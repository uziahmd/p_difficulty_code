Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So, the standard knapsack approach won't work here because the time complexity would be O(nm), which for 1e5 * 3e5 is way too big. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think. Since the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, maybe I can group the items by their weight. Then, for each weight group, sort them in descending order of cost. That way, for each weight category, I can take as many as possible of the highest value items first.\n\nBut how to handle the combination of different weights optimally? For example, when choosing between taking a 3-weight item or two 2-weight items, which gives a better value?\n\nHmm. Let's think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, separate all items into three groups: weight 1, weight 2, weight 3. Sort each group in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, compute the prefix sums so that we can quickly calculate the total cost for taking k items from that group.\n\nOnce I have these prefix sums, the problem becomes how to distribute the capacity m across the three groups to maximize the total cost.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For example, let's say I have a certain number of weight 1 items, weight 2 items, and weight 3 items. For each possible number of weight 3 items taken, I can decide how to best use the remaining capacity for weight 1 and 2 items. But even that might be too slow if done naively.\n\nAlternatively, since the weights are small (only 1, 2, 3), perhaps we can find an optimal way to combine them.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible number of weight 3 items taken (up to the maximum possible), and then for each possible number of weight 2 items, compute the remaining capacity and take as many weight 1 items as possible. However, even this approach could be O(m) for each of the weight groups, but since m is 3e5, and for each weight group, the maximum number of items is up to 1e5, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nWait, but the maximum number of weight 3 items that can be taken is min( (m//3), len(weight3)). Similarly for weight 2 items. So for each possible count of weight 3 items, we can compute how much capacity is left, then for that remaining capacity, compute the optimal selection between weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute that optimally?\n\nLet me think about the case where after taking some weight 3 items, we have a certain capacity left. Let's say the remaining capacity is 'rem'. Then, we need to choose between taking weight 1 and 2 items. How to maximize the value here?\n\nFor this, perhaps we can precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and weight 2. Then, for a given rem, we can try all possible numbers of weight 2 items that can be taken, and then take the remaining capacity as weight 1 items. But that would be O(rem) per check, which might not be efficient.\n\nWait, but for the case of combining weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps there's a way to find the optimal combination quickly. For example, for a given rem, the optimal is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, but also consider taking one less weight 2 item and adding two weight 1 items, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for any given rem, the optimal selection can be found by considering all possible combinations of taking x weight 2 items and y weight 1 items such that 2x + y ≤ rem. The maximum value is the sum of the first x weight 2 items and the first y weight 1 items.\n\nBut trying all possible x for each rem is O(rem) again. Which is not feasible if rem is up to 3e5.\n\nWait, but for each possible rem, the optimal x is up to min( (rem//2), len(weight2) ). But perhaps there's a way to precompute for each possible capacity up to m, the maximum value for the weight 1 and 2 items combined.\n\nWait, but if I have the prefix sums for weight 1 and weight 2, then for any given capacity, I can compute the best possible combination of 1s and 2s.\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have a capacity 'c' and I need to select some number of weight 2 items and weight 1 items. Let's denote the prefix sums for weight 1 as s1, where s1[k] is the sum of the first k items. Similarly for weight 2, s2[k].\n\nSo, for the capacity c, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible x (number of 2s taken), where x ranges from 0 to min( (c//2), len(s2)-1 ), and then y = c - 2x, which is the number of 1s taken (but can't exceed len(s1)-1). So the value is s2[x] + s1[ min(y, len(s1)) ].\n\nBut calculating this for each x is O(c) time. Which is not feasible for large c.\n\nBut here's an idea: for a given capacity c, the optimal x is either floor(c/2) or floor(c/2) -1, etc. Because when you take as many 2s as possible, and then fill with 1s, or take one less 2 and add two 1s, which may be better if the next 2 is worse than two 1s.\n\nBut how to find the optimal x quickly?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible capacity, we can precompute the maximum value for combining 1s and 2s. However, with m up to 3e5, this would be O(m) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Let's create a dp array for the 1s and 2s. But since the weight is up to 3e5, and the items are sorted, perhaps we can compute this in O(m) time.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. For example, for the 1s and 2s, the best way to fill a capacity is to take as many of the highest value items as possible, but since they have different weights, it's tricky.\n\nWait, here's another approach: For each possible capacity c, the optimal way to combine 1s and 2s is to take as many 2s as possible (since each 2 gives more value per unit weight than 1s if the 2s are higher value?), but no, that's not necessarily true. For example, if a 2 has a cost of 3, and two 1s have cost 4, then taking two 1s is better than one 2.\n\nBut since the 1s and 2s are sorted in descending order, perhaps the best way is to take the first x 2s and then as many 1s as possible.\n\nSo for each possible capacity, the maximum can be found by trying all possible x where x is the number of 2s taken, up to min( (c//2), len2 ), and then taking the maximum of s2[x] + s1[ min( c - 2x, len1 ) ].\n\nBut this seems O(c) for each capacity. However, if we can process this for all capacities once, then maybe it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible capacity, we can iterate through the possible number of 2s and 1s. But again, that's O(m) time.\n\nWait, but for the problem at hand, perhaps the following steps can be followed:\n\n1. Preprocess the three groups: weight 1, 2, 3. Sort each group in descending order of cost. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\nThen, for the 3s, the maximum number of items that can be taken is up to min( m // 3, len3 ). For each possible number of 3s taken (say, k3), the remaining capacity is rem = m - 3*k3. Then, for that rem, compute the maximum value from 1s and 2s.\n\nThe key is how to compute that maximum value for 1s and 2s quickly.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For all possible k3 (from 0 to max_k3), compute the remaining capacity rem = m - 3*k3.\n\n- For that rem, compute the maximum value from 1s and 2s, which we'll call val_12.\n\n- The total value is s3[k3] + val_12.\n\nWe take the maximum over all k3.\n\nBut how to compute val_12 for a given rem?\n\nFor that, perhaps for each possible rem, we can compute the optimal combination of 1s and 2s as follows:\n\nLet's say we have a capacity rem. We can take x 2s and y 1s, where 2x + y <= rem. To maximize the value, we can take as many 2s as possible, but also consider taking one less 2 and adding two 1s if that gives a better value. However, since the 2s and 1s are sorted, perhaps the optimal x is either floor(rem / 2) or floor(rem / 2) - 1, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given rem, we can take up to x_max = min( len2, rem // 2 ) 2s. Then, for x in [max(0, x_max - 1), x_max], we can check the value. Because for example, if x_max is the maximum number of 2s, then taking x_max 2s and then filling with 1s, or x_max -1 2s and then filling with 2*(x_max - (x_max -1 )) = 2 more 1s. But maybe there's a better combination here.\n\nWait, but if the 2s are sorted in descending order, then taking as many as possible of the 2s is optimal, except when the next 2 is worse than two 1s. So, for example, if the next 2 (i.e., the x_max-th 2) has a value less than the sum of two 1s (the first two 1s), then it's better to take x_max-1 2s and then take as many 1s as possible.\n\nBut how to find this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For a given rem, the maximum number of 2s is x_max = min( len2, rem // 2 ). Then, the possible candidates are x_max and x_max -1. Because, for example, if the x_max-th 2 is not worth taking compared to two 1s, then taking x_max-1 2s and then taking as many 1s as possible (which would be rem - 2*(x_max-1) ) may give a better value. Also, maybe x_max -2, but that's unlikely.\n\nSo, for each rem, we can check x_max, x_max -1, and possibly x_max - 2, but perhaps checking x_max and x_max -1 is sufficient.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of an example:\n\nSuppose rem = 5.\n\nx_max = 2 (since 2*2=4 <=5). Then, 2*2=4, leaving 1 for 1s.\n\nBut if the third 2 (if exists) is better than two 1s, then perhaps taking 2 2s is better. But if the third 2 is not better than two 1s, then taking 2 2s is worse than taking 1 2 and 3 1s (but 1*2 + 3*1= 5, which is allowed).\n\nSo for this rem, the possible x values are 2 and 1. For each x, compute the value.\n\nThus, for any rem, we can compute x_max = min(len2, rem//2). Then, check x = x_max, x_max -1, ..., down to 0? No, but for the worst case, checking x_max and x_max -1 may be sufficient.\n\nWait, but what if the best x is x_max - 2? For example, suppose that the x_max-th 2 has a very low value, but the x_max -1-th 2 is also low, but the x_max -2-th 2 is high. But how would that happen?\n\nWell, since the 2s are sorted in descending order, the x_max-th 2 is the last one that can be taken. If the x_max-th 2 is worse than two 1s, then taking x_max -1 2s and then filling with 1s would be better. But if the x_max -1-th 2 is also worse than two 1s, then taking x_max -2 2s and filling with 1s would be better. However, since the 2s are sorted, the x_max-th 2 is the worst among the 2s taken. So, for example, if x_max is 3, then the 3rd 2 is the worst of the 3 taken. So, if the 3rd 2 is worse than two 1s, then taking x_max -1 (2) 2s and then using the remaining capacity for 1s would be better. But if the 2nd 2 is also worse than two 1s, then taking x_max -2 (1) 2s and then using the remaining capacity for 1s would be better. However, this suggests that for a given rem, we need to check all possible x's up to x_max, which is O(x_max) time. Which for large rem could be O(m) time again.\n\nBut given that the rem can be up to m (3e5), and for each k3 (up to m//3, which is 1e5), this would be O(m^2), which is not feasible.\n\nSo, this approach may not be efficient enough. Therefore, we need a better way to compute the maximum value for the 1s and 2s given a capacity rem.\n\nAlternative idea: precompute for the 1s and 2s the maximum value for any capacity up to m. Let's call this dp12[cap], which represents the maximum value achievable with capacity cap using 1s and 2s.\n\nHow to compute dp12?\n\nThis is similar to the unbounded knapsack problem, but with the twist that each item can be used only once (since each item is unique). Wait, no. Each item is unique and can be taken once. So it's the 0-1 knapsack problem for items of weight 1 and 2. However, with n up to 1e5, and m up to 3e5, the standard 0-1 knapsack approach would be O(nm), which is not feasible.\n\nBut since the items are grouped by weight, perhaps there's a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nFor example, for the weight 1 items, since they are sorted, the maximum value for a capacity of x is the sum of the first min(x, len1) items. Similarly for weight 2 items, the maximum for capacity x is the sum of the first min(x//2, len2) items.\n\nBut combining them is the challenge.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For the 1s and 2s, the maximum value for capacity c can be computed as follows:\n\nFor each possible number of 2s taken (x), up to min(c//2, len2), the remaining capacity is c - 2x. The maximum number of 1s that can be taken is min(c - 2x, len1). The total value is sum_2[x] + sum_1[ min(c - 2x, len1) ].\n\nTo find the maximum over all x in 0 to x_max.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all possible c?\n\nBut for each possible c, we can compute x_max = min(c//2, len2). Then, for x_max and x_max-1, etc. But again, how?\n\nAlternatively, for the 1s and 2s, we can precompute for each possible capacity c, the maximum value as follows:\n\nLet's imagine that we have two arrays: sum1 (prefix sum of 1s) and sum2 (prefix sum of 2s). For each capacity c, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible x (number of 2s) where x is between 0 and min(c//2, len2), and then the value is sum2[x] + sum1[ min(c - 2x, len1) ].\n\nBut how to compute this for all c from 0 to m?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved in O(m) time for the 1s and 2s.\n\nLet me think. For each capacity c, the optimal x is the one that maximizes sum2[x] + sum1[ min(c - 2x, len1) ].\n\nBut how to find this for all c?\n\nPerhaps we can iterate over all possible x (number of 2s taken) and for each x, update the capacities that can be filled with x 2s and some 1s.\n\nFor example, for each x (from 0 to len2):\n\n- The weight taken by x 2s is 2x.\n\n- For any capacity c >= 2x, we can take x 2s and then take up to (c - 2x) 1s.\n\nSo, for each x, the contribution to the dp12 array for capacity c is sum2[x] + sum1[ min(c - 2x, len1) ].\n\nBut how to find the maximum over all x for each c?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be handled with a sliding window approach. However, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible c, we can compute the best x by checking all possible x that could contribute to it. But again, this seems like O(m * len2), which could be O(3e5 * 1e5) = 3e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nHmm. So what else can I do?\n\nLet me think again. Since the weight of the 2s is 2, and the 1s is 1, perhaps for each capacity c, the optimal choice between 2s and 1s is to take as many 2s as possible, and then fill the rest with 1s. But this is not always the case. However, given that the 2s and 1s are sorted in descending order, perhaps this approach is correct.\n\nWait, for example, if the 2s are sorted in descending order, and the 1s are also sorted in descending order. Then, taking as many 2s as possible is better than taking fewer 2s and more 1s, unless the next 2 is worse than two 1s.\n\nSo, for example, if the next 2 (the x_max-th 2) has a value less than the sum of the first two 1s, then it's better to take x_max-1 2s and take those two 1s instead.\n\nBut how to find this x_max?\n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\nFor capacity c, the maximum number of 2s is x_max = min( len2, c // 2 )\n\nThen, the possible candidates for x are x_max and x_max -1, because if taking x_max 2s is not better than taking x_max -1 2s plus two 1s, then the optimal is x_max -1.\n\nBut since the 2s are sorted, the x_max-th 2 has the lowest value among the 2s taken. So, comparing sum2[x_max] + sum1[ c - 2*x_max ] with sum2[x_max -1] + sum1[ c - 2*(x_max -1) ] (which is sum2[x_max -1] + sum1[ c - 2x_max + 2 ]) ?\n\nBut c - 2x_max + 2 is (c - 2x_max) + 2. Since c - 2x_max is the remaining capacity after taking x_max 2s. But if we take x_max -1 2s, then the remaining capacity is c - 2*(x_max -1) = c - 2x_max + 2. So, in that case, we can take min( c - 2x_max + 2, len1 ) 1s.\n\nBut since the 1s are sorted, the first few are the highest value.\n\nSo, for a given c, the optimal x is either x_max or x_max -1.\n\nTherefore, for any capacity c, we can compute the maximum between:\n\nOption 1: take x_max 2s and as many 1s as possible.\n\nOption 2: take x_max -1 2s and as many 1s as possible.\n\nBut wait, what if x_max is zero? Then we can't take x_max -1. So we need to handle that.\n\nBut this approach reduces the computation for any c to checking two possibilities. Thus, for each capacity c, it takes O(1) time.\n\nSo, how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nFor the given capacity c, compute x_max = min( len2, c // 2 )\n\nThen, for x in {x_max, x_max - 1} (but ensuring x >=0), compute the corresponding value.\n\nTake the maximum of these possibilities.\n\nBut why would this work?\n\nBecause the optimal x is either x_max or x_max -1. Because if taking x_max 2s is worse than taking x_max -1 2s plus two 1s, then the optimal would be x_max -1. But if x_max -1 is also worse than x_max -2, then perhaps we need to check x_max -2, but since the 2s are sorted, the x_max-th 2 is the worst in the x_max 2s. So, if taking x_max 2s is worse than x_max -1 2s plus two 1s, then taking x_max -1 2s is better. And if x_max -1 2s is worse than x_max -2 2s plus four 1s, then taking x_max -2 would be better. But this seems to suggest that we need to check multiple possibilities.\n\nBut how can we know how many possibilities to check?\n\nHowever, considering that the 2s are sorted in descending order, the value of the x-th 2 is less than or equal to the value of the (x-1)-th 2. So, if the x_max-th 2 is worse than two 1s, then taking x_max -1 2s and adding two 1s is better. But if the x_max-1-th 2 is also worse than two 1s, then taking x_max-2 2s and adding four 1s is better. However, this would imply that the optimal x is the maximum possible such that the x-th 2 is better than two 1s.\n\nBut since the 2s are sorted, this would be a contiguous range. However, without knowing the 1s' prefix sums, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut perhaps, for practical purposes, checking x_max and x_max -1 is sufficient. Because even if x_max is worse than x_max -1 + two 1s, then x_max -1 is better. And for x_max -1, we can check whether it's better than x_max -2 + ... etc. But how to know?\n\nAlternatively, think of it this way: the maximum value for the 1s and 2s can be achieved by either:\n\n- Taking as many 2s as possible and filling the rest with 1s.\n\nOR\n\n- Taking one less 2 and filling with 1s.\n\nBecause if you take more than one less, it would be equivalent to taking the same number of 2s and some 1s, which would have been considered in the first case.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nLet's test it with an example.\n\nExample 1:\n\nsum2 is [0, 5, 4, 3] (for x=0,1,2,3 2s). sum1 is [0, 10, 9, 8, 7, ... ] (for y=0,1,2,3... 1s).\n\nCapacity c = 5.\n\nx_max = 5//2 = 2 (assuming len2 is >=2). So x=2.\n\nTaking 2 2s (cost 5+4=9) and 1 1 (cost 10) → total 19.\n\nAlternatively, x=1 (taking 1 2, cost 5) and then 5 - 2*1 = 3 1s (cost 10+9+8=27) → total 5+27=32. Which is better. So the initial approach of checking x_max and x_max-1 would find this.\n\nIn this case, checking x=2 and x=1 would find the optimal.\n\nAnother example: capacity c=4.\n\nx_max = 2.\n\nsum2[2] = 9, sum1[0] = 0 → total 9.\n\nx=1: sum2[1] =5, sum1[4-2=2 → sum1[2] =19 → total 24. So better.\n\nBut what if x_max-1 is 1, and x_max-2 is 0?\n\nSo, for capacity c=4, the optimal x is 1, which is x_max-1.\n\nBut if I check x_max and x_max-1, I will find the maximum.\n\nAnother example: capacity c=3.\n\nx_max = 1 (3//2=1).\n\nsum2[1] =5, sum1[3-2*1=1 → sum1[1] =10 → total 15.\n\nx=0: sum2[0] =0, sum1[3] =10+9+8=27 → total 27. Which is better. So checking x_max and x_max-1 (x=1 and x=0) would find this.\n\nSo in this case, the optimal is x=0.\n\nThus, checking x_max and x_max-1 seems sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the approach is: for any capacity c, compute x_max = min( len2, c//2 ), then check x_max and x_max-1 (if x_max-1 >=0), and take the maximum of those two options.\n\nSo, this reduces the problem of finding the optimal combination of 1s and 2s for a given capacity c to O(1) time per capacity.\n\nNow, putting this together:\n\nThe overall steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups based on their weight (1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n   For example, for weight 1, sum1[i] = sum of the first i items.\n\n   Similarly for sum2 and sum3.\n\n4. For each possible number of 3s taken (k3), from 0 to min( len3, m//3 ), compute the remaining capacity rem = m - 3*k3.\n\n   Then, compute the maximum value from the 1s and 2s for this rem.\n\n   The total value is sum3[k3] + max_12(rem).\n\n   Keep track of the maximum total value.\n\nThe question now is how to compute max_12(rem) efficiently.\n\nImplementing the above logic for max_12(rem):\n\ndef get_max_12(rem):\n\n    len1 = len(sum1)\n\n    len2 = len(sum2)\n\n    x_max = min( len2, rem // 2 )\n\n    candidates = []\n\n    for x in [x_max, x_max -1]:\n\n        if x < 0:\n\n            continue\n\n        # number of 1s is rem - 2*x\n\n        y = rem - 2*x\n\n        y = min( y, len1 )\n\n        val = sum2[x] + sum1[y]\n\n        candidates.append( val )\n\n    return max(candidates)\n\nBut what if rem is less than 0? Well, since rem is m - 3*k3, and k3 is chosen such that 3*k3 <= m, rem is non-negative.\n\nSo, this function should work.\n\nNow, the next thing is to generate all possible k3 values.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible k3? It's the minimum between len3 and (m // 3).\n\nSo, for example, if there are 1000 items of weight 3, and m is 3e5, then the maximum k3 is 3e5//3 = 1e5. But if len3 is smaller, then it's len3.\n\nSo, the loop for k3 can run from 0 to k3_max, where k3_max is min( len3, m//3 )\n\nBut len3 can be up to 1e5. So, the loop runs up to 1e5 times. For each iteration, the get_max_12 function is O(1), so the total time for this part is O(1e5) steps.\n\nThus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n) for sorting the groups, and O(k3_max) for the loop.\n\nWhich is acceptable for the given constraints.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n2 1\n\nSo, the weight is 2, which is more than m=1. So the maximum is 0.\n\nSample Output is 0.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, group 1: [3], group 2: [2], group3: empty.\n\nFor k3=0, rem=2.\n\nCompute max_12(2):\n\nx_max = min(1, 2//2=1) → 1.\n\nCheck x=1 and x=0.\n\nFor x=1: 2*1=2 → rem - 2x = 0 → sum2[1] = 2, sum1[0] =0 → total 2.\n\nFor x=0: rem=2 → sum2[0]=0, sum1[2] (but len1 is 1, so min(2,1)=1 → sum1[1] =3 → total 3.\n\nSo max is 3. So total is sum3[0] (0) + 3 = 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n4 3\n\n3 10\n\n2 7\n\n2 8\n\n1 1\n\nGroup 1: [1]\n\ngroup2: [8,7]\n\ngroup3: [10]\n\nSo sum1 is [0, 1]\n\nsum2 is [0, 8, 15]\n\nsum3 is [0, 10]\n\nFor k3 can be 0 or 1.\n\nCase k3=1: rem = 3 -3*1 =0 → max_12(0) is 0. Total 10 +0 =10.\n\nCase k3=0: rem=3.\n\nCompute max_12(3):\n\nx_max = min(2, 3//2=1) → 1.\n\nCheck x=1 and x=0.\n\nFor x=1: 2*1=2 → rem - 2*1 =1. sum2[1] =8, sum1[1] =1 → total 9.\n\nFor x=0: rem=3 → sum2[0] =0, sum1[3] = min(3, 1) =1 → sum 0+1=1. So maximum is 9. So total is 0 +9=9.\n\nThus, the maximum between 10 and 9 is 10. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen read n lines of wi and ci.\n\nGroup them into three lists: w1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each list in descending order.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each.\n\nsum1 is a list where sum1[0] =0, sum1[1] =w1[0], sum1[2] =w1[0]+w1[1], etc.\n\nSimilarly for sum2 and sum3.\n\nOnce that's done, iterate over possible k3 (number of 3s taken). For each k3, compute rem = m -3*k3. If rem is negative, skip (but since k3 is up to m//3, rem is non-negative).\n\nThen compute max_12(rem) as described.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut how to handle cases where the len of the groups is less than the possible k3? For example, if k3 is 5 but there are only 3 items in group3. So for k3, the maximum is min( len3, m//3 ). So during the loop, k3 can range from 0 to k3_max, where k3_max is min( len3, m//3 )\n\nBut when taking k3 items from group3, we can only take up to len3 items. So for each k3 in 0..k3_max, sum3[k3] is valid.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut for large n (up to 1e5), the code needs to be efficient. Sorting the lists is O(n log n) which is acceptable.\n\nImplementing the prefix sums:\n\nFor example, for group1:\n\nsum1 = [0]\n\nfor item in group1:\n\n    sum1.append( sum1[-1] + item )\n\nSimilarly for group2 and group3.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\ngroup1 = []\ngroup2 = []\ngroup3 = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    wi, ci = map(int, input().split())\n    if wi == 1:\n        group1.append(ci)\n    elif wi == 2:\n        group2.append(ci)\n    else:\n        group3.append(ci)\n\nSort each group in descending order.\n\ngroup1.sort(reverse=True)\ngroup2.sort(reverse=True)\ngroup3.sort(reverse=True)\n\nCompute prefix sums:\n\nsum1 = [0]\nfor c in group1:\n    sum1.append( sum1[-1] + c )\n\nsum2 = [0]\nfor c in group2:\n    sum2.append( sum2[-1] + c )\n\nsum3 = [0]\nfor c in group3:\n    sum3.append( sum3[-1] + c )\n\nThen, compute k3_max = min( len(group3), m // 3 )\n\nmax_total = 0\n\nfor k3 in range(0, k3_max + 1):\n\n    rem = m - 3*k3\n\n    # compute max_12(rem)\n\n    len1 = len(sum1) -1  # since sum1 starts from 0 and has len(group1)+1 elements\n    len2 = len(sum2) -1\n\n    x_max = min( len2, rem // 2 )\n\n    candidates = []\n\n    for x in [x_max, x_max -1]:\n        if x <0:\n            continue\n        y = rem - 2*x\n        y = min( y, len1 )\n        val = sum2[x] + sum1[y]\n        candidates.append( val )\n\n    current_val = sum3[k3] + max(candidates) if candidates else sum3[k3]\n\n    if current_val > max_total:\n        max_total = current_val\n\nreturn max_total\n\nWait, but what if rem is 0? Then x_max is 0. So the candidates would be x=0 and x=-1 (which is skipped). So candidates has only x=0. So it's okay.\n\nBut in code, when rem is zero, x_max is 0, and x_max -1 is -1. So the for loop checks x in [0, -1]. So the code adds x=0 and skips x=-1. So candidates has one value.\n\nBut what if len2 is zero (no 2s)? Then x_max is min(0, ...) → 0. So x=0 is checked. Then y = rem - 0 = rem. Which is okay.\n\nAnother edge case: when rem is zero. Then, the max_12 is zero.\n\nBut what if rem is negative? No, since k3 is up to m//3, rem is >=0.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, for the for loop over k3, the range is from 0 to k3_max inclusive. So:\n\nk3_max = min( len(group3), m // 3 )\n\nfor k3 in range(0, k3_max + 1):\n\nBut what if len(group3) is zero? Then, k3_max is zero, and the loop runs once (k3=0).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the case when there are no 2s or 1s? For example, rem is 5, but no 2s. Then x_max is min(0, ...) → 0. So x=0, and y=5. But len1 may be 0 (no 1s). Then sum1[y] is sum1[0] = 0.\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n1 1\n\n2 1\n\ngroup1 is empty",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market, given constraints on the total weight he can carry.
