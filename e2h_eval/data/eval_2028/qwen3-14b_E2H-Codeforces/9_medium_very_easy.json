Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about selecting souvenirs with maximum total cost without exceeding the weight limit. The constraints are that n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Also, each souvenir's weight is between 1 and 3. Hmm, so the weights are small. That must be a clue for an efficient solution.\n\nSo the usual knapsack problem is O(nm), but with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, that would be 3e10 operations, which is way too slow. So we need a better approach here.\n\nSince the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, maybe we can handle each weight category separately. Let me think. For each weight group (w=1, w=2, w=3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, we can precompute the prefix sums. Then, for each possible number of items taken from each group, we can calculate the total weight and cost.\n\nBut how do we combine these groups optimally?\n\nLet me think. Let's say we have all items sorted by their cost per weight. But since the weights are different, maybe we need to take as many as possible of the highest value per unit weight first. However, since the weight is 1, 2, or 3, perhaps the optimal strategy is to take as many as possible of the highest value per unit weight items, but considering that taking a higher weight item might not be better than multiple lower ones.\n\nWait, but for example, if there's a weight 1 item with cost 10, and a weight 2 item with cost 19. Then per unit weight, the second is 9.5, which is less than the first. So it's better to take the weight 1 item. So maybe we should process items in order of their value per unit weight, but since the weight is fixed (only 1, 2, 3), maybe we can sort each group by their cost, then for each group, take the top k items.\n\nBut how to combine them?\n\nAnother approach: Since the weights are small, we can model this as a dynamic programming problem where we track the maximum cost for each possible weight up to m. However, even with m up to 3e5, a standard DP approach would be O(m) time. Wait, but with n up to 1e5, how?\n\nAlternatively, since the items have weight 1, 2, or 3, we can handle each group separately. For example, for weight 1 items, we can take as many as possible, but when combining with others, perhaps we can find the optimal combination.\n\nLet me think again. Let's separate the items into three groups: W1 (weight 1), W2 (weight 2), W3 (weight 3). For each group, sort them in descending order of cost. Then compute prefix sums for each group. Then, for each possible number of items taken from W1 and W2, we can compute the remaining weight and take as many as possible from W3. But with n up to 1e5, even that approach may be too slow.\n\nAlternatively, for each group, we can precompute the best possible selection for any number of items. For example, for W1, the best is to take the top k items. Similarly for W2 and W3.\n\nSo here's an idea: iterate over the number of items taken from W3, then for the remaining weight, take the best possible from W1 and W2. But even that may not be efficient.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is small, we can use a greedy approach. Let me think: the optimal strategy is to take the items with the highest value per unit weight. However, since the weight is 1, 2, or 3, we can compare the values. For example, if we have a weight 1 item with cost c1, and a weight 2 item with cost c2, then the value per unit weight is c1/1 vs c2/2. So if c1 is higher than c2/2, then the weight 1 item is better. But this may not hold when considering combinations. However, given that the weights are small, perhaps a greedy approach could work here. But I'm not sure. For example, imagine that you have two items: one with weight 3 and cost 5, and another with weight 1 and cost 3. Then the per unit weight of the first is 5/3 ≈1.67, the second is 3. So the second is better. But if you have a capacity of 3, taking the first gives you 5, while taking three of the second would give 9 (if available). But if there's only one of the second, then taking the first is better. So the greedy approach of choosing highest value per unit weight is not always correct. Therefore, the greedy approach may not work here.\n\nHmm. So back to the original idea. Since the weights are small, we can process each group and use some optimized way to compute the maximum.\n\nLet me think again. Let's consider that for each weight group, we can take as many as possible. For example, for W1, sorted by cost descending, the prefix sum for taking k items is sum1[k]. Similarly for W2, sum2[k], and W3 sum3[k].\n\nNow, for a given total weight m, we can try all possible combinations of taking x items from W3, y items from W2, and z items from W1, such that 3x + 2y + z ≤ m. But trying all possible x, y, z is impossible.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible number of items taken from W3 (up to min(m//3, len(W3))), then for the remaining weight, find the best combination of W1 and W2.\n\nSimilarly, for each possible number of items taken from W2, and then W1 and W3.\n\nBut how to efficiently compute the best combination of W1 and W2 for a given remaining weight.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a remaining weight of 'rem' after taking x items from W3. Then we need to choose y items from W2 and z items from W1 such that 2y + z ≤ rem, and the sum of their costs is maximized.\n\nHow can we compute that quickly?\n\nLet me think: For each possible y (number of W2 items taken), the maximum z is rem - 2y. So the maximum number of W1 items is (rem - 2y). But since we have prefix sums for W1 and W2, for each possible y, we can compute the sum of the first y items from W2 plus the sum of the first (rem - 2y) items from W1. However, rem can be up to m, which is 3e5, and y can be up to rem//2, which is up to 1.5e5. For each x in W3, this would take O(rem) time, which is O(3e5) per x. If x can be up to 1e5, then this becomes O(3e5 * 1e5) = 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo that's not feasible. So we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: For the combination of W1 and W2, precompute for each possible weight up to m, the maximum possible cost. How?\n\nWe can model this as a knapsack problem for items of weight 1 and 2. But since the items are sorted and we have prefix sums, perhaps we can compute for each possible weight, the maximum value.\n\nLet me think: For the W1 and W2 items, we can compute for each possible weight up to m, the maximum cost. But how?\n\nLet me think about the following approach. Let's assume that we have all the W1 items sorted in descending order of cost, and same for W2. For each possible number of W2 items taken (say, y), the maximum number of W1 items we can take is (rem - 2y). So for a given rem, the maximum is the maximum over all possible y (from 0 to min(rem//2, len(W2))) of (sum2[y] + sum1[rem - 2y]).\n\nBut how can we compute this maximum quickly?\n\nIf we can precompute for all possible possible weights, the maximum value for W1 and W2, then for any rem, we can just look it up.\n\nBut how to compute that? Let's think of it as a dynamic programming problem where we can take items of weight 1 and 2. However, since the items are sorted, maybe we can find an optimal way.\n\nAlternatively, for the W1 and W2 items, we can precompute for each possible weight up to m, the maximum value. Let's denote this as dp[w], which represents the maximum value achievable with weight w using items from W1 and W2.\n\nBut how to compute dp[w]?\n\nWe can think of it as follows:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 0.\n\nFor each weight w from 1 to m:\n\ndp[w] = max( dp[w - 1] + (cost of next W1 item if available), dp[w - 2] + (cost of next W2 item if available) )\n\nWait, but that's not straightforward because we have multiple items. However, since the items are sorted, we can take as many as possible of the highest value items first.\n\nWait, but for the W1 and W2 groups, since they are sorted in descending order, the best way to take items is to take as many as possible of the highest value items. So for example, for W1, the best is to take the first k items (sorted in descending order), and similarly for W2.\n\nTherefore, for any given weight, the optimal choice is to take some number of W1 items and W2 items. Let's think of it as for each possible number of W2 items taken, and then take as many W1 items as possible.\n\nBut how to find the maximum for all possible numbers of W2 items and W1 items.\n\nLet me think. For a given weight limit rem, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible y (number of W2 items taken) such that 2y ≤ rem, and then take (rem - 2y) W1 items. But since the W1 and W2 items are sorted, the sum for y W2 items is sum2[y], and the sum for (rem - 2y) W1 items is sum1[rem - 2y], but only if rem - 2y >= 0 and the number of W1 items taken is not more than the total available.\n\nBut to find the maximum over all possible y for this, we can precompute the sum1 and sum2 arrays, then for each possible rem, find the best y.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly for all possible rem?\n\nAlternatively, for the combination of W1 and W2, we can precompute for each possible possible weight up to m, the best value. How?\n\nLet's consider that for the W1 and W2 items, we can take any number of items, but the sum of their weights can't exceed the current weight.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAnother approach: For the W1 items, we can take up to k items, where k is the total number of W1 items. Similarly for W2. Let's say we have sum1[i] = sum of the first i W1 items, sum2[j] = sum of first j W2 items.\n\nThen, for any weight w, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible i and j where i + 2j <= w.\n\nBut how to find this maximum quickly?\n\nThis seems like a two-dimensional problem. However, perhaps for a given w, we can iterate j from 0 to min(w//2, len(W2)), and compute i = min(w - 2j, len(W1)), and take sum1[i] + sum2[j]. Then find the maximum over all j.\n\nBut even this approach for each w would take O(w) time, which for m up to 3e5 would be O(3e5^2) operations, which is 9e10 — way too slow.\n\nSo this approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the weight of W2 items is 2, and W1 is 1, perhaps for a given weight limit, we can take as many W2 items as possible, and then fill the rest with W1 items. But this may not be optimal. However, perhaps there's a way to find the optimal number of W2 items to take.\n\nLet me think. For example, for a given weight limit w, the maximum number of W2 items is floor(w / 2). Let's say we take j W2 items. Then the remaining weight is w - 2j, and we can take that many W1 items. However, since W1 and W2 items are sorted, the best j is somewhere around the point where the value of the next W2 item is higher than the value of the next W1 items.\n\nBut how to find this j quickly.\n\nAlternatively, for a given w, we can try all possible j in a small range around the optimal value. For example, since the W2 items are sorted, and W1 items are sorted, the optimal j is either the maximum possible, or the maximum possible minus some small number, etc.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for the W1 and W2 case, we can precompute for each possible j (number of W2 items taken), the maximum possible number of W1 items is (w - 2j). So for each j, the total cost is sum2[j] + sum1[min(w - 2j, len(W1))].\n\nBut how to find the maximum of this function over all possible j.\n\nLet me think of this as a function f(j) = sum2[j] + sum1[ min(w - 2j, len(W1)) ].\n\nThe function f(j) is not necessarily monotonic. However, since the sum1 and sum2 are increasing functions, but the term (w-2j) decreases as j increases. So the function may have a single peak.\n\nBut how to find the maximum j quickly.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible j, we can compute the corresponding value, but since j can be up to len(W2), which could be up to 1e5, and for each w, this would take O(len(W2)) time, which is again O(3e5 * 1e5) = 3e10 operations.\n\nNot feasible.\n\nHmm. So what's the alternative?\n\nLet me think again. Since the weight of the items is only 1, 2, 3, maybe we can model this as a knapsack problem with three different item types, but with optimized steps.\n\nLet me think about the standard unbounded knapsack problem. But here it's 0-1 knapsack, since each item can be taken once.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, the standard DP approach is O(nm) which is 3e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nBut since the weights are small (1, 2, 3), perhaps we can optimize the DP.\n\nLet me think about the DP approach. Let's define dp[w] as the maximum cost achievable with weight w.\n\nInitially, dp[0] = 0, and other dp[w] = -infinity or something.\n\nThen for each item, we can update the dp array. However, with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, this is O(nm) which is way too slow.\n\nBut since the items are grouped by their weight, maybe we can process each group separately.\n\nFor example, for all items of weight 1, we can process them in a way that for each possible weight, we take the best possible number of items.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor items with weight 1, since they are sorted in descending order of cost, the best way to take them is to take as many as possible. So for the weight 1 items, we can precompute the prefix sums. Then, for the DP, for each weight w, the maximum value would be the maximum between the previous value and the sum of the first k items, where k is the minimum between the number of items and w.\n\nBut again, integrating this into the DP is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since all items of weight 1 are processed first, then for each weight w, the maximum value for weight w would be max(dp[w - 1] + cost of next item, ...). But again, with the items sorted, perhaps we can find that the optimal is to take as many as possible of the highest cost items.\n\nWait, perhaps for each group (weight 1, 2, 3), we can process them in a way that allows us to compute the maximum for each weight efficiently.\n\nFor example, for the weight 1 items, since they are sorted, the maximum for weight w is the maximum between the previous value (without taking this item) or taking this item plus the value for weight w-1. However, since we can take multiple items, but each only once, perhaps we can process the items in a way that for each weight, we take the best possible.\n\nBut this seems like the standard 0-1 knapsack problem, which is O(nm) time.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a way to optimize for each group. For example, for the weight 1 items, since they are sorted, the optimal is to take as many as possible of the highest cost items. So for each weight w, the maximum cost for weight w is the sum of the first min(w, len(W1)) items. But this is only true if we can take those items. However, this is not the case when combining with other items. For example, taking some weight 2 items and some weight 1 items may be better than taking only weight 1 items.\n\nBut this suggests that for each group, we can precompute the best possible selection and then combine them.\n\nBut again, how?\n\nLet me think of another angle. Since the weights are small (1, 2, 3), perhaps we can model the problem as follows:\n\nFor each possible weight w from 0 to m, compute the maximum cost. The recurrence would be:\n\ndp[w] = max(dp[w], dp[w - w_i] + c_i) for all items i with weight w_i.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, this would be O(nm) which is not feasible.\n\nBut since the items are grouped by weight, maybe we can process each group in a way that reduces the computation.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items: process them all at once. For each possible weight, the maximum value is the sum of the first k items, where k is the minimum between the number of items and w. However, this is only if we take exactly k items of weight 1. So for the dp array, for each weight w, we can compute the maximum between the existing value and the sum of the first k items of weight 1, where k is up to w.\n\nBut how to integrate this into the dp.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 items, since they are sorted, for each possible weight w, the best value is the sum of the first min(w, len(W1)) items. So for all w >= len(W1), the value is the sum of all items. For w < len(W1), it's the sum of the first w items. But this is only considering taking only weight 1 items, not combining with other items.\n\nSo perhaps we can process each group in order, and for each group, update the dp array accordingly.\n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 0, and others as -infinity.\n\nProcess weight 1 items first. For each weight w, the maximum value is max(dp[w], dp[w - 1] + c_i). But since we have multiple items of weight 1, this is similar to the 0-1 knapsack for weight 1 items. However, since the items are sorted in descending order, perhaps we can find that for each weight, taking the first k items gives the best value.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, if we have all weight 1 items sorted in descending order, then for each weight w, the best possible value for taking weight 1 items is the sum of the first min(w, len(W1)) items. So, for example, if we have a weight limit of 5, and 3 items of weight 1 with values 10, 9, 8, then the best is to take all 3 items (sum 27) and leave the rest of the weight unused.\n\nSo perhaps for the weight 1 items, we can compute the prefix sum array. Then, for each weight w, the value contributed by the weight 1 items is prefix_sum_1[min(w, len(W1))].\n\nBut how to combine this with other items.\n\nMaybe the solution is to use a dynamic programming approach, but with optimizations based on the weight groups.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Separate the items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3.\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\nFor example:\n\nprefix1[i] = sum of first i items in w=1 group.\n\nprefix2[i] = sum of first i items in w=2 group.\n\nprefix3[i] = sum of first i items in w=3 group.\n\nThen, for each possible number of items taken from w=3 group (say x), and for each possible number of items taken from w=2 group (say y), and then take as many as possible from w=1 group.\n\nBut again, this seems computationally heavy.\n\nBut considering that the weight of the w=3 items is 3, the maximum number of items x is up to m//3, which for m=3e5 is 1e5. Similarly for w=2 items, the maximum y is up to m//2= 1.5e5.\n\nBut even if we loop through x and y, the total combinations would be O( (m/3) * (m/2) ) = O(m² /6), which for m=3e5 is 1.5e11 operations. Not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For the three groups, we can consider all possibilities of taking some number of items from each group, but in a way that the total weight is <= m.\n\nBut again, this is not clear.\n\nWait, here's another thought. For each possible number of items taken from the w=3 group (x), we can compute the remaining weight as rem = m - 3x. Then, for the remaining rem weight, we need to select items from w=1 and w=2 groups. And for this, we can use the earlier idea of finding the best combination of w=1 and w=2 items for the remaining weight.\n\nBut how to compute this best combination quickly.\n\nIf we can precompute for all possible weights, the best combination of w=1 and w=2 items, then for each x, we can look up the best value for rem = m - 3x, and add it to the value of prefix3[x].\n\nSo the question is: how to precompute for all possible weights, the best combination of w=1 and w=2 items.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this. Let's denote this as best_1_2[w], which is the maximum cost achievable with weight w using items from w=1 and w=2 groups.\n\nTo compute best_1_2[w], we can use the following approach:\n\nFor each possible weight w, we can try all possible y (number of w=2 items taken), and compute the corresponding x (number of w=1 items taken) as w - 2y. Then, the total cost is prefix2[y] + prefix1[min(w - 2y, len1)], where len1 is the number of w=1 items.\n\nBut for each w, this would take O(y_max) time, where y_max is up to w//2.\n\nBut with m up to 3e5, and for each w up to 3e5, this would be O( (3e5)^2 ) = 9e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to compute best_1_2[w] in O(1) or O(1) per w.\n\nLet me think: For a given weight w, the optimal y is such that the sum of the first y items of w=2 and the sum of the first (w - 2y) items of w=1 is maximized.\n\nBut since both prefix1 and prefix2 are non-decreasing, perhaps there's a way to find the optimal y quickly.\n\nLet me think of it as follows: For each possible y, the value is prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min(w - 2y, len1) ].\n\nLet's assume that w is large enough that 2y <= w, and that w - 2y is >= 0.\n\nBut since prefix1 and prefix2 are increasing, the optimal y is likely around the point where the marginal gain of adding a w=2 item is higher than the marginal gain of adding two w=1 items.\n\nBut how to find this y quickly.\n\nAlternatively, for a given w, the optimal y is either floor(w/2) or floor(w/2) - 1, or something like that. Because adding more y would decrease the number of w=1 items, but the prefix2 increases.\n\nBut this depends on the specific values of the items.\n\nAlternatively, since the items are sorted in descending order, the best way to choose between taking a w=2 item or two w=1 items is to compare the value of the next w=2 item with the sum of the next two w=1 items.\n\nBut how to apply this for all possible y.\n\nBut this sounds like a greedy approach. Let's think: for the best combination, we want to take as many as possible of the items with the highest value per unit weight.\n\nBut again, this may not be optimal in all cases.\n\nBut perhaps we can approximate this by greedily taking the best possible items.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: for the combination of w=1 and w=2 items, the best way to fill a weight w is to take as many as possible of the highest value items, regardless of their weight. So for example, if the next highest item is a w=1 item, take it, else take a w=2 item if possible.\n\nBut this is essentially the greedy approach, which may not be optimal, but perhaps in this particular case (with items sorted), it works.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of an example:\n\nSuppose we have two w=1 items with values 3 and 3, and one w=2 item with value 5. The weight is 2. The best option is to take the w=2 item (5) instead of two w=1 items (6). So the greedy approach of taking the highest value items first would work here. But in this case, the w=2 item has lower value per unit weight than the w=1 items (5/2 = 2.5 vs 3/1 = 3). So the greedy approach of taking the highest value items first would take the two w=1 items, which is better. But in this case, the greedy approach would choose correctly.\n\nWait, but in this example, the total value is 6 for two w=1 items, which is better than 5 for the w=2 item. So the greedy approach would work. But if the weight is 3, then the options are:\n\nTake one w=2 item (5) and one w=1 (3) for total 8, or take three w=1 items (but there are only two), so 6. Or take one w=2 item and one w=1 item. So the best is 8. The greedy approach would take the highest value items first: the first w=1 (3), then the second w=1 (3), and then the w=2 item (5) would have weight 2, but the remaining weight is 1. So no. So the greedy approach would take the two w=1 items (total 6) and leave the w=2 item. But the optimal is 8. So the greedy approach of taking highest value items first is not working here.\n\nThis shows that the greedy approach is not sufficient.\n\nSo back to square one. How to compute best_1_2[w] efficiently.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Since the items are sorted, for any weight w, the best combination is to take some number of w=2 items, and fill the rest with w=1 items. But since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find for each possible w, the best number of w=2 items to take by iterating over a small range around the optimal value.\n\nFor example, for a given w, the optimal number of w=2 items is between max(0, (w - len1) // 2) and min(len2, w//2). But how to determine this range.\n\nAlternatively, since the prefix sums are increasing, for a given w, the function f(y) = prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min(w - 2y, len1) ] is unimodal. This means that it increases to a certain point and then decreases, allowing us to find the maximum using ternary search.\n\nIf this is true, then for each w, we can perform a ternary search on y to find the maximum.\n\nBut is the function f(y) unimodal?\n\nLet me think. As y increases, the prefix2[y] increases, but the term prefix1[...] decreases. So the overall function could have a single peak. If this is the case, then ternary search is applicable.\n\nAssuming that this is true, for each w, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, min(len2, w//2)] to find the maximum value of f(y).\n\nThis would reduce the time complexity for computing best_1_2[w] to O(log len2) per w.\n\nBut with m up to 3e5, and for each w up to 3e5, this would be O(3e5 * log 1e5) operations, which is around 3e5 * 20 = 6e6 operations — manageable.\n\nOnce we have best_1_2 computed for all w, then for each x (number of w=3 items taken), we can compute the remaining weight rem = m - 3x, and then the maximum value is prefix3[x] + best_1_2[rem], provided that rem >= 0.\n\nWe can iterate x from 0 to min(len3, m//3), and find the maximum over all x.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Split items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3.\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n4. Precompute best_1_2 array for all possible weights from 0 to m.\n\n   For each weight w in 0..m:\n\n      Find the maximum value of prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min(w - 2y, len1) ] for y in 0..min(len2, w//2).\n\n      Use ternary search to find the optimal y.\n\n5. Then, for all possible x in 0..min(len3, m//3):\n\n   rem = m - 3x\n\n   if rem >= 0:\n\n      current_value = prefix3[x] + best_1_2[rem]\n\n      keep track of the maximum.\n\n6. The maximum value found in step 5 is the answer.\n\nNow, the key steps are:\n\n- Implementing the ternary search for best_1_2[w].\n\n- Handling edge cases, such as when w - 2y is negative, but in the code, min(w - 2y, len1) ensures that we don't take more items than available.\n\nBut wait, in the case where w - 2y is negative, we should not take any w=1 items. So the min is actually max(0, w - 2y). Or is it?\n\nNo, for the given y, if 2y > w, then w - 2y is negative, but then we cannot take any w=1 items. So in this case, the number of w=1 items is zero. So the term is prefix2[y] + prefix1[0] = prefix2[y]. But since y is chosen to be up to w//2, this situation should not happen. Because during the ternary search, the y is constrained to be between 0 and min(len2, w//2). So 2y <= w. Hence, w - 2y >= 0. So the min(w - 2y, len1) is okay.\n\nSo for each w, the y ranges from 0 to y_max = min(len2, w//2).\n\nNow, for the ternary search part, how to implement it.\n\nThe function f(y) for a given w is:\n\ndef f(y):\n    return prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min(w - 2*y, len1) ]\n\nBut since the prefix1 array is of size len1+1, where prefix1[0] = 0, prefix1[1] = cost of first item, etc.\n\nNow, to perform the ternary search, we need to find the y in the range [low, high] that maximizes f(y).\n\nBut how to know if the function is unimodal. For example, it's possible that the function increases to a peak and then decreases, which makes ternary search applicable.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is always the case. However, given that the items are sorted in descending order, it's possible that the function is unimodal.\n\nLet me take an example:\n\nSuppose prefix2 is [0, 5, 8, 10], and prefix1 is [0, 3, 6, 9, 12]. For a given w=5, the possible y values are 0, 1, 2 (since 2*2=4 <=5).\n\nFor y=0: 0 + prefix1[5] = 0 + 12 (assuming len1 is >=5, but if len1 is 4, then it's 9).\n\nFor y=1: 5 + prefix1[5 - 2*1=3] = 5 + 6=11.\n\nFor y=2: 8 + prefix1[5-4=1] = 8+3=11.\n\nSo the maximum is 11, achieved at y=1 or y=2. So the function is flat here. But it's still unimodal.\n\nAnother example: suppose prefix2 is [0, 3, 5, 6], prefix1 is [0, 4, 7, 9, 10]. For w=4.\n\nPossible y ranges from 0 to 2 (since 2*2=4).\n\ny=0: 0 + prefix1[4] = 10.\n\ny=1: 3 + prefix1[4-2=2] = 3+7=10.\n\ny=2: 5 + prefix1[0] = 5.\n\nSo the maximum is 10, achieved at y=0 or y=1. Again, flat but unimodal.\n\nSo it seems that the function is unimodal, or at least has a single peak. Thus, ternary search can be applied.\n\nSo the plan is to proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this.\n\nFirst, we need to compute the prefix sums for each group.\n\nFor example, for group1 (w=1):\n\nSort the items in descending order of cost. Then, prefix1[0] = 0, prefix1[1] = cost of first item, prefix1[2] = cost of first + second, etc.\n\nSame for group2 and group3.\n\nOnce we have these, we can proceed to compute best_1_2 for all weights up to m.\n\nNow, for each weight w in 0..m:\n\nWe need to find the maximum value of prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min(w - 2y, len1) ] for y in 0 to y_max.\n\nTo compute this, we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, y_max].\n\nBut how to handle the ternary search correctly. Note that the function may have multiple peaks, but in practice, it's likely unimodal.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps we can iterate over all possible y in a small range around the optimal point. However, given that the ternary search is O(log n), it's better to proceed with that.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nImplementing the ternary search for each w:\n\ndef get_best_1_2(w, prefix1, len1, prefix2, len2):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = min(len2, w // 2)\n\n    best = 0\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n        val1 = prefix2[mid1] + prefix1[ min(w - 2*mid1, len1) ]\n\n        val2 = prefix2[mid2] + prefix1[ min(w - 2*mid2, len1) ]\n\n        if val1 < val2:\n\n            best = max(best, val2)\n\n            low = mid1 + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            best = max(best, val1)\n\n            high = mid2 - 1\n\n    # After the loop, check some points around low, high, etc.\n\n    for y in [low, high, (low+high)//2,",
