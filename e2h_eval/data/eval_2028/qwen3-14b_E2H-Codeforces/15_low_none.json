They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine all the integers x that can be the winning team given the structure of the tournament and the string s which dictates the rules for each phase.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the tournament structure. So there are 2^n teams. Each phase halves the number of teams. For example, in the first phase (phase 1), there are 2^{n-1} games, then phase 2 has 2^{n-2}, etc., until phase n which has 1 game. Each phase's outcome depends on the value of s_i. For phase i (starting from 1?), if s[i-1] is 0, then in each match of that phase, the team with lower skill level wins. If it's 1, the higher skill level wins.\n\nThe permutation p is such that each team's skill is unique and from 1 to 2^n. We need to find all x where there exists a permutation p such that the team with skill x wins the tournament.\n\nHmm. So the problem is to find all x that can be the champion under some permutation p, given the rules of the tournament as per s.\n\nBut how do we model the tournament structure and determine which x can be champions?\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since the tournament is a binary tree structure, each team must win through each round. For each round, depending on the phase (i.e., which level of the tree), the selection of the winner depends on the s's character for that phase.\n\nBut since the permutation p is arbitrary (as long as it's a permutation), we need to find for each x, whether there exists a way to arrange the other teams such that x can win all the matches according to the rules of each phase.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe for each x, we can determine the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have in order to win, considering the rules of each phase.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the tournament as a series of rounds, and for each round, determine the constraints on x's position in the bracket.\n\nWait, but the initial bracket structure is fixed. For example, in the first round, teams are paired as 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. The winners of those pairs proceed to the next round. Then in the next round, the winners are grouped again into pairs, etc.\n\nBut the problem says that the permutation p is arbitrary. So the actual positions of the teams in the bracket can be arranged in any way, as long as the permutation p is valid. Wait no, the permutation p defines the skill levels of the teams, but their initial positions in the bracket are fixed? Or is the bracket structure determined by their initial positions?\n\nWait, the problem says that the initial pairing is team 1 vs 2, team 3 vs 4, etc. But the permutation p is the skill levels of the teams. So the initial positions (like team 1, team 2, etc.) are fixed. However, the actual skill levels are assigned via p. So for example, team 1's skill is p_1, team 2's is p_2, etc. But the permutation p can be any permutation of the numbers 1 to 2^n. So the initial bracket positions are fixed, but the skill levels are assigned arbitrarily. Our goal is to find x such that there exists a permutation p where the team that has skill x (i.e., the team whose position in the bracket is such that its p_i is x) can win the tournament.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the permutation p is given, and the tournament proceeds with the teams' skill levels as per p. But in our problem, we need to find x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x wins. So the question is: for a given x, can we assign the p array (permutation) such that when the tournament is run according to the rules of s, the team with skill x ends up being the champion.\n\nSo the key is to model for each x, whether there's a way to arrange the other teams in the bracket so that x can win all the required matches in each phase.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think recursively. For x to be the champion, it must win in each round. Each round corresponds to a phase in the tournament. For example, the first phase is the first round, then the second phase is the second round, etc. The number of phases is n.\n\nLet me consider the tournament as a binary tree. Each round reduces the number of teams by half. The structure of the tournament is fixed: the initial bracket is fixed, and each subsequent round is based on the winners of previous rounds.\n\nBut the problem is that the initial positions (team 1, team 2, etc.) are fixed. However, the p array assigns the skill levels to these",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which integers can be the winning team in a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The tournament structure and rules are defined by a string `s` where each character dictates whether the higher or lower skill level team wins in each phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured as a binary tree with `2^n` teams. Each phase halves the number of teams until only one champion remains.\n2. **Skill Levels**: Each team has a unique skill level from 1 to `2^n`. The permutation `p` determines these skill levels.\n3. **Phase Rules**: Each phase (as per the string `s`) determines if the higher (`1`) or lower (`0`) skill level team wins.\n4. **Winning Integers**: For each integer `x` from 1 to `2^n`, we need to check if there exists a permutation `p` such that `x` can win the tournament under the given rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    size = 2 ** n\n    # We need to find all x in [1, size] that can be the champion under some permutation p\n    \n    # For each x, determine if it can be the champion\n    # We'll use a recursive approach to model the possible ranges of values that can reach the final round\n    # We'll process each round from the last to the first, maintaining possible ranges of values\n    \n    # Initialize the possible range for the final round (the last phase)\n    # In the last phase, there is only one game.

For each round i (from 0 to n-1), we track the possible min and max values that can reach that round.\n    # We start from the last round and work backwards.\n    \n    # The initial range for the final round is [1, size], but we need to adjust based on the rules.\n    # However, since we're going backwards, let's think of it as building up the required constraints.\n    \n    # For each round, starting from the last (i = n-1) down to 0:\n    # - If the rule is '1', then in that round, the higher value must win. So to reach the next round, the current value must be the maximum in its bracket.\n    # - If the rule is '0', then the lower value must win. So the current value must be the minimum in its bracket.\n    \n    # But how do we model this? Let's consider that for each round, the number of teams is 2^(n - i). Each match reduces the number of teams by half.\n    \n    # We can model the possible values that can reach each round by considering the required constraints from the subsequent rounds.\n    \n    # Starting from the final round (round n-1):\n    # The possible values that can be champion must satisfy the rule of the final round.\n    # Then, for each previous round, we adjust the possible values based on the rule of that round.\n    \n    # Let's represent the possible range of values that can reach the final round.

For each round, depending on the rule, the champion must be either the maximum or minimum in its group of two in that round.\n    # So, for each round, we can compute the constraints on the value of x.\n    \n    # We'll use a set to track the possible values that can be champions.\n    \n    # To model this efficiently, we can use the following approach:\n    # Start with the final round. The champion must be the winner of the last match, which depends on the rule of the last phase.\n    # Then, for each previous round, we determine the possible values that could have reached that round.\n    \n    # Let's use dynamic programming, where for each round i (from n-1 down to 0), we track the possible min and max values that can reach the next round.\n    \n    # Let's define dp[i] as the possible range [lo, hi] of values that can reach the (i+1)-th round.\n    # Wait, maybe we can model it as follows:\n    # Starting from the last round (phase n, which is the final match), the value must be either the max or min of its pair, depending on s[n-1].\n    # Then, for the previous round (phase n-1), we need to determine what values could have passed through that phase to reach the next one.\n    \n    # Let me think recursively. Suppose we are at round k (0-based from 0 to n-1), and we want to determine the possible values that can reach round k+1.\n    \n    # For example, for the last round (k = n-1), the number of teams is 2^(n - (n-1)) = 2^1 = 2. The rule is s[n-1]. The winner must be the max or min of the two teams.\n    # So, the possible value x must be either the max or min of two teams. But since we can choose any permutation, we can arrange that x is the max or min.\n    \n    # However, since we need to work backwards, let's think of the possible range of values that can be the winner of a group of size 2^m in a certain round.\n    \n    # Let's use a bottom-up approach. Starting from the final round and moving upwards.\n    \n    # The champion must be the winner of the final match. The final match is between two teams, which themselves are winners of their respective sub-tournaments.\n    \n    # Let's think of the tournament as a series of layers. Each layer corresponds to a phase. For each layer, we can compute the possible range of values that can emerge from that layer.\n    \n    # Let's define for each layer i (from 0 to n-1), the possible range of values that can be the winner of a group of 2^{n - i} teams in that layer.\n    \n    # Starting from the last layer (i = n-1), which is the final match:\n    # The group size is 2 teams. The winner is determined by s[n-1]. So the possible values are either the max or min of the two teams. Since the permutation is arbitrary, we can have any value as long as it is either the max or min.\n    # However, the actual value x must be able to be the max or min in that group. Which means that x can be any value, because we can arrange the other team to be either higher or lower than x.\n    # Wait, but this seems incorrect. Because for the final match, if the rule is '1' (higher wins), then the champion must be the higher of the two. So x must be the higher of the two. But since the other team can be any value, x can be any value except the smallest one (if s is '1'), because you can't be the higher of two if you are the smallest. Wait, no. For example, if x is 5, and the other team is 1, then x would win if the rule is '1'. So for the final match, if the rule is '1', then x can be any value from 2 to size (since you can pair it with a lower value). If the rule is '0', then x can be any value from 1 to size-1 (since you can pair it with a higher value).\n    \n    # However, this reasoning is not sufficient for earlier rounds, because the x must survive all previous rounds. Therefore, we need to model the constraints for each round.\n    \n    # Here's an efficient way to model the constraints:\n    # For each round i (starting from 0 to n-1), we can compute the minimal and maximal possible values that can reach the next round, based on the rules of the current and subsequent rounds.\n    \n    # We can model this with a range [low, high], which represents the values that can be the winner of a group of 2^{n-i} teams in round i. For each round, depending on the rule, we adjust this range.\n    \n    # Starting from the last round (i = n-1), the group size is 2 teams. The range is [1, size], but adjusted based on the rule.\n    # For example, if the rule is '1' (higher wins), then the winner must be the maximum of the two. So the possible values are from 2 to size, because you can have any value as the maximum by pairing with a smaller one. If the rule is '0', the possible values are from 1 to size-1, since you can be the minimum by pairing with a larger one.\n    \n    # Then, for the previous rounds (i = n-2 down to 0), we need to determine the range of values that can be the winner of a group of 2^{n-i} teams, considering that they must pass through the subsequent rounds.\n    \n    # For each round i, the group is split into pairs. Each pair's winner must be able to pass through the subsequent rounds. So for each pair, the winner must be in the range computed for the next round.\n    \n    # For example, suppose in round i, the rule is '1' (higher wins). Then, for each pair, the higher of the two must be in the range [low, high] of the next round. This implies that the higher of the two must be within that range. Therefore, the lower value in the pair can be anything, but the higher must be in [low, high]. So the possible values for the current round are those that can be the higher of a pair where the higher is in [low, high]. Thus, the current range for this round would be [low, high], because any value in this range can be the higher of a pair (by choosing a lower value outside the range, but since the other value can be anything, we can choose it to be lower).\n    \n    # Wait, this seems a bit abstract. Let's formalize it.\n    \n    # Let’s denote for each round i, the range of values that can reach the next round as [lo, hi].\n    # For the next round (i+1), the range is [lo_next, hi_next].\n    # Now, for round i, depending on the rule, we need to determine what [lo, hi] would be.\n    \n    # If the rule is '1' (higher wins), then for each pair, the higher value must be in [lo_next, hi_next]. So, for the current round, the possible values must be in [lo_next, hi_next], because the higher of the pair must be in that range. The lower can be anything, but the higher must be in [lo_next, hi_next]. Thus, the current range for this round is [lo_next, hi_next].\n    \n    # If the rule is '0' (lower wins), then the lower value must be in [lo_next, hi_next]. So, for the current round, the possible values must be in [lo_next, hi_next], because the lower of the pair must be in that range. The higher can be anything, but the lower must be in [lo_next, hi_next]. Thus, the current range for this round is [lo_next, hi_next].\n    \n    # Wait, that seems counterintuitive. Let me think again. Suppose in round i, the rule is '1', and the next round's range is [lo_next, hi_next]. For a pair in this round, the higher value must be in [lo_next, hi_next]. Therefore, the possible values for the current round are those that can be the higher value of a pair where the higher is in [lo_next, hi_next]. That means that the current round's range is [lo_next, hi_next], because any value in that range can be the higher of a pair (by having a lower value outside of [lo_next, hi_next]).\n    \n    # Similarly, if the rule is '0', the lower value must be in [lo_next, hi_next]. Therefore, the current round's range is [lo_next, hi_next], since any value in that range can be the lower of a pair (by having a higher value outside of [lo_next, hi_next]).\n    \n    # So, the range for round i is the same as the range for round i+1. This suggests that the range doesn't change when moving backward, which is not correct. There must be a mistake here.\n    \n    # Let's take an example. Suppose we have n=2, s='10'.\n    # The tournament has 4 teams. The phases are:\n    # Phase 1 (s[0] = '1') - higher wins.\n    # Phase 2 (s[1] = '0') - lower wins.\n    \n    # For the final round (phase 2), the rule is '0', meaning the lower of the two wins. So the range for this round is [1, 3], because the champion must be the lower of the two teams in the final match. The possible values are 1, 2, or 3. But wait, if the rule is '0', the lower of the two teams wins. So for the final match, the champion must be the lower of the two. Therefore, the possible values can be any value from 1 to 3, as long as there exists another value higher than it. For example, if the champion is 3, then there must be a higher value, but since the maximum is 4 (for n=2, 2^2=4), but in this case, the final match is between two teams. So for the final match, the champion must be the lower of the two. So if x is 4, then the other team must be higher, but there is no higher value. Hence, x=4 cannot be the champion in this scenario. Therefore, the range for the final round is [1, 3].\n    \n    # Moving back to phase 1 (rule '1'). The range for phase 2 is [1,3]. For phase 1, the rule is '1' (higher wins). So, in phase 1, the winner of each match must be in the range [1,3]. For each match in phase 1, the higher of the two teams must be in [1,3]. Therefore, the possible values for phase 1 are [1,3], because any value in this range can be the higher of a pair (by pairing with a lower value, which can be outside of [1,3], but since the permutation allows any arrangement, we can choose the lower value to be outside of [1,3] if needed). However, if the value is 3, then the other team must be less than 3. But since the range for phase 2 is [1,3], the higher of the pair must be in [1,3], which includes 3. Hence, the range for phase 1 is [1,3].\n    \n    # Therefore, the range for phase 0 (the first round) would also be [1,3]. But wait, the initial teams are 4 in total. So the possible values that can be champions are those in [1,3], but 4 is excluded. However, in this example, the correct answer would depend on the rules.\n    \n    # This suggests that the range for each round is determined by the next round's range and the rule of the current round. However, the above logic seems to imply that the range remains the same for all rounds, which is not correct. Hence, there must be a different approach.\n    \n    # Another approach: For each round, the number of teams is 2^{n - i}. The number of matches in this round is 2^{n - i - 1}.\n    # For the champion to win, it must be the winner of each match in every round. For each round, depending on the rule, the champion must be the minimum or maximum in its pair in that round.\n    \n    # Let's model the constraints for x to be the champion. For each round from 1 to n:\n    # - In the first round, the champion must be the winner of its pair. Depending on the rule, it must be the min or max of the pair.\n    # - In the second round, the champion must be the winner of its new pair, which consists of the winners of two previous matches. Again, depending on the rule, it must be the min or max of this new pair.\n    # - And so on until the final round.\n    \n    # To find the possible x, we can simulate this process for each x. However, for large n (up to 18), this approach would be too slow.\n    \n    # Instead, we can use a more efficient method by determining for each x the minimal and maximal possible values it can have in each round based on the rules.\n    \n    # Let's consider that for each round i (from 1 to n), the champion must be either the minimum or maximum in its group of 2^{i} teams. The rules for each round determine whether it must be the min or max.\n    \n    # The key insight is that for x to be the champion, it must be the minimum or maximum in its group of 2^{k} teams in each round k. The rules for each round determine whether it must be the min or max.\n    \n    # We can calculate for each x the minimal and maximal possible values it can have in each round, and ensure that these constraints are satisfied.\n    \n    # Let's define for each round i (from 1 to n), the number of teams in the group is 2^{i}. The rule for this round determines whether x must be the min or max in this group.\n    \n    # For example, if the rule for round i is '1', then x must be the maximum in its group of 2^{i} teams. If the rule is '0', then x must be the minimum.\n    \n    # To find the possible x, we need to ensure that for each round i, x satisfies the constraint of being the min or max in its group of 2^{i} teams.\n    \n    # How can we compute this?\n    \n    # For each x, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible values it can have in each round. For example, if in round i, the rule is '1', then x must be the maximum in its group of 2^{i} teams. This means that there are (2^{i} - 1) other teams in the group, all of which must be less than x. Therefore, x must be at least (2^{i} - 1) + 1 = 2^{i}.\n    \n    # Similarly, if the rule is '0', x must be the minimum in its group of 2^{i} teams, which means x must be at most (2^{i} - 1).\n    \n    # However, this approach might not account for the fact that the groups in different rounds overlap. For example, the group in round i is part of the group in round i+1.\n    \n    # Wait, this suggests that for each round, the group size doubles. For example, in round 1, the group size is 2 teams; in round 2, it's 4 teams, etc. But the rounds are processed sequentially, so the constraints for each round must be cumulative.\n    \n    # Let's consider that for each round i (starting from 1), the group size is 2^i teams. The champion must be the min or max in this group, depending on the rule for that round.\n    \n    # For example, if the rule for round 1 is '1', then x must be the max of its 2 teams. So x must be ≥ 2.\n    # For round 2, if the rule is '0', then x must be the min of its 4 teams. So x must be ≤ 4 - 1 = 3.\n    # Combining these constraints, x must be ≥ 2 and ≤ 3.\n    \n    # This gives us a way to compute the valid range for x by applying these constraints for each round.\n    \n    # Let's formalize this:\n    # For each round i (from 1 to n):\n    #   group_size = 2^i\n    #   if s[i-1] == '1':\n    #       x must be ≥ group_size\n    #   else:\n    #       x must be ≤ group_size - 1\n    \n    # However, this assumes that the constraints are independent, which they are not. For example, in round 1, the group size is 2, and the constraint is x ≥ 2. In round 2, the group size is 4, and the constraint is x ≤ 3. This would imply that x must be in [2, 3], which is correct for the example.\n    \n    # Let's test this with the sample input.\n    \n    # Sample Input 1:\n    # 3\n    # 101\n    # Output: 4 5 6 7\n    \n    # Let's compute the constraints for each round.\n    # n = 3, s = '101'\n    # For rounds 1 to 3:\n    # Round 1: s[0] = '1' → group_size = 2 → x ≥ 2\n    # Round 2: s[1] = '0' → group_size = 4 → x ≤ 3\n    # Round 3: s[2] = '1' → group_size = 8 → x ≥ 8\n    \n    # Wait, but this would require x to be ≥ 2, ≤ 3, and ≥ 8. This is impossible. But the sample output is 4-7. Clearly, this approach is incorrect.\n    \n    # Ah, I see the mistake. The group sizes for each round are not 2^i but 2^{n - i + 1}?

For each phase, the team must be the minimum or maximum in its pair. This implies that for each phase, the team must be within a certain range of values.\n    \n    # Let's consider that for each phase, the number of teams is 2^{k} where k = n - i + 1.

This implies that in the current phase, the team must be either the smallest or largest in its group of 2^{k} teams.\n    \n    # However, this is not quite right. Each phase involves a match between two teams, which are winners from the previous phase.

But since the other team can be any value, x can be any value except the smallest one (if s is '1'), because you can't be the higher of two if you are the smallest. Wait, no. For example, if x is 5, and the other team is 1, then x would win if the rule is '1'. So for the final match, if the rule is '1', then x can be any value from 2 to size (since you can pair it with a lower value). If the rule is '0', then x can be any value from 1 to size-1 (since you can pair it with a higher value).\n    \n    # However, this reasoning is not sufficient for earlier rounds, because the x must survive all previous rounds. Therefore, we need to model the constraints for each round.\n    \n    # Here's an efficient way to model the constraints:\n    # For each round i (starting from 0 to n-1), we can compute the minimal and maximal possible values that can reach the next round, based on the rules of the current and subsequent rounds.\n    \n    # We can model this with a range [low, high], which represents the values that can be the winner of a group of 2^{n-i} teams in round i. For each round, depending on the rule, we adjust this range.\n    \n    # Starting from the last round (i = n-1), the group size is 2 teams. The range is [1, size], but adjusted based on the rule.\n    # For example, if the rule is '1' (higher wins), then the winner must be the maximum of the two. So the possible values are from 2 to size, because you can have any value as the maximum by pairing with a smaller one. If the rule is '0', the possible values are from 1 to size-1, since you can be the minimum by pairing with a larger one.\n    \n    # Then, for the previous rounds (i = n-2 down to 0), we need to determine the range of values that can be the winner of a group of 2^{n-i} teams, considering that they must pass through the subsequent rounds.\n    \n    # For each round i, the group is split into pairs. Each pair's winner must be able to pass through the subsequent rounds. So for each pair, the winner must be in the range computed for the next round.\n    \n    # For example, suppose in round i, the rule is '1' (higher wins). Then, for each pair, the higher of the two must be in the range [low, high] of the next round. This implies that the higher of the two must be within that range. Therefore, the lower value in the pair can be anything, but the higher must be in [low, high]. So the possible values for the current round are those that can be the higher of a pair where the higher is in [low, high]. Thus, the current range for this round would be [low, high], because any value in this range can be the higher of a pair (by choosing a lower value outside the range, but since the other value can be anything, we can choose it to be lower).\n    \n    # Wait, this seems a bit abstract. Let's formalize it.\n    \n    # Let’s denote for each round i, the range of values that can reach the next round as [lo, hi].\n    # For the next round (i+1), the range is [lo_next, hi_next].\n    # Now, for round i, depending on the rule, we need to determine what [lo, hi] would be.\n    \n    # If the rule is '1' (higher wins), then for each pair, the higher value must be in [lo_next, hi_next]. So, for the current round, the possible values must be in [lo_next, hi_next], because the higher of the pair must be in that range. The lower can be anything, but the higher must be in [lo_next, hi_next]. Thus, the current range for this round is [lo_next, hi_next].\n    \n    # If the rule is '0' (lower wins), then the lower value must be in [lo_next, hi_next]. So, for the current round, the possible values must be in [lo_next, hi_next], because the lower of the pair must be in that range. The higher can be anything, but the lower must be in [lo_next, hi_next]. Thus, the current range for this round is [lo_next, hi_next].\n    \n    # Wait, that seems counterintuitive. Let me think again. Suppose in round i, the rule is '1', and the next round's range is [lo_next, hi_next]. For a pair in this round, the higher value must be in [lo_next, hi_next]. Therefore, the possible values for the current round are those that can be the higher value of a pair where the higher is in [lo_next, hi_next]. That means that the current round's range is [lo_next, hi_next], because any value in that range can be the higher of a pair (by having a lower value outside of [lo_next, hi_next]).\n    \n    # Similarly, if the rule is '0', the lower value must be in [lo_next, hi_next]. Therefore, the current round's range is [lo_next, hi_next], since any value in that range can be the lower of a pair (by having a higher value outside of [lo_next, hi_next]).\n    \n    # So, the range for round i is the same as the range for round i+1. This suggests that the range doesn't change when moving backward, which is not correct. There must be a mistake here.\n    \n    # Let's take an example. Suppose we have n=2, s='10'.\n    # The tournament has 4 teams. The phases are:\n    # Phase 1 (s[0] = '1') - higher wins.\n    # Phase 2 (s[1] = '0') - lower wins.\n    \n    # For the final round (phase 2), the rule is '0', meaning the lower of the two wins. So the range for this round is [1, 3], because the champion must be the lower of the two teams in the final match. The possible values are 1, 2, or 3. But wait, if the rule is '0', the lower of the two teams wins. So for the final match, the champion must be the lower of the two. Therefore, the possible values can be any value from 1 to 3, as long as there exists another value higher than it. For example, if the champion is 3, then there must be a higher value, but since the maximum is 4 (for n=2, 2^2=4), but in this case, the final match is between two teams. So for the final match, the champion must be the lower of the two. So if x is 4, then the other team must be higher, but there is no higher value. Hence, x=4 cannot be the champion in this scenario. Therefore, the range for the final round is [1, 3].\n    \n    # Moving back to phase 1 (rule '1'). The range for phase 2 is [1,3]. For phase 1, the rule is '1' (higher wins). So, in phase 1, the winner of each match must be in the range [1,3]. For each match in phase 1, the higher of the two teams must be in [1,3]. Therefore, the possible values for phase 1 are [1,3], because any value in this range can be the higher of a pair (by pairing with a lower value, which can be outside of [1,3], but since the permutation allows any arrangement, we can choose the lower value to be outside of [1,3] if needed). However, if the value is 3, then the other team must be less than 3. But since the range for phase 2 is [1,3], the higher of the pair must be in [1,3], which includes 3. Hence, the range for phase 1 is [1,3].\n    \n    # Therefore, the range for phase 0 (the first round) would also be [1,3]. But wait, the initial teams are 4 in total. So the possible values that can be champions are those in [1,3], but 4 is excluded. However, in this example, the correct answer would depend on the rules.\n    \n    # This suggests that the range for each round is determined by the next round's range and the rule of the current round. However, the above logic seems to imply that the range remains the same for all rounds, which is not correct. Hence, there must be a different approach.\n    \n    # Another approach: For each round, the number of teams is 2^{n - i}. The number of matches in this round is 2^{n - i - 1}.\n    # For the champion to win, it must be the winner of each match in every round. For each round, depending on the rule, the champion must be the minimum or maximum in its pair in that round.\n    \n    # Let's model the constraints for x to be the champion. For each round from 1 to n:\n    # - In the first round, the champion must be the winner of its pair. Depending on the rule, it must be the min or max of the pair.\n    # - In the second round, the champion must be the winner of its new pair, which consists of the winners of two previous matches. Again, depending on the rule, it must be the min or max of this new pair.\n    # - And so on until the final round.\n    \n    # To find the possible x, we can simulate this process for each x. However, for large n (up to 18), this approach would be too slow.\n    \n    # Instead, we can use a more efficient method by determining for each x the minimal and maximal possible values it can have in each round based on the rules.\n    \n    # Let's consider that for each round i (from 1 to n), the champion must be either the minimum or maximum in its group of 2^{i} teams. The rules for each round determine whether it must be the min or max.\n    \n    # The key insight is that for x to be the champion, it must be the minimum or maximum in its group of 2^{k} teams in each round k. The rules for each round determine whether it must be the min or max.\n    \n    # We can calculate for each x the minimal and maximal possible values it can have in each round, and ensure that these constraints are satisfied.\n    \n    # Let's define for each round i (from 1 to n), the number of teams in the group is 2^{i}. The rule for this round determines whether x must be the min or max in this group.\n    \n    # For example, if the rule for round i is '1', then x must be the maximum in its group of 2^{i} teams. If the rule is '0', then x must be the minimum.\n    \n    # To find the possible x, we need to ensure that for each round i, x satisfies the constraint of being the min or max in its group of 2^{i} teams.\n    \n    # How can we compute this?\n    \n    # For each x, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible values it can have in each round. For example, if in round i, the rule is '1', then x must be the maximum in its group of 2^{i} teams. This means that there are (2^{i} - 1) other teams in the group, all of which must be less than x. Therefore, x must be at least (2^{i} - 1) + 1 = 2^{i}.\n    \n    # Similarly, if the rule is '0', x must be the minimum in its group of 2^{i} teams, which means x must be at most (2^{i} - 1).\n    \n    # However, this approach might not account for the fact that the groups in different rounds overlap. For example, the group in round i is part of the group in round i+1.\n    \n    # Wait, this suggests that for each round, the group size doubles. For example, in round 1, the group size is 2 teams; in round 2, it's 4 teams, etc. But the rounds are processed sequentially, so the constraints for each round must be cumulative.\n    \n    # Let's consider that for each round i (starting from 1), the group size is 2^i teams. The champion must be the min or max in this group, depending on the rule for that round.\n    \n    # For example, if the rule for round 1 is '1', then x must be the max of its 2 teams. So x must be ≥ 2.\n    # For round 2, if the rule is '0', then x must be the min of its 4 teams. So x must be ≤ 4 - 1 = 3.\n    # Combining these constraints, x must be ≥ 2 and ≤ 3.\n    \n    # This gives us a way to compute the valid range for x by applying these constraints for each round.\n    \n    # Let's formalize this:\n    # For each round i (from 1 to n):\n    #   group_size = 2^i\n    #   if s[i-1] == '1':\n    #       x must be ≥ group_size\n    #   else:\n    #       x must be ≤ group_size - 1\n    \n    # However, this assumes that the constraints are independent, which they are not. For example, in round 1, the group size is 2, and the constraint is x ≥ 2. In round 2, the group size is 4, and the constraint is x ≤ 3. This would imply that x must be in [2, 3], which is correct for the example.\n    \n    # Let's test this with the sample input.\n    \n    # Sample Input 1:\n    # 3\n    # 101\n    # Output: 4 5 6 7\n    \n    # Let's compute the constraints for each round.\n    # n = 3, s = '101'\n    # For rounds 1 to 3:\n    # Round 1: s[0] = '1' → group_size = 2 → x ≥ 2\n    # Round 2: s[1] = '0' → group_size = 4 → x ≤ 3\n    # Round 3: s[2] = '1' → group_size = 8 → x ≥ 8\n    \n    # Wait, but this would require x to be ≥ 2, ≤ 3, and ≥ 8. This is impossible. But the sample output is 4-7. Clearly, this approach is incorrect.\n    \n    # Ah, I see the mistake. The group sizes for each round are not 2^i but 2^{n - i + 1}? Or perhaps I have the rounds indexed incorrectly.\n    \n    # Let me reindex the rounds properly. The tournament has n phases. Each phase i (1-based) has 2^{n - i} games. The group size for phase i is 2^{n - i + 1} teams.\n    \n    # For example, in the first phase (i=1), there are 2^{n-1} games, each involving 2 teams, so total teams is 2^{n} / 2 = 2^{n-1} * 2 = 2^n teams. No, this is not correct.\n    \n    # Actually, the number of teams in the tournament decreases by half in each phase. The first phase has 2^{n} teams, the second phase has 2^{n-1}, and so on until the nth phase has 2^0 = 1 team.\n    \n    # For each phase i (1-based), the number of teams is 2^{n - (i-1)}.\n    # For example, phase 1: 2^{n} teams, phase 2: 2^{n-1}, ..., phase n: 2^0 = 1 team.\n    \n    # The group size for each phase i is 2^{n - (i-1)} teams. The number of games in phase i is 2^{n - i}.\n    \n    # For each team to win the tournament, it must be the winner of each phase. In phase i, the team must be the winner of its match, which depends on the rule for that phase.\n    \n    # So for each phase i, the team must be either the minimum or maximum in its pair of teams in that phase.\n    \n    # To determine the constraints for x, we can think recursively. For each phase, the team must be the minimum or maximum in its pair. This implies that for each phase, the team must be within a certain range of values.\n    \n    # Let's consider that for each phase, the number of teams is 2^{k} where k = n - i + 1. For example, in phase i=1, k = n.\n    \n    # For each phase i, the team must be the min or max in its pair. This implies that in the current phase, the team must be either the smallest or largest in its group of 2^{k} teams.\n    \n    # However, this is not quite right. Each phase involves a match between two teams, which are winners from the previous phase. So for phase i, the group size is 2^{k} teams, and the team must be the winner of its match in this phase, which depends on the rule for that phase.\n    \n    # This seems complex. Perhaps the correct way is to simulate the tournament for each x, but this is computationally intensive for large n. However, given the constraints (n up to 18), we need an efficient approach.\n    \n    # Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial approach of simulating the constraints for each x.

No.\n    \n    # For the final round (i = n-1), there are 2 teams. The winner is determined by the rule. So if the rule is '1', the winner must be the higher of the two, which can be any value from 2 to size. If the rule is '0', the winner must be the lower of the two, which can be any value from 1 to size-1.\n    \n    # So for the final round, the range is [2, size] if rule is '1', [1, size-1] if rule is '0'.\n    \n    # For the previous round (i = n-2), we need to determine the range of values that can reach the final round. For each match in this round, the winner must be in the range determined for the final round.\n    \n    # If the rule for this round is '1' (higher wins), then the winner of the match must be the higher of the two teams in the match. This winner must be in the range for the next round. So the possible values for this round are those values that are the higher of two teams, one of which is in the range for the next round.\n    \n    # For example, if the next round's range is [lo, hi], then for this round, the higher of the two teams must be in [lo, hi].
