And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. For each consecutive k-day period, I need to compute the average and then find the overall average of all those averages.\n\nHmm. Wait, the problem says that the answer is the sum of all the weeks' averages divided by the number of weeks. Or wait, no. Wait, the note says that for the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Oh right, because each week's average is (sum of k days) /k, and then the overall average is the sum of all those averages divided by the number of weeks. But wait, that's equivalent to taking the total sum of all the k-day periods divided by (number of weeks * k). Because each week's average is sum_week /k, so adding all those averages and dividing by number of weeks is (sum of all sum_week) / (number_of_weeks *k). \n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way to compute this. Let me think. For example, if I have n=3, k=2, then the weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their averages are 3.5 and 5.5. The overall average is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 4.5. Which is (3+4+4+7)/ (2*2) = (18)/(4) = 4.5. So yes, the total sum of all the k-day periods divided by (number_of_weeks *k) is the same as the average of the averages. So maybe it's easier to compute the total sum of all the k-day periods, then divide by (number_of_weeks *k).\n\nBut how do I compute the sum of all the k-day periods?\n\nLet me think about that. For example, in the first example: n=3, k=2. The sum of the two weeks is (3+4) + (4+7) = 7 + 11 = 18. So the total sum is 18. Then the answer is 18/(2*2) = 4.5, which matches the example.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum of all the consecutive k-day periods, then dividing by ( (n -k +1) *k ). Because the number of weeks is (n -k +1).\n\nSo the key is to compute the sum of all consecutive k-length subarrays.\n\nNow, how to compute that efficiently? Because n can be up to 2e5, and k can be up to n. So a naive approach of checking each window and summing would take O(n*k) time, which for n=2e5 would be 4e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a more efficient method. The standard approach here is to use a sliding window technique. Let me think. The sum for the first window is sum(a[0..k-1]). Then for each next window, we subtract a[i-1] and add a[i +k -1]. So each step takes O(1) time. So the total time is O(n) for the sliding window.\n\nYes. So let's proceed with that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\n2. Add this sum to the total_sum.\n\n3. Then for each next window (from i=1 to i = n -k), subtract the element leaving the window (a[i-1]) and add the new element (a[i +k -1]). Then add this to total_sum.\n\nOnce we have the total_sum, the answer is total_sum / ( (n -k +1) *k )\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the output should be the average of all the weeks. Which is exactly that.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=3, k=2. The total_sum is 7 + 11 = 18. The number of weeks is 2. So 18/(2*2) = 4.5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read n and k.\n\n- Read the array a.\n\n- Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\n- total_sum = initial_sum.\n\n- Then, for each i from 1 to (n -k) (since the number of weeks is n -k +1, and we have already processed the first one), we compute the next sum by subtracting a[i-1] and adding a[i +k -1].\n\n- Add that to total_sum.\n\nOnce done, compute the average as total_sum / ( (n -k +1) *k )\n\nThen, output that with sufficient decimal",
    "response": "To solve the problem of calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks, we need to efficiently compute the sum of all consecutive k-day periods in an array of n days. We then use this total sum to compute the overall average sleep time across all weeks.\n\n---\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**:\n   - To avoid recalculating the sum of each k-day window from scratch, we use a sliding window approach. This allows us to compute each window's sum in constant time after the initial sum is calculated.\n   - The first window sum is computed by summing the first `k` elements of the array.\n   - For subsequent windows, we subtract the element that is no longer in the window and add the new element that enters the window.\n\n2. **Total Sum Calculation**:\n   - As we iterate through all possible k-day windows, we accumulate their sums in a variable called `total_sum`.\n\n3. **Final Average Calculation**:\n   - The number of valid weeks is `n - k + 1`.\n   - The final average is obtained by dividing `total_sum` by `(n - k + 1) * k`, which gives the average of all weekly averages.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, k = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx].strip().split()))\n        idx += 1\n        \n        total_sum = 0\n        # Compute initial window sum\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum += current_sum\n        # Slide the window\n        for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i - 1] + a[i + k - 1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        # Compute the result\n        num_weeks = n - k + 1\n        result = total_sum / (num_weeks * k)\n        # Print with 10 decimal digits\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, with each test case processed in a loop.\n- **Initial Sum**: The sum of the first `k` elements is calculated once.\n- **Sliding Window**: Each new window sum is derived from the previous one by subtracting the outgoing element and adding the incoming element.\n- **Result Calculation**: The total of all window sums is divided by the product of the number of weeks and the window size `k` to get the final average sleep time per week.\n\nThis solution ensures that the algorithm runs in linear time, $O(n)$, making it efficient even for large input sizes up to $2 \\times 10^5$.",
