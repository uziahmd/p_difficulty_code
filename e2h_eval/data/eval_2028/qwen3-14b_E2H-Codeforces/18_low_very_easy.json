The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where a frog jumps on a number line, and calculate the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m. The function f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the frog moves. The frog starts at 0. From position k, it can jump to k+a or k-b. But it can't go outside [0, x]. So for each x, I need to find all positions reachable by the frog under these constraints.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute each f(i) individually for large m. We need a mathematical formula or pattern that allows us to compute the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the possible reachable positions. The frog can move forward by a steps (k+a) or backward by b steps (k-b). But since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, the movement is constrained.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of linear combinations. The frog can reach positions that are combinations of adding a and subtracting b. However, since the frog starts at 0, the positions it can reach are those that can be written as some multiple of a minus some multiple of b. Wait, but since the frog can make any number of jumps, maybe the reachable positions are those that are congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b)? Or something like that.\n\nWait, the classic problem here is the coin problem. If you have two coins of denominations a and b, the largest amount that cannot be formed is ab - a - b (assuming they are coprime). But here, the frog can add a or subtract b. But since the frog can do any number of steps, perhaps the reachable positions are those that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients such that the total is non-negative, but also considering the constraints of not going out of bounds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reachable positions are all numbers that are congruent to 0 mod d, where d is the gcd of a and b. Because any linear combination of a and b is a multiple of their gcd.\n\nSo first, let's compute d = gcd(a, b). Let's say that the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of d. But since the frog starts at 0, which is a multiple of d, then all reachable positions must be multiples of d. But maybe there's more constraints.\n\nBut if a and b are not coprime, then the frog can't reach positions that are not multiples of d. So for example, if a=5 and b=3, then d=1. So all positions are reachable? Well, no. Because the frog can only move forward by a steps or backward by b steps. But the frog can't reach negative numbers. So even though the gcd is 1, the frog can reach any integer once it can reach enough positions. But maybe not.\n\nWait, the frog can move forward and backward. Let's take the example given in the first sample input: a=5, b=3. So d=1. The frog can reach positions that are multiples of 1, i.e., all integers. But the problem says that when x is 5, f(5)=3. Let's see why.\n\nIn the first sample, for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and 5-3=2. Then from 2, can it jump to 2+5=7 (which is beyond x=5, so not allowed) or 2-3= -1 (invalid). So for x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. Hence f(5) is 3. But according to the idea that all positions are reachable, that's not the case. So my initial thought is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So the problem isn't just about the linear combinations but also about the constraints of not going out of bounds. Therefore, the reachable positions depend on the maximum x allowed. So for each x, the frog can reach certain positions based on how far it can go forward and backward.\n\nSo how can I model this?\n\nLet me think about the problem again. The frog can make any number of jumps, but during the process, it can't step outside [0, x]. So the frog can reach positions that are reachable through some sequence of +a and -b steps, but ensuring that all intermediate steps are within [0, x].\n\nBut for a given x, what positions can the frog reach?\n\nAlternatively, think about the set of positions reachable from 0, considering that the frog can only move forward a or backward b, but can't go below 0 or above x. But since the frog can make any number of steps, perhaps the reachable positions are all positions that are congruent",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line from position 0, given constraints on its jumps and a maximum boundary. The goal is to compute the sum of these values for all boundaries from 0 to a given integer $ m $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump either forward by $ a $ or backward by $ b $. The key insight is that the reachable positions are constrained by the greatest common divisor (gcd) of $ a $ and $ b $. If $ \\text{gcd}(a, b) = d $, then the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of $ d $.\n\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The frog's movement can be modeled as a cycle of steps. For each valid position, we can determine how many positions are reachable within the bounds [0, x].\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Given the constraints (up to $ 10^9 $), we need an efficient method to calculate the sum without iterating through each value from 0 to $ m $. We use mathematical properties and precompute values for cycles to efficiently sum up the results.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    b = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    if a == 0 and b == 0:\n        print(m + 1)\n        return\n    if a == 0:\n        # Only can go back, but since starting at 0, can't go below 0\n        # So f(x) = 1 for all x\n        print(m + 1)\n        return\n    if b == 0:\n        # Only can go forward by a\n        # For x < a: f(x) = 1\n        # For x >= a: f(x) = floor(x / a) + 1\n        # Sum from i=0 to m: sum_{i=0}^m [1 if i < a else (i//a + 1)]\n        # But since a is positive, and m can be large\n        # Compute sum = (m + 1) + sum_{k=1}^{floor(m/a)} k * (number of times k appears)\n        # But actually, for x >= a, f(x) = floor(x/a) + 1\n        # So the sum is sum_{x=0}^m f(x) = sum_{x=0}^{a-1} 1 + sum_{x=a}^m (floor(x/a) + 1)\n        # First part: a terms of 1\n        # Second part: sum_{k=1}^k_max (k * (number of x with floor(x/a) = k)) + sum_{k=1}^k_max (number of x with floor(x/a) = k)\n        # But it's easier to compute as:\n        # sum_{x=0}^m (floor(x/a) + 1) = sum_{x=0}^m floor(x/a) + (m+1)\n        # sum_{x=0}^m floor(x/a) = (m - r) * (m - r + 1) // (2*a) - r*(r+1)//2 where r = m % a\n        # But perhaps there's a simpler way.\n        # Let me think:\n        # For x in [0, m], floor(x/a) is k for x in [ka, (k+1)a - 1]\n        # So for k from 0 to K where K = m // a\n        # The number of x with floor(x/a) = k is min((k+1)*a - 1, m) - k*a + 1\n        # Which is a if (k+1)*a -1 <= m, else m - k*a + 1\n        # So sum_{x=0}^m floor(x/a) = sum_{k=0}^{K-1} k * a + K * (m - K*a + 1)\n        # Where K = m // a\n        # But perhaps we can use formula: sum_{x=0}^n floor(x/a) = (n - r) * (n - r + 1) // (2*a) - r*(r+1)//2 where r = n % a\n        # Not sure. Alternatively, the total sum can be calculated as:\n        # For each k from 0 to K-1: k * a\n        # For k=K: K * (m - K*a + 1)\n        # So total sum = sum_{k=0}^{K-1} k * a + K * (m - K*a + 1)\n        # Where K = m // a\n        # Then add (m+1) to get the total sum\n        # But maybe there's a better way.\n        # However, given the time, perhaps we can compute it as follows:\n        # sum_floor = (m // a) * (m // a - 1) * a // 2 + (m // a) * (m % a + 1)\n        # Wait, no. Let me think again.\n        # For example, a=5, m=7: floor(x/5) for x=0-7 is 0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1\n        # sum is 0*5 + 1*3 = 3\n        # K = 7//5 = 1, so sum_{k=0}^{K-1} k*a = 0*5 = 0\n        # plus K*(m - K*a + 1) = 1*(7 - 5 + 1) = 3\n        # total sum_floor = 0 + 3 = 3\n        # which matches. So general formula:\n        K = m // a\n        sum_floor = K * (K - 1) * a // 2 + K * (m - K * a + 1)\n        total = sum_floor + (m + 1)\n        print(total)\n        return\n    if d != 1:\n        # All positions must be multiples of d\n        # So we can divide a, b, m by d\n        a //= d\n        b //= d\n        m //= d\n        # Now the problem becomes equivalent to original with a and b coprime\n        # But we have to multiply the result by d?\n        # No, because the original problem is about positions up to x, which was divided by d\n        # So we need to compute the same problem with a, b coprime, and m' = m//d\n        # Then the answer is the same as the answer for the new parameters, multiplied by d?\n        # No, the original problem is about positions up to x, which is now m' * d\n        # So we need to compute the answer for the new a, b, m', and then the answer is the same as the original.\n        # So let's proceed with the new a, b, m\n        # So we can reassign variables\n        m_new = m\n        a_new = a\n        b_new = b\n        # Now a and b are coprime\n        # Now, the problem is to compute the sum for m_new, a_new, b_new\n        # So proceed with the following code\n        # Let's proceed with the code for coprime a and b\n        # Now, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, but since d is 1, we can ignore it\n        # But now a and b are coprime\n        # Now, we can model the problem as follows:\n        # The frog can reach any position that can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position is within [0, x]\n        # However, since the frog can move both forward and backward, but not go out of bounds, the problem becomes more complex\n        # Let's consider that the frog can reach any position >= 0, but constrained by x\n        # However, for a and b coprime, the frog can reach any integer >= (a*b - a - b) + something? Not sure\n        # But for the problem, the key is that once the frog can reach some position >= b, it can keep moving forward by a and backward by b, thus generating all positions beyond a certain point\n        # So for x >= a + b, the number of reachable positions is x + 1, because the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x\n        # Wait, no. For example, if a=5, b=3, and x=7, the sample says f(7)=8. Which is 0 to 7, but that's not the case. Wait sample input says f(7)=8, but in the note, the sum is 19. So for x=7, the frog can reach 8 positions. But according to the sample explanation, for x=5, it's 3 positions. So how does that fit?\n\n        # Let me think again. When a and b are coprime, the frog can reach any integer greater than or equal to (a*b - a - b) + something. But for our problem, since the frog can go forward and backward, perhaps once the frog can reach a certain position, it can generate all positions beyond that.\n\n        # However, given the time constraints, I'll refer to the approach used in the sample explanation and code.\n\n        # Based on the sample, when a and b are coprime, the number of reachable positions for x is:\n        # If x < a: only 0 is reachable (f(x) = 1)\n        # If x >= a and x < a + b: positions are 0, a, a - b, a - 2b, ... until they are >= 0\n        # Once x >= a + b, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x.\n\n        # Wait, in the first sample, a=5, b=3, which are coprime. For x=7, which is >= a + b = 8? No, 5+3=8, x=7 is less than 8. But the sample says f(7) is 8. How?\n\n        # This suggests that my previous assumption is incorrect. Therefore, I need another approach.\n\n        # Alternative approach: For each x, the number of reachable positions is the number of positions in the form of k*a - l*b where k, l are non-negative integers, and the position is between 0 and x, inclusive.\n\n        # But calculating this for large x is not feasible. So we need a pattern.\n\n        # Let's consider that the frog can reach all positions >= (some value). Let's find the minimal position from which the frog can reach every position beyond it.\n\n        # For coprime a and b, the minimal such position is (a*b - a - b) + something. But I'm not sure.\n\n        # Another idea: The frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a,b), which is 1 here. So all positions are possible, but constrained by the x limit and the ability to reach them via the allowed moves.\n\n        # However, for the frog to reach a position x, it must be possible to reach it by some combination of adding a and subtracting b, without stepping outside [0, x] during the process.\n\n        # This seems complex. But given the time, I'll refer to the solution approach from the sample.\n\n        # In the first sample, for x=7, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. That's 8 positions. So for x >= a + b - 1 (since a=5, b=3, a + b -1 = 7), the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x.\n\n        # So, the general rule is:\n        # If x >= a + b - 1, then f(x) = x + 1\n        # Otherwise, f(x) is the number of positions reachable up to x.\n\n        # So for x >= a + b - 1, f(x) = x + 1\n        # For x < a + b - 1, we need to compute the number of reachable positions.\n\n        # Therefore, the sum can be split into two parts:\n        # 1. For x from 0 to (a + b - 2), compute f(x) individually\n        # 2. For x from (a + b - 1) to m, each contributes x + 1\n\n        # However, this is only true if a and b are coprime. If they are not, we have to adjust for the gcd.\n\n        # So putting it all together:\n\n        # Compute d = gcd(a, b)\n        # If d != 1, then we can divide a, b, m by d, and the problem reduces to the same problem with a/d and b/d being coprime, and m' = m // d. Then the answer is the same as the sum for the new parameters.\n\n        # Now, assuming a and b are coprime, and m' is the adjusted m.\n\n        # Now, if m' < a + b - 1, then we need to compute f(x) for all x up to m', which can be done with BFS or DP for small ranges. But since a and b are up to 1e5, and m can be up to 1e9, but after dividing by d, m' can be up to 1e9 / 1 = 1e9, which is too big for BFS.\n\n        # So we need a mathematical way to compute the number of reachable positions for x < a + b - 1.\n\n        # Let's think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is reachable via a series of jumps, and for x < a + b - 1, the number of reachable positions is the number of positions that are multiples of d (which is 1 in this case) and can be expressed as k*a - l*b with k, l >= 0, and 0 <= position <= x.\n\n        # However, for small x, we can simulate this using BFS. But since a and b are up to 1e5, and for x up to 2e5 (since a + b can be up to 2e5), it's feasible.\n\n        # So the plan is:\n\n        # 1. Compute d = gcd(a, b)\n        # 2. If d != 1, then divide a, b, m by d, and compute the sum for the new parameters, then return that sum.\n        # 3. If d == 1:\n        #    a. Compute the threshold T = a + b - 1\n        #    b.

For example, if a=5, b=3, and x=7, the sample says f(7)=8. Which is 0 to 7, but that's not the case. Wait sample input says f(7)=8, but in the note, the sum is 19. So for x=7, the frog can reach 8 positions. But according to the sample explanation, for x=5, it's 3 positions. So how does that fit?\n\n        # Let me think again. When a and b are coprime, the frog can reach any integer greater than or equal to (a*b - a - b) + something.

For x=7, which is >= a + b = 8? No, 5+3=8, x=7 is less than 8. But the sample says f(7) is 8. How?\n\n        # This suggests that my previous assumption is incorrect. Therefore, I need another approach.\n\n        # Alternative approach: For each x, the number of reachable positions is the number of positions in the form of k*a - l*b where k, l are non-negative integers, and the position is between 0 and x, inclusive.\n\n        # But calculating this for large x is not feasible. So we need a pattern.\n\n        # Let's consider that the frog can reach all positions >= (some value). Let's find the minimal position from which the frog can reach every position beyond it.\n\n        # For coprime a and b, the minimal such position is (a*b - a - b) + something. But I'm not sure.\n\n        # Another idea: The frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a,b), which is 1 here. So all positions are possible, but constrained by the x limit and the ability to reach them via the allowed moves.\n\n        # However, for the frog to reach a position x, it must be possible to reach it by some combination of adding a and subtracting b, without stepping outside [0, x] during the process.\n\n        # This seems complex. But given the time, I'll refer to the solution approach from the sample.\n\n        # In the first sample, for x=7, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. That's 8 positions. So for x >= a + b - 1 (since a=5, b=3, a + b -1 = 7), the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x.\n\n        # So, the general rule is:\n        # If x >= a + b - 1, then f(x) = x + 1\n        # Otherwise, f(x) is the number of positions reachable up to x.\n\n        # So for x >= a + b - 1, f(x) = x + 1\n        # For x < a + b - 1, we need to compute the number of reachable positions.\n\n        # Therefore, the sum can be split into two parts:\n        # 1. For x from 0 to (a + b - 2), compute f(x) individually\n        # 2. For x from (a + b - 1) to m, each contributes x + 1\n\n        # However, this is only true if a and b are coprime. If they are not, we have to adjust for the gcd.\n\n        # So putting it all together:\n\n        # Compute d = gcd(a, b)\n        # If d != 1, then we can divide a, b, m by d, and the problem reduces to the same problem with a/d and b/d being coprime, and m' = m // d. Then the answer is the same as the sum for the new parameters.\n\n        # Now, assuming a and b are coprime, and m' is the adjusted m.\n\n        # Now, if m' < a + b - 1, then we need to compute f(x) for all x up to m', which can be done with BFS or DP for small ranges. But since a and b are up to 1e5, and m can be up to 1e9, but after dividing by d, m' can be up to 1e9 / 1 = 1e9, which is too big for BFS.\n\n        # So we need a mathematical way to compute the number of reachable positions for x < a + b - 1.\n\n        # Let's think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is reachable via a series of jumps, and for x < a + b - 1, the number of reachable positions is the number of positions that are multiples of d (which is 1 in this case) and can be expressed as k*a - l*b with k, l >= 0, and 0 <= position <= x.\n\n        # However, for small x, we can simulate this using BFS. But since a and b are up to 1e5, and for x up to 2e5 (since a + b can be up to 2e5), it's feasible.\n\n        # So the plan is:\n\n        # 1. Compute d = gcd(a, b)\n        # 2. If d != 1, then divide a, b, m by d, and compute the sum for the new parameters, then return that sum.\n        # 3. If d == 1:\n        #    a. Compute the threshold T = a + b - 1\n        #    b. If m < T, compute f(x) for all x from 0 to m using BFS.\n        #    c. If m >= T, compute the sum for x from 0 to T-1, and then add the sum from x=T to m, which is sum_{x=T}^m (x+1)\n\n        # Now, let's implement this logic.\n\n        # So, the code will be structured as follows:\n\n        # Function to compute the sum for a and b coprime, and m' as the current m\n\n        def compute_sum_coprime(a, b, m):\n            T = a + b -
