Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can recycle the burned-out ones into new candles. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is a. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can take b of them to make a new one. And this new one can be used again, and so on. The question is to find the total hours possible.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. He uses all 4, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 burned candles can be turned into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 burned ones can be made into 1 new candle (since 2 / 2 = 1). He uses that, adding 1 hour. Now, there's 1 burned candle left, which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. That makes sense.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Initial 6 candles: 6 hours. Then 6 / 3 = 2 new. Use them, +2 hours. Now, 2 burned. But 2 < 3, so can't make more. Wait but the sample output is 8. Wait 6 + 2 = 8? Oh right. Wait, but then why is the output 8? Oh because 6 initial gives 6 hours. Then 6 /3 = 2 new. Those burn for 2 hours. Then those 2 are burned. But 2 is less than 3, so no more. So total 6 + 2 = 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of burned candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how do we model this?\n\nThe way to model this is:\n\n- Start with a candles. Each time you burn them, you add the number of candles to the total hours. Then, collect the burned ones, and see how many new candles you can make. Then repeat the process with the new candles.\n\nBut how to track the burned ones? Let's think of it as:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nburned_candles = 0\n\nWait, perhaps not. Alternatively, each time you use the current candles, you add their count to the total hours, and then collect them as burned. Then, you can make new candles from the burned ones.\n\nWait, here's a possible algorithm:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nburned_candles = 0\n\nWhile current_candles > 0:\n\n    total_hours += current_candles\n\n    burned_candles += current_candles\n\n    new_candles = burned_candles // b\n\n    current_candles = new_candles\n\n    burned_candles = burned_candles % b\n\nWait, but this might not be correct. Because after making new candles, the burned_candles would be the remainder. Let's see.\n\nLet me try with the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\nInitial current_candles =4, burned=0.\n\nLoop:\n\ntotal +=4 → 4. burned becomes 4. new_candles =4//2=2. current_candles is now 2. burned is 0 (since 4%2=0).\n\nNext loop:\n\ntotal +=2 → 6. burned becomes 2. new_candles=2//2=1. current is 1. burned is 0.\n\nNext loop:\n\ntotal +=1 →7. burned becomes 1. new_candles=1//2=0. current is 0. So loop ends.\n\nYes, that gives 7. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\nFirst iteration: current=6. total becomes 6. burned=6. new_candles=6//3=2. current is 2. burned is 0.\n\nSecond iteration: add 2 to total (now 8). burned is 2. new_candles=2//3=0. current is 0. So loop ends. So total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial total is 5. burned is 5. new_candles is 1. Then current is 1. Add 1 to total (total 6). burned is 1. Then new_candles is 0. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. First iteration: add 3 → total 3. burned is 3. new_c",
