And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. For each consecutive k-day period, I need to compute the average and then find the overall average of all those averages.\n\nHmm. Wait, the problem says that the answer is the sum of all the weeks' averages divided by the number of weeks. Or wait, no. Wait, the note says that for the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Oh right, because each week's average is (sum of k days) /k. Then the overall average is the sum of all those averages divided by the number of weeks. But that's equivalent to (sum of all the k-day sums) divided by (number of weeks * k). Wait, because each week's average is (sum)/k. So when you take the average of all those averages, it's (sum of (sum_i)/k ) / m, where m is the number of weeks. Which equals (total_sum) / (m *k ). But the total_sum is the sum of all the k-day periods. \n\nBut how do I compute that efficiently?\n\nThe straightforward approach would be to compute the sum for each consecutive k days, add them all up, then divide by (number of weeks * k). But for large n (up to 2e5), a naive approach would be O(nk), which would be 4e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need an efficient way to compute the sum of all the consecutive k-day periods. Oh right! Sliding window technique. Let's think about that.\n\nLet me first compute the sum of the first k elements. Then for each next window, subtract the element that's leaving the window and add the new element. That way, each sum is computed in O(1) time after the initial sum, leading to O(n) time overall.\n\nYes. So steps:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Add this sum to a total_sum variable.\n3. Then for each i from k to n-1:\n   a. Subtract a[i -k] from the current sum.\n   b. Add a[i] to the current sum.\n   c. Add this new sum to total_sum.\n4. Once all sums are accumulated, the total_sum is the sum of all the k-day periods. Then the average is total_sum divided by (number of weeks * k). Wait, no. Because each week's average is sum/k, and the overall average is the average of all those averages. Which is (sum of all the averages) / m, where m is the number of weeks. But sum of averages is (sum of each week's sum)/k. So overall average is (total_sum / k) / m. Which equals total_sum/(k*m). But m is (n -k +1). So the final answer is total_sum / (k * (n -k +1)).\n\nWait, but the problem says that the output is the average of all the weeks. So for each week, we compute the average (sum of k days divided by k), then take the average of all those values. So the total is (sum of all week sums) divided by (k * m), where m is the number of weeks. Because each week contributes sum_i /k, and there are m weeks. So adding them all gives (sum_i) /k. Then dividing by m gives (sum_i)/(k*m).\n\nSo yes, the formula is total_sum / (k * m), where m = n -k +1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCalculate the total_sum of all the sliding window sums. Then divide by (k * m) where m is the number of weeks.\n\nNow, how to compute the total_sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the sample input.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput is 3 2, and array [3,4,7]. The weeks are [3,4] (sum 7) and [4,7] (sum 11). Total_sum is 7 +11=18. m is 2. So answer is 18/(2*2) = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.000... Wait wait wait. Wait the sample output for the first input is 9.000... Wait what? Let me check the example again.\n\nWait the first example says that for input 3 2 and a=[3,4,7], the result is 9.000... Wait that can't be right. Wait the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the problem says: the answer is the average of all the weeks. So for each week, compute the average (sum of the week's days divided by k), and then take the average of all those averages.\n\nIn the first example, the two weeks are [3,4] with average 3.5 and [4,7] with average 5.5. The average of those two is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2=4.5. But the sample output says '9.0000000000'. Wait that's impossible. Wait wait the sample input given in the first example is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', ...]\n\nSample Output:\n\n['9.0000000000', ...]\n\nWait that can't be. Wait maybe I made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Wait let me check the third example.\n\nThird example input is 8 2, array [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]. So n=8, k=2. So there are 8-2+1=7 weeks. The sum of all weeks is:\n\nsum of each consecutive pair:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nTotal sum is 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = ?\n\nBut the sample output is 28964.2857142857. Let's see: the total sum of all the weeks is 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = let's compute:\n\n3+6=9; 9+100004=100013; +100123 = 200136; +579 = 200715; +1245=201960; +790=202750. Then divide by 7*2? Because the average of averages would be total_sum/(k * m) ?\n\nWait in the third example, the answer is 202750/(2*7) = 202750/(14) = 14482.142857... But the sample output is 28964.2857... which is exactly double that. So clearly I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait what's the sample output for the third example? The output is 28964.2857142857. Let me compute that value. 28964.2857... equals 202750 / 7. So that's 202750 divided by 7. Which would be the total_sum divided by m (the number of weeks), not divided by k*m. So that suggests that the problem is not taking the average of the averages, but the average of the sums. Which would be total_sum divided by m.\n\nBut that contradicts the problem statement. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is ...\".\n\nWait the example in the problem statement says that for this case, the result is 9.0. Let's see.\n\nIf the example's result is 9.0, then what's that?\n\nThe weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their averages are 3.5 and 5.5. The average of these is 4.5. But the sample output says 9.0. So that's conflicting. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait perhaps the problem is not asking for the average of the averages, but the average of the sums. Because for the first example, the sum of the two weeks is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by 2 weeks gives 9. Which matches the sample output. So that's the correct approach.\n\nBut why does the problem statement say that the answer is the average of the averages? Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the example is not given, but according to the sample input, the first input is 3 2 and array [3,4,7], and the output is 9.0. Which is the sum of the two weeks (7+11=18) divided by 2 weeks. So the problem is to compute the average of the sums of the weeks. Not the average of the averages.\n\nSo why does the problem statement say \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\"?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem statement is ambiguous. But according to the sample input, the answer is the average of the sums. Which would be the sum of all the weeks' total sleep times divided by the number of weeks. Which is different from the average of the averages.\n\nSo for the first example, the average is (7+11)/2 = 9. Which is the sample output.\n\nBut then why the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Which is exactly the same as the average of the sums. So the problem requires us to compute the average of the sums of each week. So the answer is (sum of all week sums) divided by the number of weeks.\n\nSo the initial approach was wrong. The correct formula is total_sum / m, where m is the number of weeks.\n\nSo the confusion came from the problem description. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"the average amount of hours of sleep per week. [...] For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is .\"\n\nBut in that example, the average is (3+4)/2 = 3.5 for the first week, (4+7)/2 = 5.5 for the second. The average of those two is 4.5. But the sample output for the first input is 9.0. So that suggests that the problem is not asking for the average of the averages, but the average of the sums. Which would be (7 + 11)/2 = 9.0.\n\nSo the problem statement must have a mistake in the explanation, or perhaps I misread it.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". So for each week, the average is (sum of hours) /k. But Polycarp wants the average of all those averages. But according to the sample, that's not the case.\n\nBut the sample shows that the answer is the average of the sums, not the average of the averages. So why?\n\nLet me look at the sample input and output again.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output:\n\n9.0000000000\n\nWhich is the average of the sums of the weeks. The sum of the weeks is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by 2 weeks gives 9. So that's the output.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the average should be the average of the averages. Which would be (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 4.5. So why is the sample output 9?\n\nThis suggests that the problem statement is actually asking for the average of the sums, not the average of the averages. Which is confusing. But the sample indicates that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a typo, and the actual required output is the average of the sums. Because the sample shows that.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the sum of all the weeks' total sleep time (sum of each k-day period) and then divide by the number of weeks. Which is m = n -k +1.\n\nSo for the first sample, the answer is (7 + 11)/2 = 9. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the averages. Which is a bit counterintuitive. But according to the sample, that's what we need.\n\nSo the initial misunderstanding was because of the problem statement's wording. But the sample clarifies it.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to compute the sum of all the consecutive k-day periods, then divide by the number of such periods (m = n -k +1).\n\nSo the formula is total_sum / m.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n- Compute the sum of all consecutive k-day periods.\n\n- Divide that total by m (number of weeks) to get the average.\n\nSo the problem becomes easier. Now, the task is to compute the sum of all sliding windows of size k, then divide by m.\n\nNow, how to compute that sum efficiently.\n\nThe sliding window approach is the way to go. Let me think.\n\nFor example, for the first sample:\n\nInitial sum is 3 +4 =7. Then next sum is 4+7=11. Total is 18. Divided by 2 gives 9.\n\nSo the code needs to compute this sum.\n\nNow, the sliding window approach:\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements. Then for each next window, subtract the element that's leaving (a[i -k]) and add the new element (a[i]). Each step adds the current sum to the total_sum.\n\nSo for the first window, sum is initial_sum. Then for each next window, we compute the sum in O(1) time.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the array a.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nIf m is zero? No, since k <=n.\n\nCompute initial_sum as sum(a[0..k-1]).\n\ntotal_sum = initial_sum.\n\nThen, for i in range(k, n):\n\n   current_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n\n   total_sum += current_sum\n\nThen, the answer is total_sum / m.\n\nYes. And that's O(n) time.\n\nNow, for the sample input 3 2, the initial_sum is 3+4=7. Then i=2 (since k=2, n=3, i ranges from 2 to 2 (since n=3, indexes 0,1,2). So for i=2:\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 - a[0] (3) + a[2] (7) = 7-3+7= 11. total_sum becomes 7+11=18. Then divide by m=2: 18/2=9. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input 1 1, array [10]. Then m = 1-1+1=1. initial_sum is 10. total_sum is 10. answer is 10/1=10. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: input 8 2, array [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]. The total_sum is sum of all consecutive pairs. Let's compute that:\n\nThe sum of each pair:\n\n1+2 =3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nTotal sum is 3 +6 +100004 +100123 +579 +1245 +790 = let's compute:\n\n3+6 =9; +100004 = 100013; +100123 = 200136; +579 = 200715; +1245= 201960; +790= 202750.\n\nDivide by m=7: 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample output. So this approach is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to implement this.\n\nNow, in Python, for large n (up to 2e5), we need to read the input efficiently.\n\nBut for Python, even with 2e5 elements, it's manageable.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and k from input. Then read the array.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nCompute initial_sum as sum of first k elements.\n\ntotal_sum = initial_sum.\n\nThen for i in range(k, n):\n\n   current_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n\n   total_sum += current_sum\n\nThen, answer is total_sum / m.\n\nBut in Python, the array is 0-based.\n\nBut for the first part, sum(a[0:k]).\n\nBut for large k, say 2e5, sum(a[0:k]) could take O(k) time. Which is acceptable since the total time is O(n).\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n, k.\n\na = list of integers.\n\nif k ==0? Well, constraints say 1<=k<=n.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\nresult = total_sum / m\n\nThen print with enough decimal digits.\n\nBut how to handle the output formatting?\n\nThe problem says that the output should have at least 6 digits after the decimal point. So in Python, we can format the output as a float with 10 decimal digits, for example.\n\nFor example, in the first sample, the output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSo in Python, print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result)) would suffice.\n\nBut we need to make sure that even when the division is exact, like 9.0, it is printed with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, let's test the code with the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\ncurrent_sum = 3+4=7.\n\ntotal_sum =7.\n\ni=2 (k=2, n=3, so i runs from 2 to 2 (inclusive)).\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 - a[0] (3) + a[2] (7) = 7-3+7=11. total_sum becomes 7+11=18. m=2. 18/2=9.0. Output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=1, k=1. a=[10]. m=1. current_sum is 10. total_sum is 10. 10/1=10.0.\n\nSample 3:\n\nAs discussed, the result is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich is what the sample expects.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where k =n. Then m=1. The total_sum is sum(a), divided by 1. So the answer is sum(a)/1 = sum(a).\n\nAnother case: n=2, k=2. Then m=1. sum is a[0]+a[1], divided by 1.\n\nAnother case: n=4, k=2. a = [1,2,3,4]. The weeks are [1,2], [2,3], [3,4]. total_sum is 3 +5 +7 = 15. m=3. 15/3=5.0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code implementation in Python.\n\nBut for very large n (like 2e5), the code must be efficient.\n\nIn Python, the sum(a[:k]) can be done with a loop, but for large k, it's O(k) time. But since the code is O(n) overall, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nRead input:\n\nThe input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait the sample input shows that the input is given as multiple lines, but in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. Wait the sample input given in the problem is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nBut that seems to be three test cases. However, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. Wait the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo, the sample input seems to be three separate test cases. But in the problem statement, perhaps the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe original problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input is two lines. So perhaps the sample input is formatted as multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects a single test case.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line has n and k, the second line has the array.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided three test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem statement says nothing about that. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem's sample input.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\nSo the input is for one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. For example, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects to process a single test case.\n\nBut the original problem's sample input and output shows that for the first input, the output is '9.0000000000', etc. So perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases. But how to process that?\n\nWait the user's problem statement says that the input is given as two lines. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem description. For example, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual program is supposed to read one test case.\n\nBut the original problem's sample input may have been presented in a way that is not standard. For example, perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the actual code should read one test case. However, the original problem's sample input may have been formatted incorrectly.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nOutput:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of two lines. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again, perhaps the sample input is not the actual input but a list of examples. For example, the first example is input 3 2 and array [3,4,7], and output is 9.0... The second example is input 1 1 and array [10], output 10.0... The third example is input 8 2 and array [1,2,4,...], output 28964.2857...\n\nBut the way the sample input is written is as a list of strings, each representing a test case. So perhaps the problem is expecting to read multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description says that the input is two lines. So this is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original statement, perhaps the sample input is just an example of multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the user's instruction says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. How is the input formatted? According to the problem statement's input description, the input is two lines. So the code should read two lines.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three test cases. Which suggests that perhaps the problem expects to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not mention this. This is a contradiction.\n\nBut perhaps the sample input is a mistake. For example, in the problem statement, the sample input may have been presented as three separate test cases, but the actual problem expects to process a single test case. So the code should read two lines: first line n and k, second line the array.\n\nThus, the code should read from stdin, which for the first test case would be:\n\nn and k on the first line, and the array on the second line.\n\nSo the code should read two lines, split them, process, and output the result.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should process one test case. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that is not standard. For example, the sample input may be for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects only one.\n\nBut the original problem's sample input may be a mistake, and the actual code should process one test case.\n\nSo the code should read two lines. Let me proceed under that assumption.\n\nThus, the code will read n and k from the first line, then the array from the second line.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the input has multiple test cases? For example, in the sample input given in the problem statement, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k, and the second line contains the array. So the code should process one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting to read multiple test cases, but the input description is incorrect. However, given the ambiguity, I need to look at the problem's sample input and output.\n\nLooking at the sample input and output, the first input line for the first test case is \"3 2\\n3 4 7\", which would be two lines: first line is 3 2, second line is 3 4 7.\n\nSimilarly for the other test cases. Thus, the code should process multiple test cases. But how many?\n\nThe problem's original statement says nothing about multiple test cases. But the sample input shows that. So perhaps the problem is expecting to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description says that the input is two lines. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original statement again, perhaps the sample input is not part of the problem's input description. The problem's input is two lines, and the sample input is given as three examples. But the code should process one test case.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that the code should read input from stdin. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. But how to know?\n\nLooking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three test cases. The sample output is a list of three outputs. So the code should read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, the input is read via input() or sys.stdin. So perhaps the code should read all lines and process each test case.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k, and the second line contains the array. So the code should read two lines per test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases, which implies that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original statement may have a mistake here.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output show multiple test cases, the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to determine how many test cases there are? For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the number of test cases is given in the first line. But the problem statement says nothing about that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut given the confusion, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases until EOF. For example, in programming competitions, sometimes the code is expected to handle multiple test cases, but the problem statement may not mention it. However, given the sample input and output, it's likely that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? Let's think about the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of strings. For example, the first test case's input is '3 2\\n3 4 7', which is two lines. The second is '1 1\\n10', which is two lines. Third is '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'.\n\nSo the code should read each test case as two lines. But how to read them in Python?\n\nThe code can read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of two lines, and process each group.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nIn Python, the standard way is to read all input at once, split into lines, and process them.\n\nSo for example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nThen process the lines in pairs: first line is n and k, second line is the array.\n\nBut how many test cases are there? It depends on the input. For example, if the number of lines is even, then each pair is a test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are 3 test cases, each with two lines, so 6 lines total.\n\nSo the code can process the lines in pairs.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n and k from lines[idx]\n\n        n, k = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        # process this test case\n\n        # compute the answer and print\n\nSo this would handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the input is two lines. So perhaps the problem expects to process a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, the code must handle multiple test cases. Otherwise, the sample input would not make sense.\n\nSo the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement may have a mistake here. However, given that the sample input has three test cases, and the output has three corresponding answers, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement the logic for each test case, as discussed earlier.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead lines as above.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nn, k = ...\n\na = list of integers.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\ncurrent_sum = sum of first k elements.\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum.\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\nans = total_sum / m\n\nprint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut for very large n (like 2e5), the sum of the first k elements can be computed with sum(a[:k]). However, in Python, list slicing and summing is O(k) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, and multiple test cases, it's manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the sample input, for the third test case, the array is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1], which is 8 elements. So n=8, k=2.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n and k\n\n        if idx >= len(lines):\n\n            break\n\n        line = lines[idx].strip()\n\n        if not line:\n\n            idx +=1\n\n            continue\n\n        n, k = map(int, line.split())\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        if idx >= len(lines):\n\n            a = []\n\n        else:\n\n            a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        # Process\n\n        m = n - k +1\n\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\n        total_sum = current_sum\n\n        for i in range(k, n):\n\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n\n            total_sum += current_sum\n\n        ans = total_sum / m\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(ans))\n\nBut what if the input has empty lines? Well, the code skips them.\n\nBut for the problem's input, each test case is two lines. So the code should work.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output: 9.0000000000\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nSample Output: 10.0000000000\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSample Output: 28964.2857142857\n\nWhich is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should handle these cases.\n\nBut what about when k=0? Well, the constraints say 1 ≤k ≤n.\n\nNow, code is ready.\n\nBut in Python, when the sum is very large, but the division is handled as floating point. However, since Python uses double-precision floats, which have about 15-17 decimal digits of precision, the required 1e-6 precision is achievable.\n\nNow, for the third sample, the code computes 202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714..., which when printed with 10 decimal digits is 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of `k` days from a given list of `n` days. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of each consecutive `k`-day period and then finding the average of these sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case has two lines: the first line contains integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (number of days in a week), and the second line contains `n` integers representing the sleep times for each day.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: To efficiently compute the sum of each consecutive `k`-day period, we use a sliding window approach. This allows us to compute each window sum in constant time after the initial sum of the first `k` elements.\n3. **Total Sum Calculation**: By maintaining a running total of all window sums, we can compute the total sum of all consecutive `k`-day periods.\n4. **Average Calculation**: The final result for each test case is obtained by dividing the total sum of all window sums by the number of such windows, which is `n - k + 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Read n and k\n        if idx >= len(lines):\n            break\n        line = lines[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, k = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        if idx >= len(lines):\n            a = []\n        else:\n            a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        \n        m = n - k + 1\n        if m == 0:\n            print(\"0.0000000000\")\n            continue\n        \n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        \n        for i in range(k, n):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i - k] + a[i]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        \n        ans = total_sum / m\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(ans))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for easier processing. Each test case is processed in a loop.\n2. **Sliding Window Calculation**: The initial sum of the first `k` elements is computed. For each subsequent window, the sum is updated by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n3. **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all window sums is accumulated and then divided by the number of windows (`m`) to get the average sleep time over all weeks. The result is formatted to ensure at least 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach ensures an efficient solution with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, making it suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.",
