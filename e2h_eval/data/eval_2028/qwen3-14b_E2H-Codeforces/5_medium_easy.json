Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Hmm. The problem says that there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color, which can be a letter or a question mark. The goal is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of a left and a right boot with compatible colors. And then output those pairs.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to figure out is how to maximize the number of pairs. Let's think about the compatibility rules. Two colors are compatible if they are the same (if both are specific), or if one is a question mark. So, for example, a '?' can pair with any other color, including another '?'. But two specific colors must match exactly.\n\nThe challenge is to pair as many as possible, considering that each boot can be used once. How do I approach this?\n\nLet me think of possible steps:\n\n1. First, try to pair the specific colors. For example, if there's a left boot with color 'a', we can look for a right boot with 'a' that hasn't been paired yet. But since there could be multiple such pairs, maybe we need to count how many of each color there are on both sides.\n\nBut wait, but also there are the question marks. So perhaps the approach is to first pair specific colors with each other, then use the question marks to cover the remaining ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can process the pairs in a way that maximizes the matches. Let me think of the following steps:\n\n- For each color (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots and right boots. For each color c, the maximum possible pairs between left and right is the minimum of left_count[c] and right_count[c]. Then, after pairing these, we can handle the remaining boots (those that couldn't be matched with their specific color) using the question marks.\n\nWait, but the question marks can be used to pair with any. So perhaps:\n\nFirst, pair all the specific colors. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which are either '?' or have colors that couldn't be matched), pair them using the '?'.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose after pairing all specific colors, there are some left boots with color 'a' that couldn't be paired because there were no right 'a's. Similarly, some right boots with color 'b' that couldn't be paired. Also, there are some '?'s on both sides.\n\nBut the '?' can pair with any. So perhaps the next step is to pair the remaining left and right boots using the '?'.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the process:\n\n1. Count the number of left and right boots for each color (excluding '?'). For each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_c, right_c). We can pair those. Then, subtract those counts from left and right.\n\nBut wait, for example, if left has 3 'a's and right has 2 'a's, we can pair 2 of them. Then, the left has 1 'a' left, and the right has 0 'a's. Those left 'a's would need to be paired with something else, like a '?' on the right.\n\nBut how to track which boots are available for pairing?\n\nWait, but the problem requires not only the count but also the actual indices of the pairs. So perhaps we need to collect the positions of each color in both left and right strings.\n\nSo here's an approach:\n\n- For each color (including '?'), collect the list of indices (positions) where they appear in the left and right strings.\n\nThen:\n\nStep 1: Pair specific colors.\n\nFor each color c (not '?'):\n\n- Take the left indices of c and right indices of c. Pair them up as much as possible. For example, if there are m left and k right, take min(m, k) pairs.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, for color 'a', we can take the first min(left_a_count, right_a_count) elements from left and right lists and pair them. Then, remove those from the lists.\n\nBut then, after that, the remaining left and right boots (for color c) can be considered as unpaired and need to be handled later.\n\nBut how to manage this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can first process all the non-? colors and pair them as much as possible, then use the ? to pair with the remaining.\n\nBut the problem is that the ? can be used in two ways: as a left or right boot. For example, a left ? can pair with any right boot (including ?), and a right ? can pair with any left boot (including ?).\n\nSo perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Pair all specific colors. For each color c (not ?), pair as many left c with right c as possible. Then, for the remaining left and right boots, which are either ? or have colors that couldn't be paired with their counterparts.\n\n2. Then, pair the remaining left ? with the remaining right boots (any color, including ?), and vice versa.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nWait, but the remaining left and right boots may have some specific colors that couldn't be paired. For example, if there are some left boots with color 'a' and some right boots with color 'b', but none of them can be paired with each other. However, the left 'a's can be paired with right ? and vice versa.\n\nSo, after pairing the specific colors, the remaining left and right boots can be grouped into:\n\nLeft_remaining: left boots that are either ? or have a color that has no corresponding right boots (after step 1).\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nNow, the idea is to pair as many as possible between left_remaining and right_remaining, using the ?.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Let's collect all the left boots that are not yet paired. Let's call them L. Similarly, R for right boots.\n\nEach element in L can be either a specific color or ?, same for R.\n\nWe need to pair each left in L with a right in R, such that their colors are compatible.\n\nSo, how to maximize the number of pairs here?\n\nThis seems like a bipartite matching problem, but with a large n (up to 150,000). So we can't use standard algorithms like Hungarian for that.\n\nBut perhaps there's a greedy approach here.\n\nLet me think again. For the remaining left and right boots, we can first pair the left ? with the right ?. Then, pair left ? with right specific colors, and right ? with left specific colors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to pair as follows:\n\n- Pair left ? with right specific colors (but only if they are not already paired). Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for the remaining L and R, we can:\n\n- For each left boot that is a specific color, we can pair it with a right boot that is a ?.\n\n- Similarly, for each right boot that is a specific color, pair it with a left boot that is a ?.\n\n- Then, pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nAfter step 1 (pairing specific colors):\n\nWe have:\n\nleft_unpaired: list of left boots not yet paired. Each has color either ? or some specific color.\n\nright_unpaired: same for right.\n\nNow, we can collect:\n\nleft_question = number of left ? in left_unpaired.\n\nright_question = number of right ? in right_unpaired.\n\nAlso, for the left_unpaired, the specific colors are those that couldn't be paired with their respective right colors. So for example, left has some 'a's, and right has no 'a's left.\n\nSo for the left_unpaired and right_unpaired, we need to pair as follows:\n\nFor each left specific color (say, 'c'), we can pair it with any right ?.\n\nSimilarly, for each right specific color (say, 'd'), we can pair it with any left ?.\n\nThen, the remaining ?s can be paired between left and right.\n\nSo, the total possible pairs here would be:\n\nmin( (number of left specific colors) + (number of right specific colors), ... )\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nLet's compute the number of left specific (non-?) boots in left_unpaired: left_spec = len(left_unpaired) - left_question.\n\nSimilarly, right_spec = len(right_unpaired) - right_question.\n\nWe can pair left_spec with right_question, and right_spec with left_question. But how?\n\nWait, for example, suppose there are x left_spec (specific) and y right_question (question marks). Then, we can pair min(x, y) pairs by pairing left_spec with right_question.\n\nSimilarly, for the remaining right_spec and left_question, we can pair min(remaining_right_spec, left_question).\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of pairs here is (left_spec + right_spec) + min( (left_question + right_question) - (left_spec + right_spec) ) ?\n\nNo, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nThe total number of pairs possible here is the sum of:\n\n- All left_spec can be paired with right_question.\n\n- All right_spec can be paired with left_question.\n\n- The remaining (left_question - used_left_question) and (right_question - used_right_question) can be paired between themselves.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think:\n\nLet's say:\n\nleft_spec = number of left non-? in left_unpaired.\n\nright_spec = number of right non-? in right_unpaired.\n\nleft_q = left_question.\n\nright_q = right_question.\n\nWe can pair as follows:\n\nTake as many as possible from left_spec and right_q. So, take min(left_spec, right_q) pairs. Let's say we take a = min(left_spec, right_q). Then, subtract a from left_spec and right_q.\n\nThen, take as many as possible from right_spec and left_q. Take b = min(right_spec, left_q). Subtract b from right_spec and left_q.\n\nThen, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as min(left_q, right_q). Because each ? can pair with another ?.\n\nSo the total pairs here would be a + b + min(left_q, right_q).\n\nBut how does that work?\n\nYes, because:\n\n- The first part pairs left_spec with right_q.\n\n- The second part pairs right_spec with left_q.\n\n- The third part pairs the remaining q's.\n\nBut what is the order of these steps? For example, maybe pairing left_spec with right_q first is better than pairing right_spec with left_q first. But since the order doesn't affect the total, perhaps it's okay.\n\nSo, the maximum possible pairs in this phase is (left_spec + right_spec) + min( (left_q + right_q) - (left_spec + right_spec) ), but that might not be correct. Wait, no. Because left_spec + right_spec can be more than the sum of the possible pairs. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose left_spec is 3, right_q is 2. Then, a = 2. Then, left_spec becomes 1. Then, right_spec is 0, left_q is 5. Then, b is 0. Then, remaining left_q is 5, right_q is 0. So min(5,0)=0. So total pairs is 2+0+0=2. But maybe there's a better way. But in this case, there's nothing else to do.\n\nAnother example: left_spec is 3, right_spec is 4, left_q is 2, right_q is 3.\n\nFirst, pair left_spec (3) with right_q (3) â†’ a=3. Now left_spec is 0, right_q is 0. Then pair right_spec (4) with left_q (2) â†’ b=2. Now, right_spec is 2, left_q is 0. Then, remaining q's are 0 and 0. So total pairs is 3+2=5. But the total possible is 3+2 + min(0, 0) = 5. Alternatively, if we had done the steps in reverse: pair right_spec with left_q first. So, pair 2 of right_spec (4) with left_q (2). Then, left_spec (3) with right_q (3) â†’ same result.\n\nSo regardless of the order, the total is the same. Thus, the formula is correct.\n\nThus, the maximum possible pairs in this phase is a + b + c, where a is min(left_spec, right_q), b is min(right_spec, left_q), and c is min( (left_q - b) , (right_q - a) )) ?\n\nWait, no. After a and b steps, the remaining q's are (left_q - b) and (right_q - a). Wait, no:\n\nOriginal left_q is L, right_q is R.\n\nAfter a = min(left_spec, R) â†’ subtract a from left_spec and R.\n\nThen, b = min(right_spec, L) â†’ subtract b from right_spec and L.\n\nThen, remaining left_q is L - b, remaining right_q is R - a.\n\nSo the remaining q's are (L - b) and (R - a). The number of pairs is min(L - b, R - a).\n\nBut since L is the original left_q (before step a and b?), no, let me re-express:\n\nOriginal variables:\n\nleft_spec = S_L\n\nright_spec = S_R\n\nleft_q = Q_L\n\nright_q = Q_R\n\nStep 1: a = min(S_L, Q_R). Then, S_L -= a; Q_R -= a.\n\nStep 2: b = min(S_R, Q_L). Then, S_R -= b; Q_L -= b.\n\nStep 3: c = min(Q_L, Q_R).\n\nTotal pairs: a + b + c.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible?\n\nSo, the maximum pairs possible here is a + b + c.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nBut how to get the actual pairs?\n\nBut the problem requires not just the count, but also the actual pairs. So, during this phase, we need to collect the pairs.\n\nSo, perhaps the plan is:\n\n- For the first step (pairing specific colors with ?s), collect the pairs between left specific and right ?.\n\n- Then, collect pairs between right specific and left ?.\n\n- Then, collect pairs between left ? and right ?.\n\nBut how to track which boots are available?\n\nBut for this, perhaps during the initial processing, we can collect lists for each color.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFirst, for each color (excluding ?), collect the indices of left and right boots. For example, left_counts is a dictionary where key is color, value is a list of indices (starting from 1?), and similarly for right_counts.\n\nThen, for each color c (not ?), we can pair as many as possible between left_counts[c] and right_counts[c], and record those pairs. Then, remove those from the left and right lists.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, if left_counts[c] has m elements, and right_counts[c] has k elements, then the number of pairs is min(m, k). So for each such pair, we can take the first min(m, k) elements from left and right, pair them, and remove them from the lists.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining elements in left_counts[c] and right_counts[c] are not paired yet, and will be considered in the next steps.\n\nBut then, after that, we have:\n\nFor left boots, the remaining are:\n\n- Those in left_counts[c] for all c (non-?), plus those in left_counts['?'].\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nBut perhaps, after that, we can collect all the left boots that are unpaired (i.e., their color is not ? and they couldn't be paired with their corresponding right color, or they are ?).\n\nSo, for the second phase:\n\nCollect all the left unpaired boots (those that are not yet paired) into a list called left_unpaired. Similarly for right_unpaired.\n\nThen, we can separate them into:\n\nleft_specific = [boot for boot in left_unpaired if boot's color is not ?]\n\nleft_question = [boot for boot in left_unpaired if boot's color is ?]\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nThen, for the left_specific and right_question, pair as many as possible.\n\nSame for right_specific and left_question.\n\nThen, pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut for the actual pairing, we need to track which boots are available. So perhaps during the first phase, when we process each color, we can track which boots are used.\n\nBut given that the input size is up to 150,000, we need an efficient way.\n\nSo, perhaps:\n\nWe can create for each color, a list of indices (positions) for left and right. Then, for each color (non-?), we pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, for color 'a', take the first min(len(left_a), len(right_a)) pairs. Then, for the left and right lists, we can keep track of how many have been used. For example, for left_a, we can have a pointer that starts at 0, and for each pair, we take the first elements and increment the pointer. But since we need to collect the actual pairs, perhaps we can do this:\n\nInitialize for left and right, for each color, a list of indices. Then, for each color c (non-?), pair the first min(len(left[c]), len(right[c])) pairs, and add them to the answer. Then, for the left and right lists, we can slice off the first min(...) elements. Or, perhaps, keep track of how many elements have been used for each color.\n\nBut for the purpose of code, perhaps it's easier to collect all the left and right indices for each color, and then for each color, pair as many as possible, and then collect the remaining.\n\nBut how to track which indices are used?\n\nAlternatively, we can create for each color, a list of indices for left and right. Then, for each color c (non-?), we can pair the first min(len(left[c]), len(right[c])) elements. Then, the left[c] and right[c] lists will have their elements after that.\n\nBut for example, if left[c] has 5 elements and right[c] has 3, then we can pair the first 3 elements from left[c] with the first 3 elements from right[c]. Then, the left[c] list will have 2 elements left, which are not paired. These will be part of the left_unpaired.\n\nSo, after processing all the non-? colors, the left_unpaired will be all the left boots that are either ? or have their color not matched with the right. Similarly for right_unpaired.\n\nOnce that is done, the next step is to process the left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\nSo, for that, we can collect all the left_unpaired and right_unpaired into lists. Let's call them left_list and right_list.\n\nThen, we can split them into specific and question marks.\n\nleft_specific = [boot for boot in left_list if boot.color != '?']\nleft_question = [boot for boot in left_list if boot.color == '?']\nSimilarly for right.\n\nThen, we can proceed to pair left_specific with right_question, and vice versa.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nLet me think of the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n, l, r.\n\nThen, for each color in l and r, collect the indices.\n\nFor example, for left boots:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft = defaultdict(list)\nfor i, c in enumerate(l):\n    left[c].append(i+1)  # since the output uses 1-based indices\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nThen, for each color c in left (excluding '?'):\n\nif c is not '?', and also present in right:\n\nthen, the number of pairs is min(len(left[c]), len(right[c])).\n\nWe can pair them, and add those pairs to the answer.\n\nThen, for the left[c], we can remove the first min(...) elements, and same for right[c].\n\nBut how to do that? For example, for color 'a', left_a has len 5, right_a has len 3. We pair the first 3 elements. So, for left_a, we can take the first 3 elements and pair them with the first 3 elements of right_a. Then, the left_a list will have the remaining 2 elements, which are not paired.\n\nBut for code, perhaps we can process each color c (non-?):\n\nfor c in left:\n    if c == '?':\n        continue\n    if c in right:\n        num_pairs = min(len(left[c]), len(right[c]))\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n            pair (left[c][i], right[c][i])\n        # Now, remove the first num_pairs elements from left[c] and right[c]\n        left[c] = left[c][num_pairs:]\n        right[c] = right[c][num_pairs:]\n\nWait, but this is not entirely correct. Because, for example, if the color is not present in the right, then right[c] is not present. So perhaps we need to check if the color exists in the right.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c in left (non-?), check if it exists in right. If yes, then pair as above.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to loop through all possible colors (a-z), and process them. Because the left and right may have some colors not present in the other.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nWe can create for left and right, a dictionary with all colors (including ?). Then, for each color in 'a' to 'z' (since the colors are lowercase letters), we can check if they are present in left and right.\n\nBut perhaps that's not needed. Let me think again.\n\nIn code:\n\nWe can iterate over all colors that are in left (excluding '?') and check if they are in right.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to loop through all possible colors (a-z), and for each, check if they are in left and right.\n\nBut for code efficiency, perhaps it's better to process all colors that are present in left or right.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nfor c in list(left.keys()):\n    if c == '?':\n        continue\n    if c in right:\n        # process pairing between left[c] and right[c]\n        num_pairs = min(len(left[c]), len(right[c]))\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n            ans.append( (left[c][i], right[c][i]) )\n        # remove the first num_pairs elements\n        left[c] = left[c][num_pairs:]\n        right[c] = right[c][num_pairs:]\n\nBut this would miss colors that are present in right but not in left. But since we're processing left's colors, that's okay. Because, for example, if right has color 'a' but left doesn't, then those right 'a's can't be paired with left 'a's, but they may be paired with left '?'s in the next steps.\n\nBut this code would process all colors in left (non-?), and pair them with right's same color.\n\nOnce this is done, the left and right dictionaries for non-? colors will have the remaining elements (those not paired in this step).\n\nNow, the next step is to collect all the left and right boots that are unpaired. For this, we can collect all the remaining elements in left and right, including those with '?'.\n\nSo, for left_unpaired, we can collect all the elements from left's lists (for all colors, including '?'), and similarly for right_unpaired.\n\nBut how to do that? For example:\n\nleft_unpaired = []\nfor color in left:\n    left_unpaired.extend( left[color] )\n\nSimilarly for right_unpaired.\n\nBut wait, after the first step, the left's color lists may have elements that are not paired. For example, left['a'] may have some elements left. So, for the left_unpaired, we can collect all the elements from all colors in left (including '?').\n\nOnce we have left_unpaired and right_unpaired, we can process them as follows:\n\nSeparate left_unpaired into left_specific and left_question.\n\nleft_specific = [ (i, c) for (i, c) in left_unpaired if c != '?' ]\nWait, but how to track the color of each boot in left_unpaired? Because the left_unpaired is built from the left's color lists. So, for example, for each color in left, the elements in left[color] are the indices of the left boots with that color.\n\nSo, perhaps, when building left_unpaired, we can collect tuples of (index, color). But perhaps it's easier to track the color for each index. However, since the left_unpaired is built from the left's color lists, the color is known.\n\nWait, no. The left_unpaired is built by collecting all the elements in left's color lists. For example, for color 'a', left['a'] contains the indices of left boots with color 'a'. So, when we collect left_unpaired, each element is an index (i+1?), and the color is known based on which color list it came from.\n\nBut perhaps during the initial processing, we can track the color of each boot. However, that would require storing for each index in left_unpaired its color. Which is possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the initial processing, when we collect the left_unpaired, we can generate a list of tuples (index, color). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after the initial pairing, the left_unpaired is the list of all the left boots that are not yet paired, and their color can be determined from their original string.\n\nWait, but the original l string is given. So, for any index in left_unpaired, the color is l[i-1], since the indices are 1-based.\n\nSo, for example, if a left boot's index is 5, then its color is l[4].\n\nSo, during the first phase, after pairing, the left_unpaired is the list of indices (from all left's color lists) that are not yet paired. Then, for each index in left_unpaired, we can look up its color in the original l string.\n\nSimilarly for the right_unpaired.\n\nSo, perhaps the code for left_unpaired and right_unpaired is:\n\nleft_unpaired = []\nfor color in left:\n    left_unpaired.extend(left[color])\n\nSimilarly for right_unpaired.\n\nBut then, for each index in left_unpaired, its color is l[index-1].\n\nSo, for the second phase, we can process these indices.\n\nSo, for the left_unpaired and right_unpaired:\n\nWe can collect all the left_unpaired indices and their colors, and same for right.\n\nThen, we can separate them into specific and ?.\n\nBut perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nleft_unpaired = []\nfor color in left:\n    left_unpaired.extend(left[color])\n\nright_unpaired = []\nfor color in right:\n    right_unpaired.extend(right[color])\n\nThen, for left_unpaired, we can create a list of tuples (index, color), where color is l[index-1], but since we have already processed the initial pairing, the color is known. However, during the initial processing, the left's color lists were built from the original l string. So, for example, the left's color lists are built by checking the original l string. So, the color for any index in left_unpaired is known based on which color list it was in. But perhaps that's not necessary. For example, the left_unpaired is built by collecting all the indices that were not paired in the first phase. Their color is the original color (as per l string).\n\nBut during the first phase, the left's color lists are built from the original l string. So, for example, left['a'] contains the indices of left boots with color 'a'.\n\nSo, when we collect left_unpaired, each index in left_unpaired has a color that is known. For example, if an index is in left['a'], then its color is 'a'.\n\nSo, for the second phase, we can process left_unpaired and right_unpaired as follows:\n\nCollect all left_unpaired indices and their color (from l), and same for right_unpaired.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWell, perhaps during the initial processing, we can track the color for each index. But that's redundant. Alternatively, during the second phase, for each index in left_unpaired, we can get its color from the original l string.\n\nBut given that the original l and r strings are stored, this is possible.\n\nSo, for the left_unpaired list, each index is from 1 to n. For each index, its color is l[index-1].\n\nSimilarly for the right_unpaired.\n\nNow, the second phase:\n\nWe need to pair as many as possible between left_unpaired and right_unpaired.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the approach is:\n\nPair left specific (non-?) with right ?.\n\nPair right specific (non-?) with left ?.\n\nPair remaining ? with ?.\n\nSo, how to do that?\n\nLet's collect:\n\nleft_specific = [ (i, l[i-1]) for i in left_unpaired if l[i-1] != '?' ]\n\nleft_question = [ (i, l[i-1]) for i in left_unpaired if l[i-1] == '?' ]\n\nSimilarly for right_specific and right_question.\n\nBut since the left_unpaired is a list of indices, and the color is known via l[i-1], this is manageable.\n\nOnce we have these lists, we can proceed.\n\nSo, for example, for left_specific and right_question:\n\nWe can take the first min(len(left_specific), len(right_question)) pairs. For each pair, take a left_specific element and a right_question element, and pair them.\n\nSimilarly for right_specific and left_question.\n\nThen, pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how to collect these pairs?\n\nLet me think of code steps:\n\nleft_spec = [i for i in left_unpaired if l[i-1] != '?']\nleft_q = [i for i in left_unpaired if l[i-1] == '?']\n\nright_spec = [i for i in right_unpaired if r[i-1] != '?']\nright_q = [i for i in right_unpaired if r[i-1] == '?']\n\nThen, for the first part:\n\nTake as many pairs between left_spec and right_q as possible.\n\nFor example, take min(len(left_spec), len(right_q)) pairs.\n\nSo, for i in range(min(len(left_spec), len(right_q))):\n\npair left_spec[i] with right_q[i]\n\nAdd these to the answer.\n\nThen, remove those elements from left_spec and right_q.\n\nSimilarly, for the next part:\n\nTake min(len(right_spec), len(left_q)) pairs between right_spec and left_q.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q as min(len(left_q), len(right_q)) pairs.\n\nBut how to collect the actual indices?\n\nBut since we have the left_spec and right_q lists, which are lists of indices, we can pair them as follows.\n\nFor example:\n\ncount = min(len(left_spec), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(count):\n    ans.append( (left_spec[i], right_q[i]) )\n\nSimilarly for the other parts.\n\nBut after that, the left_spec and right_q lists will have their elements removed (but in code, we can just take the first count elements and ignore them).\n\nBut for code, perhaps we can process these lists as follows:\n\nWe can create pointers for each list, and process the elements.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\n# Pair left_spec with right_q\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_spec), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    ans.append( (left_spec[i], right_q[i]) )\n\n# Now, the remaining left_spec is left_spec[num_pairs:], and right_q is right_q[num_pairs:]\n\n# Pair right_spec with left_q\nnum_pairs = min(len(right_spec), len(left_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    ans.append( (left_q[i], right_spec[i]) )\n\n# Now, the remaining left_q is left_q[num_pairs:], and right_spec is right_spec[num_pairs:]\n\n# Pair remaining q's\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    ans.append( (left_q[i], right_q[i]) )\n\nWait, but the order of the last step is important. For example, if left_q is [a, b, c], and right_q is [d, e], then the min is 2, so pair a with d, b with e.\n\nBut in code, the left_q and right_q are lists of indices. So, the code for the last step would be:\n\nremaining_left_q = left_q[num_pairs_prev:] (from previous steps)\nremaining_right_q = right_q[num_pairs_prev:]\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nActually, after the first two steps, the left_q and right_q are not modified. So perhaps, in code, after pairing left_spec with right_q, we can take the remaining elements in right_q as right_q[num_pairs:].\n\nBut perhaps the code should be:\n\nAfter pairing left_spec and right_q:\n\nleft_spec = left_spec[num_pairs:]\nright_q = right_q[num_pairs:]\n\nThen, pair right_spec and left_q:\n\nnum_pairs2 = min(len(right_spec), len(left_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs2):\n    ans.append( (left_q[i], right_spec[i]) )\n\nleft_q = left_q[num_pairs2:]\nright_spec = right_spec[num_pairs2:]\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nnum_pairs3 = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs3):\n    ans.append( (left_q[i], right_q[i]) )\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nBut since in Python, lists are mutable, perhaps we can create copies of the lists and modify them.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be:\n\n# Pair left_spec with right_q\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_spec), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    ans.append( (left_spec[i], right_q[i]) )\n# Remove these elements from the lists (but in code, we can just ignore them in the next steps)\nleft_spec = left_spec[num_pairs:]\nright_q = right_q[num_pairs:]\n\n# Pair right_spec with left_q\nnum_pairs = min(len(right_spec), len(left_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    ans.append( (left_q[i], right_spec[i]) )\nright_spec = right_spec[num_pairs:]\nleft_q = left_q[num_pairs:]\n\n# Pair remaining q's\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    ans.append( (left_q[i], right_q[i]) )\n\nBut how to get left_spec, right_spec, left_q, right_q?\n\nWait, in code, the left_spec is a list of indices from left_unpaired where their color is not '?'. Similarly for others.\n\nSo, during the code, after collecting left_unpaired and right_unpaired, we can create these lists.\n\nBut how to collect left_spec, left_q, etc.:\n\nleft_spec = []\nleft_q = []\nfor idx in left_unpaired:\n    if l[idx-1] != '?':\n        left_spec.append(idx)\n    else:\n        left_q.append(idx)\n\nSimilarly for right_spec and right_q:\n\nright_spec = []\nright_q = []\nfor idx in right_unpaired:\n    if r[idx-1] != '?':\n        right_spec.append(idx)\n    else:\n        right_q.append(idx)\n\nOnce these are created, the code proceeds as above.\n\nBut what about the order of the pairs? For example, in the first step, pairing left_spec with right_q. But the left_spec is a list of indices, and the right_q is a list of indices. So pairing the first elements of each list.\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid pairing, the order doesn't matter.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nThe code steps are:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left and right as defaultdict(list).\n\nFor each i in 0..n-1:\n\n    left[l[i]].append(i+1)\n    right[r[i]].append(i+1)\n\nProcess the first phase:\n\nans = []\n\nfor color in list(left.keys()):\n    if color == '?':\n        continue\n    if color in right:\n        num_pairs = min(len(left[color]), len(right[color]))\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n            ans.append( (left[color][i], right[color][i]) )\n        # trim the lists\n        left[color] = left[color][num_pairs:]\n        right[color] = right[color][num_pairs:]\n\nCollect left_unpaired and right_unpaired:\n\nleft_unpaired = []\nfor color in left:\n    left_unpaired.extend(left[color])\n\nright_unpaired = []\nfor color in right:\n    right_unpaired.extend(right[color])\n\nNow, process the second phase.\n\nCreate left_spec, left_q, right_spec, right_q:\n\nleft_spec = []\nleft_q = []\nfor idx in left_unpaired:\n    if l[idx-1] != '?':\n        left_spec.append(idx)\n    else:\n        left_q.append(idx)\n\nright_spec = []\nright_q = []\nfor idx in right_unpaired:\n    if r[idx-1] != '?':\n        right_spec.append(idx)\n    else:\n        right_q.append(idx)\n\nThen, process the three steps:\n\n# Step 1: left_spec with right_q\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_spec), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    ans.append( (left_spec[i], right_q[i]) )\nleft_spec = left_spec[num_pairs:]\nright_q = right_q[num_pairs:]\n\n# Step 2: right_spec with left_q\nnum_pairs = min(len(right_spec), len(left_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    ans.append( (left_q[i], right_spec[i]) )\nright_spec = right_spec[num_pairs:]\nleft_q = left_q[num_pairs:]\n\n# Step 3: pair remaining q's\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    ans.append( (left_q[i], right_q[i]) )\n\nFinally, output the length of ans, followed by the pairs.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when we process the first phase, the left and right dictionaries may have entries for '?', but those are not processed in that phase. However, during the collection of left_unpaired and right_unpaired, all entries in left and right (including '?') are included. So that's correct.\n\nBut let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. The compatibility rules are such that specific colors must match exactly, while a question mark ('?') can pair with any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Pairing of Specific Colors**: First, we pair left boots with specific colors with right boots of the same specific color. This is done by iterating through each color (excluding '?') and pairing as many as possible between the left and right boots.\n2. **Handling Remaining Boots**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining boots which might be either specific colors or question marks.
