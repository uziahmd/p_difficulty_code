The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm. Let me think about the parity here. Because if a_i is even and b_j is odd, their sum is odd. Similarly, if a_i is odd and b_j is even, their sum is also odd. So the key is to match even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. \n\nSo the approach should be to count how many even and odd numbers there are in the chests and keys. Then, for each even chest, we need an odd key. For each odd chest, we need an even key. \n\nBut since the number of keys might be limited, we need to take the minimum between the counts. Like, for example, if there are 5 even chests and 3 odd keys, then we can only open 3 of them. Similarly for the other way around.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n   Let's say even_chest = count of a_i even, odd_chest = count of a_i odd.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n   even_key = count of b_j even, odd_key = count of b_j odd.\n3. The maximum possible chests is the sum of min(even_chest, odd_key) and min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each even chest needs an odd key, so the maximum possible for that part is the minimum of even_chest and the number of odd keys. Similarly for the other part.\n\nYes. So that's the plan. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parity:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chest is 3 (14,6,2), odd_chest is 2 (9,11).\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Even keys: 8,4,20 (3), odd keys: 7 (1). \n\nSo min(3,1) is 1 (even_chest and odd_key). Then min(2,3) (odd_chest and even_key) is 2. Total 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example: \nChests are all even (2,4,6,8,10). So even_chest=5, odd_chest=0.\nKeys: 5 (odd). So odd_key=1, even_key=0. So min(5,1) is 1, and min(0,0) is 0. Total 1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are all even (20,30,40,50). So even_chest=1, odd_chest=0. Keys: even_key=4, odd_key=0. So min(1,0) is 0, and min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the approach seems solid.\n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the list of a_i, count even and odd.\n- Read the list of b_j, count even and odd.\n- Compute the sum of min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nBut wait, how to count even and odd? For each number in a list, check if it's even or odd. For example, for a_i, even_chest is the count of numbers where x % 2 == 0.\n\nSo in Python, for the a list:\n\neven_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\n\nSame for the keys.\n\nThen compute the sum as mentioned.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the a list, then the b list.\n\nCompute even_chest, odd_chest, even_key, odd_key.\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\nPrint result.\n\nYes. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]. even_chest is 3 (14,6,2). odd_chest is 2.\n\nb = [8,4,7,20]. even_key",
