Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about Leha choosing two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x, and they don't overlap. And we have to find the minimal total cost of such a pair. If it's not possible, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. Each voucher has li (departure day), ri (return day), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. So for two vouchers i and j, their durations must sum to x. Also, they must not overlap. Which means either the first ends before the second starts, or vice versa.\n\nThe challenge is to find all pairs of vouchers that satisfy these conditions and find the minimum sum of their costs.\n\nConstraints are n up to 2e5, which is big. So O(n^2) approaches are definitely out of the question. Need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for each voucher, we can calculate its duration. Let's say duration is d. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we need another voucher with duration x - d. And those two vouchers must not overlap.\n\nSo the idea is: for each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with duration (x - d), and that they don't overlap. Then take the minimum cost for such pairs.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the minimum cost for the other voucher?\n\nLet me think about grouping vouchers by their duration. For example, create a dictionary where key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by their start and end times. Or maybe for each duration, we can pre-process some data structures to quickly find the minimum cost for vouchers that end before a certain time, or start after a certain time.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, store a list of vouchers with that duration. Also, for each duration, sort the vouchers in a way that allows us to query for the minimum cost of vouchers that end before a certain day, or start after a certain day.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, suppose we have a voucher A with duration d, and we want to find a voucher B with duration (x - d) that does not overlap with A. So for voucher A, which has [li, ri], we need voucher B to have either rj < li (so B ends before A starts) or lj > ri (so B starts after A ends). \n\nSo for each voucher A (with duration d), we can look for vouchers B with duration (x - d) that end before li, or start after ri. For each of these cases, we need to find the minimum cost of such vouchers B.\n\nIf we can do this efficiently for each voucher, then we can compute the minimum total cost.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- Precompute for each duration d, a sorted list of vouchers (sorted by their end time, and also by their start time?), and for each possible end time, have the minimum cost up to that point.\n\nBut perhaps for each duration, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by their end time (ri), and for each entry, we can have a prefix min array. So that for a given li, we can find all vouchers B with end time < li, and get the minimum cost among them.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers sorted by their start time (li), we can have a prefix min array. So that for a given ri, we can find all vouchers B with start time > ri, and get the minimum cost.\n\nWait, but how to do that?\n\nFor example, for vouchers of duration (x - d), let's say we have a list sorted by their end time. For a given li, we need to find all vouchers B where ri < li. Since the list is sorted by end time, we can binary search for the largest end time less than li. All vouchers up to that index would be candidates. Then, the minimum cost in that subset can be found using a precomputed prefix min array.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case where B's start time is greater than A's end time. For that, we can have a sorted list of vouchers by their start time, and for a given ri, find the first voucher with start time > ri, and then take the minimum cost from that point onward.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor each possible duration d, we can have two data structures:\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by end time (ri), with a prefix min array for cost.\n- A sorted list of vouchers by start time (li), with a suffix min array for cost.\n\nBut how to build these?\n\nLet me think. For each duration, say, D, we collect all vouchers with that duration. Then, for each such group, we sort them by their end time (ri), and create a prefix min array. For example, for the list sorted by ri, the prefix min array will store the minimum cost from the beginning up to each index. Similarly, we sort the same vouchers by their start time (li), and create a suffix min array. For example, the suffix min array will store the minimum cost from that index to the end.\n\nThen, for a voucher A with duration d, and looking for vouchers B with duration (x - d):\n\nCase 1: B ends before A starts. So B's ri < A's li. For this, we can look into the group of vouchers with duration (x - d), sorted by end time. We can perform a binary search to find the largest ri that is less than A's li. Then, the minimum cost in the prefix up to that index is available.\n\nCase 2: B starts after A ends. So B's li > A's ri. For this, we can look into the group of vouchers with duration (x - d), sorted by start time. We can perform a binary search to find the first li that is greater than A's ri. Then, the suffix min array from that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nSo for each voucher A, we check both cases, and take the minimum possible cost from each case, if any. Then, the overall minimum is the minimum between all such possibilities.\n\nBut we need to handle the case where x - d is not present in the duration map. Also, we need to make sure that the voucher B is not the same as voucher A (but since we're considering all vouchers, even if there's only one voucher with that duration, but when d is such that x - d is same as d, but we need two different vouchers, but maybe that's handled by checking if there are at least two vouchers with that duration.)\n\nWait, but the problem says i != j. So for example, if a voucher has duration d, and x = 2d, then we need to find another voucher with duration d. But if there's only one such voucher, then it can't be used. So in our code, when processing vouchers, we need to ensure that when d is equal to (x - d), we have at least two vouchers with that duration.\n\nBut how to handle that? Well, when we process voucher A, and x - d is equal to d, then when looking for B, we need to find a voucher B with duration d, but not the same as A. However, in our approach, the data structures for duration d would include all vouchers with that duration, including A. So when we look for B in that group, we have to make sure that B is not A. However, since we are looking for the minimum cost, perhaps in that case, the minimum cost would be the minimum of all vouchers except A. But how to handle that?\n\nHmm. That complicates things. Because if the voucher A is part of the group for duration d, and when looking for B's in that group, we need to exclude A itself. However, if there are multiple vouchers in that group, then even if the minimum is A itself, there may be another voucher with the same duration. So perhaps during the processing, when we are checking for B's, we can find the minimum cost in the group, but if the group has only one voucher, then it's not allowed. But how to track that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let's think again.\n\nAlternative approach: for each voucher, we can consider it as the first voucher (the one with duration d), and look for a voucher with duration (x - d) that comes before it (ends before it starts) or comes after it (starts after it ends). But when processing, we need to make sure that the voucher B is not the same as voucher A.\n\nBut how to avoid that?\n\nWell, for example, when we have a voucher A with duration d, and we look for vouchers B with duration (x - d) that end before A's start. Suppose that the group for (x - d) has a voucher B which is the same as A. Well, in that case, the duration of A is d, and x - d is also d. So x must be 2d. But for that case, the voucher B would be the same as A. However, since the problem requires two distinct vouchers, we need to make sure that in such a case, there's at least another voucher in the group with duration d.\n\nBut how can we handle that in our code?\n\nPerhaps when we process a voucher A, and x - d is equal to d, then when looking for B's in the group of duration d, we need to find the minimum cost excluding A itself. However, that would require for each group, having a way to find the minimum cost in the group except for a specific element. But that seems computationally expensive if done naively.\n\nAlternatively, during preprocessing, for each duration, we can store two sorted lists: one sorted by end time, and one sorted by start time. Also, for each of these lists, we can have a prefix min array and a suffix min array. Then, when checking for a voucher A in the group, when we are looking for B's in the same group (i.e., when x - d = d), we can check if the group has at least two vouchers, and then find the minimum cost in the group excluding A. But how?\n\nBut this seems complex. Maybe there's a way to avoid this problem by considering that when x - d is equal to d, then during the processing of voucher A, we can check if there exists another voucher in the same group (duration d) that doesn't overlap with A.\n\nBut how to find that? For example, if voucher A is in the group of duration d, and we need another voucher B in the same group that ends before A's start or starts after A's end. But since B has the same duration as A, the only way they don't overlap is if B ends before A starts (so B's ri < A's li) or starts after A ends (B's li > A's ri). But since B is in the same group as A, which has duration d, then B's duration is same as A's.\n\nSo for voucher A, when x - d = d, then for each voucher A, we can check the group of duration d for vouchers that end before A's li, or start after A's ri. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nBut this seems like the same approach as before. So perhaps during the processing, when we are looking for B in the same group, we can use the same method as before, but in that case, we need to make sure that the voucher B is not the same as A.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? For example, suppose the group has multiple vouchers. When we find the minimum cost in the group for B's that end before A's li, perhaps the minimum is from another voucher, not A itself. However, if the minimum is A itself, then we can't choose it. But how to know that?\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe we can proceed under the assumption that when we find the minimum cost in the group, if that minimum is from the same voucher, then we need to check if there's another voucher in the group with the same duration. But how to track that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the initial grouping, for each duration, we can have all vouchers in the group, and when we are processing a voucher A, we can check whether the voucher B that is found in the group is different from A. However, this would require checking each candidate B.\n\nBut that would complicate the approach. Perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can proceed as follows: for each voucher A, we check both cases (B before and B after). For each case, we find the minimum cost of B's in the group. However, if the group contains only one voucher (which is A itself), then that case is invalid. Otherwise, if the group has multiple vouchers, then the minimum cost is the minimum of all B's in the group that meet the condition. But how to ensure that the B is not A?\n\nBut perhaps in practice, when we find the minimum in the group, even if it includes A, but there are other vouchers in the group, then there's a possibility that another voucher is the minimum. For example, if the group has multiple vouchers, and the minimum is A's cost, then there may be another voucher with the same cost. But if the group has only one voucher (A), then we can't take it. So during the processing, when the group is for duration (x - d), and if x - d == d, then we need to make sure that the group has at least two vouchers, and that the voucher B is not the same as A.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to handle it by allowing the same voucher to be considered, but then subtracting the case where it's the same voucher. However, this would complicate the code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the initial grouping, we can precompute for each duration, the minimum cost of vouchers that end before a certain time, and the minimum cost of vouchers that start after a certain time, but excluding the current voucher. But this seems computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can proceed as follows: for each voucher A, when looking for B's in the same duration (x - d = d), we can check whether the group has at least one voucher that meets the condition (either ends before A's li or starts after A's ri). If yes, then take the minimum cost among those vouchers. However, the problem is that the same voucher may be considered here, but if there are multiple vouchers, then there's a chance that another one is available.\n\nBut how can we handle that?\n\nMaybe the code can proceed by allowing the same voucher to be considered, but then in the end, when we find the minimum, we can check if there's at least two vouchers. However, this might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the initial grouping, for each duration, we can have a list of vouchers sorted by end time and start time, and for each of these sorted lists, we can have a prefix min array. Then, for each voucher A in the group, when we check for B's that end before A's li, we can find the min in the prefix, but subtract the cost if it's the same as A. However, this seems difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can proceed without worrying about the same voucher, and after processing all possibilities, check if the pair (A, B) is valid (i.e., i != j). But how to ensure that? For example, if the code finds that the minimum cost for B's is the same as A's cost, but there's another voucher with same cost, then that's okay. However, if there's only one voucher in the group, then it's invalid.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the code can proceed under the assumption that when x - d is equal to d, then the group has at least two vouchers. But that's not necessarily true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can allow the same voucher to be considered, but then when the pair is formed, it's invalid. However, since the code is trying to find the minimum, perhaps when the same voucher is considered, it would not contribute to the answer unless there's another voucher with the same duration. But how to check that?\n\nThis seems too error-prone. Maybe there's a better approach. Let me think again.\n\nAnother idea: for each voucher, when considering the two cases (B before and B after), we can process all vouchers B that are in the required duration and meet the non-overlapping condition, but not the same as A. However, how to do this efficiently?\n\nBut for that, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have two sorted lists (sorted by end time and start time), and for each of these lists, we can have a prefix min and suffix min array. Then, when we process voucher A, and for the same duration, we can check if the voucher B is different from A.\n\nBut how to check that? For example, suppose we have a voucher A in the group. When we find the minimum cost for vouchers B that end before A's li, we can check if the minimum is achieved by a voucher that is not A. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for the same duration group, when we are looking for vouchers B that end before A's li, we can find the minimum cost in the group (excluding A) that ends before A's li. However, how to do that?\n\nThis seems challenging. Maybe the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each voucher A:\n\n- Compute d = duration of A.\n\n- Check if (x - d) exists in the duration map. If not, skip.\n\n- For the target duration (x - d):\n\n   - If target duration is not equal to d:\n\n      - Then, for vouchers B in that target duration, we can find the minimum cost that ends before A's li (case 1) and the minimum cost that starts after A's ri (case 2). Since B's are from a different group, they cannot be the same as A.\n\n   - Else (target duration is d):\n\n      - Then, need to find vouchers B in the same group (d) that are not A, and either end before A's li or start after A's ri.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nIn this case, for the same group (d), when looking for vouchers B that end before A's li, we can find the minimum cost among all such B's, but excluding A. Similarly for the other case.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWell, for the same group, the sorted list of vouchers by end time. Suppose we have a list sorted by end time. For a given li, we can find all vouchers B in this list that end before li. Now, among these, we need to find the minimum cost, but not including A if it is in this subset.\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n- For the list of vouchers in the target duration (same as d), sorted by end time, and with a prefix min array.\n\n- Find the index where the end time is less than li. Let's say up to index k.\n\n- The prefix min up to k is the minimum cost in this range. However, if A is in this range (i.e., A's end time is <= li), then we need to check if the minimum is A's cost. If so, then we need to see if there's another voucher in the range with the same or lower cost.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps for the same group, when we are looking for B's that end before A's li, we can first check if the group has at least one voucher that ends before A's li, and is not A. If yes, then take the minimum. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have the list of vouchers sorted by end time, and also a prefix min array. Then, for a voucher A in the same group, when checking for B's that end before A's li, we can find the minimum in the prefix up to index k. If that minimum is achieved by A, then we need to check if there are other vouchers in the prefix with the same or lower cost. However, this would require knowing if the minimum is unique or not, which is not straightforward.\n\nThis seems too complicated. Maybe we can proceed with the initial approach, allowing for the possibility of considering A as B, and then later check if the pair (A, B) is valid. But since the code is trying to find the minimum, perhaps in such cases, the code would find a valid pair if there exists another voucher.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the initial processing, we can allow the same voucher to be considered, and then during the final answer calculation, we can check if the pair is valid (i.e., i != j). However, that would require storing the indices of the vouchers, which complicates the code.\n\nBut maybe for the purposes of finding the minimum, even if the code considers the same voucher, but there are no other vouchers, then that case is invalid and would not contribute to the answer.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose x = 2d. There is only one voucher with duration d. Then, when processing this voucher, the code would check for vouchers in the same group (d) with x - d = d. But since there's only one voucher, the code would not find any pair. Hence, the code would not consider this as a valid option.\n\nBut if there are two vouchers with the same duration d, then when processing voucher A, the code would find the minimum cost of vouchers in the same group that end before A's li or start after A's ri. If one of those vouchers is B (the other voucher), then it would be considered.\n\nBut how to ensure that in the case where the group has multiple vouchers, but the minimum is A's own cost, but there's another voucher in the group that also meets the condition.\n\nFor example, suppose group has two vouchers, A and B. Both have same duration. Suppose A's end time is 3, and B's end time is 4. Suppose we are processing A, and looking for vouchers B that end before A's li (say A's li is 5). Then, B's end time is 4 < 5, so B is in the range. The prefix min would include both A and B. However, the code would find the minimum between A and B. If B's cost is lower, then it's okay. But if A's cost is the minimum, but there's another voucher (B) in the group, then the code would consider that.\n\nBut in that case, the code would find the minimum cost (A's cost), but since B is in the group, and B is not A, the code can take it. Wait, but how does the code know that there's another voucher in the group?\n\nAh, here's the problem. If the group has multiple vouchers, and the minimum cost in the group for the required condition is A's cost (which is the same voucher), then the code would think that there is a valid pair (A and A), but that's invalid. However, since there's another voucher in the group, which may have the same cost, the code would still find a valid pair (A and B) with the same cost.\n\nSo perhaps the code can proceed under the assumption that if there are multiple vouchers in the group, and the minimum is found, then there exists at least one voucher in the group that meets the condition and is not A. Even if the minimum is A's cost, but there are others in the group, the code can use that other voucher.\n\nBut how to ensure that? For example, if the group has two vouchers: A (cost 4) and B (cost 4). When processing A, the code finds the minimum cost in the group as 4 (A's cost). However, B is also in the group and meets the condition (assuming B ends before A's li). Then, the code can take B as the pair. Hence, even though the minimum is A's cost, the code can still find a valid pair.\n\nSo perhaps the code can proceed by allowing the same voucher to be considered, but during the processing, the presence of multiple vouchers ensures that there is a valid pair.\n\nThus, the code can proceed with the initial approach, and during the processing, for each voucher A, check both cases (B before and B after), and for each case, find the minimum cost in the target duration group. If the group has at least one voucher that meets the condition (regardless of whether it's A or not), then take that into account. Then, after processing all vouchers, the code can return the minimum total cost found.\n\nBut in the case where the group has only one voucher (which is A itself), then the code would not find any valid pair for that case. So the code would ignore it.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed with the initial approach, and during the processing, even if the same voucher is considered, but the group has multiple vouchers, then there's a valid pair. Thus, the code can proceed without worrying about the same voucher being considered, because when the group has multiple vouchers, the code would find a valid pair even if the minimum is A's cost.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each voucher A:\n\n   d = duration of A\n\n   target_d = x - d\n\n   if target_d not in the duration map: continue\n\n   else:\n\n      for the target_d group:\n\n         case 1: find B's that end before A's li. So check if there are any such B's. If yes, get the minimum cost.\n\n         case 2: find B's that start after A's ri. So check if there are any such B's. If yes, get the minimum cost.\n\n         then, the total cost for this pair is (cost of A) + (minimum of case 1 or case 2)\n\n         keep track of the global minimum.\n\nSo, the code needs to process all vouchers, and for each, check the two cases.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement the two cases efficiently.\n\nImplementing case 1:\n\nFor vouchers in target_d group, sorted by end time (ri), and with a prefix min array.\n\nFor a given A's li, find the largest ri in the sorted list that is less than li. All vouchers up to that index are candidates. The prefix min array for that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: for vouchers in target_d group, sorted by start time (li), and with a suffix min array. For a given A's ri, find the smallest li in the sorted list that is larger than ri. All vouchers from that index onwards are candidates. The suffix min array gives the minimum cost.\n\nSo, the steps for preprocessing:\n\nFor each duration d in the duration map:\n\n   collect all vouchers with that duration.\n\n   sort them by end time (ri), and create a prefix min array.\n\n   sort them by start time (li), and create a suffix min array.\n\nBut how to sort them? For example, for the first case, the list is sorted by ri. For the second case, sorted by li.\n\nWait, for case 2, we need to find vouchers B with li > A's ri. So, the list of vouchers for target_d is sorted by li. Then, for a given A's ri, we can perform a binary search to find the first li that is greater than A's ri. All vouchers from that index to the end are candidates. The suffix min array would have the minimum cost from that index onwards.\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\nFor each duration d:\n\n   list1 = sorted by ri (end time), and for each index i, prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], list1[i].cost)\n\n   list2 = sorted by li (start time), and for each index i, suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], list2[i].cost)\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nOnce the lists are sorted, the prefix min can be computed by iterating through the list once. Similarly for the suffix min.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher A, when checking case 1 and case 2, we can perform the binary searches.\n\nNow, implementing the binary search for case 1:\n\nFor the list sorted by ri (end time), we want the maximum ri that is < li_A. So, we can perform a binary search on the list to find the rightmost element with ri < li_A. Then, the prefix min up to that index is the minimum cost.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2, for the list sorted by li (start time), we want the first element with li > ri_A. Once we find that index, the suffix min from that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen, for each voucher, compute its duration.\n\nGroup vouchers by their duration. So, a dictionary: duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are lists of vouchers.\n\nFor each duration in duration_dict, pre-process the two sorted lists and their min arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher A in all vouchers:\n\n   d = duration of A.\n\n   target_d = x - d.\n\n   if target_d not in duration_dict: continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      process case 1 and case 2.\n\nFor case 1:\n\n   list_ri_sorted = duration_dict[target_d].list1 (sorted by ri)\n\n   find the largest ri in list_ri_sorted that is < li_A.\n\n   if such an index exists (say, idx):\n\n      min_cost_case1 = prefix_min_ri[idx]\n\n   else:\n\n      min_cost_case1 = infinity\n\nFor case 2:\n\n   list_li_sorted = duration_dict[target_d].list2 (sorted by li)\n\n   find the first li in list_li_sorted that is > ri_A.\n\n   if such an index exists (say, idx):\n\n      min_cost_case2 = suffix_min_li[idx]\n\n   else:\n\n      min_cost_case2 = infinity\n\n   total_min = min(min_cost_case1, min_cost_case2)\n\n   if total_min is not infinity:\n\n      current_total = cost_A + total_min\n\n      update the global minimum.\n\nSo, the code proceeds this way.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this correctly.\n\nBut how to handle the binary search for case 1 and case 2?\n\nLet's think about case 1 first. For the list sorted by ri, we need to find the rightmost element with ri < li_A.\n\nThis can be done with bisect_left or bisect_right.\n\nFor example, suppose the list is sorted in ascending order of ri. We can use bisect_left to find the insertion point of li_A. The elements before that insertion point are all <= li_A. Wait, no. Wait, bisect_left returns the first position where li_A can be inserted to maintain sorted order. So, elements before the insertion point are <= li_A? No. Wait, the list is sorted in ascending order. So, for a given value x, bisect_left returns the first index where elements are >= x. So, the elements before that index are < x. So, the number of elements < x is the insertion index.\n\nWait, for example, if the list is [1,3,5,7], and x is 4, bisect_left returns 2, because 4 would be inserted at index 2 (between 3 and 5). So elements before index 2 are [1,3], which are <4. So, the maximum index with ri < li_A is insertion_point -1. But if insertion_point is 0, then there are no elements < li_A.\n\nSo, for case 1, the insertion point is found using bisect.bisect_left(list_ri, li_A). The number of elements < li_A is insertion_point. So, if insertion_point is 0, then no elements. Else, the max index is insertion_point -1. Then, if insertion_point is 0, then no elements. Else, the prefix_min_ri[insertion_point -1] is the minimum cost.\n\nBut wait, the list_ri_sorted is a list of vouchers sorted by ri. So, for the list, we can extract the ri values into a separate array for binary search. For example, during preprocessing, for each duration, we have a list of vouchers sorted by ri. Then, we can create an array of their ri's, and perform bisect on that array.\n\nSimilarly for the other case.\n\nSo, during preprocessing for each duration d:\n\n   sorted_by_ri = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\n   ri_values = [v.ri for v in sorted_by_ri]\n\n   prefix_min = [ ... ]\n\nSimilarly for the other sorted list.\n\nSo, for each voucher A:\n\n   case 1:\n\n      target_d = x - d.\n\n      if target_d not in duration_dict: continue.\n\n      else:\n\n         sorted_ri_list = duration_dict[target_d].sorted_by_ri\n\n         ri_values = duration_dict[target_d].ri_values\n\n         insertion_point = bisect.bisect_left(ri_values, li_A)\n\n         if insertion_point > 0:\n\n             min_case1 = prefix_min[insertion_point - 1]\n\n         else:\n\n             min_case1 = infinity\n\nSimilarly for case 2:\n\n   sorted_li_list = duration_dict[target_d].sorted_by_li\n\n   li_values = [v.li for v in sorted_li_list]\n\n   insertion_point = bisect.bisect_right(li_values, ri_A)\n\n   if insertion_point < len(li_values):\n\n       min_case2 = suffix_min[insertion_point]\n\n   else:\n\n       min_case2 = infinity\n\nWait, for case 2, we want vouchers with li > ri_A. So, the sorted_li_list is sorted by li. We can find the first index where li > ri_A. For example, using bisect_right for ri_A. Because bisect_right returns the insertion point after any existing entries of ri_A. So, all elements from insertion_point onwards are > ri_A.\n\nYes. So, for example, if the list is [1, 3, 5, 7], and ri_A is 3, then bisect_right returns 2. Elements from index 2 onwards are 5,7 which are >3.\n\nSo, in that case, the insertion_point is the first index where li > ri_A. Then, the suffix_min array for that index gives the minimum cost of vouchers from that index to the end.\n\nSo, the code for case 2:\n\ninsertion_point = bisect.bisect_right(li_values, ri_A)\n\nif insertion_point < len(li_values):\n\n   min_case2 = suffix_min[insertion_point]\n\nelse:\n\n   min_case2 = infinity\n\nNow, the suffix_min array is built as follows: for the sorted_li_list, which is sorted by li, the suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to len(sorted_li_list) -1.\n\nSo, during preprocessing:\n\nfor the sorted_li_list:\n\n   suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_li_list)\n\n   suffix_min[-1] = sorted_li_list[-1].cost\n\n   for i in range(len(sorted_li_list)-2, -1, -1):\n\n       suffix_min[i] = min(sorted_li_list[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1])\n\nThus, for insertion_point, the suffix_min[insertion_point] is the minimum cost of vouchers starting from that index.\n\nSo, putting this together.\n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\n- Read all vouchers.\n\n- Group them by their duration.\n\n- For each group, pre-process sorted_by_ri and sorted_by_li, along with their prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher in all vouchers, process as described.\n\nNow, the code can be written in Python.\n\nBut what about the data structures?\n\nLet me think about the data structures. For each duration, we can store:\n\n- sorted_ri: list of vouchers sorted by ri.\n\n- ri_values: list of their ri's for binary search.\n\n- prefix_min_ri: list of min cost up to each index.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_li, li_values, and suffix_min_li.\n\nSo, for example, in Python, for each duration d, we can have a dictionary entry like:\n\n{\n    'sorted_ri': [...],\n    'ri_values': [...],\n    'prefix_min_ri': [...],\n    'sorted_li': [...],\n    'li_values': [...],\n    'suffix_min_li': [...]\n}\n\nBut in Python, perhaps using a class or a tuple would be more efficient, but for code simplicity, perhaps using a dictionary per duration.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen, read n lines, each with li, ri, cost. For each voucher, compute duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup them into a dictionary, say, duration_dict. The keys are the durations, and the values are lists of vouchers.\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_dict:\n\n   process the sorted_ri and prefix_min_ri.\n\n   process the sorted_li and suffix_min_li.\n\nOnce that is done, iterate through all vouchers, and for each voucher, check for target_d = x - duration.\n\nNow, for each voucher, check if target_d exists in duration_dict.\n\nIf yes, then process case 1 and case 2.\n\nBut how to handle the case where target_d is same as current duration?\n\nAs discussed earlier, the code will handle it automatically.\n\nNow, the code needs to find the global minimum of all possible valid pairs.\n\nInitialize the answer as infinity. After processing all vouchers, if the answer is still infinity, output -1, else output the answer.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration is 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nSo, the vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 0: l=1, r=3, cost=4, duration=3\n\nvoucher 1: l=1, r=2, cost=5, duration=2\n\nvoucher 2: l=5, r=6, cost=1, duration=2\n\nvoucher 3: l=1, r=2, cost=4, duration=2\n\nSo, duration_dict has keys 3 and 2.\n\nFor duration 3, the vouchers are [voucher0].\n\nFor duration 2, the vouchers are [voucher1, voucher2, voucher3].\n\nProcessing for voucher0 (duration 3):\n\ntarget_d = 5 -3 = 2. Which exists.\n\nCase 1: find vouchers with duration 2 that end before voucher0's li (which is",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to help Leha find two non-overlapping travel vouchers whose combined duration exactly matches his vacation length, while minimizing the total cost. The solution involves efficiently checking for valid voucher pairs using preprocessing and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, group all vouchers by their duration. This allows us to quickly access vouchers of specific durations.\n2. **Preprocess Data Structures**: For each duration, preprocess two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by the end date (ri) with a prefix minimum cost array.\n   - Another sorted by the start date (li) with a suffix minimum cost array.\n3. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with the required complementary duration such that they do not overlap.
