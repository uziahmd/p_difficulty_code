Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding two vouchers that don't overlap, their durations add up exactly to x, and their total cost is minimized. If it's not possible, return -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. Each voucher has li (departure day), ri (return day), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j such that:\n\n- Their durations sum to x. So duration_i + duration_j = x.\n- They don't overlap. Which means either ri < lj or rj < li. So one ends before the other starts.\n\nThe goal is to find the minimum cost of such pairs.\n\nConstraints: n can be up to 2e5, which is 200,000. So O(n^2) approaches are out of the question. Need an efficient solution.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for each voucher, we can compute its duration. Then, for each voucher, we need to find another voucher with duration equal to (x - duration_i), and that doesn't overlap with it.\n\nBut how to efficiently find such vouchers?\n\nLet me think about grouping vouchers by their duration. For example, create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we can check if there's a voucher with duration (x - d), and then find the ones that don't overlap.\n\nBut even then, for each voucher, checking all vouchers with the required duration could be O(n) in worst case, leading to O(n^2) time again.\n\nSo we need a way to, for a given voucher, quickly find the minimum cost voucher of a certain duration that doesn't overlap with it.\n\nHmm. Let's think about for each duration d, pre-process the vouchers of that duration in a way that allows us to query for the minimum cost voucher that ends before a certain day (so that it can be paired with a voucher starting after that day), or starts after a certain day (so that it can be paired with a voucher ending before that day).\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each duration d, we can have two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by their end day (ri), and for each end day, track the minimum cost up to that point. So that for a given voucher with start day l and duration d, we can find all vouchers of duration (x - d) that end before l. Because then, those vouchers would be non-overlapping with the current voucher (since their end is before the current voucher's start).\n\nSimilarly, for the same duration, we can have a sorted list of vouchers by their start day (li), and for each start day, track the minimum cost from that point onwards. So that for a voucher with end day r, we can find vouchers of duration (x - d) that start after r.\n\nWait, but how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a duration d, and we want to find vouchers with duration (x - d). For each voucher with duration d, say it has start l and end r. Then, any voucher with duration (x - d) that ends before l can be paired with it. Also, any voucher with duration (x - d) that starts after r can be paired with it.\n\nSo for each voucher, we need to check both possibilities: find vouchers of duration (x - d) that end before l, and those that start after r.\n\nBut how to find the minimal cost among these vouchers?\n\nLet me consider for each duration, say target_duration, we have two arrays:\n\n- One sorted by end day, and for each end day, we have the minimum cost of vouchers up to that end day. This way, when we want to find the minimum cost voucher with target_duration that ends before a certain l, we can perform a binary search on the sorted end days and get the minimum cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for the start days, sorted in ascending order, and for each start day, track the minimum cost from that start day onwards. Wait, but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, for the start days, sorted, and for each start day, have the minimum cost from that start day onwards. But how to build that?\n\nAlternatively, for the vouchers of target_duration, sorted by their start day. Then, for a given r (the end of the current voucher), we can find all vouchers with start day > r. Among those, we need the minimum cost. To do this, we can have a sorted list of start days, and for each position in the sorted list, have a prefix minimum. Wait, no. If the start days are sorted, then all start days after a certain value can be found via binary search. And once we find the first index where start day > r, all elements from that index onwards are candidates. To find the minimum cost in that suffix, we can precompute a suffix minimum array.\n\nYes! So for each duration, we can pre-process the vouchers as follows:\n\nFor vouchers of duration d:\n\n- Sort them by their end day (ri). Then, create a list of end days and a corresponding list of min_cost_up_to_end. For each position i in the sorted list, min_cost_up_to_end[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers. So when we want to find the minimum cost of vouchers with end day <= some value, we can binary search the end day and take the min cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, sort the vouchers by their start day (li). Create a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end of the list. Then, for a given r, we can find the earliest start day that is > r, and then take the suffix_min from that index onwards.\n\nThis way, for each voucher, we can check two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: Find a voucher with target_duration that ends before the current voucher's start (l). So for that, we look into the sorted end days of the target_duration vouchers, find the largest end day <= l-1, and get the minimum cost up to that point.\n\nCase 2: Find a voucher with target_duration that starts after the current voucher's end (r). So for that, we look into the sorted start days of the target_duration vouchers, find the first start day > r, and then get the minimum cost from that index onwards.\n\nIf either case gives us a valid voucher, we can take the minimum between them and combine with the current voucher's cost.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, store two structures:\n\n   a. A sorted list of vouchers by end day, along with a prefix min cost array.\n\n   b. A sorted list of vouchers by start day, along with a suffix min cost array.\n\n2. For each voucher in the original list, compute its duration d. Then, compute the target duration t = x - d. If t is less than 1, skip (since durations are at least 1).\n\n3. For each voucher, check if there exists any vouchers with duration t. If not, skip.\n\n4. For the current voucher (with duration d, start l, end r), check the two cases:\n\n   a. Find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration t that end before l. How?\n\n      - Look into the sorted end days for duration t. Find the largest end day <= l-1. If such exists, take the min cost up to that point.\n\n   b. Find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration t that start after r. How?\n\n      - Look into the sorted start days for duration t. Find the first start day > r. If such exists, take the suffix min from that index.\n\n   Then, combine the current voucher's cost with the found min cost (if any) and keep track of the overall minimum.\n\nBut how to handle the preprocessing steps?\n\nLet me think about how to structure the data.\n\nWe can have a dictionary called duration_map, where each key is a duration, and the value is a tuple of two lists:\n\n- For the end-sorted list: list of (end_day, cost), sorted by end_day. Also, a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost from 0 to i.\n\n- For the start-sorted list: list of (start_day, cost), sorted by start_day. Also, a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end.\n\nBut perhaps for each duration, we can have:\n\n- A list of vouchers sorted by end_day. Then, for each position in this list, the prefix_min array is built.\n\nSimilarly, a list sorted by start_day, and a suffix_min array.\n\nSo for example, for duration t, we have:\n\nsorted_ends = sorted list of vouchers by end_day.\n\nprefix_mins = [ ... ] where prefix_mins[i] = min( sorted_ends[0..i].cost )\n\nsorted_starts = sorted list of vouchers by start_day.\n\nsuffix_mins = [ ... ] where suffix_mins[i] = min( sorted_starts[i..n-1].cost )\n\nSo during preprocessing, for each duration, we process the vouchers of that duration and build these structures.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher, we can check for the target duration.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nFirst, group all vouchers by their duration. For each duration, collect all vouchers, then sort them by end_day and build prefix_mins. Also, sort them by start_day and build suffix_mins.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher in the original list:\n\nCompute d = duration. t = x - d. If t is not present in duration_map, skip. Else:\n\nCheck for vouchers with duration t.\n\nFor case a: find the min cost in duration t's vouchers that end before l (current voucher's start). How?\n\nIn the sorted_ends list for duration t, find the largest end_day <= l-1. Since the list is sorted, we can perform a binary search for l-1. If found, the prefix_mins up to that index gives the min cost.\n\nFor case b: find the min cost in duration t's vouchers that start after r (current voucher's end). In the sorted_starts list for duration t, find the first start_day > r. All vouchers from that index onwards are candidates. The suffix_mins for that index gives the min cost.\n\nSo, for each voucher, we can check both cases and see if there's a valid pair. Then, we take the minimum between the two possibilities (if they exist) and add to the current voucher's cost.\n\nWe need to track the overall minimum across all such possibilities.\n\nNow, the key is to implement these steps efficiently.\n\nNow, considering the constraints. For each voucher, the processing is O(log k), where k is the number of vouchers with duration t. Since for each voucher, we perform two binary searches (one for case a and one for case b), and the rest is O(1) operations.\n\nSo the total time complexity is O(n log n), since for each voucher, we do O(log n) operations, and the preprocessing steps (sorting and building prefix/suffix min arrays) are O(n log n) overall.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, let's think about the data structures.\n\nImplementing the duration_map:\n\nWe can use a defaultdict (from collections) to map durations to their data.\n\nFor each duration, we need:\n\nsorted_ends: list of (end_day, cost), sorted by end_day.\n\nprefix_mins: list of min costs up to each index.\n\nSimilarly, sorted_starts: list of (start_day, cost), sorted by start_day.\n\nsuffix_mins: list of min costs from each index onwards.\n\nSo for example, for a duration t, when we process all vouchers of that duration:\n\nsorted_ends = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.end_day)\n\nThen, prefix_mins is built as follows:\n\nprefix_mins[0] = sorted_ends[0].cost\n\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_ends)-1:\n\nprefix_mins[i] = min(prefix_mins[i-1], sorted_ends[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly, sorted_starts is sorted by start_day.\n\nThen, suffix_mins is built from the end:\n\nsuffix_mins[-1] = sorted_starts[-1].cost\n\nfor i in len(sorted_starts)-2 downto 0:\n\nsuffix_mins[i] = min( suffix_mins[i+1], sorted_starts[i].cost )\n\nOnce these are built, for each voucher, when looking for case a and case b, we can perform the necessary steps.\n\nNow, for case a:\n\nWe need to find in the sorted_ends list of duration t, the maximum end_day <= l-1. Let's call this value 'target'.\n\nWe can perform a binary search for 'target' in the sorted_ends list. Since the list is sorted by end_day, we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point, then subtract 1 to get the last element <= target.\n\nIf the insertion point is 0, then there are no such elements.\n\nOnce we have the index, if it's >=0, then the prefix_mins at that index gives the min cost.\n\nFor case b:\n\nWe need to find in the sorted_starts list of duration t, the first start_day > r. Let's call this value 'target'.\n\nWe can use bisect_right to find the insertion point of r in the sorted_starts list (sorted by start_day). The insertion point gives the first element > r. So if insertion_point is less than len(sorted_starts), then the suffix_mins[insertion_point] is the min cost from that index onwards.\n\nIf insertion_point is len(sorted_starts), then no such elements.\n\nSo, combining all these steps.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, read n vouchers, storing li, ri, cost. Also compute duration for each.\n\nThen, group all vouchers by their duration into the duration_map.\n\nFor each duration in the duration_map, process the vouchers to create sorted_ends and sorted_starts, along with prefix_mins and suffix_mins.\n\nOnce that is done, iterate through each voucher in the original list. For each voucher, compute d = duration, t = x -d. Check if t is in duration_map. If not, continue.\n\nElse, for the current voucher (l, r, cost), check both cases:\n\nCase 1: Find vouchers of duration t that end before l. So, in the sorted_ends list of duration t, find the max end_day <= l-1.\n\nCase 2: Find vouchers of duration t that start after r. So, in the sorted_starts list of duration t, find the first start_day > r.\n\nFor each case, if found, get the min cost and add to current voucher's cost. Keep track of the overall minimum.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle the binary search steps.\n\nImplementing the binary search in Python:\n\nFor case a:\n\nsorted_ends is a list sorted by end_day. For each entry, we can extract the end_day values into a separate list for binary search.\n\nWait, perhaps for each duration, we can precompute two lists:\n\nFor sorted_ends, a list of end_days (sorted), and a list of prefix_mins.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_starts, a list of start_days (sorted), and a list of suffix_mins.\n\nSo, for example, for duration t:\n\nsorted_ends_days = [voucher.end_day for voucher in sorted_ends]\n\nsorted_ends_prefix = [ ... ]\n\nThen, during case a, we can perform a bisect_right on sorted_ends_days for l-1. Let me think.\n\nBut perhaps, during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have:\n\nFor the sorted_ends list, the end_days are sorted. So for the binary search, we can use the bisect module.\n\nSo, in code, for a given duration t, we have:\n\nsorted_ends_days = [voucher[0] for voucher in sorted_ends_list]\n\nWait, but how are the sorted_ends stored? For example, for each duration, sorted_ends is a list of tuples (end_day, cost), sorted by end_day. So, the end_days can be extracted as a list.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_starts.\n\nSo, during the preprocessing step, for each duration, we can generate:\n\nsorted_ends_days = [end_day for end_day, cost in sorted_ends]\n\nsorted_starts_days = [start_day for start_day, cost in sorted_starts]\n\nBut perhaps during the binary search steps, we can use the list of end_days, and for each, perform the bisect.\n\nSo, for case a:\n\ntarget = l - 1\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ends_days, target) - 1\n\nif index >=0:\n\nmin_cost_a = prefix_mins[index]\n\nelse:\n\nno such voucher.\n\nSimilarly, for case b:\n\ntarget = r\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_starts_days, target)\n\nif index < len(sorted_starts_days):\n\nmin_cost_b = suffix_mins[index]\n\nelse:\n\nno such voucher.\n\nSo, the code for each voucher would involve these steps.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nImplementing the duration_map:\n\nIn Python, perhaps:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nimport bisect\n\nThen:\n\nduration_map = defaultdict( ... )\n\nBut what is stored for each duration? For example, for each duration d, we can have:\n\n{\n    'sorted_ends': list of (end_day, cost), sorted by end_day,\n    'prefix_mins': list of min costs,\n    'sorted_starts': list of (start_day, cost), sorted by start_day,\n    'suffix_mins': list of min costs,\n}\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to store for each duration, the sorted_ends_days list, and the prefix_mins, and similarly for starts.\n\nAlternatively, during preprocessing, for each duration, we can process the vouchers as follows:\n\nFor example, for duration d:\n\nvouchers_of_d = list of all vouchers with duration d.\n\nsorted_ends = sorted(vouchers_of_d, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nsorted_ends_days = [v.ri for v in sorted_ends]\n\nprefix_mins = [ ... ]\n\nSimilarly, sorted_starts = sorted(vouchers_of_d, key=lambda v: v.li)\n\nsorted_starts_days = [v.li for v in sorted_starts]\n\nsuffix_mins = [ ... ]\n\nBut how to represent the vouchers? Well, perhaps each voucher is stored as a tuple (li, ri, cost). So during preprocessing, for each duration, we can collect the vouchers, then sort them accordingly.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nAfter reading all vouchers, group them by duration. For each duration, collect all vouchers.\n\nThen, for each duration in the group:\n\nProcess the vouchers into sorted_ends and sorted_starts, and compute prefix and suffix mins.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor d in duration_map:\n\n    vouchers = duration_map[d]\n\n    # process sorted_ends\n\n    sorted_ends = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])  # x[1] is ri\n\n    sorted_ends_days = [x[1] for x in sorted_ends]\n\n    prefix_mins = [0] * len(sorted_ends)\n\n    prefix_mins[0] = sorted_ends[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_ends)):\n\n        prefix_mins[i] = min(prefix_mins[i-1], sorted_ends[i][2])\n\n    # process sorted_starts\n\n    sorted_starts = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])  # x[0] is li\n\n    sorted_starts_days = [x[0] for x in sorted_starts]\n\n    suffix_mins = [0] * len(sorted_starts)\n\n    suffix_mins[-1] = sorted_starts[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_starts)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_mins[i] = min(suffix_mins[i+1], sorted_starts[i][2])\n\n    # store these in duration_map for d.\n\nBut how to store these in the duration_map? Perhaps, for each duration, we have a tuple containing (sorted_ends_days, prefix_mins, sorted_starts_days, suffix_mins).\n\nBut in Python, perhaps using a dictionary of dictionaries. For example, for each duration d, duration_info[d] is a dictionary with keys 'ends_days', 'prefix_mins', 'starts_days', 'suffix_mins'.\n\nSo during preprocessing, for each duration d, we can compute these four arrays and store them.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher (li, ri, cost), with duration d, we check for t = x - d. If t is in duration_info, then proceed.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut first, let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if x is less than 2? Well, according to the input constraints, x is at least 2. Wait, the input says x is between 2 and 2e5. Because the problem says: 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·10^5. So x can be 2, and each voucher's duration is at least 1. So for x=2, the two durations must be 1 and 1. So, the code needs to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: when there are multiple vouchers with the same duration. For example, if two vouchers with duration 1 and non-overlapping, then their sum is 2.\n\nAnother case: when the same voucher is considered twice. But since the problem says i != j, we have to make sure that when we select a voucher from the same duration, it's not the same voucher. However, since the code checks for vouchers with duration t (which is x-d), and for each voucher, the code is looking for another voucher (possibly different) in that duration. However, when t = d, and x = 2d, then the code may need to check that the two vouchers are different. But how?\n\nWait, for example, suppose x = 2d, and there's only one voucher with duration d. Then, it's impossible to choose two vouchers. But if there are two vouchers with duration d, and they don't overlap, then it's possible.\n\nBut in our code, when we process a voucher with duration d, and t = x -d = d. Then, during case a and case b, we are looking for vouchers with duration t (d) that end before l or start after r. However, if the voucher itself is part of the duration t, then during the binary search steps, it could be included. But since the code is looking for any voucher in the duration t, including possibly the same voucher, but since the code requires that i != j, we need to ensure that the current voucher is not the same as the one found.\n\nBut how?\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because, for example, if a voucher is processed, and during the case a, the code finds that there is a voucher in the duration t (which is same as d) that ends before l. But if that voucher is the same as the current one, then the code would count it as a valid pair, but i and j would be same, which is invalid.\n\nSo how to avoid that?\n\nThis is a critical point. Because during the processing of a voucher, when we look for vouchers in duration t, which could be same as d, we need to ensure that the voucher we find is different from the current one.\n\nBut how can we handle this?\n\nHmm. For example, suppose there are two vouchers with same duration d. When processing voucher A, during the check for duration t =d, the code may find voucher B (another voucher) that meets the condition. But if there's only one voucher, then during the check, the code would find nothing, because the voucher is the same as current one (but i and j must be different).\n\nSo, the problem is that during the processing of a voucher, when we look for vouchers of duration t, which could be same as d, the code may include the same voucher as the current one, leading to an invalid pair.\n\nHow can we prevent this?\n\nOne approach is to, when checking for vouchers in duration t, ensure that the voucher is not the same as the current one. However, since the same voucher may appear multiple times in the duration t's list, we need to check if the voucher found is different.\n\nBut how can we track that?\n\nThis seems complicated. For example, during the processing of voucher A, when we look for vouchers in duration t (which could be same as d), the code may find a voucher B which is same as A. But since the code is looking for any voucher, including B, but if B is the same as A, then the pair (A, B) is invalid.\n\nBut how can we know whether the voucher found is the same as the current one?\n\nThis seems tricky. Because during the preprocessing steps, the code groups vouchers by duration, but does not track their individual identities. So, for example, during the case a, when we find the min cost in the vouchers of duration t, which could include the current voucher.\n\nSo, how can we avoid this?\n\nAlternative approach: during the processing of voucher A, when looking for vouchers in duration t, we can check whether the voucher found is different from A. However, since the code is looking for the minimal cost, perhaps the minimal cost is achieved by a different voucher, but there's no way to know unless we check.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive, as for each voucher, we would have to check if the found voucher is different from the current one.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nAn alternative idea: during the preprocessing steps, for each duration, we can have multiple entries, and when processing a voucher, we can check if the found voucher is not the same as the current one.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nWell, perhaps during the processing of a voucher, when we find a candidate voucher (say, the minimal cost in case a), we need to check if that voucher is not the same as the current voucher. But how can we know which voucher that is?\n\nBecause the code is using prefix_mins and suffix_mins arrays, which track the minimal cost, but not the actual vouchers. So, if the minimal cost is achieved by the current voucher, then we need to ignore it.\n\nBut how to know that?\n\nThis seems difficult. For example, if the current voucher is part of the duration t, and the minimal cost is exactly the current voucher's cost, then we need to check if there's another voucher with the same cost, or if the current voucher is the only one.\n\nThis seems very complicated. How can we handle this?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose there's only one voucher with duration t. Then, when processing a voucher (say, the same voucher) and looking for another voucher, there's none. So, the code would not consider it. But if there are two vouchers with same duration, and the same start and end days, then during processing of the first voucher, the code may find the second voucher as a valid candidate.\n\nBut how can we ensure that the code does not select the same voucher?\n\nAlternative approach: during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can store all vouchers. Then, for a given voucher, during case a and case b, when we find the minimal cost, we need to check whether there exists at least one voucher in the duration t that meets the condition and is not the same as the current voucher.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems challenging. Let's think of the following scenario:\n\nSuppose current voucher is A, and during case a, the code finds that the minimal cost is achieved by voucher A. However, since voucher A is the same as current voucher, it's invalid. However, there may be other vouchers in the duration t that meet the condition and have the same cost. Or maybe not. So the code would need to check if there's at least one voucher in the duration t that meets the condition and is different from the current voucher.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems like a big problem, but perhaps there's a way around.\n\nLet me think again. The problem requires that the two vouchers are different. So, during the processing of voucher A, when we look for a voucher B in duration t, we need to ensure that B is not A.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nOne possible way is to, during the processing of voucher A, when checking for vouchers in duration t, we can check if there is at least one voucher in the duration t that meets the condition (ends before l, or starts after r) and is not A.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor example, during case a, when we find the minimal cost in the vouchers of duration t that end before l, but the minimal cost could be achieved by voucher A itself. However, if there are other vouchers in the same duration t that also end before l, then we can take the minimal cost. But if the only voucher is A, then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the problem is that the current voucher may be part of the group of vouchers in duration t, and thus, the code needs to make sure that there is at least one other voucher in that group that meets the condition.\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we handle this?\n\nAlternative idea: during the preprocessing steps, for each duration, store all vouchers. Then, during case a, when we find the minimal cost, we can check whether the minimal cost is achieved by a voucher that is not the current one.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWell, perhaps during the case a processing, after finding the index (say, idx) in the sorted_ends_days list, we can check if there are any vouchers in the prefix up to idx that are not the current voucher.\n\nBut how to know which vouchers are in that prefix?\n\nThis seems impossible unless we track the vouchers in the sorted_ends list.\n\nBut then, for example, during the case a, the code would have to check if there is at least one voucher in the prefix up to idx that is not the current voucher.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nThis seems computationally expensive, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing steps, for each duration, we can store the sorted_ends list as a list of vouchers, and during the case a processing, once we find the index, we can check if there's at least one voucher in the prefix up to that index that is not the current voucher.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, during the case a processing, after finding the index, we can check the minimal cost in the prefix up to index. If the minimal cost is the same as the current voucher's cost, then we need to check whether there is at least one other voucher in the prefix that has the same cost. Or, perhaps, check if the current voucher is in the prefix.\n\nBut how to know if the current voucher is in the prefix?\n\nThis seems very complex. Perhaps, the code can assume that the current voucher is not part of the duration t, but that's not necessarily true. For example, when t = d, and the current voucher is part of the duration t.\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, during the processing of voucher A, when looking for vouchers of duration t = x -d, which could be same as d, the code will find other vouchers (if any) that meet the condition. However, if the only voucher that meets the condition is the current voucher, then it's invalid.\n\nSo, how to handle this?\n\nMaybe, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nWhen processing voucher A, during case a, after finding the minimal cost in the vouchers of duration t that end before l, check if there exists at least one voucher in that set that is not A.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, during the case a processing, after finding the index, the code can check if the number of vouchers in the prefix up to index is at least 1. If it is, then check if the current voucher is in that prefix. If not, then it's safe to take the minimal cost. If it is, then check if there are other vouchers in the prefix with the same cost.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, during the case a processing, the code can find the minimal cost in the vouchers of duration t that end before l, and then check if there's at least one voucher in that set (i.e., the set of vouchers with duration t that end before l) that is not the current voucher.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAnother Idea: during the processing of voucher A, when looking for vouchers in duration t, the code can first check if the duration t is the same as d. If yes, then during the case a processing, the code needs to ensure that the voucher found is not the same as A.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe during the case a processing, when we find the minimal cost, we can check whether there are at least two vouchers in the duration t that meet the condition (end before l). If so, then the minimal cost is acceptable. Otherwise, not.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nFor example, during case a, after finding the index, if the number of vouchers in the prefix up to index is >=1, then:\n\nif the current voucher is in that prefix, then we need to check if there's at least one other voucher in that prefix.\n\nBut how to know if the current voucher is in that prefix?\n\nThis seems very challenging.\n\nPerhaps, the initial approach is to ignore this possibility, and then during the final answer, check if there are at least two vouchers. However, this would lead to incorrect answers in some cases.\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, the code can proceed without considering this, and then during the final answer, if the minimal cost is found, it's possible that it's from the same voucher. But how to avoid that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can proceed with the initial approach, and during the case a and case b, allow the same voucher to be considered, but then during the pairing, check if the voucher is different.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems computationally expensive. For example, during the case a, after finding the minimal cost, we can retrieve the voucher(s) that achieve that cost, and check if any of them is different from the current voucher.\n\nBut how to retrieve those vouchers?\n\nThis seems impossible with the current data structures, which only track the minimal cost.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the problem is that the initial approach is missing this case, and thus may produce incorrect results. But how can we handle this?\n\nLet me think of a test case where this is a problem.\n\nTest Case:\n\nn=2, x=2.\n\nVoucher 1: l=1, r=1 (duration 1), cost=1.\n\nVoucher 2: l=2, r=2 (duration 1), cost=1.\n\nSo x=2, and each voucher has duration 1. So the total duration is 2.\n\nThe two vouchers are non-overlapping. The minimal cost is 1+1=2.\n\nIn this case, during processing of voucher 1:\n\nt = x -d = 2-1=1.\n\nSo check for vouchers with duration 1.\n\nFor case a: find vouchers with duration 1 that end before l=1. l=1, so end before l is end <=0. There are none.\n\nFor case b: find vouchers with duration 1 that start after r=1. r=1, so start >1. Voucher 2 has start 2. So it's valid. The cost is 1. So total cost is 1+1=2.\n\nSimilarly, during processing of voucher 2, the same applies. So the code would find this pair.\n\nBut what if there's only one voucher?\n\nTest Case:\n\nn=1, x=2. But n must be >=2 according to the input constraints. So this is not possible.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nn=2, x=2.\n\nVoucher 1: l=1, r=1 (duration 1), cost=1.\n\nVoucher 2: l=1, r=1 (duration 1), cost=1.\n\nThese two vouchers are overlapping (same days). So the code would not select them.\n\nBut if voucher 2's l and r are 2 and 2, then they are non-overlapping.\n\nBut during processing of voucher 1, case b would find voucher 2.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what if during case a, the only voucher that meets the condition is the current voucher itself?\n\nExample:\n\nn=2, x=2.\n\nVoucher 1: l=1, r=1 (duration 1), cost=1.\n\nVoucher 2: l=1, r=1 (duration 1), cost=2.\n\nNow, during processing of voucher 1:\n\nt = 1. So check for vouchers with duration 1.\n\nCase a: find vouchers with duration 1 that end before l=1. None.\n\nCase b: find vouchers with duration 1 that start after r=1. So start >1. Voucher 2 has start 1, which is not >1. So no.\n\nSo no valid pair.\n\nBut voucher 1 and voucher 2 are overlapping, so it's invalid.\n\nSo the code correctly returns -1.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=2, x=2.\n\nVoucher 1: l=1, r=1 (duration 1), cost=1.\n\nVoucher 2: l=2, r=2 (duration 1), cost=2.\n\nProcessing voucher 1:\n\ncase a: no.\n\ncase b: find vouchers with duration 1 that start after r=1. So start >1. voucher 2's start is 2. So yes. min cost is 2. total cost is 1+2=3.\n\nProcessing voucher 2:\n\ncase a: find vouchers with duration 1 that end before l=2. voucher 1 ends at 1, which is <= 2-1=1. So yes. min cost is 1. total cost is 2+1=3.\n\nSo overall minimum is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, what if there's a scenario where the only valid voucher is the same as the current one?\n\nBut that's not possible, since the current voucher can't be paired with itself. So during processing, when looking for vouchers in duration t, if the only voucher that meets the condition is the current one, then it's not allowed. But how to detect that?\n\nFor example:\n\nn=1, x=2. Not allowed as per input constraints.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=2, x=2.\n\nVoucher 1: l=1, r=1 (duration 1), cost=1.\n\nVoucher 2: l=1, r=1 (duration 1), cost=1.\n\nThey are overlapping. So no valid pair. So code returns -1.\n\nBut during processing of voucher 1:\n\ncase a: find vouchers with duration 1 that end before l=1. None.\n\ncase b",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers from a list such that their combined duration equals a given value `x` and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently checking for pairs with the required combined duration.\n2. **Preprocess Data**: For each duration, we preprocess the vouchers to create sorted lists based on their start and end days. Additionally, we compute prefix minimum costs for end-sorted lists and suffix minimum costs for start-sorted lists. This allows efficient range queries to find the minimum cost of valid vouchers.\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: For each voucher, we use binary search to quickly find the minimum cost of valid vouchers that either end before the current voucher starts or start after the current voucher ends. This ensures that the solution is efficient even for large input sizes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost))\n\n    # Group vouchers by duration\n    duration_map = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, cost in vouchers:\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        duration_map[duration].append((l, r, cost))\n\n    # Preprocess each duration's data\n    duration_info = dict()\n    for d in duration_map:\n        vouchers_d = duration_map[d]\n        # Process sorted_ends\n        sorted_ends = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        sorted_ends_days = [v[1] for v in sorted_ends]\n        prefix_mins = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_ends:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n            prefix_mins.append(min_so_far)\n        # Process sorted_starts\n        sorted_starts = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        sorted_starts_days = [v[0] for v in sorted_starts]\n        suffix_mins = [0] * len(sorted_starts)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_starts)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_starts[i][2])\n            suffix_mins[i] = min_so_far\n        # Store in duration_info\n        duration_info[d] = {\n            'sorted_ends_days': sorted_ends_days,\n            'prefix_mins': prefix_mins,\n            'sorted_starts_days': sorted_starts_days,\n            'suffix_mins': suffix_mins\n        }\n\n    min_total_cost = float('inf')\n\n    for l, r, cost in vouchers:\n        d = r - l + 1\n        t = x - d\n        if t < 1:\n            continue\n        if t not in duration_info:\n            continue\n        info = duration_info[t]\n        # Case 1: find vouchers in t that end before l\n        ends_days = info['sorted_ends_days']\n        prefix_mins = info['prefix_mins']\n        target = l - 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(ends_days, target) - 1\n        if idx >= 0:\n            case1_cost = prefix_mins[idx]\n            total = cost + case1_cost\n            if total < min_total_cost:\n                min_total_cost = total\n        # Case 2: find vouchers in t that start after r\n        starts_days = info['sorted_starts_days']\n        suffix_mins = info['suffix_mins']\n        target = r\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(starts_days, target)\n        if idx < len(starts_days):\n            case2_cost = suffix_mins[idx]\n            total = cost + case2_cost\n            if total < min_total_cost:\n                min_total_cost = total\n\n    if min_total_cost == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total_cost)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end and start days.
