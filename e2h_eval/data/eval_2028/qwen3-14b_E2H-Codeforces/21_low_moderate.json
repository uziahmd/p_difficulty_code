The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. Let's break down the condition. The sum a_i + b_j is odd if one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. Conversely, for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the problem reduces to counting how many even and odd numbers there are in the chests and keys. Then, for each even chest, we can pair it with an odd key, and for each odd chest, we can pair it with an even key. But since each key can be used only once, we need to find the minimum between the count of even chests and the count of odd keys, and similarly for the other case. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let's say:\n\nNumber of even chests: even_chest_count\nNumber of odd chests: odd_chest_count\n\nNumber of even keys: even_key_count\nNumber of odd keys: odd_key_count\n\nThen, the maximum possible for even chests is min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count). Because each even chest needs an odd key. Similarly, the maximum for odd chests is min(odd_chest_count, even_key_count). Summing these two gives the total maximum chests that can be opened.\n\nYes! Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, but you can't use the same key twice. So the number of such pairs is the minimum of the two counts. Same for the other case.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd numbers in the chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd numbers in the keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count) + min(odd_chest_count, even_key_count).\n\nThat seems straightforward. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's check their parity:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chest_count is 3 (14,6,2), odd_chest_count is 2 (9, 11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's see: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_key_count is 3 (8,4,20), odd_key_count is 1 (7).\n\nSo for even chests (3) paired with odd keys (1): min(3,1)=1. For odd chests (2) paired with even keys (3): min(2,3)=2. Total 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example: input is 5 1, chests are 2,4,6,8,10 (all even). Keys is 5 (odd). So even_chest_count is 5, odd_key_count is 1. So min(5,1)=1. The other part is min(0, even_key_count (0)) which is 0. So total 1, which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even), keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chest_count is 1. odd_key_count is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. The other part: odd_chest_count is 0, so min(0, even_key_count (4)) is 0. Total 0. Which matches the third example.\n\nLooks like this logic works. So the steps are:\n\n- Count even and odd in a_i (chests)\n- Count even and odd in b_j (keys)\n- Compute min(even_chest, odd_keys) + min(odd_chest, even_keys)\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list of a_i. Then read the list of b_j.\n\nCount even and odd in a: for example, even_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0), same for odd_chest = n - even_chest.\n\nSimilarly for keys: even_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0), odd_key = m - even_key.\n\nThen compute the answer as min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number, which means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Even and Odd Numbers**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Pairing Strategy**: \n   - Even-numbered chests can be opened by odd-numbered keys.\n   - Odd-numbered chests can be opened by even-numbered keys.\n3. **Calculate Maximum Pairs**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the minimum of the count of even chests and odd keys, plus the minimum of the count of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Counting Evens and Odds**: We count how many even and odd numbers are present in the lists of chests and keys.\n- **Calculating Result**: Using the counts, we determine the maximum possible pairs by taking the minimum of the respective counts for each pairing strategy (even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened using the available keys, adhering to the constraints and optimizing the pairing process.",
