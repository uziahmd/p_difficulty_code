Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the pile should contain exactly all the letters from both names combined, no more, no less. Any extra letters or missing letters would make the answer \"NO\".\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the combined letters of the first two input lines (guest and host) exactly match the letters in the third line (the pile). How to do that?\n\nHmm. One way is to count the frequency of each character in the combined string of guest and host, and compare it with the frequency in the pile. If they are the same, output YES, else NO.\n\nRight. So, for each test case, we take the first two lines, concatenate them, then check if the count of each character in that concatenated string matches the count in the third line.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nLet me think. For example, for the first sample input:\n\nGuest is SANTACLAUS, host is DEDMOROZ. Combined, their letters are SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Then the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let's see, the counts of each letter in both should be same.\n\nSo, in Python, perhaps using the collections.Counter class would be helpful. Because Counter can count the occurrences of each character in a string.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read three lines of input.\n2. Combine the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Create a Counter for this combined string.\n4. Create a Counter for the third line (the pile).\n5. Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, Counter compares the counts of each element. So if both Counters have the same counts for all characters, then they are considered equal.\n\nYes. So that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nWhat if the combined length of the first two lines is different from the length of the third line? For example, if the combined length is 10 and the pile is 11 letters. Then obviously, the answer is NO. But checking the lengths first could be a quick way to reject some cases early.\n\nSo, perhaps first check if len(guest + host) == len(pile). If not, immediately return NO. Otherwise, proceed to compare the counts.\n\nThat's a good optimization. Because if the lengths are different, there's no way the counts can match. So adding that check first can save some processing time.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n- Read guest, host, pile.\n\n- Check if len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, output NO.\n\n- Else, check if the combined counts of guest + host equals the counts of pile.\n\nIf both conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, how to read the input?\n\nThe input is three lines. Wait, the input is given as three lines. But looking at the example input:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as a list of three elements. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput is ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, but that's probably a representation of three test cases. Each test case has three lines. So the actual input is three lines per test case. But the problem says that the input file consists of three lines. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line the host's name, third line the pile.\n\nSo for each test case, there are three lines. But the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines. So perhaps the input is multiple test cases, each with three lines. But the problem says that the input is three lines. Wait, maybe the sample input is given as a list of three test cases. But in reality, the program should read three lines from standard input, which are the three lines for one test case.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is three lines. So the program should process one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. Oh, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each element of the list is a separate test case. For example, the first test case's input is three lines: first line is 'SANTACLAUS', second 'DEDMOROZ', third '",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door could be rearranged to form the names of the guest and the host. This involves verifying that the pile contains exactly the same letters as the combined names of the guest and the host, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Length Check**: First, check if the combined length of the guest's and host's names matches the length of the pile. If they do not match, immediately return \"NO\".\n3. **Character Counting**: Use a character frequency counter to count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names of the guest and host, and in the pile. If both counters match, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the names; otherwise, it cannot.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the three lines from input\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Check if the total length matches\n    if len(guest) + len(host) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    # Combine guest and host names\n    combined = guest + host\n    # Create counters for both combined and pile\n    combined_counter = Counter(combined)\n    pile_counter = Counter(pile)\n    \n    # Compare the counters\n    if combined_counter == pile_counter:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines from standard input, which are the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n- **Length Check**: Before performing any detailed checks, the code quickly verifies if the total number of characters in the guest and host names matches the number of characters in the pile. This is a necessary condition for the answer to be \"YES\".\n- **Character Frequency Counting**: Using the `Counter` class from the `collections` module, the code counts the occurrences of each character in both the combined string of the guest and host names and the pile. If these counts match, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check both the length and the character composition, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
