    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0 and 2 directly. Hmm.\n\nSo the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). So what does that mean for the order of characters?\n\nLet me think about the possible rearrangements. Since 0 can be swapped with 1, and 1 can be swapped with 2, but not 0 and 2. So maybe the 0s can move past 1s, and 1s can move past 2s, but 0s can't move past 2s directly. Wait, but maybe through some steps? Like, if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, can the 0 move past the 2?\n\nWait, no. Because the 0 can swap with the 1, which can then swap with the 2. So for example, if we have 0-1-2. We can swap the 0 and 1 to get 1-0-2. Then swap the 0 and 2? No, because 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. So the 0 can't move past the 2. So the 0 can only move past 1s, but not 2s. Similarly, 2s can move past 1s but not 0s.\n\nSo this suggests that the relative order of 0s and 2s cannot be changed. Because 0s can't pass through 2s. Wait, but what if there's a sequence of 0s and 2s separated by 1s? For example, 0-1-2. Can the 0 move to the right of the 2? Let's think. The 0 can swap with the 1 to get 1-0-2. Then the 0 can't swap with the 2. So no. So the 0 can't get past the 2. So the original order of 0s and 2s is fixed? Or maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a string like 0-2. We can't swap them. So their order is fixed. But if there's a 1 in between, maybe we can do something. Like 0-1-2. Then the 0 can move to the right of the 1, but then the 1 can move to the right of the 2? No, because the 1 can swap with 2. So for example, 0-1-2 can become 0-2-1. Then the 0 is still before the 2. So the 0 can't get past the 2. So the relative positions of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because any 0 can only move through 1s, and 2s can only move through 1s. So the 0s and 2s are in their original order relative to each other. Because if there's a 0 followed by a 2, they can't swap. And even with 1s in between, the 0 can't pass through the 2. So the positions of 0s and 2s relative to each other are fixed. So the overall idea is that the 0s and 2s can't change their relative order. However, the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s, as long as they are moving through 0s or 2s?\n\nWait, no. Because 1s can swap with 0s and with 2s. So 1s can move past 0s and 2s. But 0s and 2s can't move past each other. So the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So the problem reduces to:\n\nThe 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order. But between them, we can arrange the 1s. Also, the 1s can be moved around between the 0s and 2s. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the original string is \"012\". Then, since 0 and 1 can be swapped, and 1 and 2 can be swapped, but 0 and 2 can't. So the possible permutations would be:\n\nOriginal: 0 1 2\n\nWe can swap 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then swap 0 and 2? No. So we can't. But then, swap the 0 and 1 again. Or, swap the 1 and 2 to get 1 2 0? No, because the 1 and 2 are adjacent. So the original string can be transformed into 0 2 1 (by swapping 1 and 2 first?), wait:\n\nOriginal is 0 1 2. Swap 1 and 2 to get 0 2 1. That's allowed. So now the 0 is before the 2, and the 1 is after. So the 0 and 2's relative order is preserved. So the 0 is before the 2. So that's allowed. So in this case, the 1 can move between the 0 and 2. So the 1 can be placed anywhere between the 0 and 2, but the 0 and 2 are fixed in their original order.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the 0s and 2s must appear in the same order as in the original string. However, the 1s can be arranged between them, and also can be moved around.\n\nSo the approach would be to arrange all the 1s in between the 0s and 2s, but keeping the order of 0s and 2s. So the minimal string would be to have as many 0s as possible at the beginning, then 1s, then 2s. But how?\n\nWait, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order. So for example, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, the 0 must come before the 2. But between them, we can arrange 1s. So the problem becomes:\n\nWe need to arrange the 1s in the positions where they can be moved. So for example, the 1s can be placed between the 0s and 2s, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order.\n\nSo here's an idea: the minimal string would be constructed by grouping all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and inserting the 1s in between. But how?\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved anywhere between the 0s and 2s. So perhaps the minimal string would be to arrange all the 0s first, then the 1s, then the 2s. But that's only possible if the original string's 0s and 2s are in such an order. For example, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then the 0 must come before the 2. So in that case, the minimal string would have all the 0s, then the 1s, then the 2s. But if the original string has a 2 followed by a 0, then the 2 must come before the 0. So the minimal string would have the 2s first, then the 1s, then the 0s. But that's not possible if there are 0s and 2s in the original string. Wait, but the original order of 0s and 2s must be preserved. So if the original string has a 2 followed by a 0, then in the final string, the 2 must come before the 0. But that's not allowed if we want to arrange 0s first. So that's impossible. Therefore, the minimal string depends on the order of 0s and 2s in the original string.\n\nSo the key idea is that the 0s and 2s must remain in their original order. But between them, we can arrange the 1s. So the problem reduces to grouping all the 1s between the 0s and 2s, but keeping the 0s and 2s in their original order.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Split the original string into three groups: the 0s, 1s, and 2s. But that's not correct, because the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So the correct way is to collect all the 0s and 2s in the order they appear, and then insert the 1s in between.\n\nWait, but how? Let's think of the 0s and 2s as a sequence. For example, suppose the original string is '012'. The 0s and 2s are [0, 2]. So in the final string, the 0 must come before the 2. Between them, we can insert the 1s. So the minimal string would be 0 followed by 1s followed by 2. But in this case, there's one 1. So the result is 012. Which is already the minimal.\n\nAnother example: original string is '20'. Then the 0s and 2s are [2, 0], but since we can't swap 2 and 0, the order must be preserved. So the minimal string is '20', which is the original. So the answer is correct.\n\nAnother example: '100210' from the sample input. The original string is '100210'. Let's process it. The 0s and 2s in the original string are:\n\nLooking at the original string: characters are 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0. So the 0s and 2s are 0, 0, 2, 0. So the order is 0, 0, 2, 0. So the 0s and 2s must appear in that order. So the 0s and 2s are [0, 0, 2, 0]. Now, the 1s are in the original string. How many 1s are there? The original string has two 1s. Let's see: the original string is '1','0','0','2','1','0' → the 1s are at positions 0 and 4. So total two 1s. Now, how to arrange them between the 0s and 2s.\n\nBut since the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order, the 1s can be inserted in between. So the minimal string would be to arrange the 1s in the positions between the 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nWait, the minimal lex string would be to have as many 0s as possible first, then 1s, then 2s. But given that the 0s and 2s are in their original order, perhaps we need to arrange the 1s in between them. For example, in the original 0s and 2s sequence, between each pair of consecutive elements, we can insert 1s. But how to arrange that optimally.\n\nLet me think of the 0s and 2s as a list. For example, the example '100210' gives the list of 0, 0, 2, 0. The 1s are two. Now, the minimal string would be to place the 1s in the positions where they can be inserted between the 0s and 2s. But since the 1s can be moved anywhere between the 0s and 2s, perhaps the minimal way is to group all the 1s between the 0s and 2s. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think of the 0s and 2s as fixed in their order. The minimal string would be to have all 0s first, then 1s, then 2s. But this is only possible if the original 0s and 2s are ordered such that all 0s come before 2s. For example, if the original 0s and 2s sequence is [0, 0, 2, 0], then the 0s and 2s are not all 0s first. So that would not be possible. Because the 2 comes before the last 0. So in this case, the 0s and 2s sequence is 0, 0, 2, 0. So the 2 is in between the 0s. So the minimal string would have to arrange the 1s in the positions where they can be placed. So for example, the 1s can be placed before the 2, between the 0s and the 2, and between the 2 and the 0. But how to arrange that.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved anywhere between the 0s and 2s. For example, in the sequence [0, 0, 2, 0], the 1s can be inserted in any positions between these elements. So for example, between the first 0 and the second 0, between the second 0 and the 2, between the 2 and the last 0, etc. But since the 1s are all the same, the minimal lex string would be to insert all the 1s as early as possible. Because 1 is larger than 0 but smaller than 2. So inserting them between 0s and 2s would help.\n\nWait, the minimal lex string would have as many 0s as possible first, then 1s, then 2s. But how to do that given the original order of 0s and 2s.\n\nLet me think of the 0s and 2s as fixed in their order. So for example, the sequence of 0s and 2s is S = [s_0, s_1, ..., s_k], where each s_i is either 0 or 2. Now, between each pair of consecutive elements in S, we can insert some number of 1s. Also, before the first element of S, and after the last element of S, we can insert 1s.\n\nBut the minimal lex string would be to arrange the 1s in the earliest possible positions. Because inserting 1s earlier would make the string lex smaller. But wait, inserting 1s before the 0s would be worse than putting them after the 0s. Because 0 is smaller than 1. So for example, if we have a 0 and insert a 1 before it, the string would start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So the optimal way is to insert all the 1s in between the 0s and 2s in such a way that the 1s are placed between the 0s and 2s, but as much as possible before the 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to collect all the 1s and then insert them between the 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Let's call this list 'fixed'.\n\n2. Collect all the 1s into a list, say 'ones'.\n\n3. Now, the problem is to insert the 'ones' into the 'fixed' list, inserting them between the elements of 'fixed' (including before the first element and after the last element) in a way that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to do that insertion optimally.\n\nBecause inserting the 1s as early as possible would be better. But inserting them in certain positions might be better.\n\nFor example, consider inserting between two elements of 'fixed' that are 0 and 2. Inserting the 1s between them would allow the 1s to be between the 0 and 2. Which is better than inserting them after the 2.\n\nBecause inserting between the 0 and 2 would give a 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than putting the 1s after the 2 (since 1 is less than 2).\n\nSo the optimal way is to insert all the 1s between the elements of the fixed list, but in such a way that they are placed in the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not cause a higher lex order.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the fixed list as a sequence of elements, and between each pair of consecutive elements, we can insert some number of 1s. Additionally, before the first element, and after the last element, insert some 1s.\n\nBut since the 1s are all the same, the minimal lex string would be achieved by inserting all the 1s as early as possible. However, inserting them before the first element (if possible) would be worse than inserting them after the 0s. Wait, inserting 1s before the first element would make the string start with 1s, but if the first element is 0, that's worse than having 0s first.\n\nSo the best way is to insert the 1s in between the 0s and 2s where they can be placed between 0 and 2, but also between 0 and 0, or between 2 and 2, or between 2 and 0.\n\nBut the minimal lex string would be to insert all 1s in the earliest possible positions where inserting them doesn't cause a higher lex order.\n\nLet me think of the fixed list as a sequence of elements. For example, fixed is [0, 0, 2, 0].\n\nNow, the 1s can be inserted in between the elements. For example, between the first 0 and second 0, between the second 0 and 2, between the 2 and the 0, or before the first element, or after the last element.\n\nBut inserting 1s before the first element would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So we should avoid that. Similarly, inserting 1s after the last element (which is 0) would be okay, but perhaps inserting them earlier is better.\n\nSo the optimal way is to insert all the 1s in between the elements of the fixed list where inserting them would be beneficial.\n\nBut how to decide where to insert them.\n\nSince the 1s can be placed in any of the possible gaps between the elements of the fixed list. For example, the number of gaps is len(fixed) + 1. For example, for fixed of length 4, there are 5 gaps.\n\nEach gap can have zero or more 1s. But all the 1s must be inserted into these gaps.\n\nTo make the lex smallest string, we want to insert the 1s in the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not lead to a higher lex order.\n\nBut how to determine which gaps to choose.\n\nLet's think about the gaps. Each gap is between two elements of the fixed list. For example, between elements i and i+1 in fixed. Let's consider the first gap (before the first element) and the rest.\n\nThe first gap (before the first element) is only allowed to have 1s if the first element is 1, but since fixed contains only 0s and 2s, the first element is 0 or 2. So inserting 1s before the first element would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. Hence, we should not insert any 1s into that gap.\n\nSimilarly, for the other gaps. For each gap between two elements in fixed, say between a and b, inserting 1s here would be better if that allows the 1s to be placed in positions where they are not preceded by higher characters.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe key is to find for each gap, whether inserting 1s here would be better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nFor example, consider a gap between a 0 and a 2. Inserting 1s here would allow the 1s to be between 0 and 2, which is better than inserting them after the 2 (since 1 is less than 2). So inserting as many 1s as possible into this gap is better.\n\nAnother example: a gap between two 0s. Inserting 1s here would be worse than inserting them after the 0s (since inserting between 0s would create a 0, then 1s, then 0, which is better than inserting after the 0s, which would be 0s followed by 1s, then 0s. Wait, no. For example, inserting between two 0s would create 0, 1s, 0. Which is better than inserting after the first 0 and before the second 0. Wait, but inserting 1s between two 0s would be better than inserting them after the second 0. Because inserting between the two 0s would have the 1s between two 0s, which is better than placing them after the second 0, which would be followed by the next elements (like 2s, etc). So inserting 1s in between 0s would be better than inserting them after the 0s, but perhaps not as good as inserting them between 0 and 2.\n\nSo the priority is to insert the 1s in the earliest possible gaps that can be as early as possible, but considering the surrounding elements.\n\nAn alternative approach: for each gap between elements in the fixed list, determine the optimal position to insert the 1s.\n\nThe idea is that inserting 1s into a gap between elements a and b is better if a is as small as possible and b is as large as possible. Because inserting 1s here would allow the 1s to be placed in between a and b, which could be between a 0 and a 2. So the optimal is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible gaps that are between a 0 and a 2.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother way to think is that the 1s can be placed in any gaps, but to minimize the lex order, we should insert them as far left as possible. However, inserting them in certain positions may be better than others.\n\nFor example, if we have a gap between a 0 and a 2, inserting the 1s here is better than inserting them after the 2. Because inserting between the 0 and 2 would result in 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than 0 followed by 2 followed by 1s.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- For all the gaps between elements in the fixed list, find the earliest gap where inserting the 1s will not cause a higher lex order. Then insert all the 1s into that gap.\n\nBut how to find that gap.\n\nLet me think of the gaps as follows. Each gap is between two elements, or before the first element, or after the last element. We can iterate through the gaps in order and decide where to insert the 1s.\n\nThe earliest possible position where inserting 1s would be beneficial is the first gap where the current element is 0 and the next element is 2. Because inserting 1s here would allow us to have 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than having 0 followed by 2 followed by 1s. So inserting all 1s into this gap would be optimal.\n\nIf there are multiple such gaps, inserting them into the earliest one would be better.\n\nAlternatively, if there are no such gaps, then we need to find other gaps where inserting 1s would be better.\n\nBut what if there are multiple 0s and 2s in the fixed list?\n\nLet me think of an example. Fixed list is [0, 0, 2, 0]. The gaps are:\n\nGap 0: before the first 0.\n\nGap 1: between first 0 and second 0.\n\nGap 2: between second 0 and 2.\n\nGap 3: between 2 and 0.\n\nGap 4: after the last 0.\n\nWe want to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible gaps. Let's see:\n\n- Gap 0: inserting 1s here would start with 1s followed by 0s, which is worse than starting with 0s.\n\n- Gap 1: between 0 and 0. Inserting 1s here would create 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. This is better than inserting after the 0s (gap 4) where the 1s would be after the 0s. For example, inserting 1s in gap 1 would have 0, 1s, 0, 2, 0. Whereas inserting them in gap 4 would have 0, 0, 2, 0, 1s. The former is better since the 1s are placed earlier. However, inserting them in gap 2 (between 0 and 2) would be better than inserting them in gap 1. Because inserting in gap 2 would have 0, 0, 1s, 2, 0. Which is better than inserting in gap 1 (0, 1s, 0, 2, 0). Because the first difference is at position 2: 0 vs 1. Wait, no. Let's compare:\n\nIf we insert 1s in gap 1 (between first and second 0), then the string would be 0, 1s, 0, 2, 0.\n\nIf we insert 1s in gap 2 (between second 0 and 2), then the string would be 0, 0, 1s, 2, 0.\n\nWhich one is lex smaller? Let's compare the two possibilities.\n\nTake the first character: both start with 0.\n\nSecond character: in the first case, it's 1 (if there are 1s inserted here), in the second case, it's 0. So the second case is better. Because 0 is smaller than 1. So inserting the 1s in gap 2 would be worse than inserting them in gap 1. Wait, no! Wait, inserting them in gap 1 would have the 1s in the second position. Inserting them in gap 2 would have the 1s after the second 0. So the first case would have 0, 1, ... whereas the second case would have 0, 0, ... So the second case is better. So inserting the 1s in gap 1 is worse than inserting them in gap 2.\n\nWait, so why? Because inserting them in gap 2 (after the second 0) allows the 0s to be earlier, and the 1s are later. So the first occurrence of 1 is later, which is better.\n\nSo this suggests that inserting the 1s in the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not cause the 1s to be before a 0. So the optimal strategy is to insert the 1s as far to the left as possible, but in such a way that the 1s are placed after 0s and before 2s.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAnother approach: the 1s can be placed in any of the gaps. To minimize the lex order, we want to insert the 1s as far to the left as possible, but ensuring that inserting them into a gap does not create a situation where the 1s are placed before a 0 (which would be worse than placing them after the 0).\n\nWait, but inserting the 1s into a gap between two elements a and b. If a is 0 and b is 2, inserting the 1s here is good. If a is 0 and b is 0, inserting the 1s here would create 0, 1s, 0. Which is worse than inserting the 1s after the 0s (so that the 1s are after the 0s, leading to more 0s first). But inserting the 1s here would allow the 1s to be placed between the 0s, but that would make the string have a 1 earlier than it would otherwise. For example, inserting the 1s between the two 0s would create 0, 1s, 0, 2, 0. Whereas inserting them after the second 0 would create 0, 0, 2, 0, 1s. The first case has a 1 earlier, which makes the string lex larger. So inserting into this gap is worse than inserting into the later gaps.\n\nThus, the optimal way is to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not introduce a 1 before a 0. So the earliest gaps where the current element is 0 and the next is 2. Because inserting there would allow the 1s to be between 0 and 2, which is better than inserting after the 2.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nCollect all the 1s.\n\nIterate through the gaps between the elements of the fixed list. For each gap, check if inserting the 1s here would help. The first gap where the previous element is 0 and the next element is 2 is the best place to insert all the 1s.\n\nIf there is no such gap, then we can insert the 1s in the earliest possible gap where inserting them would not cause a problem. For example, if there are no 0s followed by 2s, then all the 0s are before the 2s, or all the 2s are before the 0s. Let's think:\n\nCase 1: All 0s are before 2s. Then the fixed list is something like [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2]. In this case, inserting all the 1s between the 0s and the 2s would be best. So inserting them in the gap between the last 0 and first 2.\n\nCase 2: All 2s are before 0s. Then the fixed list is [2, 2, 0, 0]. Then inserting the 1s between the 2s and 0s would be best. But inserting between 2 and 0 would create 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is better than inserting after the 0s (since 1 is less than 2). So inserting between 2 and 0 would be better.\n\nBut how to find this gap.\n\nSo the general approach is to find the earliest gap where inserting the 1s would be as early as possible, but in a way that the 1s are placed between a 0 and a 2 (if possible), or between a 2 and a 0 (if necessary), or between 0s or 2s.\n\nAlternatively, for each gap between elements a and b in the fixed list, the decision to insert the 1s into this gap depends on the following:\n\nIf a is 0 and b is 2, then inserting here is the best option.\n\nIf a is 2 and b is 0, then inserting here would be worse than inserting after the 2s (because inserting between 2 and 0 would have 2 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is worse than inserting the 1s after the 2s and before the 0s. Wait, no. Because inserting between 2 and 0 would have 2, 1s, 0. Which is better than inserting after the 2s and before the 0s, which would be 2, 1s, 0. Wait, that's the same thing. So inserting the 1s between the 2 and 0 is the same as inserting them after the 2 and before the 0. So that's the same gap.\n\nSo the main idea is to find the earliest gap where inserting the 1s would not cause a problem. Once we find such a gap, insert all the 1s there.\n\nIf there are no such gaps (i.e., all 0s come before 2s or all 2s come before 0s), then we can insert the 1s between the 0s and 2s (if there are any 0s and 2s).\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- Split the original string into the fixed list (0s and 2s in order) and collect the 1s.\n\n- For the fixed list, we need to find the earliest gap where inserting the 1s would be beneficial.\n\nLet me think of the fixed list as a list of elements. For each gap between elements (including before the first and after the last), we can consider inserting the 1s.\n\nWe want to find the earliest gap where inserting the 1s would be better than inserting them elsewhere. Let's think of the following:\n\nIf there is a gap between a 0 and a 2, inserting the 1s here is the best choice. Because that way, the 1s are between 0 and 2, which is better than inserting them after the 2s (which would be followed by 2s) or before the 0s (which would be preceded by nothing, but that's worse).\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\n- Find the first occurrence of a 0 followed by a 2 in the fixed list. Insert all the 1s into the gap between them.\n\n- If there is no such occurrence, then check if there are any 0s and 2s. If there are, then insert the 1s between the last 0 and first 2 (if all 0s are before 2s) or between the last 2 and first 0 (if all 2s are before 0s).\n\n- If there are no 0s or no 2s, then insert the 1s at the earliest possible position.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, the following approach can be used:\n\nWe can iterate through the fixed list and for each gap, decide whether inserting the 1s here would be better than inserting them elsewhere. We can find the earliest gap where inserting the 1s would not create a higher lex order.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nFor each gap, the decision to insert the 1s here depends on the surrounding elements. For example, if the current gap is between a and b:\n\n- If a is 0 and b is 2, then inserting the 1s here is the best option. So we should insert all the 1s here.\n\n- If a is 0 and b is 0, inserting the 1s here would be worse than inserting them later. So we should not insert them here unless there are no better options.\n\n- If a is 2 and b is 0, inserting the 1s here would be better than inserting them after the 2s (since inserting between 2 and 0 would allow the 1s to be between 2 and 0, which is better than inserting after the 2s and before the 0s (which is the same thing). So this is the same as inserting between them.\n\n- If a is 2 and b is 2, inserting the 1s here would be worse than inserting them after the 2s.\n\nSo the idea is to find the earliest gap where inserting the 1s would not increase the lex order. For example, inserting them between 0 and 2, or between 2 and 0.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nLoop through the gaps in the fixed list in order. For each gap, check if inserting the 1s here would be better than inserting them elsewhere. Once such a gap is found, insert all the 1s there and break.\n\nHow to check if inserting the 1s here is better than elsewhere.\n\nFor example, for a gap between a and b:\n\n- If a is 0 and b is 2, then inserting here is the best possible option. So insert all the 1s here.\n\n- If a is 0 and b is 0, then inserting the 1s here would create a 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than inserting the 1s after the 0s (but inserting after the 0s would be in a later gap, which may be better). So we can skip this gap and look for better ones.\n\n- If a is 2 and b is 0, inserting here would create 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which is better than inserting the 1s after the 2s (since inserting after the 2s would be 2 followed by 1s, then 0. Which is the same as inserting here. So this is a valid candidate.\n\n- If a is 2 and b is 2, then inserting here would be worse than inserting after the 2s.\n\nSo the first gap that is either between 0 and 2 or between 2 and 0 is the best candidate. Once found, insert all the 1s here.\n\nIf there are no such gaps, then the fixed list consists of all 0s or all 2s. In this case, we can insert the 1s either at the beginning (if all are 0s) or at the end (if all are 2s), but wait:\n\nIf the fixed list is all 0s, then inserting the 1s after the 0s would be better than inserting them before. Because inserting after the 0s would have 0s followed by 1s, which is better than inserting before (which would have 1s followed by 0s).\n\nIf the fixed list is all 2s, then inserting the 1s before the 2s would be better than inserting after. Because inserting before",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing specific adjacent swaps on a given ternary string. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. The key insight is that the relative order of '0's and '2's in the original string must remain unchanged, while '1's can be freely rearranged between them.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Separate Characters**: Split the input string into two parts: one containing only '0's and '2's (maintaining their original order), and another containing all '1's.\n2. **Determine Insertion Points**: Identify the optimal positions to insert the collected '1's into the sequence of '0's and '2's. The optimal insertion point is the first gap where a '0' is immediately followed by a '2' or a '2' is immediately followed by a '0'.\n3. **Insert '1's**: Insert all collected '1's into the identified gap to ensure the resulting string is lexicographically smallest.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    fixed = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            fixed.append(c)\n    \n    # Find the best position to insert the ones\n    insert_pos = 0\n    found = False\n    for i in range(len(fixed)):\n        if fixed[i] == '0' and i < len(fixed) - 1 and fixed[i+1] == '2':\n            insert_pos = i + 1\n            found = True\n            break\n        elif fixed[i] == '2' and i < len(fixed) - 1 and fixed[i+1] == '0':\n            insert_pos = i + 1\n            found = True\n            break\n    \n    if not found:\n        # Check if there are both 0s and 2s\n        has_zero = '0' in fixed\n        has_two = '2' in fixed\n        if has_zero and has_two:\n            # Find the first 0 and last 0, first 2 and last 2\n            first_two = fixed.index('2')\n            last_zero = len(fixed) - 1 - fixed[::-1].index('0')\n            if first_two > last_zero:\n                # All 2s before 0s\n                insert_pos = first_two\n            else:\n                # All 0s before 2s\n                insert_pos = last_zero + 1\n        else:\n            # All are 0s or all are 2s\n            if fixed and fixed[0] == '0':\n                insert_pos = len(fixed)\n            else:\n                insert_pos = 0\n    \n    # Now construct the result\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(fixed)):\n        if i == insert_pos:\n            result.extend(ones)\n        result.append(fixed[i])\n    if insert_pos == len(fixed):\n        result.extend(ones)\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input and output the results\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    inputs = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in inputs:\n        s = line.strip()\n        print(min_ternary_string(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Separation of Characters**: The input string is split into two lists: `fixed` for '0's and '2's, and `ones` for '1's.\n- **Finding Insertion Point**: The algorithm checks for the earliest gap between '0' and '2' or '2' and '0' to insert the '1's.
