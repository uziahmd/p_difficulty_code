    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the sum of d(1,n) for all good trees. Let me first understand what a good tree is.\n\nSo, a good tree is an edge-weighted tree where each edge has weight 1 or -1. And for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i must be -1. Oh right, because each vertex's edges' product is -1. \n\nWait, for each vertex, the product of the edge weights connected to it is -1. So, for example, if a vertex has degree k, then the product of those k edges is -1. That's a crucial condition. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out which trees are considered good. Then, for those trees, compute d(1,n), which is the sum of the edge weights along the path from node 1 to node n, and sum that over all good trees.\n\nBut how do I approach this? Let's think about the constraints for a tree to be good.\n\nLet me consider the product condition. For each vertex, the product of its adjacent edges is -1. Let's think about the degrees of the vertices. Suppose a vertex has degree d. The product of its edges is -1. Since each edge contributes either +1 or -1, the product is -1. So, the number of edges with weight -1 incident to the vertex must be odd. Because (-1)^k * (1)^{d -k} = (-1)^k. For this to be -1, k must be odd. Therefore, each vertex must have an odd number of edges with weight -1. \n\nBut wait, the product of all edges adjacent to vertex i is -1. So for each vertex, the product is -1. But each edge is between two vertices. So, for each edge, its weight contributes to the product of both of its endpoints. \n\nThis seems like a system of equations. Let me think about this. For each vertex, the product of the edges incident to it is -1. Let me take the product of all these equations for all vertices. \n\nThe product of all vertex products would be (-1)^n. On the other hand, each edge is counted twice in this product (once for each endpoint). So, for each edge, its weight is multiplied twice. So the product of all vertex products is (product of (edge weight)^2) for all edges. Since each edge's weight is squared, that becomes 1^m, where m is the number of edges. So the product of all vertex products is 1. \n\nBut the left-hand side is (-1)^n. Therefore, (-1)^n must equal 1. Which implies that n must be even. Wait, that's a key point. \n\nSo for there to exist any good trees, n must be even. Otherwise, there are no good trees. \n\nWait, let me check this. Let me suppose that n is even. Then (-1)^n is 1, which matches the product of all vertex products. If n is odd, then (-1)^n is -1, which can't equal 1. Therefore, when n is odd, there are no good trees. \n\nSo for the problem, if n is 1, then there's only one vertex. But the product condition for that vertex would require the product of all edges incident to it. But since it's a single node, there are zero edges. The product of zero terms is 1. But the condition requires it to be -1. Therefore, for n=1, there are no good trees. \n\nSimilarly, for n=2, the product condition: each vertex must have product of edges incident to it equal to -1. For n=2, there's only one edge between the two nodes. Each vertex has exactly one edge. So the product for each vertex is the weight of that edge. Therefore, the product must be -1. Therefore, the edge must be -1. So the only good tree is the one with that edge being -1. And the sum d(1,2) is -1. Which matches the first example.\n\nSo, for the problem, when n is 1, the answer is 0 (since there are no good trees). When n is odd, the answer is 0 as well. Only when n is even, there might be some trees contributing.\n\nSo the first thing to check is whether n is even. If not, output 0. But wait, n=1 is also odd, and the answer is 0. So the code can start with checking if n is even. If not, return 0.\n\nBut let's confirm this. For example, the second sample input is n=1, output is 0. For n=2, output is -1 mod 998... which is 998244352. So yes, the code needs to handle that.\n\nSo, for the rest of the problem, we can assume that n is even. Now, the question is: How many good trees are there? And what is the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees?\n\nBut perhaps there's a clever way to compute this sum without enumerating all possible trees, which would be impossible for large n.\n\nLet me think about the conditions again. For each vertex, the product of the edges adjacent to it is -1. Let me think of each edge's weight as a variable. Let me denote the edges as variables w_e âˆˆ {1, -1}.\n\nFor each vertex v, the product of w_e for all edges e incident to v is -1.\n\nThis seems like a system of equations. However, since each edge is part of two vertices, there's a dependency here. Let me think about the number of constraints.\n\nFor example, in a tree with n nodes, there are n-1 edges. The number of equations is n. But each equation is multiplicative. However, the product of all equations gives us 1 (as discussed earlier), so the system is over-constrained. Hence, there's a dependency among the equations. Therefore, the number of independent equations is n-1. \n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as assigning variables to edges such that for each vertex, the product of the edges adjacent to it is -1. Let me take the logarithm? No, since we are dealing with multiplicative products. Maybe think in terms of parity. For each vertex, the number of edges with weight -1 adjacent to it must be odd. Because (-1)^k = -1 implies k is odd.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: Assign to each edge a value of +1 or -1, such that for every vertex, the number of edges adjacent to it with weight -1 is odd. \n\nBut how can this be done? Let me think about the parity conditions. For each vertex, the sum (mod 2) of the number of -1 edges adjacent to it is 1. \n\nBut since each edge connects two vertices, changing the weight of an edge affects the parity of two vertices. \n\nThis seems similar to a system of linear equations over GF(2). Let me model this. Let me consider each edge as a variable x_e, which is 0 if the weight is 1, and 1 if the weight is -1. Then, for each vertex v, the sum of x_e for all edges incident to v must be 1 mod 2. \n\nSo, the problem becomes solving a system of linear equations over GF(2). The variables are the edges (n-1 variables), and the equations are the n constraints that the sum of x_e around each vertex is 1. However, as before, the sum of all equations is equal to the sum of degrees mod 2. Wait, each edge is counted twice (once for each endpoint), so sum over all equations is sum (sum x_e for edges adjacent to v) ) = sum (degree(v) * ... no, wait, each edge is counted twice. So sum over all equations is 2 * sum x_e for all edges. Which is 0 mod 2. But the sum of the right-hand sides is sum 1 for each of the n equations, which is n mod 2. Therefore, for the system to be solvable, we must have n â‰¡ 0 mod 2. Which aligns with our previous conclusion. So for n even, the system is solvable. \n\nSo, the system has solutions only when n is even. And when n is even, how many solutions are there?\n\nIn linear algebra over GF(2), the number of solutions depends on the rank of the system. The system has n equations, but they are not independent. Since the sum of all equations is 0 mod 2 (as discussed), and the sum of RHS is n mod 2. For the system to be consistent, n mod 2 must be 0, which is satisfied. \n\nSo the system has rank (n-1), assuming that the equations are not all dependent. So the number of solutions is 2^{(number of variables - rank)}. The variables are n-1 edges. The rank is n-1? Let me think. \n\nThe system has n equations, but they are dependent. The sum of all equations is 0 mod 2. So the rank is at most n-1. If the system is consistent, then the rank is exactly n-1. Therefore, the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1? Wait that can't be. Because for example, when n=2, there is exactly one solution (the edge must be -1). Which is 1 solution. So for n=2, the number of solutions is 1. But according to this formula, 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1. Which matches. \n\nBut what about for larger n? Let's take n=4. How many solutions are there? Let's think. Suppose the tree is arbitrary. For example, take a tree with 4 nodes arranged as a chain: 1-2-3-4. The equations are:\n\nFor vertex 1: x_1 (the edge between 1-2) must be 1 mod 2.\n\nFor vertex 2: x_1 + x_2 (edge 2-3) = 1 mod 2.\n\nFor vertex 3: x_2 + x_3 (edge 3-4) = 1 mod 2.\n\nFor vertex 4: x_3 = 1 mod 2.\n\nSolving these equations:\n\nFrom vertex 1: x_1 = 1.\n\nFrom vertex 4: x_3 = 1.\n\nFrom vertex 2: 1 + x_2 = 1 â†’ x_2 = 0.\n\nFrom vertex 3: 0 + 1 = 1 â†’ 1=1. Which holds. So the solution is unique. So for this tree, there's exactly one solution. \n\nBut the number of solutions depends on the structure of the tree? Or is it always one solution?\n\nWait, but the system of equations is for the tree. For any tree, the system has exactly one solution. Because the system has rank n-1. So the number of solutions is 2^{ (n-1) - (n-1) } } = 1. \n\nSo regardless of the tree structure, the system has exactly one solution. Therefore, for each tree structure (i.e., each possible tree topology), there is exactly one assignment of edge weights that satisfies the conditions. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1} ... no. Wait, no. The total number of edge-weighted trees is n^{n-2} * 2^{n-1}. But the good trees are those that satisfy the product condition. For each tree structure (there are n^{n-2} of them), there's exactly one way to assign the weights (as per the system of equations). Therefore, the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} * 1. Because for each tree, exactly one weight assignment satisfies the conditions. \n\nWait, that's a big insight. So for each tree structure, there's exactly one way to assign the edge weights to make it good. Therefore, the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} (the number of tree structures) multiplied by 1 (the number of valid weight assignments per structure). \n\nBut wait, in the first example, n=2. The number of tree structures is 1 (only one tree). The number of valid weight assignments is 1. So total good trees is 1. Which matches the example. \n\nIn the third example, n=4. The output says there are 16 good trees. Let's check: n^{n-2} = 4^2 = 16. So yes. Which matches. So the total number of good trees is indeed n^{n-2} for even n. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: For all possible trees (n^{n-2} of them), each with exactly one valid weight assignment, compute the sum of d(1,n) over all these trees. \n\nNow the challenge is to compute this sum efficiently. \n\nBut how? Since n can be up to 5e5, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution. \n\nLet me think about the sum. For each tree structure, we have exactly one weight assignment. So the sum is the sum over all tree structures of d(1,n) for that tree's unique weight assignment. \n\nSo the problem becomes: find the sum over all trees T of d_T(1,n), where d_T(1,n) is the sum of the edge weights along the path from 1 to n in T, under the unique weight assignment that makes T good. \n\nBut how to compute this sum?\n\nLet me think about the properties of the weight assignment. For each tree, the weights are determined by the system of equations. Let's think of the weight assignment as determined by the parity conditions. \n\nLet me think of the equations again. For each vertex v, the sum of x_e (where x_e is 1 if the edge is -1, else 0) for edges incident to v is 1 mod 2. \n\nThis is equivalent to saying that the number of -1 edges adjacent to each vertex is odd. \n\nNow, for a given tree, how can we compute the weights? \n\nThis seems like a system that can be solved via a spanning tree approach. For example, in a tree, we can choose a root (say, node 1), and perform a traversal to assign the x_e variables. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model the weight assignment. Let me think about the following: \n\nSuppose we pick an arbitrary tree structure. Let's assign variables to edges. Let me think of the tree as a rooted tree, say rooted at node 1. For each node except the root, there's a unique parent. Then, for each node, the parity condition can be used to determine the x_e of the edge between the node and its parent. \n\nWait, for example, consider the root node (node 1). Its parity condition is that the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. Suppose node 1 has children. Let's say there are k children. The sum of the x_e for the edges from node 1 to each child must be 1 mod 2. But how does that help us?\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Suppose we have a tree. Let's pick any root (like node 1). For each node, except the root, we can determine the x_e of the edge connecting it to its parent. \n\nLet me think of the root node. The sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. However, the root has some children. Let me consider the subtree. For example, suppose the root has a child v. The edge between root and v is e. For node v, the sum of x_e (for edges adjacent to v) must be 1 mod 2. The edges adjacent to v include e and the edges to its children. \n\nBut maybe there's a way to assign the variables. Let me think of the following approach. For any tree, the system of equations can be solved uniquely. Let me think of the equations as follows. For each node except the root, we can set the variable x_e for the edge between it and its parent based on the parity condition of the node. \n\nFor example, suppose we root the tree at node 1. For each node v (other than the root), the parity condition for v is that the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to v is 1 mod 2. Let me denote the edge between v and its parent as e_v. The other edges are to children of v. But during traversal, we can process the tree in a way that allows us to determine x_e_v based on the parity condition of v. \n\nLet me think of this. For node v, the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. Suppose we have already processed all children of v. Then, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to v includes the edge to the parent (e_v) and the edges to the children. However, during traversal, when processing v, the edges to the children would have already been processed. Wait, no. If we are doing a post-order traversal, then for each node v, we process its children first. \n\nAlternatively, for the root node, the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. For the root, all edges are to children. But since the root's equation is sum x_e = 1 mod 2. However, the other nodes' equations can be used to determine their x_e values. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this. For example, for each non-root node v, the x_e for the edge between v and its parent is determined by the parity condition of v. Let me explain. \n\nSuppose v is not the root. Let's say that the edge between v and its parent p is e. The parity condition for v requires that the sum of x_e (for edges adjacent to v) is 1 mod 2. The edges adjacent to v include e and the edges to its children. However, during traversal, when we process v, we can assume that the edges to the children have already been processed. Wait, but that may not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, think of the following: For each node v (except the root), the x_e of the edge between v and its parent is determined by the parity condition of v. Let me think. \n\nLet me assume that for each node v (except the root), the parity of the number of -1 edges in its subtree (excluding the edge to the parent) is known. Then, the x_e for the edge to the parent can be determined. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better way. \n\nLet me think about the entire tree. For each node, the sum of x_e (edges adjacent) is 1 mod 2. Let me imagine that I can assign variables to edges in such a way that for each node, the sum of x_e is 1. \n\nBut since the tree is connected, the system has a unique solution. So, perhaps the sum of x_e along any path between two nodes can be determined. \n\nBut how does that relate to d(1, n)? \n\nWait, d(1, n) is the sum of the edge weights along the path from 1 to n. Each edge weight is either 1 or -1. So, if we can find the sum of the x_e variables (since x_e is 1 for -1 edge, 0 for +1) multiplied by -1? Wait, no. Because the actual weight is (-1)^x_e. Because if x_e is 0, the weight is 1. If x_e is 1, the weight is -1. \n\nSo the sum d(1, n) is the sum over edges e on the path from 1 to n of (-1)^{x_e}. \n\nBut how can we relate this to the x_e variables? \n\nAlternatively, since each x_e is 0 or 1, and the weight is -1 if x_e is 1, else 1. So the weight is 1 - 2x_e. Because 1 - 2*0 = 1, and 1 - 2*1 = -1. \n\nTherefore, the sum d(1,n) is the sum over the edges on the path from 1 to n of (1 - 2x_e) = (number of edges on the path) - 2 * sum x_e on the path. \n\nBut the number of edges on the path from 1 to n is (depth of n) in the tree, assuming the tree is rooted at 1. But since the tree is arbitrary, the depth varies. However, for any tree, the path between 1 and n is unique, and has length (distance between 1 and n). Let's denote this length as L. So, d(1,n) = L - 2 * sum_{e in path} x_e. \n\nBut how can we compute the sum over all trees of this quantity?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the sum over all trees of [L - 2 * sum x_e]. Which is equal to sum_L (over all trees) - 2 * sum (sum x_e over path). \n\nBut sum_L is the sum over all trees of the length of the path from 1 to n. \n\nBut how can we compute this? For example, for each tree, the length of the path from 1 to n depends on the structure of the tree. \n\nBut this seems difficult. However, perhaps there's a way to find the expected value of this sum and multiply by the number of trees. But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find that the sum over all trees of sum x_e is something manageable. \n\nBut let's think again. For each tree, the x_e variables are determined uniquely by the system of equations. So, for each edge e, what is the contribution of x_e to the sum over all trees? \n\nBut how can we find for each edge e, the sum over all trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by x_e (which is 0 or 1) ?\n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nWait, but perhaps the sum over all trees of d(1,n) can be expressed as sum_{trees} [sum_{e in path} (1 - 2x_e)] = sum_{trees} [L - 2 * sum_{e in path} x_e ] = sum_{trees} L - 2 * sum_{trees} sum_{e in path} x_e. \n\nBut how to compute these two terms?\n\nLet me first think about the first term, sum_{trees} L. Here, L is the length of the path from 1 to n in the tree. \n\nThe sum over all trees of the distance between 1 and n. \n\nThis seems like a standard combinatorial problem. How many trees have a certain distance between 1 and n? \n\nBut for large n, it's challenging to compute directly. However, perhaps there's a formula. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me think about the second term. \n\nThe second term is sum_{trees} sum_{e in path} x_e. \n\nBut since each tree has a unique x_e assignment, perhaps there's a way to find for each edge e, the probability (or count) that e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the value of x_e in that tree. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, note that for each tree, the x_e variables are determined by the system of equations. So, for each edge e, perhaps we can find the value of x_e in the unique assignment, and then multiply it by the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n. \n\nBut how to find x_e for a given edge e in a tree? \n\nThis seems complex. Perhaps there's another way. \n\nLet me think about the system of equations again. The variables x_e are determined by the system. For each tree, the x_e's are uniquely determined. \n\nLet me consider the following approach: For each tree, the x_e variables are determined by the system of equations. Let me consider the sum over all trees of the sum_{e in path} x_e. \n\nBut since each tree contributes a certain value, perhaps there's a way to find for each edge e, the total contribution of x_e across all trees where e is on the path from 1 to n. \n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think about the following: For a given tree, the sum over the path from 1 to n of x_e is equal to the number of edges on the path that are assigned x_e=1. \n\nBut how to find this for all trees?\n\nAnother idea: Since the x_e variables are determined by the system of equations, perhaps for each edge e, there's a way to find the value of x_e in terms of the structure of the tree. \n\nLet me think of the system again. For each node v, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to v is 1 mod 2. \n\nLet me imagine that I have a tree, and I want to compute the x_e variables. \n\nLet me root the tree at node 1. Then, for each node v, except the root, we can determine x_e for the edge between v and its parent. \n\nHow? \n\nFor node v, the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to v must be 1 mod 2. The edges adjacent to v are the edge to its parent (let's call it e_p), and the edges to its children (e_c1, e_c2, ...). \n\nBut during a traversal, suppose we have already processed the children of v. For example, in a post-order traversal, we process children before the parent. \n\nAt the time of processing v, the x_e for the edges to children are already determined. Let me denote the sum of x_e for the edges to children as S. Then, the equation for v is x_e_p + S = 1 mod 2. Therefore, x_e_p = 1 - S mod 2. \n\nSo, for each node v (not root), x_e_p (the edge between v and its parent) is determined by the sum of x_e for edges to children of v. \n\nFor the root node, the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. Since the root has no parent, all edges are to children. Let's denote the sum of x_e for those edges as S_root. Then, S_root must be 1 mod 2. \n\nBut this seems recursive. However, since the tree is connected, this system can be solved. \n\nBut how does this help us find the sum over all trees of d(1,n)?\n\nPerhaps for each tree, the sum of x_e along the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of times the parity flips along the path. \n\nAlternatively, think of the root as node 1. For the path from 1 to n, the x_e variables along this path are determined by the above process. \n\nBut how can we find the expected value of x_e for each edge e on the path? \n\nAlternatively, for each tree, the value of x_e depends on the structure of the tree. \n\nBut this seems too vague. Let me think of the entire problem again. \n\nWe need to find the sum over all trees T of d_T(1,n). \n\nLet me think of d_T(1,n) as the sum of weights along the path from 1 to n. \n\nBut since the weights are determined by the system of equations, perhaps there's a relation between the parity conditions and the path sum. \n\nLet me think about the following. For any tree, the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to n is equal to the sum of (1 - 2x_e) for each edge e on the path. \n\nWhich equals the length of the path (number of edges) minus 2 * sum x_e on the path. \n\nLet me denote this as L - 2 * S, where L is the length of the path and S is the sum of x_e on the path. \n\nSo the total sum over all trees is sum_T (L_T - 2 * S_T) = sum_T L_T - 2 * sum_T S_T. \n\nIf I can compute these two terms, I can get the answer. \n\nLet me think about the first term, sum_T L_T. \n\nWhat is the sum of the lengths of the path from 1 to n over all possible trees? \n\nThis seems like a known problem. \n\nFor example, in a labeled tree, the number of trees where the distance between 1 and n is k. \n\nBut how to compute the sum over all trees of the distance between 1 and n? \n\nLet me think of the total number of trees as n^{n-2}. \n\nThe average distance between 1 and n in a random labeled tree. \n\nBut I don't remember the formula. However, there's a known result that the expected distance between two nodes in a random labeled tree is 2(n-1)/(n+1). Wait, I'm not sure. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, for any two distinct nodes u and v, the number of trees where u and v are connected by an edge is (n-2) * n^{n-3} }? Wait, Cayley's formula says that the number of trees is n^{n-2}. For the number of trees where u and v are connected by an edge, we can think of it as follows: \n\nConsider the number of trees where u and v are connected. The number of such trees is (n-2) * n^{n-3} }? Or perhaps it's n^{n-2} multiplied by the probability that u and v are connected. \n\nAlternatively, for any two distinct nodes u and v, the number of trees where u and v are connected by an edge is n^{n-3} * 1. Because, for a tree, the number of trees containing a specific edge is (n-1)^{n-3} }? No, I'm not sure. \n\nWait, there's a formula for the number of trees on n labeled nodes where a particular edge is present. It is (n-2) * n^{n-3} }? Or perhaps n^{n-2} multiplied by the probability that a specific edge is present in a random tree. \n\nBut for a random labeled tree, the probability that a specific pair of nodes u and v are connected by an edge is 2/(n). Because for any tree, there are n-1 edges. The total number of possible pairs is C(n, 2). So the expected number of edges in a tree is (n-1) * [probability that any specific edge is present]. \n\nBut for a random tree, the probability that a specific edge exists is (number of trees containing that edge) / total number of trees. \n\nThe number of trees containing a specific edge uv can be calculated by considering that if we contract the edge uv into a single node, we get a tree with n-1 nodes. The number of such trees is (n-1)^{n-3} }, according to Cayley's formula. So the number of trees containing edge uv is (n-1)^{n-3} } * 1? Wait, no. Contracting uv into a single node, the number of trees on the new graph (with n-1 nodes) is (n-1)^{n-3} }, and each such tree corresponds to exactly one tree on the original n nodes with the edge uv. So the number of trees containing edge uv is (n-1)^{n-3} } * 1? Or is it (n-1)^{n-3} } * something else?\n\nActually, the number of labeled trees on n nodes containing a specific edge uv is (n-1)^{n-3} } * 1? No, the contraction approach says that the number of trees containing edge uv is equal to the number of trees on n-1 nodes (after contracting uv), which is (n-1)^{n-3} }, and hence the total number is (n-1)^{n-3} }.\n\nBut Cayley's formula says that the total number of trees on n nodes is n^{n-2}. So the probability that a specific edge is present is [(n-1)^{n-3}] / [n^{n-2}] ] = (n-1)^{n-3} / n^{n-2} } = 1/(n) * (n-1)^{n-3} / n^{n-3} } ) = 1/n * ( (n-1)/n )^{n-3} }? Not sure. \n\nBut for the purposes of calculating the sum of distances between 1 and n over all trees, perhaps we can find a generating function or use linearity of expectation. \n\nBut perhaps there's another way. \n\nThe sum over all trees of the distance between 1 and n. Let me denote this as S. \n\nNote that for each tree, the distance between 1 and n is the number of edges on the path between them. \n\nLet me think of the expected distance between 1 and n in a random labeled tree multiplied by the total number of trees (n^{n-2}).\n\nBut what's the expected distance between two nodes in a random labeled tree?\n\nI recall that in a random tree, the expected distance between two nodes is 2(n-1)/(n+1). But I'm not sure. Let me think for small cases. \n\nFor n=2, there is one tree, and the distance is 1. The expected value is 1. The formula would give 2(1)/3 = 2/3, which doesn't match. So that formula is incorrect. \n\nAnother approach: For two nodes u and v, the number of trees where the distance between them is k. \n\nBut I'm not aware of a direct formula. However, there's a result related to the number of trees where u and v are connected by a path of length k. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem as follows. For any two distinct nodes u and v, the number of trees where they are connected by an edge is (n-2) * n^{n-3} }? No, earlier reasoning said that the number of trees containing edge uv is (n-1)^{n-3} }, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, using PrÃ¼fer codes. Each tree can be represented by a PrÃ¼fer sequence of length n-2. The number of times a particular edge appears in the tree can be determined by the PrÃ¼fer code. \n\nFor example, the number of trees where the edge between u and v is present is equal to the number of PrÃ¼fer sequences where neither u nor v is the last element to be removed. Wait, I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the number of trees containing the edge uv is equal to (n-2) * n^{n-3} }? No, for n=2, it's 1, and the formula would give 0 * 2^{-1} = 0, which is wrong. \n\nThis seems too stuck. Let me think back to the original problem. \n\nMaybe there's a way to find that the sum over all trees of d(1,n) is zero for even n? But the sample input for n=4 has a sum of -10. Which is not zero. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of S_T (sum of x_e on the path) is equal to something that can be computed. \n\nLet me think about the sum over all trees of S_T. \n\nEach S_T is the sum of x_e for edges on the path from 1 to n in tree T. \n\nBut for each tree, the x_e variables are determined uniquely by the system of equations. \n\nBut perhaps for each edge e, we can find the total contribution of x_e across all trees where e is on the path from 1 to n. \n\nLet me denote this as C_e = number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the value of x_e in that tree. \n\nThen, sum_T S_T = sum_e C_e. \n\nSo if I can find for each edge e, the value of C_e, then I can compute the sum. \n\nBut how to find C_e?\n\nBut how is x_e determined for a given edge e in a tree T? \n\nLet me think about the system of equations again. For any tree T, the x_e's are determined uniquely. \n\nLet me imagine that for a given tree T, and a particular edge e, what is the value of x_e?\n\nIt depends on the structure of the tree. But perhaps there's a way to find it. \n\nLet me consider the following: For any tree T, the variables x_e are determined by the system of equations. \n\nLet me think of the tree as a graph. For each node v, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to v is 1 mod 2. \n\nLet me consider the sum of all these equations. As before, it's n mod 2, which is 0 for even n. \n\nBut how to find x_e for a particular edge e?\n\nLet me consider the following: Take any spanning tree, and imagine that I have to assign x_e such that for each node, the sum of x_e for incident edges is 1. \n\nLet me think of the tree as a rooted tree, and use the earlier approach. \n\nFor example, root the tree at node 1. Then, for each node v, the x_e of the edge between v and its parent is determined by the sum of x_e of its children. \n\nLet me define for each node v, a value f(v), which is the sum of x_e for edges in the subtree rooted at v. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, for each node v, after",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the distances from node 1 to node n for all good trees. A good tree is defined as an edge-weighted tree where each edge has a weight of either 1 or -1, and for each vertex, the product of the weights of its incident edges is -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Good Trees**: A good tree must satisfy the condition that the product of the weights of all edges incident to each vertex is -1. This implies that each vertex must have an odd number of edges with weight -1.\n2. **Constraints on n**: For a tree with `n` vertices to be good, `n` must be even. If `n` is odd, there are no good trees, and the result is 0.\n3. **Sum of Distances**: For each good tree, we need to compute the sum of the weights along the path from node 1 to node n. The distance `d(1, n)` is calculated as the sum of edge weights on this path.\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Using combinatorial properties and modular arithmetic, we can derive the result efficiently. The key insight is that the sum of distances for all good trees can be derived using properties of trees and modular inverses.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    if n % 2 != 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # For even n >= 2\n    # The answer is (-1) * (n-1) * pow(n, n-2, MOD) % MOD\n    # But need to verify with examples.\n    # Let's check sample input n=2: answer is -1 mod MOD = 998244352\n    # Which matches -1 * (2-1) * 2^(0) = -1 * 1 * 1 = -1\n    # For n=4, sample output is 998244343 which is -10 mod MOD\n    # According to formula: -1 * (4-1) * 4^(4-2) = -3 * 16 = -48 mod MOD\n    # Wait this doesn't match the sample.
