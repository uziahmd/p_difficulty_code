There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about examples. For n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the winner plays the second game, the other player (player 3) hasn't played any games. So the difference is 1 (the winner has 1 game, the other has 0). That's allowed. So that's why the answer is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the example says the answer is 2. Wait, why not 3? Because if you have four players, maybe the winner plays three games? But no, because in a knockout tournament, each loss eliminates someone. For four players, the tournament would have three games total (since each game eliminates one person, and you need to eliminate three to get a winner). But the maximum number of games the winner can play is two. Because in the example, they split into two matches first: (1 vs 2) and (3 vs 4). Then the winners (say 1 and 3) play each other. So the winner plays two games. But if you tried to make the winner play three games, that would require them to play three times, but that's impossible because each time they play, they have to face someone else. Let me think: for example, if the winner plays three games, then they must have three opponents. But each of those opponents would have to be eliminated in their own games. But how does that fit with the rules?\n\nThe rule says that two players can only play if their number of previous games differ by at most one. So, for the winner to play three games, each time they play, the opponent must have played either the same number of games or one less. Let's see. Let's imagine the winner starts by playing against someone. That's game 1. Then, the next game, the opponent must have played either 0 or 1 games. Suppose the winner plays against someone who has played 0 games (so the winner has 1, opponent has 0). Then, after that game, the winner has 2 games. Now, the next opponent must have played 1 or 2 games. But how would that happen? Let's think of the structure.\n\nThis feels like it's related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because, perhaps, to maximize the number of games, each time the winner plays, they have to have opponents that are structured in a way that allows the maximum steps. Let me think recursively. Suppose the maximum number of games the winner can play is f(n). How can we model this?\n\nLet's think about the scenario where the winner plays k games. For each of those games, the opponent must be someone who has played either k-1, k-2, etc. But perhaps the optimal way is to arrange the tournament such that each time the winner plays, the opponent has played as many games as possible. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is similar to building a binary tree. Because in a normal knockout tournament, each game is a node with two children (the two players). But here, the constraints on the game differences might affect the structure. However, the problem is to find the maximum possible number of games the winner can play. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as finding the largest k such that the sum of the first k+1 Fibonacci numbers is less than or equal to n. Or something along those lines. \n\nWait, let's think about the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games. Let's denote this as f(k). For example:\n\n- To have a winner play 1 game, you need 2 players. f(1) = 2.\n- To have a winner play 2 games, you need 3 players. Because the winner plays two games. For example, first against player 2, then against player 3. But for that, the first game is between 1 and 2, then the second game between 1 and 3. But according to the rule, when the second game happens, player 1 has played 1 game, and player 3 has played 0. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So f(2) = 3.\n- To have a winner play 3 games, what's the minimal number of players? Let's see. The first game, the winner plays against someone. Then, the next game, the opponent must have played either 0 or 1 games. Let's say the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given the constraint that two players can only compete if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. This problem can be efficiently solved using a recursive approach based on the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Constraints**: The key constraint is that players can only compete if their number of previously played games differs by at most one. This leads us to consider a structure similar to the Fibonacci sequence, where each player's path to the final requires a specific number of opponents structured in a way that adheres to the rule.\n2. **Recursive Insight**: To find the maximum number of games the winner can play, we recognize that the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each game the winner plays requires opponents who themselves have played a certain number of games, leading to a recursive structure.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Using a recursive approach with memoization (or dynamic programming), we can compute the minimum number of players required for the winner to play a certain number of games. We iterate until the minimum number of players exceeds the given number of players `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef max_games(n):\n    # We need to find the maximum k such that f(k) <= n\n    # where f(k) is the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games.\n    # f(0) = 1 (trivial case, but not used here)\n    # f(1) = 2\n    # f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)\n    # So we can compute this using a loop until f(k) exceeds n.\n\n    if n == 1:\n        return 0  # Not possible since n >= 2\n\n    # Initialize the Fibonacci-like sequence\n    a, b = 1, 2  # f(0) = 1, f(1) = 2\n    k = 1\n    while True:\n        if b > n:\n            return k\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    print(max_games(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: We start with the base cases where the minimum number of players required for the winner to play 1 game is 2.\n2. **Fibonacci-like Sequence**: We generate a sequence where each term represents the minimum number of players required for the winner to play an increasing number of games. This sequence is generated similarly to the Fibonacci sequence.\n3. **Loop Until Exceed**: We continue generating terms of this sequence until the term exceeds the given number of players `n`. The maximum number of games the winner can play is then the index of the last valid term in this sequence.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the result even for very large values of `n` (up to $10^{18}$) using a linear scan with constant time operations per step.",
