On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray of the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what reversing a subarray does. For example, if I reverse a segment [l, r], then the elements in that segment are reversed. The goal is to choose such a segment so that when we reverse it, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) of the new array is as long as possible.\n\nThe original array's LNDS might already be good, but maybe by reversing a certain part, we can make it even better. So the approach is to find which reversal gives the maximum possible LNDS.\n\nBut considering all possible intervals [l, r] and checking each possibility would be O(n^2) possibilities. For each of these, computing the LNDS would take O(n^2) time, which for n=2000 would be way too slow. So that approach is not feasible.\n\nWe need a smarter way. Let's think about the structure of the problem. Since the array only has 1s and 2s, the LNDS is determined by the number of 1s and 2s and how they are arranged.\n\nIn the original array, the maximum possible LNDS is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s (if the array is non-decreasing), or something less if there are 2s followed by 1s. But when we reverse a subarray, maybe we can fix some of those transitions.\n\nWait, the LNDS can be thought of as follows: the maximum number of elements in a non-decreasing sequence. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 is followed by a 1. Because each such occurrence is a \"break\" in the non-decreasing order. But perhaps that's not directly helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the maximum between:\n\n- The number of 1s (if all 1s come before 2s)\n- Or, the number of 2s (if all 2s come before 1s, but that would be decreasing, so the LNDS would be the number of 2s, but that's not possible. Wait no, the LNDS is the longest non-decreasing. So if the array is 2 followed by 1, the LNDS is 1 (each element alone). But if you reverse a part of it, maybe you can have more 1s followed by 2s.\n\nSo, the optimal scenario is when all the 1s come before the 2s. Then the LNDS is the entire array. But if there are some 2s followed by 1s, reversing a segment that includes those could help.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the best way to reverse a segment to maximize the number of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the original array. Let's say that in the original array, there are some places where a 2 is followed by a 1. Each such occurrence is a problem. Reversing a segment that includes such a transition could turn it into a 1 followed by a 2, which is good.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the maximum LNDS after any reversal is equal to the original maximum LNDS plus the number of such \"bad\" transitions that can be fixed by reversing a segment. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is the total number of elements minus the number of \"drops\" (places where a 2 is followed by a 1) in the original array, but that's only if we can fix all those drops. However, reversing a segment can fix some of those drops.\n\nWait, but the original array may have multiple drops. For example, in the first sample input: [1, 2, 1, 2]. The original array has two drops: between index 2 and 3 (2 followed by 1) and between index 3 and 4 (1 followed by 2, which is okay). Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nOriginal array is 1, 2, 1, 2. The transitions are:\n\n1→2 (ok), 2→1 (drop), 1→2 (ok). So one drop. The original LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). But after reversing [2,3], the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which has no drops. So the LNDS is 4.\n\nSo the idea is that by reversing a segment",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray of a given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can help reduce the number of \"drops\" (i.e., instances where a 2 is immediately followed by a 1), which in turn can increase the LNDS.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Drops**: Count the number of drops in the original sequence. A drop occurs when a 2 is immediately followed by a 1.\n2. **Reverse Subarray Impact**: Reversing a subarray that contains these drops can potentially eliminate them. For example, reversing a segment containing a 2 followed by a 1 will turn it into a 1 followed by a 2, which is non-decreasing.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: Use dynamic programming to compute the maximum length of the LNDS considering all possible subarrays. This involves precomputing the number of 1s and 2s up to each position and using these values to determine the optimal subarray reversal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Precompute prefix counts of 1s and 2s\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    prefix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n        prefix_twos[i+1] = prefix_twos[i] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    max_lnds = 0\n    \n    # Case 1: No reversal, original LNDS\n    # Since the array has only 1 and 2, the LNDS is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s minus the number of drops\n    # But actually, the LNDS is the total number of elements minus the number of drops (since each drop breaks the sequence)\n    # However, this is not accurate.
