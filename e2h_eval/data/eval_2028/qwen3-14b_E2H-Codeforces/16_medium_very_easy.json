Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving through a common border between blocks. Each block is a region divided by the roads. \n\nFirst, I need to model the problem. Since each road is a line, the blocks are regions divided by these lines. The key here is that moving between blocks requires sharing a non-zero length border. So, two blocks are adjacent if they share a segment of a road (i.e., they are separated by exactly one road). But how do I model this?\n\nThe challenge is to represent each block as a node in a graph, and edges exist between nodes if they are adjacent. Then, find the shortest path from the home's block to the university's block. However, with n up to 300, the number of blocks can be huge. So, enumerating all blocks isn't feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another approach. Since each step corresponds to crossing a road, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of the roads. Let me think: each block can be represented by the set of roads that separate it from the home. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the parity of the number of roads that separate the home and the current block. But that might not directly apply here.\n\nAnother idea: For each block, the position relative to each road can be represented as a sign. For example, for each road, the block lies on one side of the line. So, the home's position has a certain sign for each road, and the university's position has another. The problem is to find the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed to get from the home's region to the university's region.\n\nBut how does crossing roads affect the regions? Each time you cross a road, you switch the sign of that road's equation. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads that separate the home and the university, such that each step crosses one road. But wait, maybe not exactly. Because each step can cross a road, but the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed. But how to model that?\n\nWait, the minimal number of steps is equal to the minimal number of roads that separate the home and university regions. Because each step can cross one road. But maybe not. For example, if two regions are separated by two roads, then you can cross one road and then another. But maybe there's a way to cross them in one step? No, because each step can only cross one road. So, the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate the two regions. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a region. Two regions are connected if they share a common border. Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path between the home region and the university region. But how to model this graph without knowing all regions?\n\nBut with n roads, the maximum number of regions is O(2^n), which is impossible for n=300. So that approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For each road, determine whether the home and university are on the same side of that road. If they are on the same side, then that road doesn't separate them. If they are on different sides, then that road is part of the boundary between their regions. \n\nBut how to find the minimal steps? Let's think of it as a BFS problem. Each state is the set of roads that have been crossed. But again, that's too big.\n\nWait, here's an important observation: The regions can be represented by the signs of their positions relative to each road. Each region is determined by the signs of each road's equation evaluated at a point. For example, for a point (x,y), for each road i, compute the value s_i = a_i x + b_i y + c_i. Since the point is not on any road, s_i is non-zero. The sign of s_i determines which side of the road the point is on. \n\nNow, two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one sign. Because crossing a road changes the sign of that road's equation. So, if two regions differ in exactly one sign, then they share a border. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of sign differences between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector. \n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Suppose two regions differ in exactly one sign. That means that they are separated by exactly one road. So, they are adjacent. Thus, the minimal steps required is the number of roads where the home and university have different signs. Because each step can flip one sign. \n\nWait, no. Suppose that the home and university have different signs on k roads. Then, the minimal number of steps needed is k. Because you can cross each of those roads once. But how can that be? Because each step moves you across one road. So, if you start in the home region, and cross a road, you end up in a region that differs in exactly one sign. Then, crossing another road, etc. So, the minimal steps is the number of differing signs between the home and the university. \n\nBut that seems too simple. Let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x+1y+0=0 (y=0) and 1x+0y+0=0 (x=0). \n\nFor home (1,1):\nRoad 1: 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 >0 → sign is +.\nRoad 2: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0 → sign is +.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\nRoad 1: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign is -.\nRoad 2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign is -.\n\nSo, for both roads, the signs are different. So the number of differing signs is 2. The output is 2. Which matches the sample. \n\nSecond sample input:\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. \n\nCheck for home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1 (x=0): 1>0 → +.\nRoad 2 (y=0): 1>0 → +.\nRoad 3: 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → -.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: -1 <0 → -.\nRoad 2: -1 <0 → -.\nRoad 3: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → -.\n\nSo, for road 1 and 2, signs differ. Road 3 same. So differing signs count is 2. Output is 2, which matches the sample. \n\nSo the answer seems to be the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nBut why is that correct? Let me think. Because each step allows you to cross a road. So, each step changes the sign of exactly one road. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two regions. Because you can cross each of those roads once. \n\nBut how do we know that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads? Because each time you cross a road, you change the sign for that road. So, if the home and university differ in k roads, then you can cross each of those roads once, and that would take k steps. \n\nBut how can we be sure that there's no shorter path? Well, suppose that there's a way to reach the university in fewer steps. But each step can only change one sign. So, if there are k differing signs, you need at least k steps. Hence, the minimal steps is exactly the number of differing signs. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: for each road, check if the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. Count the number of such roads. That's the answer. \n\nWait, but what if there are multiple roads that are overlapping? Or if some roads are redundant? For example, suppose two roads are parallel. But the problem says that no two roads are the same. But they can be parallel. \n\nBut regardless of the arrangement of roads, the minimal steps is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nSo the solution is to compute for each road, whether the home and university are on opposite sides of that road. The count of such roads is the answer. \n\nLet me test this hypothesis with some examples. \n\nExample case: home and university are separated by zero roads. That means they are in the same region. Then the answer is zero steps. \n\nAnother example: home and university are separated by one road. So answer is 1. \n\nAnother case: suppose there are two roads that separate them. Then answer is 2. \n\nBut how to check if two points are on opposite sides of a line. For a line ax + by + c = 0, the sign of ax + by + c for a point (x,y) tells which side it is on. \n\nSo for a road, compute for home: val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c. For university: val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If val1 * val2 < 0, then they are on opposite sides. \n\nSo, for each road, compute val1 and val2. If their product is negative, increment the count. \n\nThat's the solution. \n\nWait, but why is this correct? Because each road that separates them must be crossed once. And the minimal steps is the number of such roads. \n\nBut why can't there be a scenario where two roads are crossed, but the steps are less than the count? For example, if two roads cross each other, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. But perhaps there's a way to cross one road, then another, but that's two steps. Which equals the count. \n\nSo the answer is indeed the count of roads where the two points are on opposite sides. \n\nThis is a very simple solution. So the code would be:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2). Read n roads. For each road, compute the value for home and university. Check if their product is negative. Count how many such roads. Output the count. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. What if there are multiple roads that are crossed, but the minimal steps is less than the count? Like, if there are two roads that are parallel, but the home and university are on opposite sides of both. Then, the count is 2. But can you cross one road and then the other? Which would take two steps. Which is the same as the count. So no problem. \n\nAnother case: suppose there are two roads that cross each other, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both. Then, the minimal steps is 2. Because you need to cross each road once. \n\nBut what if there's a path that crosses one road and then another, but that's two steps. Which is the same as the count. \n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal steps is exactly the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nThus, the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, let's look at the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are y=0 and x=0. \n\nFor the first road (y=0): home is 1*1 + 0*... wait, the road is 0x + 1y + 0 = 0. So for home (1,1), 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. For university, 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1, so count +=1. \n\nSecond road: x=0. For home, 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1. For university, 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1. So count +=1. Total 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads:\n\nRoad 1: x=0. Same as before. Home is 1, university -1. Product negative. Count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: y=0. Same as before. Product negative. Count +=1.\n\nRoad3: x + y -3 =0. For home: 1+1-3 = -1. For university: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Product is (-1)*(-5) = positive. So no count. So total is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works. \n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen for each of the n roads, read a, b, c.\n\nFor each road, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\nIf val1 * val2 < 0, then increment the count.\n\nFinally, output the count.\n\nThis is very efficient. For n up to 300, it's O(n) time. \n\nBut wait, why is this correct? Because each road that separates the two points contributes to the count, and the minimal steps is exactly that count. \n\nYes. So the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nWe need to read the inputs correctly. For example, the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. The input is given as per the example. Let me check the input format.\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1.\n\nSecond line two integers x2, y2.\n\nThird line is n.\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo the code needs to read these.\n\nBut looking at the sample input, the first example input is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, but that seems like two test cases. But the problem says that the input is for one test case. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the input description. So the user probably provided two examples, but the actual code needs to process one test case.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1.\n\nSecond line two integers x2, y2.\n\nThird line is n.\n\nThen n lines of coefficients.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. So in Python, read all lines, split into the appropriate parts.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first example is:\n\nInput is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWhich gives output 2.\n\nThe second example is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nSo the code should read the input as per the problem statement.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nThen for each line, compute val1 and val2.\n\nCount the number of roads where val1 * val2 < 0.\n\nPrint that count.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2 from input.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but why is this correct? Because the problem says that neither home nor university is on any road. So val1 and val2 are not zero. So their product can't be zero. So the code is safe.\n\nYes. So this is the solution. It's very simple. \n\nBut why is the problem considered \"very easy\"? Because this approach is straightforward once you realize that the minimal steps is the number of roads separating the two points. \n\nSo the code is as above. Let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). \n\nRoads:\n\n0 1 0 → val1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2= 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nNext road: 1 0 0 → val1 =1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 =1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Output 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are:\n\n1 0 0 → val1 =1*1 +0*1 +0=1. val2 =1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\n0 1 0 → same as before, count +=1.\n\nThird road: 1 1 -3 → val1 =1*1 +1*1 -3 = -1. val2 =1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 =-5. product is (-1)*(-5)=5>0 → no count. So total 2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about other cases?\n\nCase where home and university are on same side of all roads. Then answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: one road. Home and university on opposite sides. Answer is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct. Therefore, this is the solution.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a non-zero length border.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that each road divides the plane into two regions. If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed to move between these regions. The minimum number of steps required is equivalent to the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks.\n\nTo determine if the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, we evaluate the sign of the road's equation at both points. If the signs differ, the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Road Equations**: For each road, compute the value of the line equation at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Checking Opposite Sides**: If the product of the values from the home and university coordinates for a given road is negative, it indicates they are on opposite sides of that road. This road must be crossed, so we increment our count.\n4. **Output Result**: The count of such roads is printed, which represents the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n).",
