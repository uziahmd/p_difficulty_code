Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of steps to get from the home block to the university block, moving through adjacent blocks. Each step allows moving between blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacency. But how? Since the roads are infinite lines, each block is a region divided by these lines. The challenge is to represent each block in a way that allows me to determine which blocks are adjacent.\n\nBut directly modeling all blocks isn't feasible, especially since there can be up to 300 lines, leading to a huge number of regions. So there must be a smarter way.\n\nWait, the key here is that moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. But each road is a line. So two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road. But how do I model this?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as a graph where each node represents a block. Two nodes are connected if their corresponding blocks share a common border. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home block to the university block.\n\nBut how to represent the blocks and determine adjacency?\n\nAnother approach: For each block, the parity of the number of roads that separate it from the home block might matter. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of each block as being defined by the sign of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road, the block is either on one side of the line or the other. So, each block can be represented by a vector of signs (for each road, whether the point is on the positive or negative side of the line). However, with n roads, there are 2^n possible combinations, but since the roads can be arranged in any way, some combinations may not exist. However, given that the home and university are not on any road, their sign vectors are unique.\n\nBut how do we check adjacency between two blocks? Two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if two blocks differ in exactly one road, then they are separated by that road, and hence share a common border. Wait, is that correct?\n\nLet me think. Suppose two regions are separated by exactly one line. Then they are adjacent. But if two regions differ in more than one line's sign, then they are separated by multiple roads. But would they share a common border? Probably not. Because if you cross two roads, you'd be in a different region that's separated by two roads. So adjacency is when two regions differ in exactly one road's sign. Therefore, the adjacency graph can be modeled as a graph where each node is a sign vector, and edges exist between nodes that differ in exactly one sign.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find the minimum number of steps to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, where each step changes exactly one sign (i.e., flipping one bit). But wait, no. Because each step is moving across a road, which changes the sign of exactly one road. So the number of steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university blocks. But how?\n\nWait, for example, suppose the home is in a region that has sign vector S, and the university is in region T. The minimal steps would be the number of roads where S and T differ. Because each step can flip one road's sign. But that's only if the regions are connected via such steps. But perhaps that's not the case. Because two regions that differ in two roads may be connected via a path that flips one road at a time. For example, if the home is in S, and there's a region that differs in one road (so adjacent), and then another that differs in another road. So the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. Because each step flips one bit.\n\nWait, but that would imply that the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of home and university. But how does that hold?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose there are two roads. The home is in a region that is positive for both roads. The university is in a region that is negative for both roads. The Hamming distance is 2. But to get from home to university, you need to cross both roads, which would require two steps. So yes, the answer would be 2. Which matches the Hamming distance. Another example: if the home and university differ in exactly one road, then the answer is 1. So that seems to fit.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university. But how to compute the sign vectors?\n\nEach road is a line. For the home point, we can compute for each road whether the point is on the positive or negative side of the line. Similarly for the university. Then, the Hamming distance between these two vectors is the answer.\n\nWait, but why is this the case? Because each step allows you to cross a single road. So, each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road's equation. Therefore, the minimal number of steps is the number of roads where the home and university have differing signs. Because each differing road must be crossed once. And since you can cross them in any order, the minimal steps is exactly the Hamming distance.\n\nBut how can this be? Let's take an example. Suppose there are three roads. Home's sign vector is (+, +, +), university's is (-, -, +). The Hamming distance is 2. So the minimal steps would be 2. How? Well, cross the first road (to get to -, +, +), then cross the second road (to get to -, -, +). So that's two steps. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: home is (+, +, +), university is (-, +, -). Hamming distance is 2. So steps would be cross first road (to -, +, +) then cross third road (to -, +, -). So two steps. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing the Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university points with respect to all roads.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. For each road, compute the sign of the home point (i.e., evaluate a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. Since the home is not on any road, this value is non-zero. Similarly for the university point.\n\n2. For each road, compare the sign of the home and the university. If they are different, increment the count.\n\n3. The answer is the count.\n\nWait, but how can this be so simple? Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1)\n\nRoads:\n\n0 1 0 → equation is 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 → y=0. So the home (1,1) is above this line (y=0), so substituting into equation: 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1 > 0. So sign is positive. The university is (-1,-1): substituting into the equation gives 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1 < 0. So for this road, signs are different. So contributes 1.\n\nSecond road: 1 0 0 → x=0. Home (1,1) gives 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1>0. University (-1,-1) gives 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) + 0 = -1 <0. Different again. So total of 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1)\n\nRoads:\n\n1 0 0 → x=0. Home is +, university is - → different.\n\n0 1 0 → same as before, different.\n\nThird road: 1 1 -3 → equation x + y -3 = 0. For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1 <0. For university (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0. Same sign. So total of 2 differences. Hence output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works for the sample inputs.\n\nSo the problem is really just to compute the number of roads where the home and university points are on opposite sides of the road.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because each time you cross a road, you change the sign of that road. So to get from the home's region to the university's region, you need to cross each road that separates them once. And the minimal steps is the number of such roads.\n\nThis is a very clever insight. So the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, the steps for coding:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1).\n\nRead university coordinates (x2, y2).\n\nRead n roads.\n\nFor each road, compute the value for home and university.\n\nCheck if the product of the two values is negative. If so, increment the count.\n\nThe answer is the count.\n\nWait, because if the product is negative, that means the two points are on opposite sides of the line. So for each road, if home and university are on opposite sides, that road contributes 1 to the answer.\n\nYes. So the code is:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of the n roads:\n\n    a, b, c = coefficients.\n\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nThat's it?\n\nBut why is that correct? Because each road that separates the home and university blocks contributes to the Hamming distance. Because the home and university are in different regions, so their sign vectors differ in exactly those roads that separate them.\n\nBut how do we know that the minimal steps is exactly the number of roads that separate them?\n\nBecause each step can cross one road, and each such road that separates them must be crossed once. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them.\n\nYes. Because if you have to cross each of those roads once, and each step crosses exactly one road, then the minimal steps is exactly the count.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct solution.\n\nLet me think about some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: No roads. Then the home and university are in the same block. So answer is 0.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, n can be 1. But according to the problem statement, the home and university are not on any road. So if n=0, but the problem says n is at least 1? Wait, no. The input says third line is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). Wait, no. Wait, looking back at the input description:\n\nThird line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So n is at least 1. So the case where n=0 is not possible.\n\nBut in code, even if n was zero, the code would return 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: home and university are on same side of all roads. Then answer is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: home and university are separated by two roads. So answer is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute for each road whether the two points are on opposite sides, and count the number of such roads.\n\nSo the Python code would read the input, process each road, and compute the count.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nThe input is given as multiple lines. For example, in the first sample input:\n\nThe first input is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nSo the code should read x1, y1 as 1,1, then x2,y2 as -1,-1, then n=2, then two lines for the roads.\n\nIn Python, we can read the input as follows:\n\nRead the first line as x1, y1.\n\nRead the second line as x2, y2.\n\nRead the third line as n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the first line, split into x1, y1.\n\nRead the second line, split into x2, y2.\n\nRead third line as n.\n\nThen read n lines, each as a, b, c.\n\nThen for each of these lines, compute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\nIf val1 * val2 < 0, increment count.\n\nFinally, print count.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFirst case:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1).\n\nRoads:\n\n0 1 0 → val1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) + 0 = -1. product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1 0 0 → val1 is 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) + 0*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2 → output 2.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1).\n\nRoads:\n\n1 0 0 → val1 =1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 = -1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\n0 1 0 → same as before, count +=1.\n\nThird road: 1 1 -3 → val1 =1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2 = 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0 → no count. So total is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nWhat about when the home and university are on the same side of a road? For example, if a road is x + y = 0. Home (1,1) gives 2, university (2,2) gives 4. Both positive. So product is positive → no count.\n\nAnother case: if a road is x=0. Home is (1,0) → val is 1. University (2,0) → val is 2. Same sign. So no count.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead from stdin. Note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as per the first sample. Wait, the sample input shows two examples, but the actual problem is to process one input. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1.\n\nSecond line contains x2, y2.\n\nThird line is n.\n\nThen n lines of a, b, c.\n\nSo the code needs to process a single test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows two examples, perhaps for testing purposes. However, the code should process one case per run.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the home and university are in the same region? For example, if all roads are such that the home and university are on the same side. Then the answer is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the solution is correct.\n",

Each step allows moving between blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that two blocks are adjacent if they are separated by exactly one road. Therefore, the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the number of roads that separate these two blocks. This can be determined by checking how many roads have the home and university points on opposite sides.\n\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the coordinates of the home and university points, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Sign Check**: For each road, calculate the value of the line equation at both the home and university points. If these values have opposite signs, it indicates that the points are on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Count Opposite Sides**: Count the number of roads where the home and university points lie on opposite sides.
