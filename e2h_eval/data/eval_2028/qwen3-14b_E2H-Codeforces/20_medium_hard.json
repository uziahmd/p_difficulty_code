For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of length 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. The answer needs to be computed modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a beautiful multiset is. For every binary string s (of length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of binary strings of exactly length n.\n\nThe maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. So we need to count all possible assignments of c_s values (each between 0 and k) such that when you choose them, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to model this.\n\nLet me consider that each c_s represents a constraint. The problem requires that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. So the way to approach this might be to find for each possible assignment of c_s's, the maximum possible size of the multiset, and count those assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset given the c_s's?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with some kind of constraints on the prefixes. For example, the maximum size of the multiset would be determined by the constraints on the prefixes. Because each string in the multiset contributes to all its prefixes. So, for instance, adding a string of length n contributes to all its prefixes of lengths 1 to n.\n\nThis feels similar to a trie structure. Each node in the trie represents a binary string (prefix), and the number of times a node can be used depends on its c_s value. But how does that translate into the maximum number of strings in the multiset?\n\nWait, the problem is similar to a flow problem, where each node (prefix) has a capacity, and the edges represent the inclusion of a longer prefix. For example, if you have a string of length m, then it contributes to all prefixes of length 1 to m. So, the constraints are that for each prefix s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut the maximum size of the multiset is the maximum number of strings we can select such that all these constraints are satisfied. How to compute this maximum?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the maximum number of elements in the multiset, which is equivalent to the maximum number of strings of length n that can be chosen such that for each prefix s, the number of selected strings that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how do we model this? It's similar to a problem where each node (prefix) has a capacity, and each selected string (leaf node of depth n) contributes 1 to each of its ancestor nodes (prefixes). The goal is to find the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be selected without violating any capacities.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled as a flow network, but perhaps there's a more efficient way given that the structure is a tree (trie of all binary strings up to length n).\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For each node (binary string), the maximum number of times it can be used as a prefix is c_s. However, each time we select a string that ends at a certain node, it uses up one unit from all its ancestors.\n\nBut how can we compute the maximum number of such strings? This seems like a problem that can be solved using dynamic programming or some greedy approach.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. Suppose we have all the prefixes. For each node, the number of strings that pass through it is constrained by c_s. However, since each string of length n contributes to all its prefixes, the constraints form a hierarchy.\n\nThe maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum over all possible constraints. Wait, no. For example, if we have two prefixes, one of length 1 and one of length 2. Suppose the root (length 1) has c=2, and the child (length 2) has c=1. Then, each string that starts with the root's prefix (say '0') and is of length 2 (like '00' or '01') will contribute to both the root and the child. If we select two strings that start with '0', then the root's count would be 2 (allowed), but the child's count would be 2, which exceeds c=1. Therefore, the maximum number of such strings is limited by the child's capacity. So, for each node, the maximum number of strings that can pass through it is limited by the sum of capacities along the path, but perhaps the maximum is determined by the minimum of the capacities along the path multiplied by some factors?\n\nAlternatively, considering that each node's capacity is a constraint on the number of strings that have it as a prefix. For example, the root node (length 1) can have up to c_root strings that start with that prefix. However, each string that starts with that prefix contributes to all its children's constraints. So, for example, if we have a node s of length m, then the number of strings that have s as a prefix cannot exceed c_s. Also, each of those strings contributes to the counts of their prefixes. Therefore, the problem is similar to a hierarchical constraint system, and the maximum number of strings is determined by the minimum of the capacities along the paths.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of nodes that can be selected such that for each node, the number of selected nodes in its subtree is ≤ the capacity of that node. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a tree where each node has two children (for 0 and 1). Each node has a capacity c_s. The maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be selected is determined by the constraints that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nWait, that's an interesting idea. Because for any node s (which represents a prefix), the number of leaves (strings of length n) that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of leaves in the subtree rooted at s. Therefore, the constraint is that for each node s, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nSo the problem reduces to choosing the capacities c_s (for all prefixes s) such that the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be selected under these constraints is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute, given the c_s's, what is the maximum number of leaves that can be selected?\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum number of leaves such that for every node in the trie, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis is similar to a problem where each node has a capacity, and the number of leaves in the subtree must not exceed the node's capacity. The maximum number of leaves is the sum over all leaves, but subject to the constraints.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum? It seems that the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimum of the capacities along the paths from the root to the leaves. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a trie where each node has two children. For each node, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, ...). For example, if a node has two children, each of which can have up to x and y leaves in their subtrees, then the maximum number of leaves for this node's subtree is x + y, but also cannot exceed c_s. So, the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of a node is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves in each of its children's subtrees.\n\nThis suggests a recursive approach. For each node, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the leaves from its children. However, since the children are the nodes that extend the current node by adding a 0 or 1 bit.\n\nWait, this seems promising. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet’s define for each node s, the maximum number of leaves that can be in the subtree rooted at s, given the capacities. Let’s denote this value as dp[s]. Then:\n\nIf s is a leaf node (i.e., length n), then dp[s] = 1, because the only leaf is itself. But since the capacity for s is c_s, the actual maximum is min(c_s, 1). But wait, the capacity for s is the maximum number of leaves that can have s as a prefix. Since s is a leaf (length n), the only string in the multiset that has s as a prefix is s itself. So the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is min(c_s, 1). However, if we're trying to compute the maximum number of leaves overall, perhaps this is not directly applicable. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, for each node s, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves in its children's subtrees. Because each child's subtree contributes to the total leaves under s. However, since the capacity of s is c_s, the total cannot exceed that. \n\nFor example, for a node s with two children left and right. The maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is min(c_s, left_dp + right_dp). \n\nThis seems like a correct approach. Because, the leaves under s can be any combination of leaves in the left and right children's subtrees, but the total must not exceed c_s. Therefore, the maximum possible is min(c_s, left_dp + right_dp).\n\nThis recursive formula allows us to compute the maximum number of leaves possible for the entire trie (the root node's dp value) given the capacities. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: for each possible assignment of c_s (each between 0 and k), compute the maximum number of leaves (dp[root]) as per this formula, and then count the number of assignments where this value is exactly f.\n\nBut the problem is to count the number of such assignments where this maximum is exactly f. However, since the constraints are on all nodes, and the formula for dp depends on the capacities of all nodes, how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nGiven that n is up to 15, the total number of nodes (binary strings of length 1 to n) is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^(n+1) - 2. For n=15, this is 2^16-2 = 65534, which is manageable for some DP approaches, but not sure.\n\nBut the problem is to count the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that the dp[root] computed via this formula equals exactly f.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem where we process the trie in a bottom-up manner. For each node, we can track the possible values of dp[s], and for each possible choice of c_s, compute the contribution to the parent nodes.\n\nBut given that n is up to 15, and the number of nodes is O(2^n), this might be feasible if we can find a way to represent the possible states.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the trie. The nodes can be considered in order of increasing length. For example, all nodes of length 1, then length 2, etc., up to length n. For each node, its children are the nodes formed by appending a 0 or 1 bit.\n\nProcessing the nodes in reverse order (from longest to shortest) might help, since the dp value of a node depends on its children's dp values.\n\nWait, for a node of length m, its children are of length m+1. So, to compute the dp value of a node, we need the dp values of its children. Therefore, processing the nodes in order from longest (length n) to shortest (length 1) makes sense.\n\nFor each node, the dp value is min(c_s, sum of children's dp values). But for a node of length n, it has no children (since the strings are of length exactly n). Therefore, the dp for such a node is min(c_s, 1). Because the sum of children's dp values is zero (no children), but the node itself is a leaf. Wait, no. For a node of length n, the subtree consists of only that node. So the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1 (the node itself) if allowed by c_s. Hence, dp[s] = min(c_s, 1). \n\nBut for a node of length m < n, its children are of length m+1, and the sum of their dp values is the sum of their max leaves. So, the dp value for this node is min(c_s, sum_children_dp).\n\nTherefore, the process is:\n\nInitialize all leaves (nodes of length n) with dp[s] = min(c_s, 1). Then, for each node of length m from n-1 down to 1, compute dp[s] as min(c_s, sum of dp of children).\n\nOnce we compute dp for the root (length 1), that's the maximum size of the beautiful multiset.\n\nNow, the problem is to count the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that the final dp[root] equals exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this?\n\nThe key observation here is that the value of dp[s] for a node depends on the c_s and the dp values of its children. However, for each node, the choice of c_s can be any value between 0 and k, but once we know the sum of children's dp values, the dp[s] is min(c_s, sum_children_dp). Therefore, for each node, the choice of c_s affects the dp[s] in a way that depends on the sum of children's dp values.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming, where for each node, we track the possible values of dp[s], and how the choices of c_s contribute to the possibilities.\n\nBut since the nodes are processed in order from longest to shortest, and each node's dp depends on the choices made in its children, we need to model this recursively.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the trie. Each node has two children (except for nodes of length n). For a node s of length m, its children are s0 and s1 (appending 0 or 1). So, the sum of children's dp values is dp[s0] + dp[s1].\n\nFor each node, when processing it, the possible value of dp[s] is determined by the sum_children (sum of children's dp values) and the choice of c_s. For example, if sum_children is S, then dp[s] can be any value between 0 and min(k, S) if c_s is chosen to be ≥ S, or between 0 and c_s if c_s < S. Wait, no. Because dp[s] is min(c_s, sum_children). So regardless of the choice of c_s, dp[s] is min(c_s, sum_children). Therefore, for a given sum_children, the possible dp[s] is min(c_s, sum_children). But since c_s can be chosen between 0 and k, the possible dp[s] can be any value between 0 and min(k, sum_children), but also, for any value t ≤ min(k, sum_children), there's a way to choose c_s such that dp[s] = t.\n\nWait, for example, if sum_children is S, then:\n\n- To get dp[s] = t, we need to choose c_s such that t ≤ c_s and t ≤ S. Or, if t ≤ S, then we can set c_s ≥ t. However, since the actual dp[s] is min(c_s, S), then for any t ≤ min(k, S), we can choose c_s to be t (so that min(t, S) = t if t ≤ S). Alternatively, if S is less than k, then choosing c_s ≥ S would make dp[s] = S. Therefore, for a given sum_children S, the possible dp[s] values can be any value between 0 and min(S, k), but the choice of c_s determines which value is taken.\n\nBut for the purpose of counting the number of valid assignments, perhaps for each node, given the sum_children S, the number of ways to choose c_s such that dp[s] is a certain value. However, since the higher nodes depend on the lower ones, we need to model this recursively.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each node, given that the sum_children is S, the number of possible ways to choose c_s such that dp[s] is t, and then propagate this up.\n\nBut since the sum_children S is determined by the children's choices, and the choice of c_s for the current node affects the parent's sum_children, this seems complex.\n\nHowever, perhaps we can model this with memoization. For each node, and for each possible value of the dp[s], we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's assignments that result in this dp[s].\n\nBut given that the number of nodes is 2^1 + ... + 2^n = O(2^n), and for each node, the possible dp[s] can be up to min(k, ...), which could be up to 2^15 (since n is up to 15, and for the root node, the maximum possible dp is min(k, 2^n)), but k can be up to 2e5. For n=15, 2^15 is 32768. So if k is larger than that, then the maximum dp for the root is 2^15.\n\nBut for n=15, the maximum possible dp for the root is 2^15. So for each node, the possible dp values can be up to 2^15. However, when k is smaller than that, it's min(k, ...).\n\nBut even with that, for each node, the number of possible dp values is up to 2^15, which is 32768. For n=15, the total number of nodes is 2^16-2 = 65534. So the total number of states would be 65534 * 32768, which is way too big for a standard DP approach. That's about 2e9 operations, which is impossible.\n\nHmm. So this approach might not be feasible for n=15. Need to find another way.\n\nAlternative idea: The value of dp[s] for a node s is min(c_s, sum_children_dp). However, the choice of c_s can be anything between 0 and k, but for the purposes of the dp[s], once the sum_children is known, the choice of c_s can be anything that allows dp[s] to be min(c_s, sum_children). However, since the actual value of dp[s] is min(c_s, sum_children), the choice of c_s can be any value ≥ dp[s], but since we're counting the number of ways, perhaps for a given sum_children S, the number of choices of c_s that result in a particular dp[s] value.\n\nFor example, suppose the sum_children is S. Then, the possible dp[s] can be any value between 0 and min(S, k). For a given target t (the dp[s] value), the number of c_s choices that would lead to dp[s] = t is:\n\n- If t <= S and t <= k: then c_s can be any value between t and min(k, S), but wait no. Because dp[s] = min(c_s, S). So to have dp[s] = t, we need that min(c_s, S) = t. Which implies that:\n\nEither:\n\n- c_s >= t and S >= t, and t is the minimum between c_s and S. So, if S >= t, then c_s can be any value between t and min(S, k). Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIf S is fixed, then for min(c_s, S) to be equal to t, we have two cases:\n\nCase 1: t = S. Then, min(c_s, S) = S implies that c_s >= S. So the number of possible c_s is max(0, k - S + 1) if S <= k. Otherwise, zero.\n\nCase 2: t < S. Then, min(c_s, S) = t implies that c_s >= t and c_s < S. Wait, no. If c_s is between t and S-1, then min(c_s, S) is c_s. So to have min(c_s, S) = t, we need that c_s = t. Because if c_s is larger than t but less than S, then min(c_s, S) is c_s, which would be larger than t. So the only way for min(c_s, S) to be exactly t is if either:\n\n- c_s = t and S >= t (so that min(t, S) = t), or\n\n- S = t and c_s >= t (so that min(c_s, S) = S = t).\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me rephrase:\n\nmin(c_s, S) = t.\n\nWhich means:\n\nEither:\n\n1. c_s >= t and S >= t, and t is the minimum between them. Which can happen in two subcases:\n\n   a) t = c_s and S >= t.\n\n   b) t = S and c_s >= t.\n\nBut that's not correct. Let me think of it mathematically.\n\nmin(a, b) = t if and only if:\n\nt ≤ a and t ≤ b and (a = t or b = t).\n\nWait, no. min(a, b) = t implies that t is the smaller of a and b. So:\n\nEither:\n\n- a = t and b ≥ t, or\n\n- b = t and a ≥ t.\n\nBut in our case, a is c_s and b is S.\n\nSo min(c_s, S) = t implies that:\n\nEither:\n\nc_s = t and S ≥ t, or\n\nS = t and c_s ≥ t.\n\nBut also, if c_s ≥ t and S ≥ t, but both are larger than t, then min(c_s, S) is min(c_s, S) which is larger than t. So that can't be.\n\nThus, the only possibilities are:\n\nEither:\n\n- c_s = t and S ≥ t, or\n\n- S = t and c_s ≥ t.\n\nBut this seems to imply that for min(c_s, S) = t, there are two possibilities. However, if S is larger than t, then the only way to have min(c_s, S) = t is c_s = t. Because if c_s is larger than t, then min(c_s, S) would be at least t. But to get exactly t, it must be that c_s = t. Similarly, if S is less than t, then it's impossible. So:\n\nIf S >= t, then to have min(c_s, S) = t, we need that c_s = t.\n\nIf S < t, then it's impossible.\n\nWait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose S is 5, and we want min(c_s, 5) = 3. Then c_s must be 3. Because if c_s is 3, then min(3,5)=3. If c_s is 4, then min(4,5)=4>3. If c_s is 2, min(2,5)=2<3. So only when c_s is exactly 3. Thus, for any t, if we want min(c_s, S) = t, then:\n\n- If t > S: impossible.\n\n- Else if t = S: then c_s can be any value >= t (since min(c_s, S) = S = t).\n\n- Else (t < S): c_s must be exactly t.\n\nAh! So this is the key insight. For a given S (sum of children's dp values), the number of ways to choose c_s such that dp[s] = t is:\n\nif t > S: 0\n\nelif t == S: number of possible c_s values between t and k (inclusive) → (k - t + 1)\n\nelse (t < S): number of possible c_s values equal to t → 1 (if t is between 0 and k) else 0.\n\nBut wait, when t < S, the only way for min(c_s, S) to be t is to have c_s = t. Because if c_s is larger than t, then min(c_s, S) would be min(c_s, S) which is ≥ t. But since S is larger than t, min(c_s, S) would be min(c_s, S) which is ≥ t. But to get exactly t, c_s must be exactly t. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo, for each node, given that the sum_children is S, the number of ways to choose c_s such that dp[s] is t is:\n\nif t > S → 0\n\nelif t == S → (k - t + 1) if t <=k else 0\n\nelse (t < S) → 1 if t is between 0 and k else 0.\n\nBut this is only true if t is within the allowed range for c_s (0 ≤ t ≤k). So, for example, if t is 5 and k is 3, then even if t < S, we can't choose c_s = t, so the count is zero.\n\nSo putting this together, for a node with sum_children S, the number of ways to get dp[s] = t is:\n\nways = 0\n\nif t > S:\n\n    ways = 0\n\nelif t == S:\n\n    if t <=k:\n\n        ways = (k - t + 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        ways = 0\n\nelse:\n\n    if t <=k:\n\n        ways = 1\n\n    else:\n\n        ways = 0\n\nBut this is only for the current node's choice of c_s. However, the sum_children is determined by the children's choices. So how do we combine this with the children's possibilities?\n\nThis seems like a recursive problem. For each node, we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's assignments such that the dp[s] is t.\n\nLet me think of this as a dynamic programming problem where for each node, we track the number of ways to have a certain value of dp[s], considering the choices for the node's c_s and the children's assignments.\n\nFor example, for a leaf node (length n), the sum_children is 0 (since it has no children). So for this node, the sum_children is S = 0. Then, the dp[s] is min(c_s, 0). Since 0 is the sum_children, which is S. So according to the earlier formula:\n\nif t > S → 0. Here S is 0, so t can't be >0.\n\nIf t == S (t=0): then ways is (k -0 +1) if 0 <=k. Which is (k+1).\n\nElse, t < S → no, since S is 0, and t must be <0, which is impossible. So for a leaf node, the possible dp[s] is either 0 or min(c_s, 0). Wait, no. Wait, the sum_children is 0, and the dp[s] is min(c_s, sum_children) = min(c_s, 0). Since c_s is ≥0, this is 0. So regardless of c_s, the dp[s] for a leaf node is 0. But this contradicts with the previous analysis. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh right! Earlier, I thought that the dp[s] for a node is min(c_s, sum_children). But for a leaf node, the sum_children is 0, but the actual number of leaves in the subtree is 1 (the node itself). So why is the dp[s] min(c_s, 0)? That seems incorrect.\n\nWait, there's a mistake in my earlier reasoning. Let me re-examine the formula for dp[s].\n\nEarlier, I thought that dp[s] is the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s, which is min(c_s, sum of children's dp). But for a leaf node (s of length n), the sum of children's dp is zero (no children), and the number of leaves in the subtree is 1 (the node itself). However, the constraint is that the number of leaves in the subtree of s (which is 1) must be ≤ c_s. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is min(c_s, 1). Not min(c_s, sum_children). So my previous model was wrong.\n\nOh no! That's a critical mistake. So what's the correct formula for dp[s]?\n\nLet me re-derive this.\n\nFor a node s of length m:\n\nIf m == n: it's a leaf. The subtree consists of exactly one node (s). The maximum number of leaves is 1, but this must be ≤ c_s. So dp[s] = min(c_s, 1).\n\nFor m < n: the subtree of s includes all leaves in the subtrees of its children. So the maximum number of leaves is the sum of the leaves from the children's subtrees, but this sum must not exceed c_s. So dp[s] = min(c_s, sum_children_dp).\n\nAh! So the formula for dp[s] is:\n\nif m == n:\n\n    dp[s] = min(c_s, 1)\n\nelse:\n\n    dp[s] = min(c_s, sum_children_dp)\n\nSo for a leaf node, the sum_children_dp is zero, but dp[s] is min(c_s, 1), not min(c_s, sum_children_dp). So the earlier formula was incorrect. This changes everything.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is:\n\nFor each node s of length m:\n\nif m == n:\n\n    dp[s] = min(c_s, 1)\n\nelse:\n\n    dp[s] = min(c_s, sum of dp of children)\n\nThis is crucial. Now, the previous analysis about the ways to choose c_s must be adjusted accordingly.\n\nSo for a node s of length m < n, the sum_children_dp is the sum of the dp of its two children. Then, dp[s] = min(c_s, sum_children_dp).\n\nFor a node of length m = n, dp[s] = min(c_s, 1).\n\nSo now, the problem becomes more complex. Let's re-express the earlier analysis for the ways to choose c_s based on the sum_children.\n\nFor a non-leaf node (m < n):\n\nsum_children is S = dp_left + dp_right.\n\nThen, dp[s] = min(c_s, S).\n\nFor a leaf node (m = n):\n\ndp[s] = min(c_s, 1).\n\nSo, for a leaf node, the possible dp[s] can be 0 or 1, depending on c_s. For example:\n\nIf c_s >=1 → dp[s] = 1.\n\nIf c_s = 0 → dp[s] = 0.\n\nSo for a leaf node, the number of ways to have dp[s] = t is:\n\nif t is 0: c_s can be 0 → 1 way.\n\nif t is 1: c_s can be between 1 and k → (k) ways (since c_s can be 1, 2, ..., k).\n\nWait, because for t=1, min(c_s, 1) = 1 requires that c_s ≥ 1. So the number of possible c_s values is (k - 1 + 1) = k (since c_s can be 1, 2, ..., k).\n\nBut if k is 0, then no way. So for a leaf node, the number of ways to have dp[s] = t is:\n\nif t is 0: 1 way (c_s = 0).\n\nif t is 1: (k >= 1 ? (k) : 0) ways.\n\nOther values of t are impossible.\n\nSo this is different from the non-leaf nodes.\n\nNow, for non-leaf nodes, the same analysis applies as before, but with the sum_children being S = sum of children's dp.\n\nSo for non-leaf nodes, given sum_children S, the number of ways to choose c_s to get a certain dp[s] value t is:\n\nif t > S → 0\n\nelif t == S → (k - t + 1) if t <=k else 0\n\nelse (t < S) → 1 if t is between 0 and k else 0.\n\nBut for leaf nodes, it's different.\n\nSo, this suggests that we can model the problem recursively, where for each node, we compute the number of ways to achieve a certain dp value, considering the children's possibilities.\n\nLet me think of this as a recursive function. Let's say for a given node, we can compute the number of ways to have a certain dp value for that node, considering all possible choices of c_s and the children's dp values.\n\nFor a leaf node (length n), the number of ways to have dp[s] = t is:\n\nif t == 0: 1 (c_s = 0)\n\nelif t == 1: (k >= 1 ? k : 0)\n\nelse: 0\n\nFor non-leaf nodes, we need to consider the possibilities for their children. For example, a node has two children, left and right. For each possible dp_left and dp_right, the sum_children S = dp_left + dp_right. Then, for the current node, given this S, the number of ways to choose c_s to get a certain dp value t is as discussed earlier. But since the children's dp values can vary, we need to aggregate all possibilities for the children.\n\nThis suggests that for each node, we need to compute a frequency table (or a map) of possible dp values and the number of ways to achieve them, considering the children's possibilities.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- Process the nodes in order from leaves (length n) up to the root (length 1).\n\n- For each node, compute the possible dp values and the number of ways to achieve them.\n\nFor a leaf node, this is straightforward as discussed.\n\nFor a non-leaf node, we need to combine the possibilities from its two children. Let's denote that for the left child, there are various possible dp_left values with counts, and similarly for the right child. We need to consider all pairs (dp_left, dp_right) and compute for each pair the sum S = dp_left + dp_right. Then, for each such S, compute the number of ways to choose c_s for the current node to get a certain t, and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut since the children are processed before the current node (because they are deeper in the trie), this can be done recursively.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nThe key is to represent for each node, the possible dp values and their counts. For example, for a node, we can have a dictionary or array where dp_count[t] represents the number of ways to assign c_s and children's choices such that the dp of this node is t.\n\nFor the base case (leaf nodes), this is easy.\n\nFor non-leaf nodes, we need to compute the convolution of the children's dp_count arrays. For each possible dp_left and dp_right, we calculate their sum S, and then for each possible t, compute the number of ways to get t from this S, and accumulate it into the current node's dp_count.\n\nBut given that for n=15, the number of nodes is 2^16-2 = 65534, and for each node, the possible dp values can be up to 2^15 (since for the root node, the maximum possible dp is min(k, 2^15)), this seems challenging, but perhaps manageable with memoization and optimizations.\n\nBut how to compute the convolution of two dp_count arrays for the children?\n\nFor example, suppose the left child has possible dp values with counts stored in left_dp, and the right child has right_dp. Then, for all possible pairs (l, r) in left_dp and right_dp, we compute S = l + r, and then for the current node, for each possible t, add the number of ways from this pair multiplied by the number of ways to choose c_s for the current node to get t from S.\n\nThis seems computationally expensive. However, for each node, the maximum possible sum S is the sum of the maximum possible dp values of the children. For example, for a node of depth m, the maximum possible sum S is 2^{n - m} (since each level adds a factor of 2). For example, for a node of depth 1, the maximum sum is 2^{n-1} (each of the 2^{n-1} leaves contributes 1 if allowed by their c_s).\n\nBut for n=15, the maximum sum S for a node can be up to 2^15 = 32768. So for each node, the possible sum S ranges up to 32768, which is manageable.\n\nBut combining two children's dp_count arrays would involve iterating over all possible pairs (l, r) where l is in left_dp and r is in right_dp, which could be O(M^2) for each node, where M is the maximum possible dp value for the children. For example, if each child has M possible values, then the total combinations are M^2. For n=15, this could be up to 32768^2 = ~1e9, which is way too slow.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is not feasible for n=15. So, what's another way?\n\nAlternative idea: Since each node's dp depends on its children's sum, and the children are independent, perhaps we can use dynamic programming with memoization and convolution techniques.\n\nBut even with that, for each node, the convolution would be expensive.\n\nAlternative",

This ensures that when processing a node, its children have already been processed.\n2. **Dynamic Programming**: For each node, the number of valid configurations is computed based on its children's configurations. This involves convolution to combine the counts from children.\n3. **Constraints Handling**: For each node, the constraints on the number of valid strings are applied to determine valid configurations, considering both leaf and non-leaf nodes differently.\n4. **Efficient Counting**: Using modular arithmetic ensures that large numbers are handled efficiently, and the results are computed within the constraints of the problem.",
