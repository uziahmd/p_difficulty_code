For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem statement is a bit complex. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nSo, we need to find the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to compute this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a beautiful multiset is. The definition says that for every binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset is made of binary strings of exactly length n. The maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f, and we need to count the number of c_s configurations that make this true.\n\nWait, but how do we determine what the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is given the c_s values? Because for each configuration of c_s, there's a maximum size that can be achieved. We need to count those configurations where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nSo the problem reduces to two parts:\n\n1. For a given set of c_s values, compute the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset.\n2. Count all such c_s configurations where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut since n is up to 15, the number of binary strings s of length up to n is sum_{i=1}^n 2^i = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, that's 2^16 - 2 = 65534, which is manageable in terms of data structures, but maybe not for brute-force approaches.\n\nBut considering that the constraints for k and f are up to 2e5, we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset. How is this determined by the c_s values?\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where each node (binary string) has a capacity, and the multiset is a collection of paths (the full strings of length n) such that for each prefix s of any string in the multiset, the count of such strings does not exceed c_s.\n\nBut how to model this maximum size?\n\nAlternatively, think of each string in the multiset as contributing +1 to all its prefixes. So, the total number of strings in the multiset is the sum over all strings in the multiset of 1, but each such string adds 1 to all its prefixes. However, the constraints are that for each prefix s, the sum of all these contributions (i.e., the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix) must be <= c_s.\n\nSo the problem becomes finding the maximum number of strings (let's call it m) such that for every prefix s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is <= c_s. And we need to find the maximum m possible, given the c_s's, and then count the number of c_s configurations where this maximum m is exactly f.\n\nHmm. So how can we model the maximum m for given c_s's?\n\nThis feels like a problem where we can model it as a flow network, but perhaps there's a more mathematical way.\n\nAnother thought: for each string of length n, when added to the multiset, it contributes to all its prefixes. Therefore, the constraints form a hierarchy. For example, if we have a string '01', then adding it increases the count for prefixes '0' (length 1), '01' (length 2), and also the entire string (but that's the same as the string itself). But since the multiset consists of strings of exactly length n, each string contributes exactly to all its prefixes of lengths from 1 to n.\n\nThe problem of finding the maximum m is equivalent to finding the maximum number of strings of length n such that for every prefix s of any of the strings, the number of strings that have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nThis is similar to a problem where each node (prefix) has a capacity, and we need to select a set of leaves (strings of length n) such that the capacities are not exceeded. The maximum number of such leaves is the maximum m.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum m?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a tree with capacities. Each node is a prefix, and the children are the extensions by one bit. The root is the empty string, but since our prefixes start from length 1, maybe we can ignore that. Wait, the problem considers all prefixes of length from 1 to n.\n\nBut the structure is a trie. Each node represents a binary string. The root could be considered as the empty string (but not part of the constraints). Then each node has two children (appending 0 or 1). The leaves are the nodes of depth n.\n\nNow, for each node (prefix s), the number of leaves in the subtree rooted at s (i.e., the number of strings of length n that have s as a prefix) must be <= c_s. Because each such leaf contributes 1 to the count of s's prefix.\n\nSo the maximum m is the maximum number of leaves that can be selected such that for each node s, the number of selected leaves in its subtree is <= c_s.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of selecting as many leaves as possible under the constraints that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is <= c_s. But how to compute this maximum?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming on the trie. For each node, the maximum number of leaves we can select in its subtree is limited by c_s, but also depends on the children.\n\nWait, but the constraints are that for each node s, the total number of leaves in its subtree (i.e., the number of leaves that have s as a prefix) must be <= c_s. So, for a node s, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is min(c_s, sum of the max leaves from each child's subtree).\n\nWait, no. Because each leaf in the subtree of s contributes to the count of s. So, for a node s, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtrees of its children. Wait, no. Because for example, if a node s has two children, left and right. The maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s would be the sum of the leaves in the left and right subtrees. However, this sum must be <= c_s. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of s is min(c_s, left_max + right_max). But since the children's maximums are themselves constrained by their own c values, etc.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum m is the minimum of the sum of the children's maximums, but constrained by the c_s value. So this can be computed recursively.\n\nSo for the root node (which is the empty string, but since our constraints start from length 1, maybe we don't have to consider it?), but in our case, the root would be the empty string, and its children are the length-1 strings. However, the constraints for the empty string are not given. Wait, no. The problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n, we have c_s. So the empty string isn't considered here. Therefore, the root node (empty string) isn't part of the constraints. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be selected is the sum of the maximum leaves in the subtrees of the root's children (i.e., the length-1 strings), but each of those is constrained by their own c values.\n\nWait, but for each node s (say, of length l), the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves of its children. Because each child can contribute some number of leaves, and the sum of those is the total number of leaves in s's subtree. However, this sum cannot exceed c_s. Therefore, for each node, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is:\n\nmax_leaves(s) = min( c_s, max_leaves(left_child) + max_leaves(right_child) )\n\nBut this is only for nodes that are not leaves (i.e., nodes with depth < n). For nodes of depth n (the leaves of the trie), they have no children, so their max_leaves is 0? Or wait, for a node s of depth n (a string of length n), its subtree consists of only itself. So, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1 (if we select it), but that's allowed only if c_s >= 1. But how does this fit into the formula?\n\nWait, the formula for a node s of depth n (a leaf in the trie) would be that it has no children. Therefore, the sum of the children's max_leaves is zero. So the max_leaves(s) would be min( c_s, 0 )? Which would be zero. But that can't be right. Because if we select the string s (of length n) in the multiset, then for s's prefix (itself), the count is 1, which must be <= c_s. So, the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s (which is just s) is 1, but only if c_s >= 1. So perhaps the formula is different for leaves.\n\nAh, here's the confusion. The max_leaves(s) represents the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of s. For a node s of depth n (a leaf in the trie), the subtree consists of exactly one node (s itself). So, the maximum number of leaves in this subtree is 1 if c_s >= 1, else 0. But according to the earlier formula, it would be min(c_s, 0) which is 0. That's wrong.\n\nSo, the formula for max_leaves(s) is:\n\nif s is a leaf (depth == n):\n    return min(c_s, 1)\nelse:\n    return min( c_s, max_leaves(left) + max_leaves(right) )\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for a node s of depth less than n, the number of leaves in its subtree is the sum of the leaves from its two children. But this sum must not exceed c_s. However, for a node of depth n, the number of leaves in its subtree is 1 (if we include it) or 0 (if we don't). But since we are trying to maximize the count, it's 1 if allowed by c_s.\n\nSo the maximum possible m is the max_leaves(root's children), summed? Wait, the root here is the empty string. Its children are the length-1 strings. The maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the entire trie is the sum of max_leaves for each of the root's children. But wait, the root's max_leaves would be min( c_root, sum of children's max_leaves ), but the root isn't part of the constraints. So perhaps the root is not considered here. Instead, the maximum m is the sum of the max_leaves for the root's children (the length-1 strings), but each of those is computed according to the formula.\n\nWait, no. Because the root's children are the length-1 strings. For each of them, their max_leaves is min(c_s, ...). The total maximum m is the sum of the max_leaves of the root's children. Because each of those can contribute up to their max_leaves, and the root's constraints (if any) are not part of the problem. Wait, the root is the empty string, which is not considered in the c_s values. Therefore, there's no constraint on the total number of leaves. Therefore, the maximum m is indeed the sum of the max_leaves for the root's children (each of which is a length-1 string). However, for each of those children, their max_leaves is computed as min( c_s, sum of their children's max_leaves ), and so on down the trie.\n\nSo the formula for the maximum m is the sum of the max_leaves of the root's children (the length-1 strings). But how do we compute this?\n\nThis suggests that for each node s (with depth from 1 to n), we can compute the max_leaves(s) as follows:\n\ndef compute_max_leaves(s):\n    if depth(s) == n:\n        return 1 if c_s >= 1 else 0\n    else:\n        left = compute_max_leaves( s + '0' )\n        right = compute_max_leaves( s + '1' )\n        return min( c_s, left + right )\n\nThen, the maximum m is the sum of compute_max_leaves('0') and compute_max_leaves('1').\n\nBut for the problem, given the c_s values, we can compute m as this sum.\n\nBut our task is to count the number of c_s configurations where this m equals exactly f.\n\nBut with n up to 15, and the number of nodes being 2^(n+1) - 2, which for n=15 is 65534, how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nWe need to model the constraints on the c_s's such that when we compute m as described, it equals f.\n\nBut directly iterating through all possible c_s configurations is impossible. Because for each node, c_s can be from 0 to k. For n=15, there are 65534 nodes, and each can have up to k+1 options. Even for small k, this is impossible.\n\nTherefore, we need a dynamic programming approach that captures the dependencies between the nodes.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each node, the value of compute_max_leaves(s) depends on the c_s and the values of its children. However, since the nodes are arranged in a trie, we can process them in a bottom-up manner. For example, nodes at depth n (the leaves) are processed first, then their parents, and so on up to the root.\n\nSo, for each node, the compute_max_leaves(s) is min( c_s, left + right ), where left and right are the compute_max_leaves of the children.\n\nBut for the purpose of counting the number of c_s configurations that result in m = f, perhaps we can model this as a DP problem, where for each node, we track the possible values of compute_max_leaves(s), and how they contribute to the overall count.\n\nBut since the nodes are in a trie, and each node's DP depends on its children, we can process the trie in a bottom-up way, starting from the leaves and moving up to the root.\n\nLet me formalize this. For each node s, let's define dp[s][x] as the number of ways to choose c_s (from 0 to k) such that the compute_max_leaves(s) is x. However, since compute_max_leaves(s) depends on the children, we need to combine the possibilities from the children.\n\nBut for a node s at depth d < n, compute_max_leaves(s) is min( c_s, left_val + right_val ), where left_val and right_val are the compute_max_leaves of the left and right children. But the c_s can be chosen in a way that affects this min.\n\nSo for each node, once we know the possible values of left_val and right_val (from their respective DPs), we can compute the possible values of compute_max_leaves(s) based on the choice of c_s.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think for a node s with children left and right. Suppose that for the left child, the possible compute_max_leaves values are L, and for the right child, R. Then, for each possible pair (l, r), the sum l + r is the maximum possible contribution from the children. Then, for the current node s, the compute_max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, l + r). But c_s can be chosen between 0 and k. For each possible choice of c_s, the value of compute_max_leaves(s) is the minimum of c_s and l + r.\n\nBut since l and r are fixed (for the children's possibilities), the value of compute_max_leaves(s) is determined by c_s. However, for the node s, the choice of c_s can be anything between 0 and k. However, for a given l and r, the value of compute_max_leaves(s) will be the minimum between c_s and (l + r). So, the possible values for compute_max_leaves(s) can be:\n\nIf we choose c_s >= (l + r), then compute_max_leaves(s) is l + r.\n\nIf we choose c_s < (l + r), then compute_max_leaves(s) is c_s.\n\nTherefore, for a given l and r, the possible compute_max_leaves(s) can be any value from 0 up to min(k, l + r). However, the number of ways to achieve a certain value x for compute_max_leaves(s) depends on how many choices of c_s would result in x.\n\nFor example, if l + r is S. Then, for compute_max_leaves(s) to be x, there are two possibilities:\n\n- x <= S and c_s >= x. Then, if x is exactly S, then c_s must be >= S. So the number of choices for c_s is (k - S + 1) if x = S. Otherwise, if x < S, then the number of choices is (S - x) if x is chosen such that c_s is exactly x (no, wait, that's not correct).\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase. For a given S (sum of children's values), compute_max_leaves(s) can be any x ≤ min(S, k). The value x is determined by the choice of c_s. For x to be the compute_max_leaves(s), the c_s must satisfy:\n\nx = min(c_s, S)\n\nWhich implies that:\n\nif x ≤ S → then c_s can be x (so that min(x, S) = x), or any value ≥ x but ≤ S (since then min(c_s, S) = x only if x is S? No, no. Wait:\n\nSuppose S is fixed. For x to be the value of min(c_s, S), we have:\n\nCase 1: x ≤ S. Then, x is the min if c_s is exactly x (since min(x, S) = x), or if c_s is larger than x but less than or equal to S. Wait, no. For example, if c_s is 5 and S is 10, then min(5, 10) is 5. If c_s is 7, min is 7. So for any c_s between x and S, the min is c_s. So, if I want compute_max_leaves(s) to be x, then x must be either:\n\n- x = c_s and c_s ≤ S → so c_s can be x, and x can be anything from 0 to min(S, k).\n\nOR\n\n- x = S and c_s ≥ S → which is only possible if S ≤ k. In that case, the number of choices for c_s is (k - S + 1).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The value of compute_max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, S). So, for compute_max_leaves(s) to be exactly x, x must be such that:\n\nEither:\n\n- x = c_s and c_s ≤ S → but then x can be any value from 0 to min(S, k).\n\nOR\n\n- x = S and c_s ≥ S → but then x is S, and c_s can be from S to k.\n\nBut wait, if you choose c_s = x, where x ≤ S, then compute_max_leaves(s) is x. However, if you choose c_s > x but ≤ S, then compute_max_leaves(s) is c_s, which is larger than x. Therefore, for compute_max_leaves(s) to be exactly x, you need that x is the minimum of c_s and S. So, the only way for compute_max_leaves(s) to be exactly x is:\n\nEither:\n\n1. x ≤ S, and c_s = x. Then, min(x, S) = x.\n\nOR\n\n2. x = S, and c_s ≥ S. Then, min(c_s, S) = S.\n\nWait, but if x is between 0 and S, and you choose c_s ≥ x but ≤ S, then compute_max_leaves(s) is c_s, which is larger than x. So, this would not contribute to x being the value. Therefore, for compute_max_leaves(s) to be exactly x, the only possibilities are:\n\n- x is in [0, S], and c_s is exactly x. Then, compute_max_leaves(s) is x.\n\n- x is S, and c_s is ≥ S. Then, compute_max_leaves(s) is S.\n\nBut how do these cases affect the count of ways?\n\nSo, for a given S (sum of children's compute_max_leaves), the number of ways to choose c_s such that compute_max_leaves(s) is x is:\n\nIf x < S:\n\nNumber of ways is 1 (choosing c_s = x) if x ≤ k. Otherwise 0.\n\nIf x = S:\n\nNumber of ways is (k - S + 1) if S ≤ k. Otherwise 0.\n\nWait, but this seems to suggest that for each x, the number of ways is either 1 (if x < S and x ≤ k) or (k - S + 1) if x = S and S ≤ k.\n\nBut this seems to imply that for a given S, the possible compute_max_leaves(s) values are x in [0, min(S, k)], and the count for each x is:\n\n- For x < min(S, k): 1 way (choose c_s = x).\n\n- For x = min(S, k): (k - min(S, k) + 1) ways.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose S is the sum of children's values. Then, the possible compute_max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, S). So, for each possible value of x that can be achieved by min(c_s, S), we need to count the number of c_s choices that lead to that x.\n\nLet me take an example. Let S = 5, k = 7.\n\nWhat are the possible x values and their counts?\n\nFor x in 0 to 5:\n\nEach x can be achieved by choosing c_s = x. So 1 way each.\n\nAdditionally, for x = 5 (since S=5), choosing c_s ≥5 (up to 7) gives x=5. So the number of ways for x=5 is 1 (from c_s=5) plus (7-5+1) = 3 (from c_s=5,6,7)? Wait no. Wait, when you choose c_s ≥ S (which is 5), then compute_max_leaves(s) is S (5). So, for x=5, the number of ways is the number of c_s ≥ S (i.e., 5 to 7) plus the number of c_s = x (which is 5). But this would be overlapping. Because choosing c_s=5 is counted in both cases.\n\nAh, here's the mistake. The previous reasoning was incorrect. Because when x is S, the cases where c_s = x and c_s ≥ S overlap. Therefore, the correct way to count is:\n\nThe compute_max_leaves(s) can be x in 0 to min(S, k). For each x:\n\nIf x < S:\n\nThe number of ways to get x is 1 (c_s = x) if x ≤ k.\n\nIf x = S:\n\nThe number of ways to get x is (number of c_s ≥ S) which is (k - S + 1) if S ≤ k. However, this includes c_s = S, which was already counted in the x < S case. Wait, no. Because when x = S, and S is the sum of children's values, then x = S. So when x = S, the previous case (x < S) does not apply. Therefore, the correct approach is:\n\nThe possible x values are:\n\nAll x in 0 to min(S, k). For each x:\n\nIf x < S: the number of ways is 1 (choose c_s = x).\n\nIf x = S: the number of ways is (k - S + 1) if S ≤k, else 0.\n\nBut then, for x = S, the value of compute_max_leaves(s) is S, which is min(c_s, S). This is achieved when c_s ≥ S. So the number of ways is (k - S + 1) if S ≤k.\n\nBut what if S exceeds k? Then, min(c_s, S) = min(c_s, something larger than k). So, since c_s can be at most k, then min(c_s, S) = c_s. Therefore, for x in 0 to k, the number of ways is 1 for each x (choosing c_s = x). However, S is larger than k. So for x = S (which is larger than k), it's not possible. Therefore, in this case, the compute_max_leaves(s) can be up to k. So the x ranges from 0 to k.\n\nSo putting this together, for a given S (sum of children's compute_max_leaves) and given k, the number of ways for compute_max_leaves(s) to be x is:\n\nif x <= min(S, k):\n\n   if x < S:\n\n       ways = 1 if x <= k else 0\n\n   else (x == S):\n\n       ways = (k - S + 1) if S <=k else 0\n\nBut when S > k, then x can't be S. So the x can be up to k. So for x in 0..k:\n\nways is 1 (since choosing c_s = x gives min(x, S) = x).\n\nBut how to model this in code?\n\nAlternatively, for a given S and k, the compute_max_leaves(s) can be any value x in [0, m], where m = min(S, k). For each x in 0..m:\n\nif x < m:\n\n   the number of ways is 1 (choose c_s =x)\n\nif x = m:\n\n   the number of ways is (k - m + 1) (since m is min(S, k), which is either S or k. If m = S, then S ≤k, and the number is k - S + 1. If m =k, then S ≥k, and the number is k -k +1 = 1. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nIf S >=k, then m =k. So compute_max_leaves(s) can be any value x from 0 to k. For x <k, it's achieved by choosing c_s =x (ways=1). For x=k, it's achieved by choosing c_s >=k. Since c_s can be at most k, this is exactly when c_s =k. So the number of ways for x=k is 1. So in this case, for x=k, the number of ways is 1.\n\nSo combining the cases:\n\nfor x in 0 to m:\n\n   if x < m:\n\n      ways =1\n\n   else:\n\n      ways = (k - m +1) ?\n\nWait, no. Because m is min(S, k). So when m = S, then S ≤k. Then, for x = m = S, the number of ways is (k - S +1). When m =k, then S ≥k. Then, x =m =k, the number of ways is 1 (since c_s must be k).\n\nSo in general, for x in 0 to m:\n\nways[x] = 1 if x < m, and for x = m, ways is (k - m +1) if m = S, else 1 if m =k.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, for a given S and k, the number of ways for compute_max_leaves(s) to be x is:\n\nif x <=k:\n\n   if x < S: 1 way (choose c_s =x)\n\n   elif x == S and S <=k: (k - S +1) ways (choose c_s >= S)\n\n   else (x == S and S >k): no, because x is <=k, and S>k implies x < S.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's easier to model for each possible S (the sum of children's values) and for each possible x (the compute_max_leaves(s) value), the number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, S) =x.\n\nSo for a given S and x:\n\nif x > S: impossible.\n\nif x <= S:\n\n   then, min(c_s, S) =x can happen in two cases:\n\n   1. c_s =x and x <= S (which is always true here)\n\n   2. c_s >=x and x = S. Because if x = S, then min(c_s, S) = S if c_s >=S.\n\nBut for x < S, min(c_s, S) =x only if c_s =x. Because if c_s is larger than x but less than S, then min(c_s, S) =c_s which is larger than x. So for x < S, the only way to get x is by choosing c_s=x.\n\nFor x = S, the ways are the number of c_s >= S (since then min(c_s, S) =S). However, c_s can be from S to k. So the number of ways is max(0, k - S +1).\n\nSo, for any x:\n\nif x > S: 0\n\nelse:\n\n   if x < S: ways =1 if x <=k else 0\n\n   if x == S: ways = max(0, k - S +1) if S <=k else 0\n\nBut since S can be up to ... Well, for each node, the sum of children's compute_max_leaves can be up to ... Well, for leaves, it's 1. For their parents, it's up to 2, and so on. For the root's children (depth 1), the maximum sum is 2^n. For n=15, that's 32768. But since k can be up to 2e5, and for each node, S can be up to 2^n, which for n=15 is 32768, which is manageable.\n\nSo for each node, given the possible values of the sum of children's compute_max_leaves (S), we can compute for each possible x (the compute_max_leaves of this node) the number of ways to choose c_s.\n\nBut how to model this in the DP?\n\nThe idea is to perform a post-order traversal of the trie. For each node, we compute a frequency map (dictionary or array) that represents the number of ways to choose c_s for this node such that compute_max_leaves(s) equals a certain value. For leaves (depth n), their frequency map is:\n\nfor x in 0..k:\n\n   if x == 0: ways = 1 (if c_s is 0, then compute_max_leaves is 0)\n\n   if x == 1: ways = 1 (if c_s is >=1, but since for leaves, compute_max_leaves is min(c_s, 1). So for x=1, the number of ways is (k -1 +1) =k if 1 <=k. But wait, for leaves, the compute_max_leaves is min(c_s, 1). Because for a leaf node, the sum of children's compute_max_leaves is 0 (since it has no children). So S=0. Then, compute_max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, 0). But that's not correct. Wait, earlier analysis said that for leaves, compute_max_leaves is min(c_s, 1). Where did that come from?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-express the compute_max_leaves function.\n\nFor a node s of depth d:\n\nif d == n:\n\n   the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is 1 if c_s >=1, else 0. Because the subtree of s is just the node itself. So, the compute_max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, 1). Because if c_s >=1, then you can take the leaf (so 1). Else, you can't take it (so 0).\n\nBut according to the previous formula for non-leaves, which is min(c_s, left + right). For leaves, since they have no children, left + right is 0. So compute_max_leaves(s) = min(c_s, 0). Which would be zero. But that contradicts the correct value.\n\nAh! There's a mistake in the earlier reasoning. The formula for compute_max_leaves(s) depends on whether s is a leaf or not. For non-leaf nodes (d <n), compute_max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, left + right). For leaves (d =n), compute_max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, 1). Because the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is 1, which can be taken if c_s >=1.\n\nSo, the formula for compute_max_leaves(s) is:\n\nif d ==n:\n\n   return min(c_s, 1)\n\nelse:\n\n   return min(c_s, left + right)\n\nThus, for leaves, the sum of children's compute_max_leaves is zero, but the compute_max_leaves is min(c_s, 1).\n\nSo, the previous analysis for non-leaf nodes still holds, but for leaves, the compute_max_leaves is min(c_s, 1). Therefore, for leaves, the S (sum of children's values) is zero, and compute_max_leaves is min(c_s, 1).\n\nSo, for a leaf node, given S = 0, the compute_max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, 1). So, the possible x values are 0 or 1. For x=0: c_s can be 0. For x=1: c_s can be >=1. So the number of ways for x=0 is 1 (choose c_s=0), for x=1 is (k -1 +1) =k if 1<=k. But since k can be as small as 1, but the problem says k >=1.\n\nThus, for leaves, the frequency map is:\n\nways[0] = 1 (if c_s=0)\n\nways[1] = (k) (if c_s >=1, which is k choices: 1 to k)\n\nWait, no. Because c_s can be chosen from 0 to k. So for x=1, the number of c_s that satisfy min(c_s, 1) =1 is the number of c_s >=1. Which is k - 0 (since c_s ranges from 0 to k). Wait, the number of integers between 1 and k inclusive is k.\n\nYes. So for a leaf node, the frequency map is:\n\nways[0] = 1 (when c_s =0)\n\nways[1] = k (when c_s >=1)\n\nOther x's are 0.\n\nSo, for a leaf node, the possible x values are 0 and 1.\n\nThis changes the earlier analysis. Now, for non-leaf nodes, the compute_max_leaves is min(c_s, left + right). For leaves, it's min(c_s, 1).\n\nSo, back to the DP approach. For each node, we need to compute a frequency map of possible x values (compute_max_leaves) and the number of ways to choose c_s for this node given the possible x values of its children.\n\nThe process is:\n\n- For leaves (depth n), the frequency map is {0:1, 1:k} (but only if k >=1. But since k >=1 per input constraints?)\n\nWait, the input constraints say 1<=k. So yes.\n\nFor non-leaf nodes, we process their children first, then combine their frequency maps.\n\nBut how to combine the children's frequency maps?\n\nFor a non-leaf node, the sum of children's compute_max_leaves is left_val + right_val. But since each child has their own frequency map, we need to consider all possible combinations of left_val and right_val, compute their sum S = left_val + right_val, and then for each possible S, compute the frequency map for the current node.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive. For example, if each child has O(m) possible x values, then combining them would take O(m^2) time. However, for n up to 15, the maximum depth is 15, and the number of nodes is manageable.\n\nBut for each node, the number of possible x values depends on the depth. For example, leaves have x up to 1. For their parents, x can be up to 2. For their grandparents, up to 4, etc. So for depth d, the maximum possible x is 2^{n -d}.\n\nBut for n=15, the maximum possible x for the root's children (depth 1) is 2^{14} = 16384. Which is manageable with some optimizations.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Perform a post-order traversal of the trie.\n\n- For each node, compute the frequency map (ways to choose c_s for this node leading to x).\n\n- For leaves, the frequency map is as discussed.\n\n- For non-leaves, we take the frequency maps of the left and right children, and for each possible pair (l, r), compute S = l + r, then compute the frequency map for this node based on S and",

Each node corresponds to a binary string prefix of lengths from 1 to `n`.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a bottom-up approach to compute the number of valid configurations for each node. For each node, calculate the possible values of the maximum number of leaves (strings of length `n`) that can be included in the multiset, considering constraints.\n3. **Post-order Traversal**: Traverse the trie in post-order to ensure that each node's children are processed before the node itself. This allows us to compute the valid configurations for each node based on its children.\n4. **Combining Results**: For each non-leaf node, combine the results from its left and right children to determine the valid configurations for the node, considering the constraints on the number of prefixes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k, f = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    # Precompute all nodes in the trie, represented by their depth and path\n    # We'll build the trie structure using recursion or BFS, but since n is small, we can generate all possible nodes\n    # However, for DP, we can process nodes in a post-order way.\n\n    # We'll represent the trie as a tree, with each node having left and right children\n    # But for the purposes of DP, we can generate all possible nodes recursively.\n\n    # We'll use memoization to store the DP for each node.

For leaf nodes, the configuration is determined by whether the count of allowed prefixes includes the node itself.\n3. **Combining Results**: For non-leaf nodes, the configurations are combined by considering all possible sums of values from their children, ensuring constraints are respected.\n4. **Final Calculation**: The result is obtained by combining the configurations of the two root children (depth 1 nodes) to ensure the total number of valid strings equals `f`.",

The maximum m is the sum of the compute_max_leaves of those two children. However, in our current approach, the dfs(1) returns the dp for one of those children.

The maximum m is the sum of the compute_max_leaves('0') + compute_max_leaves('1').\n    # Therefore, we need to compute the dp for '0' and '1' separately, then combine them.\n\n    # However, the previous code's dfs(1) returns the dp for a single node. So, we need to run dfs twice for the two children.\n\n    # To correct this, let's modify the approach:\n\n    # The root has two children: left and right (depth 1). We need to compute their dp separately.\n\n    # So, the function should return the dp for a node given its depth and the path. However, for the purpose of DP, since all nodes at the same depth have the same structure, we can memoize based on depth.\n\n    # However, for the initial approach, the code is not handling this correctly. Let's adjust the code.\n\n    # Let's redefine the dfs function to take the depth and return the dp for any node at that depth. Since all nodes at the same depth have the same structure (they are symmetric), their dp will be the same.\n\n    # Therefore, for each depth d, the dp for any node at depth d is the same. Thus, we can compute it once per depth.\n\n    # However, this is only true if the nodes are symmetric. For example, a node at depth d with path '00' and another with path '01' would have the same dp, because their subtrees are structurally identical.\n\n    # Therefore, for each depth d, the dp for any node at that depth is the same.
