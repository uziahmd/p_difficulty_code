Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Mister B wants to find three vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. The output should be three distinct vertices. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the angles in a regular polygon work. Let me think. For a regular n-gon, each interior angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. But wait, that's the angle between two adjacent sides. However, when you pick three vertices, the angle formed depends on how many steps apart they are.\n\nWait, the problem says that the angle is formed with v2 as the vertex, and v1 and v3 on its sides. So, for example, in a regular polygon, if we pick three vertices such that there are k steps between v2 and v1, and m steps between v2 and v3, then the angle would depend on those steps. But since the polygon is regular and convex, maybe there's a formula for the angle based on the number of sides between the points.\n\nLet me think about how to compute the angle. Suppose we have a regular n-gon. Let's take a vertex v2. Then, if we choose two other vertices v1 and v3 such that there are k edges between v2 and v1 along one side, and l edges between v2 and v3 along the other side. Wait, but since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 would be determined by the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when going around the polygon. For example, in a regular polygon, if you pick three consecutive vertices, the angle at the middle one is the interior angle. But if you pick vertices that are further apart, the angle changes.\n\nWait, here's a way to think about it. In a regular polygon, the central angles are 360/n degrees. For example, each side subtends an angle of 360/n degrees at the center. Now, when considering the angle at vertex v2, perhaps the angle depends on the arc between v1 and v3. For example, if there are m steps between v1 and v3 (going around the polygon), then the angle at v2 would be something like (m-1) * (central angle) / something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for the angle. Let me think of some examples. Take a square (n=4). If we take three consecutive vertices, say 1,2,3. The angle at 2 is 90 degrees, which is the interior angle. But if we take vertices 1,2,4, then the angle at 2 would be 45 degrees. Because the lines from 2 to 1 and 2 to 4 form a 45-degree angle. How does that relate to the number of steps?\n\nIn the square case, for the angle at vertex v2, if there are k steps between v1 and v3 (when moving around the polygon), then maybe the angle is (k * 180)/n ?\n\nWait, for the square example, when the angle is 45 degrees. Let's see: between v1 and v3 (say, 1 and 4) there are two steps if you go clockwise (from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4?), no. Wait, in a square, vertices are 1,2,3,4. If you take v1=1, v2=2, v3=4. Then between v1 and v3, there's one step if you go counter-clockwise (from 1 to 4), but two steps clockwise. But how does that relate to the angle?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 depends on the number of sides between v1 and v3. For example, if there are m vertices between v1 and v3 along the perimeter (in one direction), then the angle can be calculated using some formula.\n\nAnother approach: For a regular polygon, the measure of the angle formed by three vertices can be found using the formula. Let me look up the formula for the angle formed by three vertices in a regular polygon.\n\nUpon recalling, for a regular polygon with n sides, if you choose three vertices such that there are k steps between v1 and v2 and l steps between v2 and v3, but that might not be directly helpful. Alternatively, consider that when you select three vertices v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 depends on how many edges are between v1 and v3 when going around the polygon. Let me think about this.\n\nSuppose that between v1 and v3, there are m edges along the perimeter. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently calculating the closest possible angle using these properties.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Angles in Regular Polygons**: In a regular n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{360^\\circ}{n} $. For any three vertices $ v_1, v_2, v_3 $, the angle at $ v_2 $ can be determined based on the number of steps between $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $ around the polygon.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: The angle at vertex $ v_2 $ for vertices $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $, which are $ k $ steps apart (in one direction), is given by $ \\theta = \\frac{(k-1) \\times 180^\\circ}{n} $. This formula helps us determine the angle for various configurations of vertices.\n3. **Optimal Angle Search**: We need to find the value of $ k $ such that the angle $ \\theta $ is as close as possible to the given angle $ a $. This involves iterating over possible values of $ k $ and checking the closest match.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # The angle in a regular n-gon when choosing vertices with k steps apart\n    # The angle is (k-1)*180 / n\n    # We need to find the k that makes this angle closest to a\n    # But since k can be from 2 to n-1 (since we need at least two steps between v1 and v3)\n    # Wait, for a triangle (n=3), the only possible k is 2 (steps between v1 and v3)\n    # So for general case, k ranges from 2 to n-1\n    # But since the polygon is regular, the minimal angle is when k=2, maximal when k = n-1\n    \n    # Let's compute the best k\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 2\n    for k in range(2, n):\n        angle = (k - 1) * 180.0 / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Choose the smaller k or any, since any is acceptable\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n    \n    # Now, once we have best_k, we need to choose the vertices\n    # For example, let's choose v2 as 1, v1 as 1 + 1, v3 as 1 + best_k\n    # But need to make sure that the indices are within 1..n\n    # Let's pick v2 as 1, then v1 is 2, v3 is 1 + best_k\n    # However, if 1 + best_k exceeds n, we need to wrap around\n    # Wait, no.

The vertices are chosen such that `v2` is fixed at 1, `v1` is the next vertex, and `v3` is `k` steps away from `v2`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the closest possible angle using geometric properties of regular polygons, and then construct the required vertices accordingly.",
