There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. So, the challenge is to model how the tournament can be structured to maximize the winner's games under this constraint.\n\nLet me think about the examples given. For n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Maybe first play against one player, then against another. But how does the rule apply here? Let's see: when the winner plays their first game, they have 0 games before, and the opponent also 0. Then after winning, they have 1 game. The next opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. So if the second game is against someone who has 0 games (like the third player), then the difference is 1, which is allowed. So that works. Hence, the answer is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the output is 2. Wait, why can't the winner play three games? Let's think. Suppose the winner plays three games. That would require that each time they play, the opponent's game count is within one. Let's imagine:\n\nFirst game: 0 vs 0. Winner has 1 game.\n\nSecond game: opponent must have 0 or 1. Suppose they play against someone with 0. Now winner has 2 games. Then third game: opponent must have 1 or 2. But how can there be someone with 1 game? Let's see. If the winner's first two opponents are players 2 and 3. Then, for the third game, the opponent would need to have 1 or 2 games. But the only other player is 4. If player 4 hasn't played yet, then the difference is 2 (winner has 2, opponent 0). Which is more than one. So that's not allowed. Therefore, the maximum is 2.\n\nSo, how to model this? It seems like the problem is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because, for the winner to play as many games as possible, each time they play, the opponent must have a certain number of games. Let me think recursively. Let's say the maximum number of games the winner can play is f(n). How to find f(n)?\n\nLet me think: To maximize the number of games for the winner, each time they play a game, the opponent must be someone who has played as many games as possible. So, the structure might be such that the winner's path requires that each time they play, the opponent is from a subtree where they have played k-1 games, or k games. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a binary tree where each node represents a game. The winner's path is from the root to a leaf, and each step along the path represents a game. The constraints on the opponents' game counts imply that the depth of the tree is limited in some way.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for the winner to play m games, they must have defeated m opponents. Each of these opponents must have been in a situation where their number of games before facing the winner was either m-1, m-2, etc. Wait, perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the largest m such that the sum of the first m+1 Fibonacci numbers is less than or equal to n. Or something along those lines.\n\nWait, let's think about the minimal number of players required for the winner to have m games. For example:\n\nIf m=1, then you need 2 players (the winner and one opponent). So 2 players.\n\nFor m=2, the winner plays two games. The first game requires one opponent. The second game requires an opponent who has played either 0 or 1 games. Let's say the winner's first opponent is one player, and the second opponent is another player who has played 0 games. But how do they get to that point? Well, maybe the second opponent is someone who has not played before. But in that case, the winner has played 1 game, and the opponent has 0. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So for m=2, the total players needed is 3 (the winner, plus two opponents). But wait, in the example where n=3, the answer is 2. So that's correct.\n\nBut for m=3, how many players are needed? Let's think. The winner has to play 3 games. Let's see:\n\nThe first game: opponent has 0 games. After that, the winner has 1 game.\n\nSecond game: opponent must have 0 or 1. Let's say opponent has 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a constraint that two players can only compete if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. This problem can be efficiently solved using properties of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Constraint**: The rule that two players can only play against each other if their number of previous games differs by at most one implies that the structure of the tournament must be such that each match is balanced in terms of the number of games each player has already played.\n2. **Fibonacci Insight**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `m` games follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each game the winner plays requires opponents who themselves have played a certain number of games, leading to a recursive structure.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: We use an iterative approach to compute the maximum number of games the winner can play by checking the smallest Fibonacci-like numbers until we exceed the given number of players `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    # The maximum number of games the winner can play\n    # We use a Fibonacci-like approach to find the maximum m such that the sum of the first m+1 terms (like Fibonacci) is <= n\n    # Initialize the first two terms\n    a, b = 1, 1\n    count = 0\n    while a <= n:\n        count += 1\n        a, b = b, a + b\n    return count - 1\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    print(max_games(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start with two initial values `a` and `b` both set to 1, representing the minimum number of players needed for the winner to play 1 game.\n2. **Iterative Check**: In each iteration, we increment the count of games and update the Fibonacci-like sequence values. This loop continues until the value of `a` exceeds the number of players `n`.\n3. **Result Adjustment**: The count of games is adjusted by subtracting 1 because the loop exits when `a` exceeds `n`, giving us the maximum number of games just before exceeding the player limit.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result in logarithmic time relative to the value of `n`, making it suitable even for very large values up to $10^{18}$.",
