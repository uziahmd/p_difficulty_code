Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the total sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to balance that with adding some cards whose values are between -x and x. \n\nSo first, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call that target T = -S.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the minimum number of cards needed to sum up to T, where each card's value is between -x and x. But since we can choose any numbers in that range, how do we find the minimal count?\n\nLet me think. For example, if T is 0, then no cards are needed. But if T is non-zero, then we need to find the minimal number of cards that can add up to T. \n\nEach card can contribute at most x (if positive) or at least -x (if negative). So, for the minimal number of cards, we want to use the maximum possible contribution per card. \n\nFor example, if T is positive, then each card can contribute +x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). But wait, since each card can be as high as x. So for example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then 5 / 2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards (2+2+1). But wait, but the problem allows using any numbers. So maybe the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of |T| divided by x. Because each card can contribute up to x towards the target. \n\nBut let's think about the absolute value. Suppose T is some value. Let's take absolute value of T, because the sign can be handled by choosing positive or negative cards. \n\nSo the minimal number of cards required is ceil( |T| / x ), but with one adjustment. Because if |T| is exactly divisible by x, then it's |T|/x. Otherwise, it's (|T|//x) + 1. \n\nWait, for example, if T is 3 and x is 2. Then 3/2 is 1.5, so ceil is 2. Which would be two cards: 2 + 1. But since the maximum allowed per card is 2. So yes, two cards. \n\nAnother example: T is 4 and x is 2. Then 4/2 is exactly 2, so two cards. \n\nSo the formula is (abs(T) + x - 1) // x. Because that's how you compute the ceiling of division. \n\nBut wait, let's check. For T = 5, x=2: (5 + 2 -1 )//2 = 6//2=3. Which is correct. For T=4, (4 +2-1)/2=5//2=2. Correct. For T=3, (3+2-1)/2=4/2=2. Correct. \n\nYes. So the minimal number of cards is (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x. \n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then the answer is zero. So in that case, we don't need any cards. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nCompute the sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum_S. Then T is -sum_S. If T is zero, answer is 0. Else, compute the minimal number of cards as (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x. \n\nWait, but let's look at the examples given. \n\nFirst example input is 3 2, with cards -1, 1, 2. Sum is (-1 + 1 +2) = 2. So T is -2. So abs(T) is 2. x is 2. So (2 +2-1)/2 = 3/2 = 1.5 floored? Wait wait, (2 + 2-1) is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5, but integer division in Python would be 1. Wait, but (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x. So 2 +2-1 =3, divided by 2 is 1.5, which in integer division (using //) would be 1. But that's correct. Because 2 is exactly divisible by x=2. So 2 / 2 = 1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the first example. \n\nSecond example input is 2 3, with cards -2, -2. Sum is -4. T is 4",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the new ones) equals zero. The cards can have values ranging from -x to x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum needed to balance the found cards to zero is the negative of the sum of the found cards.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula `ceil(|target| / x)`, which can be efficiently calculated using integer arithmetic as `(abs(target) + x - 1) // x`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_S = sum(cards)\ntarget = -sum_S\n\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    min_cards = (abs(target) + x - 1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of found cards `n`, the maximum absolute value `x`, and the list of numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine how much more is needed to balance the total sum to zero.\n3. **Target Calculation**: The target sum needed to balance the found cards is the negative of their sum.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using integer arithmetic, we calculate the minimum number of cards required to reach the target sum by considering the maximum value each card can contribute (i.e., `x`). This ensures we use the minimal number of cards by leveraging the maximum possible contribution per card.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result in linear time relative to the number of found cards, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
