There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. For each house, the profit is a^2 where a is the height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that the tallest house in the range l_i to r_i must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit while satisfying all the restrictions.\n\nHmm. So how do I approach this? Since n, h, m are all up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach is possible. But even with n=50, trying all possibilities for each house's height would be h^50, which is way too big. That's not feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about constraints. The restrictions require that for each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum height in that interval is <= x_i. So for each such interval, the maximum of the heights in that range must not exceed x_i.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to choosing heights for each house such that all these constraints are satisfied, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nBut how to model this? One idea is that for each position, the maximum possible height it can have is determined by the restrictions that apply to it. However, since a restriction applies to a range, the maximum height of any house in that range can't exceed x_i. So for example, if there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, then all houses 1, 2, 3 must be <= 2. But if there are multiple overlapping restrictions, we need to find for each position the minimum x_i from all restrictions that cover it. Wait, no. Because a restriction says that the maximum in the interval is <= x_i. So for a particular house j, if there's a restriction that covers j (i.e., l_i <= j <= r_i), then the maximum height of that house can't be higher than x_i. But if there are multiple restrictions that include j, then the maximum allowed for j is the minimum of all x_i's from those restrictions. Because if one restriction says that in some interval containing j, the max is <= x1, and another says that in another interval containing j, the max is <= x2, then the maximum allowed for j is min(x1, x2). Because if j's height is higher than either x1 or x2, then that would violate the respective restriction.\n\nWait, no. Let me think. Suppose j is in a restriction [l1, r1] with x1, and also in [l2, r2] with x2. Then, the maximum height of j can't be higher than x1 (because in the first restriction, the max in [l1, r1] must be <=x1. So if j's height is higher than x1, then that would violate the first restriction. Similarly for the second. Therefore, the maximum allowed for j is the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that include j. But wait, maybe not. Because suppose there's a restriction that applies to a larger interval. For example, if there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, and another on [2,2] with x=3. Then, for house 2, the first restriction requires that the maximum in [1,3] is <=2. So house 2 can't be higher than 2. Even though the second restriction allows it to be up to 3. Because the first restriction is more restrictive. Therefore, for each house j, the maximum allowed height is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include j in their interval. Because any restriction that includes j in its interval imposes that the maximum in that interval is <=x_i. Which implies that j's height can't be higher than x_i. So for j, the maximum possible height is min( all x_i where j is in [l_i, r_i] ), and also h. Because the original maximum is h.\n\nWait, but maybe there are restrictions that don't include j, but other houses. For example, suppose there's a restriction that says in [1,2], the max is <=3. Then, house 3 can be as high as h, unless there's another restriction that includes it.\n\nSo the idea is: For each house j, the maximum height it can have is the minimum between h and the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include j in their interval. Because if there's any restriction that includes j, then the max in that interval must be <=x_i. So j's height can't be higher than x_i. Therefore, the maximum possible for j is the minimum of all such x_i's. If there are no restrictions that include j, then",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the profit from building houses on a street while adhering to zoning restrictions. Each house's height contributes to the profit as the square of its height, and each restriction limits the maximum height in a specific range.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Constraints**: Each house can have a height between 0 and a given maximum height `h`. Additionally, there are restrictions that specify the maximum height allowed in certain intervals.\n2. **Determine Maximum Heights**: For each house, determine the maximum allowable height by considering all restrictions that include that house in their interval. The maximum allowable height for a house is the minimum value of all such restrictions and the global maximum height `h`.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: Once the maximum allowable height for each house is determined, compute the profit by summing the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    results = []\n    \n    while idx < len(input):\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, h, m = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        \n        # Initialize max_heights array with h\n        max_heights = [h] * n\n        \n        for _ in range(m):\n            l, r, x = map(int, input[idx].strip().split())\n            idx += 1\n            # Adjust l and r to 0-based index\n            for i in range(l-1, r):\n                if max_heights[i] > x:\n                    max_heights[i] = x\n        \n        total = 0\n        for height in max_heights:\n            total += height * height\n        \n        results.append(str(total))\n    \n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, parsing the number of spots `n`, maximum height `h`, and number of restrictions `m`.\n2. **Initialization**: An array `max_heights` is initialized with the maximum possible height `h` for each spot.\n3. **Applying Restrictions**: For each restriction, the maximum allowable height for each house in the specified range is updated to the minimum of its current value and the restriction's maximum height.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: The total profit is calculated by summing the squares of the allowable heights for each house.\n\nThis approach ensures that all restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit by leveraging the constraints efficiently. The complexity is manageable given the problem constraints (up to 50 spots and restrictions), making this solution both effective and efficient.",
