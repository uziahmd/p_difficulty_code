Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the total sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to balance that with adding some cards whose values are between -x and x. \n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let me think: the sum of the new cards needs to be equal to -S. But each new card can contribute between -x and x. So, what's the minimum number of cards needed to reach that target?\n\nLet me think about the target. Let's say the required sum is T = -S. We need to find the minimal number of cards whose sum is T, with each card's value between -x and x.\n\nBut how do I find the minimal number of cards? Let's think about the maximum possible contribution per card. For example, if T is positive, then each card can contribute up to +x. Similarly, if T is negative, each card can contribute as low as -x. So the minimal number of cards would be the ceiling of |T| divided by x. But wait, maybe there's some cases where it's possible with fewer cards?\n\nWait, for example, if T is 5 and x is 3. Then each card can contribute up to 3. So 5/3 is 1.666..., so we need 2 cards. Because 3 + 2 =5. But 2 cards. So the minimal is ceil(|T| / x). But wait, what if T is 3? Then one card is enough. So yes, the formula would be ceil( |T| / x ), but only when T is not zero. Wait, but if T is zero, then no cards are needed. So the answer is zero in that case.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 4 and x is 3. Then 4/3 is 1.333, so ceil is 2. But 3+1=4, so two cards. So yes, that formula works. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but only when T is not zero. But wait, what if T is 0? Then zero cards are needed. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards, S.\n2. Compute T = -S. This is the sum that the new cards must contribute.\n3. If T is zero, then answer is 0.\n4. Else, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach T. Which is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, why?\n\nBecause each card can contribute at most x towards the absolute value. So for example, if T is positive, then each card can contribute up to x. So the minimal number is ceil(T / x). Similarly if T is negative, then each card can contribute up to -x (so the absolute value is x). So the minimal number is ceil( |T| / x ). \n\nWait, but let's take T=5 and x=3. Then 5/3 is 1.666, ceil is 2. Which is correct. For T=3, 3/3 is 1, so 1 card. For T=2, 2/3 is 0.666, ceil is 1. Which is correct. So yes, the formula is correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 4 and x is 3. Then 4/3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. Which is correct. So the formula is correct.\n\nSo the answer is the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), unless T is zero, which requires zero cards.\n\nBut wait, what about when T is exactly divisible by x? For example, T=6 and x=3. Then 6/3=2, so 2 cards. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCalculate the sum of the found cards. Then T is -sum. If T is zero, return 0. Otherwise, compute the absolute value of T, divide by x, take the ceiling of that. That's the answer.\n\nBut wait, let's check the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nThe sum of found cards is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. The absolute value is 2. Divided by x (2) is 1. So ceil(1) is 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the newly found ones) equals zero. The solution involves calculating the sum of the currently found cards and determining how many additional cards are needed to balance this sum.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum of the integers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum for the new cards is the negative of the sum of the found cards. If this target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the minimum number of cards required by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum absolute value allowed on a card (x). Use the ceiling of this division to ensure we account for any remainder.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, x = map(int, line.split())\n        cards = list(map(int, input[len(input)-1].split()))\n        total = sum(cards)\n        target = -total\n        if target == 0:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            abs_target = abs(target)\n            min_cards = math.ceil(abs_target / x)\n            print(min_cards)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. Each line is processed to extract the number of cards, the maximum absolute value on a card, and the list of integers on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed. The target sum needed from the new cards is the negative of this sum.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed, and the result is zero.\n4. **Ceiling Division**: If the target sum is non-zero, the minimum number of cards required is determined using ceiling division of the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum allowed value on a card (x). This ensures that even if there is a remainder, we account for it by rounding up.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of cards using basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
