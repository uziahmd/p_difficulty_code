Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. Hmm. The task is to process a string S that's being built step by step by appending 0s and 1s. After each addition, we need to compute the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code. Oh right, but there are four forbidden codes: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring of S that is one of those four is invalid and shouldn't be counted.\n\nWait, but how do we count all possible valid substrings? Let me think. For each possible substring of S, we need to check if it's a valid Morse code for a letter. Then, the total number of such substrings (each being a valid code) is the answer. But wait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". So each valid substring corresponds to exactly one letter. However, different substrings might correspond to the same letter, but since the problem counts sequences of letters, each occurrence counts as a separate sequence. For example, if two different substrings correspond to the same letter, like \"1\" and \"1\" again, then \"T\" and \"T\" would be two separate sequences. Wait no, the problem says sequences of letters. So for example, if the substring is \"1\", which is T, then that's one sequence. If another substring is \"1\", that's another occurrence of T, but the count is for the number of sequences. Wait, the problem says \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S\". So each valid substring (i.e., each valid code) is a single letter. So the total number of such sequences is equal to the number of valid substrings. Because each valid substring represents exactly one letter, and each occurrence is considered as a separate sequence. For example, if S is \"11\", then the substrings are \"1\" (first position), \"1\" (second position), and \"11\" (both). Each of these is a valid code (assuming they are not in the forbidden list). So the count would be 3. So the answer after each step is the count of all valid substrings of S.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, after each step, compute the number of valid substrings of S. A substring here is any contiguous sequence of characters in S. And each such substring must be of length 1-4, and not be one of the four forbidden codes.\n\nWait, but the forbidden codes are only those four. So for any substring of S, if its length is between 1 and 4, and it's not in the forbidden list, then it's a valid code and contributes 1 to the answer. Otherwise, it's not counted.\n\nSo the approach is: for each step, S is a string of length i (after i steps). We need to consider all possible substrings of S, check their lengths (must be 1-4), check if they are in the forbidden list. Then sum up all valid ones.\n\nBut for m up to 3000, and each step, the length of S is up to 3000. The number of substrings for each step would be O(n^2), which for n=3000 is about 9 million per step. For m=3000 steps, that would be 27 billion operations. That's way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm. Let's think about dynamic programming. Maybe we can track, for each position, the number of valid substrings ending at that position. Then, for each new character added to S, we can compute how many new valid substrings are added.\n\nLet me think. Suppose after adding the new character (say, the current S is s of length n), we can look at the last k characters (k from 1 to 4) and check if they form a valid code. For each of these possible k-length substrings, if they are valid, then they contribute 1 to the total count. But also, when considering previous possibilities. Wait, perhaps we can track for each position, the number of valid substrings ending at that position. Then, the total answer is the sum over all positions of the number of valid substrings ending there.\n\nFor example, for each i (current length of S), we can compute dp[i], which is the number of valid substrings ending at position i. Then, the total answer is the sum of dp[1] to dp[i].\n\nSo how to compute dp[i]?\n\nWell, for each i, we can check the last 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters. For each possible length l (from 1 to 4), if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then dp[i] += 1. Also, if there are longer substrings that could be broken down into valid codes? No, wait. Because each valid substring is counted as a separate entity. For example, if the current string ends with a valid code of length 2, then that's one substring. But if the previous part also has some valid substrings, but that's already accounted for in earlier dp entries.\n\nWait, no. The dp[i] is the number of valid substrings that end at position i. For example, if the current string is \"111\" (length 3), then the substrings ending at position 3 are:\n\n- \"1\" (length 1)\n- \"11\" (length 2)\n- \"111\" (length 3)\n\nEach of these may or may not be valid. So dp[3] is the sum of 1 for each of these that are valid.\n\nSo for each new character added (say, at position i), we can check the last 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters (but not longer than i). For each possible l (1 to 4), check if the substring s[i-l ... i-1] (assuming 0-based) is valid. If so, add 1 to dp[i]. Then the total answer after i steps is the sum of dp[1] to dp[i].\n\nThis approach would reduce the time complexity. For each step, we check up to 4 possibilities, so O(1) per step. Then the total time is O(m * 4) = O(m), which is acceptable for m up to 3000.\n\nYes! So the key is to compute dp[i] as the number of valid substrings ending at position i. Then the total answer after each step is the sum of dp[1] to dp[i].\n\nNow, the question is how to check whether a substring of length l (from 1 to 4) is valid.\n\nFirst, we need to generate a set of forbidden codes. The forbidden codes are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So for any substring of length 1-4, if it is in this forbidden set, then it's invalid. Otherwise, if the length is between 1-4, it's valid.\n\nWait, but the allowed codes are those that are not in the forbidden list. So for example, a substring of length 1 is allowed (since none of the forbidden codes have length 1). Similarly for length 2, 3, 4, except for the four forbidden ones.\n\nSo for a given substring, we need to check:\n\n- its length is between 1 and 4 (which is automatically true because we check for l from 1 to 4, and the current length is i, so for l up to 4, the substring exists only if i >= l).\n\nSo for each l in 1..4, if i >= l, then check the substring of length l ending at i. If that substring is not in the forbidden set, then add 1 to dp[i].\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the forbidden set as a set of strings.\n\n- For each step i (from 1 to m):\n\n   - Append the new character to the current string S.\n\n   - For l in 1 to 4:\n\n      - if i >= l:\n\n         - get the substring of length l ending at position i (i.e., S[i-l:i])\n\n         - if that substring is not in forbidden, then add 1 to dp[i]\n\n   - The total answer is the sum of all dp[1] to dp[i].\n\nBut wait, the sum of all dp up to i is the total number of valid substrings in the current S. Because each dp[j] counts the number of valid substrings ending at j, and all substrings are accounted for once.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the problem becomes manageable. Now, the next thing is to precompute the forbidden set. Let's see:\n\nForbidden strings are:\n\n\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\".\n\nSo, the forbidden set is {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}.\n\nSo, during processing, for each possible substring of length 1-4, we check if it's in forbidden. If not, then it's valid and contributes 1 to the count.\n\nSo, for each step, we can build the string S incrementally, and for each new character, check the last 1, 2, 3, 4 characters (if possible) and count how many are valid.\n\nNow, the issue is that for each step, the current S is built by appending the new character. So, for example, after the first step, S is '1' (if the first input is '1').\n\nNow, for the DP approach, we can keep track of the current string, and for each new step, check the last 1-4 characters.\n\nBut for checking the substrings, we need to get the substring of length l ending at the current position. So, for example, if the current S is of length i, then for l=1, it's the last character. For l=2, it's the last two characters, etc.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nInitialize S as an empty string.\n\nInitialize a variable total to 0.\n\nInitialize a variable dp_prev (or something similar) to track the sum of dp's up to the previous step.\n\nBut for each step, we can compute the current dp_i, which is the number of valid substrings ending at this step. Then, the total is the previous total plus dp_i.\n\nSo, for example, after each step, we can have a cumulative sum.\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\nWe can have a list called dp, where dp[i] is the number of valid substrings ending at position i (positions are 1-based). But since for each step, we only need the previous values up to i-1, maybe we can just keep track of the cumulative sum.\n\nLet me think. For each step i (from 1 to m):\n\ncurrent S is s = s_prev + new_char.\n\nWe compute the current dp_i as the number of valid substrings ending at i.\n\nThen the total is the previous total plus dp_i.\n\nSo, we can track the total as a variable that accumulates the sum.\n\nSo, for example, initial total is 0.\n\nAfter each step, we calculate dp_i and add it to the total.\n\nSo, the code can be:\n\nInitialize S as empty string.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor each step in 1..m:\n\n   append the new character to S.\n\n   current_dp = 0\n\n   for l in 1..4:\n\n      if len(S) >= l:\n\n          substr = S[-l:] \n\n          if substr not in forbidden:\n\n              current_dp +=1\n\n   total += current_dp\n\n   print(total % MOD)\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for each l in 1 to 4, we check the substring of length l ending at the current position. For example, when l=1, substr is the last character. If that is not forbidden, then it's a valid substring. Similarly for l=2, etc. But the forbidden set contains only 4 elements, which are of length 4. So for l=1, 2, 3, the substrings are allowed unless they are in forbidden. But forbidden only has length 4. So for l=1, 2, 3, the substrings are automatically allowed, unless they are in forbidden. Wait, but forbidden contains only length 4 strings. So for l=1, 2, 3, the substrings can't be in forbidden. Therefore, for l=1, 2, 3, the check is whether the substring is in forbidden? No. Wait, the forbidden list has only 4 strings, all of length 4. So, for substrings of length less than 4, they are automatically allowed. Only for l=4, we need to check if it's in forbidden.\n\nAh! That's a key insight. Because the forbidden codes are only of length 4. So for l=1, 2, 3, any substring is valid. Only for l=4, we need to check if it's one of the forbidden codes.\n\nSo, this simplifies the code. For each new character, we check for l=1, 2, 3, 4. For l=1, 2, 3: the substrings are valid. For l=4: check if it's in forbidden. So for each step, the current_dp is:\n\nnumber of valid substrings ending at current position. Which is:\n\nfor l=1, 2, 3: if the current length is >= l, then add 1.\n\nfor l=4: if current length is >=4 and the substring is not forbidden, add 1.\n\nSo for example, if the current length is 3, then l can be 1, 2, 3. All of them are valid, so current_dp is 3.\n\nIf the current length is 4, then l can be 1, 2, 3 (each adds 1) and l=4, which adds 1 if the substring is not forbidden.\n\nSo, for each step, the current_dp can be calculated as:\n\ncount = 0\n\nif len(S) >= 1: count +=1\n\nif len(S) >=2: count +=1\n\nif len(S) >=3: count +=1\n\nif len(S) >=4 and the last 4 chars not in forbidden: count +=1\n\nSo, this reduces the checking for each step. For example, for a string of length i, the current_dp is min(3, i) + (if i >=4 and the last 4 is allowed, then 1 else 0).\n\nWait, but why? Because for l=1, 2, 3, the substrings are valid. So, for each l from 1 to 3, if the length allows, add 1. Then for l=4, check if it's allowed.\n\nSo, the code can be optimized as:\n\ncurrent_dp = 0\n\nif len(S) >=1:\n\n   current_dp +=1\n\nif len(S) >=2:\n\n   current_dp +=1\n\nif len(S) >=3:\n\n   current_dp +=1\n\nif len(S) >=4:\n\n   substr = S[-4:]\n\n   if substr not in forbidden:\n\n       current_dp +=1\n\nSo, this would be O(1) per step.\n\nThat's a big optimization. So the forbidden check is only needed for l=4. So, the code can proceed this way.\n\nLet me test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nAfter first step, S is '1'. len is 1. So current_dp is 1. total is 1. Output is 1.\n\nAfter second step, S is '11'. len is 2. current_dp is 1 (for l=1) + 1 (for l=2) + 1 (for l=3? No, len is 2 <3. So current_dp is 1+1=2. So total is 1+2=3. Output is 3.\n\nThird step: S is '111'. len is 3. current_dp is 1 (l=1) +1 (l=2) +1 (l=3) + check l=4? No. So current_dp is 3. total becomes 3+3=6? Wait but the sample output is 7. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample output for the first input is [1, 3, 7]. Wait the first sample input is 3 steps, and outputs 1, 3, 7. Let's see:\n\nAfter third step, the total should be 7.\n\nWait according to our calculation, after first step: total is 1.\n\nSecond step: current_dp is 2 (adding 1 and 2). So total is 1+2=3.\n\nThird step: current_dp is 3 (l=1, 2, 3). So total is 3+3=6. But sample output says 7. So there's a mistake here.\n\nWait what's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh no, I think I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Because the current_dp is the number of valid substrings ending at the current position. But the total is the sum of all dp's up to current step. So for the third step, the current_dp is 3. But the total is 1 (from first step) + 2 (from second) + 3 (from third) = 6. But the sample output says after third step it's 7. So there's a contradiction here. Which indicates that my approach is wrong.\n\nWait the sample input after three steps is S = '111'.\n\nThe valid substrings are:\n\nAll substrings of length 1, 2, 3. Since none of them are forbidden (as forbidden codes are of length 4). So the number of substrings is:\n\nNumber of substrings of length 1: 3.\n\nLength 2: 2.\n\nLength 3: 1.\n\nTotal 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. But according to the sample explanation, the answer is 7. Wait what's going on here?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that after all three steps, the answer is 7. Let me check the note again.\n\nIn the note, the first sample input is 3 steps, and the output is 1, 3, 7. Let me recheck the note.\n\nThe note says:\n\nAfter all characters have been appended, S is \"111\". The valid substrings are:\n\n\"1\", \"11\", \"111\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\". Wait that's 7 entries. But according to my calculation, the number of substrings is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because the problem is not counting the number of substrings, but the number of sequences of letters. Each valid substring represents a single letter. However, different substrings can represent the same letter, but each occurrence counts as a separate sequence. Wait, but in the sample explanation, the count is 7, which is higher than the number of substrings. How?\n\nWait the sample explanation lists the following sequences:\n\n\"T\" (from \"1\")\n\n\"M\" (from \"11\")\n\n\"O\" (from \"111\")\n\n\"TT\" (from \"1\" and \"1\")\n\n\"TM\" (from \"1\" and \"11\")\n\n\"MT\" (from \"11\" and \"1\")\n\n\"TTT\" (from \"1\", \"1\", \"1\").\n\nWait but the substrings are:\n\nAll possible substrings of S. Let's list them:\n\nS is \"111\".\n\nSubstrings:\n\nPositions 1: \"1\"\n\nPositions 2: \"1\"\n\nPositions 3: \"1\"\n\nLength 2: \"11\" (positions 1-2), \"11\" (positions 2-3)\n\nLength 3: \"111\"\n\nSo total substrings are 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. But the sample explanation counts 7 sequences. How?\n\nAh! Oh wait, the sample explanation says that the sequences are:\n\n\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n\nWhich is 7. But how does that map to substrings?\n\nBecause each of these sequences is formed by concatenating letters. For example, \"TT\" is two letters, each represented by \"1\". But the substring \"11\" (the first two characters) represents the letter M. So the sample explanation seems to be counting the number of possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting the string into valid codes. Wait, this is completely different from what I thought earlier.\n\nOh no! I completely misunderstood the problem. Oh my god. So the original problem isn't counting the number of valid substrings, but the number of ways to split the string into sequences of valid codes. But that's not what the problem says. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nWait, the wording is confusing. What does it mean for a sequence of letters to be represented with some substring of S in Morse code?\n\nEach letter is represented by a Morse code. So a sequence of letters is represented by the concatenation of their Morse codes. For example, the sequence \"T\" is represented by \"1\", the sequence \"TM\" is represented by \"11\", and the sequence \"TT\" is represented by \"11\".\n\nWait, but the problem says that each sequence of letters is represented by some substring of S. So, for example, if S is \"111\", then the substring \"11\" can represent either the letter M (as a single letter) or two Ts (as two letters). So both sequences (\"M\" and \"TT\") are counted as separate sequences. Hence, the number of sequences is not the number of valid substrings, but the number of ways to split the string into valid codes. Wait, but the problem says \"some substring of S\". So for example, the substring \"11\" can be interpreted as a single code (M) or as two codes (T and T). But according to the problem statement, the question is to find the number of sequences of letters that are represented with some substring of S. So for each substring of S, if it is a valid code (i.e., not forbidden), then it contributes one sequence (a single letter). Additionally, if there are ways to split the substring into multiple valid codes, then each of those splits would contribute additional sequences. But how?\n\nWait, this is a completely different problem. For example, the sample input S is \"111\". The substrings are:\n\n\"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", \"111\".\n\nEach of these substrings is a valid code. But for the substring \"11\", it's a valid code (M) and also can be split into two \"1\"s (T and T). So the sequences \"M\" and \"TT\" are both counted. Similarly for the substring \"111\": it can be split into \"1\" + \"1\" + \"1\", \"1\" + \"11\", \"11\" + \"1\", or \"111\". So for each possible way of splitting a substring into valid codes, we count the sequence of letters. Thus, the problem is to count all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid codes.\n\nBut this is a much more complex problem. The initial approach was incorrect because I thought of counting the number of valid substrings, but actually, the problem requires counting the number of ways to split any substring into valid codes, and each split corresponds to a sequence of letters.\n\nThis changes everything. So the problem is similar to the classic \"number of ways to decode a string\" problem, but applied to all substrings of S.\n\nSo for example, for S = \"111\", the answer is 7 as explained in the sample. Let's see how that comes about.\n\nEach substring of S:\n\nFor each possible substring, we need to count the number of ways to split it into valid codes. Then sum all those numbers across all substrings.\n\nSo for example, the substring \"1\" (length 1) can be split in exactly 1 way (just the single letter). So contributes 1.\n\nThe substring \"1\" (another occurrence) contributes 1.\n\nThe third \"1\" contributes 1.\n\nThe substring \"11\" can be split in two ways: as a single code (M) or two codes (T and T). So contributes 2.\n\nAnother occurrence of \"11\" (positions 2-3) contributes 2.\n\nThe substring \"111\" can be split into:\n\n- 1 + 1 + 1 (3 ways? Or 1 way?)\n\nWait, the number of ways to split a string into valid codes is similar to the problem of decoding a message. For example, for the string \"111\", the number of ways is:\n\n- Take first 1 (valid), then the remaining \"11\" can be split in 2 ways (so total 2).\n\n- Take first 2 (valid), then remaining \"1\" can be split in 1 way (total 1).\n\n- Take first 3 (valid), which is 1 way.\n\nSo total 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 ways.\n\nWait but according to the sample explanation, the answer for S = \"111\" is 7. Let's see:\n\nThe sample explanation lists 7 sequences. Let's count how many they are:\n\nEach individual letter (T, M, O) → 3 sequences.\n\nThen sequences of two letters: TT, TM, MT → 3 sequences.\n\nAnd TTT → 1 sequence.\n\nTotal 3 + 3 + 1 = 7. So how does that relate to the splits of all substrings?\n\nLet's break down all substrings and their contributions:\n\nSubstrings of length 1: 3 substrings, each contributes 1 → 3.\n\nSubstrings of length 2: 2 substrings, each contributes 2 (split into 1 code or 2 codes) → 2 * 2 = 4.\n\nSubstring of length 3: 1 substring, contributes 4 (as above) → 4.\n\nTotal sum is 3 + 4 + 4 = 11? But the sample says 7. So clearly, there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the sequences are:\n\n\"T\" (from \"1\"), \"M\" (from \"11\"), \"O\" (from \"111\"), \"TT\" (from \"11\"), \"TM\" (from \"111\"), \"MT\" (from \"111\"), \"TTT\" (from \"111\").\n\nWait, but how does that fit into the splits of substrings?\n\nLet me think again. The problem says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\n\nSo each such sequence must be represented by a substring of S. For example, the sequence \"TT\" is represented by the substring \"11\" (which is the Morse code for M, but also can be split into two Ts). So the sequence \"TT\" is counted once, as it is represented by the substring \"11\".\n\nWait, but how is that possible? Because the substring \"11\" is a valid code (M), and also can be split into two Ts. So the sequence \"TT\" is represented by the same substring as \"M\"? No, that's not possible. Because the sequence \"TT\" is the concatenation of two Morse codes (each \"1\"), while \"M\" is a single Morse code (\"11\"). So the problem is that the sequences are represented by the concatenation of Morse codes. So for a sequence of letters, the Morse code is the concatenation of each letter's code. So the sequence \"TT\" is represented by the Morse code \"11\", which is the same as the Morse code for M. So in this case, the same substring can represent two different sequences: \"T\" followed by \"T\", and \"M\". So both sequences are counted.\n\nBut how do we count them? Because the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So each such sequence corresponds to a way of parsing a substring into valid Morse codes. For example, the substring \"11\" can be parsed in two ways: as one code (M) or two codes (T and T). So each parsing corresponds to a different sequence. Hence, the total number of sequences is the sum over all substrings of the number of ways to parse them into valid codes.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: for every possible substring of S, compute the number of ways to parse it into valid Morse codes (i.e., sequences of letters), and sum all those numbers.\n\nThus, the answer is the sum for all substrings of S of the number of ways to parse that substring into valid codes.\n\nSo the problem becomes similar to the classic \"number of ways to decode a string\" problem, but applied to all possible substrings of S.\n\nSo for example, for the first sample input, S is \"111\". The substrings are:\n\n\"1\" → 1 way.\n\n\"1\" → 1 way.\n\n\"1\" → 1 way.\n\n\"11\" → 2 ways.\n\n\"11\" → 2 ways.\n\n\"111\" → 4 ways.\n\nTotal sum is 1+1+1+2+2+4 = 11. But the sample output is 7. This suggests that there's a misunderstanding again.\n\nWait the sample explanation says that after all three steps, the answer is 7. So how does that align?\n\nThe sample explanation lists seven sequences:\n\n\"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", \"TM\", \"MT\", \"TTT\".\n\nBut according to the parsing approach, the total would be:\n\nEach of the three \"1\" substrings contributes 1 (total 3).\n\nEach of the two \"11\" substrings contributes 2 (total 4).\n\nThe \"111\" substring contributes 4 (total 4).\n\nTotal 3 + 4 + 4 = 11. But the sample says 7. So clearly, there's a fundamental error in understanding the problem.\n\nWait looking back at the note:\n\n\"In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code, therefore, are as follows. \"T\" (translates into \"1\") \"M\" (translates into \"11\") \"O\" (translates into \"111\") \"TT\" (translates into \"11\") \"TM\" (translates into \"111\") \"MT\" (translates into \"111\") \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\")\"\n\nAh! So the sequences are not counting the ways to parse the substrings, but instead counting each distinct sequence of letters that can be formed by any substring. For example, the substring \"11\" can be parsed as \"M\" (one sequence) or as \"TT\" (another sequence). Both are counted as two separate sequences. But in the sample explanation, they are counted as two sequences (M and TT). However, the sample explanation lists \"TT\" as one sequence and \"M\" as another. So the total number of sequences is the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any parsing of any substring.\n\nBut that would imply that for the sample input, the answer is 7. However, the parsing approach would count multiple ways for the same sequence. For example, if there are two different substrings that can be parsed into the same sequence, they are counted as two separate instances. Or is it that the problem wants to count the number of distinct sequences?\n\nNo, the problem says \"number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So for example, the sequence \"T\" is counted once, even if it appears multiple times. But according to the sample explanation, the answer includes \"T\", \"M\", \"O\", \"TT\", etc. So it's not counting the number of ways to parse, but the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any parsing of any substring.\n\nBut this is not what the sample shows. In the sample explanation, there are three occurrences of \"T\" in the substrings, but they are counted once. But the sample explanation lists \"T\" once, \"TT\" once, etc. So this suggests that the problem is asking for the number of distinct sequences, not the number of ways to parse.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let's read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"find and report, after each of these modifications to string S, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nSo, for example, if a substring can be parsed in multiple ways into sequences of letters, each of those sequences is counted once. But if the same sequence is generated by multiple substrings or multiple parsings, it is still counted once.\n\nBut this is not the case in the sample explanation. The sample explanation lists \"T\" once, even though there are three substrings that are \"1\" (each representing T). So this implies that the problem is not counting the number of ways to parse, but the number of distinct sequences of letters that exist in the set of all possible sequences generated by any parsing of any substring.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample, the sequences are:\n\n- T (from any \"1\" substring)\n\n- M (from any \"11\" substring)\n\n- O (from \"111\" substring)\n\n- TT (from parsing \"11\" as two Ts)\n\n- TM (from parsing \"111\" as \"1\" and \"11\")\n\n- MT (from parsing \"111\" as \"11\" and \"1\")\n\n- TTT (from parsing \"111\" as three Ts)\n\nSo total 7 distinct sequences.\n\nBut how do we count this? It's not clear how to compute this efficiently, especially since m can be up to 3000 and each step can add up to 3000 characters. For each step, we'd need to track all possible sequences generated by all possible substrings, which seems computationally expensive.\n\nBut this contradicts the initial sample's output. Because if the answer is the number of distinct sequences, then the first sample would have 7, but the initial approach of counting the number of ways to parse each substring would give a different result.\n\nBut the sample says that after the first step, the answer is 1, which matches the count of one distinct sequence (\"T\").\n\nAfter the second step, the answer is 3, which would be T, M, and TT (from the two substrings of length 1 and 2, and parsing of the length 2 substring into two Ts). So yes, that's three distinct sequences.\n\nAfter the third step, it's 7. So the problem is asking for the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any parsing of any substring of S.\n\nThis is a completely different problem than what I initially thought. Now, how to approach this?\n\nThe problem now is to find the number of distinct sequences of letters that can be formed by any parsing of any substring of S. Each parsing of a substring into valid Morse codes corresponds to a sequence of letters. We need to count all distinct such sequences.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nThis seems challenging. For example, for each new character added to S, we need to consider all new substrings that end at this position, and for each of those substrings, generate all possible sequences of letters that can be parsed from them, and add them to a set of sequences. Then, the total number of unique sequences is the size of this set.\n\nBut for m=3000, and each step potentially adding O(n) new substrings, this approach would be O(n^2) in time and space, which for n=3000 would be about 9 million operations. But generating all possible sequences for each substring and storing them in a set would be very memory-intensive and time-consuming, especially since sequences can be long.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this with dynamic programming, keeping track of all possible sequences that can be formed up to each position.\n\nAlternatively, think about it as follows: whenever a new character is added to S, it creates new substrings that end at this position. For each such new substring, we can find all possible ways to parse it into sequences of letters, and add those sequences to the global set of sequences.\n\nBut how to find the sequences for a new substring?\n\nLet's think about the new character. When we add a new character to S, the new substrings that end at this position are those that start at position i-k+1 (for k from 1 to current length). For each such substring, we can compute the set of sequences that can be formed by parsing it.\n\nBut for each substring, the sequences can be derived from the previous steps. For example, if the substring is s = s_prev + new_char, then for each possible way to split s into valid codes, the sequences can be derived from the splits.\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem where for each position i, we track all possible sequences that can be formed by parsing substrings ending at i.\n\nLet me think. Let's define dp[i] as the set of all sequences of letters that can be formed by parsing any substring ending at position i.\n\nWhen we add a new character to S, making it length i, we can look at the last 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters (since Morse codes are up to length 4). For each possible length l (1-4), if the substring of length l ending at i is valid (i.e., not in forbidden), then we can consider adding this as",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct sequences of English letters that can be represented by any substring of a dynamically growing string S in Morse code.
