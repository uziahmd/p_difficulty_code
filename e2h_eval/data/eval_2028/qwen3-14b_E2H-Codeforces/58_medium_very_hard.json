You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of edges to add to form an odd-length cycle and the number of ways to do that. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The graph is undirected, no loops or parallel edges. We need to find t (minimum edges to add) and w (number of ways to add those edges to form an odd cycle).\n\nAn odd-length cycle is a cycle with an odd number of edges (or vertices, since each edge connects two vertices). So, for example, a triangle (3 nodes) is a cycle of length 3, which is odd.\n\nThe key here is that if the graph already has an odd-length cycle, then t is 0 and w is 1? Wait, no. Because the problem says \"the number of ways to add t edges to form a cycle of odd length\". If there's already such a cycle, then you don't need to add any edges. But how many ways are there? Well, the existing cycles would count as ways. But wait, the question is about adding edges. If the graph already contains such a cycle, then the answer for t is 0, and w is the number of existing odd cycles? No, that can't be right. Because the problem says that the way to add edges is considered as adding edges. If the graph already has an odd cycle, then you don't need to add any edges. So in that case, the answer is t=0 and w=1? Or maybe the number of possible ways to choose edges that form such a cycle, but since you don't add any edges, it's just 1 way? Wait, no. The problem states that the answer w is the number of ways to add t edges. So if the graph already has an odd cycle, then there's exactly one way to add zero edges, so w is 1. But that doesn't make sense. Because there could be multiple existing odd cycles. However, the problem says that the way is considered equal if they have the same set of added edges. Since in this case, no edges are added, there's only one way. So regardless of how many existing odd cycles there are, if the graph already has at least one, then t is 0 and w is 1.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is the number of ways to add t edges to form such a cycle. So if the graph already contains an odd cycle, then adding zero edges would count as a valid way. However, there might be multiple such ways. But since adding zero edges is just one possibility (the empty set), then w would be 1. Unless there are multiple existing odd cycles. But the problem says that the way is considered equal if the added edges are the same. So even if there are multiple existing odd cycles, the way to add zero edges is just one. Therefore, the answer for w is 1 in this case.\n\nWait, but the example given has the second input as 3 3 with edges forming a triangle. The output is 0 1. Which matches this reasoning. So in that case, the answer is t=0 and w=1. So that's correct.\n\nSo the first thing to check is whether the graph already has an odd cycle. If yes, then t=0 and w=1. Otherwise, we need to find the minimal t and the number of ways.\n\nSo the problem reduces to two cases:\n\nCase 1: The graph has an odd cycle. Then t=0, w=1.\n\nCase 2: The graph is bipartite (since a bipartite graph has no odd cycles). Then we need to find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle.\n\nSo the first step is to check whether the graph is bipartite. If not, then answer is t=0, w=1. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, for a bipartite graph, how to create an odd cycle with minimal edges?\n\nLet me think. A bipartite graph can't have any odd-length cycles. So adding edges to create an odd cycle. What is the minimal number of edges required?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the graph is bipartite. To create an odd cycle, we need to add edges in such a way that there's a cycle with an odd length.\n\nIn a bipartite graph, all cycles are even-length. So adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition would create an odd-length cycle. Because in a bipartition (A, B), any edge between two nodes in A would create a cycle of length (path from u to v in A's partition via some path in the bipartition, plus the new edge). Let me think: suppose u and v are in the same partition. Then any path from u to v must have even length (since in bipartite graphs, paths between nodes in the same partition have even length). Adding an edge between u and v gives a cycle of length (path length + 1), which is odd. So that creates an odd-length cycle.\n\nTherefore, the minimal number of edges to add is 1. But only if there exists at least two nodes in the same partition (so that adding an edge between them creates an odd cycle).\n\nWait, but for a bipartition (A,B), if the graph is connected, then the bipartition is unique. But if the graph is disconnected, then each connected component can have its own bipartition. For example, a graph with two disconnected components, each being a bipartitioned tree.\n\nSo, for each connected component, we can compute its bipartition. Now, to create an odd cycle, we need to add an edge between two nodes in the same partition of some component. So the minimal number of edges to add is 1. However, if all connected components are bipartite and for each component, the bipartition is such that there are no two nodes in the same partition (which is impossible?), wait, no. For example, in a connected bipartite graph, each component has at least two nodes. For example, if a component is a single edge (two nodes), then the bipartition is {u} and {v}. So, adding an edge between u and v would create a cycle of length 2 (but that's not allowed as a cycle must have more than one vertex). Wait, but the problem says the cycle must consist of more than one vertex. Wait, the cycle must have more than one vertex. So the cycle must have at least three vertices.\n\nSo adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition of a connected component. Let's see: suppose the component is a tree. Then adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition creates a cycle. The length of the cycle would be the length of the path between the two nodes (which is even, since they are in the same partition) plus 1. So the total length is even +1 = odd. So the cycle is of odd length. But the cycle must have at least three nodes. So for example, if the two nodes are connected by a path of length 2 (so the path is u - a - v), and adding an edge u-v. Then the cycle is u-a-v-u, which is length 3 (odd). That's acceptable.\n\nSo the minimal t is 1, provided that there exists at least one connected component where there are at least two nodes in the same partition. But in a bipartitioned component, each component has two partitions. So for a component with more than one node, the partitions can have sizes >=1. For example, a component with two nodes (u and v) in a bipartition (A, B), where A has u and B has v. So adding an edge between u and v would create a cycle of length 2 (but that's not allowed?), but according to the problem statement, the cycle must consist of more than one vertex. Wait, the problem says \"a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex.\" So the cycle must have at least two vertices (but that's not possible, since a cycle must have at least three vertices). Wait, no. Wait, the definition of a cycle in graph theory requires that it has at least three vertices. So for example, a cycle of length 2 is not a valid cycle. So the problem says that the cycle must have more than one vertex, but perhaps the actual requirement is that the cycle has length >=3. So when we add an edge between two nodes u and v in the same partition, the resulting cycle must have length >=3. So in the case of a component with two nodes (u and v) in different partitions. Adding an edge between u and v would create a cycle of length 2 (u-v-u), which is not a valid cycle. So that's not acceptable. Therefore, for a component with two nodes (u and v), adding an edge between them would not form a valid cycle. Therefore, in such a component, we cannot create a cycle by adding one edge. Therefore, we need to add edges in such a way that the cycle has length >=3.\n\nSo what's the minimal number of edges needed in such cases?\n\nLet me think. Let's take the example where the graph is a single edge (u and v). This is a bipartite graph. To create an odd-length cycle, we need to add edges such that there's a cycle. Since the current graph is two nodes connected by an edge. To form a cycle, we need to add another edge. But adding another edge between u and v would create a multiedge, which is not allowed. Alternatively, we need to connect to another node. Wait, but there's only two nodes. So perhaps in this case, the minimal t is 3? Because you need to add two more nodes and connect them in a way that forms a cycle. But that seems complicated.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem requires that the graph is connected. Wait, no. The original graph may have multiple connected components. For example, the third sample input is '3 0' (three nodes, no edges). The output is '3 1'. So in that case, the minimal number of edges to add is 3. How?\n\nBecause to form a cycle of three nodes, you need to connect all three nodes in a triangle. So adding three edges. So t=3, w=1. Because there's only one way to connect all three nodes into a triangle.\n\nSo for a component that is a single node, but that's not possible here. Let's think again.\n\nSo the problem is, if the graph is bipartite, then for each connected component, we can look at the bipartition. For each component, the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle depends on the component.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For each connected component in the bipartite graph, we can compute the size of the two partitions, say A and B. Let's say that the component has a bipartition (A, B). For this component, adding an edge between two nodes in A (or two nodes in B) will create an odd-length cycle. But only if the two nodes are not directly connected. But in the case of a component that is a tree (so no cycles), adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition will create a cycle. However, the length of that cycle depends on the distance between the two nodes.\n\nSo for example, if the component is a tree with two nodes (u and v), then adding an edge between u and v would create a cycle of length 2 (which is invalid). Therefore, that's not allowed. Therefore, in this case, the component can't contribute to creating an odd cycle by adding a single edge. So for such a component, we need to add more edges.\n\nSo how to handle such cases?\n\nThe problem is that for certain components, adding a single edge may not create a valid cycle. Therefore, the minimal t depends on the structure of each component.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this.\n\nLet me think again. For a connected bipartite graph (so no odd cycles), the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd cycle is either 1 or 2, depending on the component.\n\nWait, for example, if the component is a tree with more than two nodes. For example, a star-shaped tree with three nodes (u connected to v and w). The bipartition would be {u}, {v, w}. So adding an edge between v and w (same partition) would create a cycle of length 3 (v-u-w-v), which is valid. So that's a single edge addition. So t is 1.\n\nBut for the component with two nodes (u and v), adding an edge between them creates a cycle of length 2 (invalid), so we can't do that. So for such a component, how can we create an odd-length cycle?\n\nWe need to add edges in such a way that there's a cycle of length >=3. So, for example, adding two edges. Suppose we have two nodes u and v. To form a cycle, we need to have at least three nodes. So we need to add a third node. But the original component has only two nodes. So, perhaps we need to connect to another component. Wait, but if the original graph has multiple components, like two components each with two nodes. Then, adding edges between nodes from different components.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal t is determined by the number of components. Let me think about the third example in the problem statement. The input is 3 0 (three nodes, no edges). The output is 3 1. Because adding three edges to form a triangle. So t is 3. But what if the graph has two components, each with one node. Then, adding edges between them would require ... but that's not possible. Wait, but the original graph has n nodes. So for example, in the case of three isolated nodes, each is a component. To form a cycle, you need to connect them in a triangle, which requires three edges. So that's the minimal.\n\nSo, in general, for a bipartite graph, the minimal t depends on the number of connected components. Let me think.\n\nIf the graph is bipartite, then the minimal number of edges to add to form an odd cycle is:\n\n- If there exists a connected component with at least two nodes in the same partition (i.e., the component's bipartition has both partitions non-empty and size >= 2?), then t is 1.\n\nBut if all connected components are such that their bipartitions are of size 1 and 1 (like a component with two nodes) or have only one node (like a component with one node), then adding edges between components may be needed.\n\nWait, but for a component with a single node, adding an edge to another component. Let me think.\n\nSuppose the graph has two components: one with a single node A, and another with a single node B. Then, adding an edge between A and B would create a component with two nodes. But that's still bipartite. To form an odd cycle, you need to have three nodes connected in a cycle. So, adding two edges: for example, adding a third node C and connecting A-B, B-C, C-A. But that requires three edges. But if there are three components with one node each, then adding three edges between them to form a triangle.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal number of edges is (k - 1) + 1, where k is the number of components. Wait, perhaps the minimal number of edges is (k - 1) + 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as follows:\n\nIf the graph has k connected components, and each component is bipartite. Then, to form an odd cycle, we need to connect these components in a way that creates an odd-length cycle.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, if there are two components. Each component is a single node. Then, adding an edge between them gives a component with two nodes, but no cycle. Adding another edge between them is not allowed (parallel edges). So, to create a cycle, you need to connect them to a third node. So, adding two edges to connect three nodes in a triangle. That's three edges. So in this case, t is 3.\n\nBut if there are two components, each with at least two nodes. For example, component 1 has two nodes (u and v) connected by an edge. Component 2 has two nodes (x and y) connected by an edge. So, each component is bipartitioned. For component 1, the bipartition is {u}, {v}. For component 2, {x}, {y}.\n\nTo create an odd cycle, we can add an edge between u and x. Then, the component becomes connected. However, the cycle would require a path from u to x. But since they were in separate components, adding an edge between them creates a new component. However, the cycle would be formed by combining the edges of the two components plus the new edge. But how?\n\nWait, the original components are trees. Adding an edge between u and x. Now, the component has a cycle. Let's see: the path from u to x is just the new edge. So there's no cycle. So that's not helpful. Wait, no. To create a cycle, you need to have a closed path. So, perhaps adding edges between components in a way that creates a cycle.\n\nAlternatively, consider adding edges between two nodes in the same partition of a component. For example, component 1 has u and v (partitions {u}, {v}), component 2 has x and y (partitions {x}, {y}).\n\nIf you add an edge between u and v (same partition?), no. Wait, in component 1, u and v are in different partitions. So adding an edge between u and v would create a cycle of length 2, which is invalid. So that's not allowed. So, to create a cycle, you need to add edges between nodes in the same partition. But in component 1, there's only one node in each partition. So, you can't add an edge between two nodes in the same partition. Therefore, for component 1, you can't create an odd cycle by adding a single edge. Similarly for component 2.\n\nSo, the only way is to connect the two components. For example, add an edge between u (from component 1) and x (from component 2), and then add an edge between v and y. Now, the combined component would have a cycle. Let me think: u connected to x, x connected to y (original edge), y connected to v (new edge), v connected to u (original edge). So the cycle is u-x-y-v-u, which is length 4 (even). Not helpful. Hmm. Not an odd cycle.\n\nAlternatively, add an edge between u and x, and another edge between u and y. Then, the cycle would be u-x-u (no, that's a loop, but not allowed). Or, u-x-y-v-u. That's a cycle of length 4. Still even.\n\nAlternatively, adding an edge between u and x, and another between v and y. Then, the cycle u-x-y-v-u is length 4 again.\n\nHmm. So, in this scenario, adding two edges between the two components may not help. How can we get an odd-length cycle?\n\nPerhaps by connecting three components. Let's say there are three components, each with two nodes. Then, adding edges between u (component 1) and x (component 2), x and v (component 2?), no. Maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number of edges to add is determined by the number of connected components in the bipartite graph. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nIf the graph is bipartite, then:\n\n- If there is at least one connected component that has at least two nodes in one of its partitions, then t is 1. Because adding an edge between two nodes in the same partition of that component creates an odd-length cycle.\n\n- Otherwise, all connected components are either single-node components or components with two nodes (each partition has exactly one node). In this case, the minimal t is (number of components) - 1 + 1 = number of components? Or something else.\n\nWait, for example, if there are k components, each being a single node. Then, to form a cycle, you need to connect them into a cycle. For example, if k=3, you need to connect them into a triangle (3 edges). So t is 3.\n\nIf k=2, you need to connect them in a way that forms a cycle. But two nodes can't form a cycle. So you need to add a third node (but there are none), so you need to connect the two nodes and add another node. But that's not possible unless you have more nodes.\n\nWait, this suggests that the problem is more complex than I thought. So perhaps I need to find the minimal t based on the following:\n\nFor a bipartite graph, the minimal number of edges to add is:\n\n- If there exists a component with at least two nodes in one partition (so that adding one edge between them creates an odd cycle), then t is 1.\n\n- Else, all components are either single-node or have exactly two nodes (so each component's bipartition is (1,1)). Then, the minimal number of edges to add is (number of components) - 1 + 1? Or (number of components) ?\n\nWait, let's think of the case where all components are single-node. Let's say there are k components (each with one node). To form a cycle, we need to connect them into a cycle. The minimal number of edges is k (to form a cycle of k nodes). For example, k=3, need 3 edges. For k=2, need 2 edges (but that would form a cycle of length 2, which is invalid). So in that case, it's not possible. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, if there are two single-node components, you can't form a cycle. You need three nodes. So, to form a cycle, you have to add edges between three nodes. But there are only two. So you need to add a third node (but there are no nodes left). So this is impossible. But in the problem statement, the input is given with n nodes. So, for example, in the case of n=2 and m=0. The output would be t=3? But that's impossible because you can't add three edges to form a cycle. Wait, but the problem says that the graph has n nodes. So in the case of two nodes and no edges, you can't form a cycle with any number of added edges. Because adding edges between the two nodes would create a multiedge (not allowed). So the minimal t would be 3, but that's impossible. However, this seems contradictory to the problem statement.\n\nWait, but in the third sample input, n=3 and m=0, the output is 3 1. That makes sense because you need to add three edges to form a triangle.\n\nBut for n=2, m=0, there's no way to form a cycle. But according to the problem statement, the graph must have a cycle of more than one vertex. So in this case, the answer would be impossible. But according to the problem statement, the input is always possible? Or is there a guarantee that the answer exists?\n\nThe problem says that the graph is not necessarily connected. But for any input, it's possible to add edges to form an odd cycle. Because if n >=3, then you can add edges to form a triangle. For example, if n=2, then it's impossible. But the problem says that the input may have n=2 and m=0. How to handle that?\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement, the sample input includes the third case where n=3 and m=0, which outputs 3 1. So for n=3, it's possible. For n=2, the answer would be impossible. However, the problem says that the input is given, but perhaps the constraints ensure that n is at least 3?\n\nNo, the problem allows n=1. Wait, but for n=1, you can't form a cycle. But the problem says that the cycle must have more than one vertex. So for n=1, the answer is impossible. However, the problem statement says that the input is given, but perhaps the code must handle such cases. But according to the problem statement, the graph can have any n and m.\n\nBut perhaps the code needs to handle such cases. However, according to the problem statement, the answer must exist. Because the problem says that the graph can have any input, but the code must output the answer. So how?\n\nLet me think again. The problem says that the graph is not necessarily connected. So, for example, if n=1, then no cycle can be formed. But according to the problem statement, the output must be t and w. How?\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's examples, the third input is n=3, m=0. The output is 3 1. Which implies that when the graph is bipartite (which it is, since it's empty), and there are no existing odd cycles, then t is 3 and w is 1.\n\nSo, for the case of n=2, m=0. The graph is bipartite. How to compute t and w?\n\nWell, the minimal number of edges to add to form an odd cycle. Since the graph is two nodes with no edges. To form a cycle, you need to have at least three nodes. But there are only two. So you can't. But the problem says that the graph has n nodes. So, perhaps the code should assume that n is at least 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can handle cases where n is 1 or 2. For example, if n=1, then it's impossible to form a cycle, but according to the problem's note, the cycle must have more than one vertex. So, the answer would be impossible. However, the problem says that the code must output t and w. But how?\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to have a solution. Or is it not?\n\nThe problem statement says nothing about that. So perhaps the code must handle all cases.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps the code can proceed under the assumption that n is at least 3. Let's think about the possible scenarios.\n\nSo, going back to the main problem. The steps I need to perform are:\n\n1. Check if the graph has any odd-length cycles. If yes, output t=0 and w=1.\n\n2. If not, then the graph is bipartite. Then, compute the minimal t and w.\n\nSo, how to check if the graph has an odd-length cycle? By checking if it's bipartite. If it's not bipartite, then there exists an odd-length cycle.\n\nSo, first, I need to perform a bipartition check on the entire graph. If during this check, any component is not bipartite, then answer is t=0, w=1.\n\nOtherwise, the graph is bipartite, and proceed to calculate t and w.\n\nNow, for the bipartite graph:\n\nWe need to find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd-length cycle. And the number of ways to do it.\n\nSo, for a bipartite graph, the minimal number of edges is:\n\nCase A: There exists a component where the bipartition has at least two nodes in one of the partitions. Then, t=1. The number of ways is the sum over all components of (number of pairs of nodes in same partition) for each component. But wait, no. Because adding any such pair would create an odd cycle. But the problem requires that the added edges form exactly an odd cycle. So, the minimal t is 1, and the number of ways is the total number of possible edges that can be added between same partitions of any component. However, the problem says that adding those edges must form a cycle. But adding any such edge between same partitions in a component that is bipartitioned would create an odd cycle. So, the number of ways is the sum over all components of (C(a, 2) + C(b, 2)), where a and b are the sizes of the two partitions of that component. However, for components that are single nodes (a=1, b=0), then C(a,2) is 0, etc.\n\nBut wait, in the case where a component has two nodes (u and v) in different partitions. Then, the two partitions have sizes 1 and 1. So, C(1, 2) is 0 for both. So adding an edge between them would not create an odd cycle. So, the number of ways for that component is zero. Therefore, the total number of ways is the sum over all components of (C(a, 2) + C(b, 2)).\n\nBut in this case, if there's at least one component where this sum is non-zero, then t=1 and w is the sum of all such possible edges.\n\nBut what if there are multiple components with possible edges. For example, component 1 has 2 nodes in partition A, component 2 has 3 nodes in partition B. Then, the total number of ways is C(2,2) + C(3,2) = 1 + 3 = 4. So adding any of these four edges would create an odd cycle.\n\nBut what if the component is a single node (so a=1, b=0)? Then, C(1,2) is 0, and C(0,2) is 0. So contributes nothing.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nIf the graph is bipartite:\n\n- Compute for each component the number of possible edges that can be added between same partitions. Let's call this value for each component as c_i.\n\n- If any c_i > 0, then t=1, and w is the sum of all c_i.\n\n- Else, all components have at most one node in each partition. So, the graph consists of components that are single nodes or pairs of nodes (each component has two nodes, partitions of size 1 and 1). In this case, to form an odd cycle, we need to add edges between components.\n\nFor example, if there are k components, each with one node. Then, to form a cycle, we need to connect them into a cycle of length >=3. For this, the minimal number of edges is (k) if k >=3. Because you need to form a cycle of k nodes (each connected to the next, and the last to the first). So for k=3, you need 3 edges. For k=2, you can't form a cycle. But since the problem requires that the graph has n nodes, for k=2 (n=2), you can't form a cycle. But according to the problem statement, the input may have n=2 and m=0. How to handle that?\n\nBut according to the sample input, when n=3 and m=0, the answer is 3 1. Which is the case where all components are single nodes (three components), and adding three edges to form a triangle.\n\nSo for this case, when the graph is bipartite and all components have c_i = 0, then:\n\nThe number of components is k. Let's compute the minimal t and w.\n\nIf k == 1: the component is a single node. Then, no way to form a cycle. But since the component has only one node, you can't form a cycle. So this case can't happen? Because the component is bipartite, but if the component is a single node, then it's trivially bipartitioned. But adding edges to form a cycle would require at least three nodes. So for this case, the code must return t=3 (if n >=3?), but how?\n\nBut this is getting complicated. So perhaps the code can handle this case as follows:\n\nIf the graph is bipartite and all components have c_i = 0, then:\n\n- Let k be the number of connected components.\n\n- If k == 1 and the component has only one node: then, we can't form a cycle. But according to the problem statement, the input is such that it's possible to form a cycle. But the problem says nothing about that. So perhaps the code must handle this.\n\nBut given that the problem has sample inputs, perhaps the code can proceed under the assumption that when all components have c_i = 0, then the minimal t is (k) if k >=3, and if k <3, then it's impossible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the case where all components are single-node components. Then, the number of components is k = n. For example, if n=3, then k=3. So, the minimal number of edges is 3 (form a triangle). So t=3, and the number of ways is 1 (only one way to connect all three nodes into a triangle). So, for this case, the answer is t = k, w=1 if k >=3. If k <3, then impossible. But the problem says that the answer must be computed. How?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer must exist. So perhaps the code can assume that the input is such that it is possible to form an odd cycle. However, the problem does not state this. Therefore, the code must handle all possible cases.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's proceed with the following logic:\n\nIf the graph is bipartite, and all components have c_i=0:\n\nThen, the graph is made up of components that are single-node or two-node components (each with partitions of size 1 and 1).\n\nIn this case, the minimal number of edges to add to form an odd cycle is:\n\n- If there are at least three components (each with one node), then t is 3, and w is 1 (the only way is to connect three components into a triangle).\n\nBut if there are exactly two components (each with one node), then you can't form a cycle. So, you need to add edges between them and another node (but there are no other nodes). So, it's impossible. But according to the problem statement, the code must output t and w. So, perhaps in such cases, the answer is t=3 and w=0? Or some other value.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's think about the code.\n\nBut perhaps the code can proceed with the following steps:\n\nOnce the graph is determined to be bipartite, and all components have c_i=0, then:\n\nCompute the number of components, say, k.\n\nIf k == 1:\n\n   Then the component has one node. So, no way to form a cycle. But this is impossible, since the component has only one node. So, the minimal t is 3 (assuming n >=3). For example, if n=1, then no solution. But the problem may not have such test cases.\n\nBut according to the sample input, when n=3 and k=3 (each component is a single node), then t=3, w=1.\n\nSo, for this case, when k is the number of components, and all components are single-node:\n\nt = k (if k >=3) ?\n\nBut for k=2, you can't form a cycle. So, the minimal t is k + 1 ?\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems very ambiguous. Perhaps the code can handle this case as follows:\n\nIn the case where the graph is bipartite and no component has any pairs in same partition (i.e., all components have c_i=0):\n\nThen, the minimal number of edges to add is:\n\nt = (number of components) if number of components >=3, else (number of components + 1) ?\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for the case where all components are single-node, the minimal number of edges to add to form a cycle is (number of components) if the number of components >=3. For example, for 3 components, you need 3 edges to form a triangle. For 4 components, you need 4 edges to form a cycle (like a square with a diagonal, but that would have even cycles. Wait, no. Wait, for four components (nodes A, B, C, D), you can connect them in a cycle of four nodes (A-B-C-D-A), which is even. But that's not an odd cycle. So that's not acceptable. So, to form an odd cycle, you need to have a cycle of length 3, 5, etc. So for four components, you need to add edges to form a cycle of length 3, which requires selecting three of the four nodes and connecting them into a triangle (3 edges), and leaving the fourth node disconnected. So, the minimal t is 3.\n\nBut then, for k=4 components, the minimal t is 3, and the number of ways is C(4, 3) * 1 (since for each selection of 3 nodes, there's one way to connect them into a triangle).\n\nBut this complicates the calculation of w.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps the code should handle the case where the graph is bipartite and all components have c_i=0 as follows:\n\nIf the number of components is k.\n\nThen:\n\nIf k == 1:\n\n   If the component has only one node: then, you can't form a cycle. So, this case is impossible. But perhaps the code can output t=3 and w=0, but this is unclear.\n\nIf k == 2:\n\n   Then, the two components are single-node. So, you can't form a cycle. Need to add at least one more node. But since there are only two nodes, it's impossible. So, the minimal t is 3 (adding three edges between two nodes, but that's not possible). So this case is impossible. But the code must output something.\n\nIf k >=3:\n\n   Then, the minimal t is 3 (connect three of the components into a triangle), and the number of ways is C(k, 3) * 1 (since for each combination of three components, there's one way to connect them into a triangle).\n\nBut this is only true if the components are single-node. However, if there are components with two",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of edges to add to an undirected graph to form a simple cycle of odd length and the number of ways to do so.
