The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem is about calculating the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. Let me think through the approach.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are n houses arranged in a circle. Xenia starts at house 1. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The movement between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. The goal is to find the total minimum time required to complete all tasks.\n\nHmm. The key here is to process the tasks in order and calculate the time taken between each consecutive task. Since the tasks must be done in order, we need to consider the movement from the current position to the next task's location, considering the circular arrangement.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nInitially, Xenia is at house 1. Then, for each task in order, we need to compute how long it takes to get from her current position to the next task's house. But since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise, the time between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nFor example, if she's at house x and needs to go to house y, the time is (y - x) mod n if moving clockwise. Wait, no. Because if x is 3 and y is 2 in a 4-house setup, moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. So (y -x +n) %n ?\n\nWait, the formula for the minimal steps when moving clockwise is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x +n). Which can be written as (y - x) %n if the movement is allowed only clockwise. Wait, no. For example, if x is 3 and y is 2, then (2-3) = -1, mod 4 would be 3, which is correct. So yes, the number of steps is (y -x) mod n. But since in Python, modulo can return negative values, but in this case, since y and x are between 1 and n, perhaps we can calculate it as (y -x) if y >=x else (y -x +n). Or maybe (y -x +n) %n ?\n\nYes. So for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the steps between them.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given as a list. Let's say the tasks are a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. But Xenia must do them in order. So for each i from 1 to m, she must be at a_i. However, the problem says that for the i-th task, she needs to be at a_i and have completed all previous tasks. So the order is fixed. So the sequence of positions she needs to reach is a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. But she can have multiple consecutive tasks in the same house. For example, if a_1 is 3, a_2 is 3, then moving from a_1 to a_2 takes zero steps.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Start at position 1.\n\n- For each task in the list, compute the steps needed to get from the current position to the task's position, add that to the total time.\n\n- Then update the current position to the task's position.\n\nBut how do we compute the steps between current position and the next task's position?\n\nLet me take the first example:\n\nSample input 1: n=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Steps from 1 to 3: clockwise. 1→2→3: 2 steps. So total time is 2.\n\nCurrent position is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. So steps from 3 to 2. Since moving clockwise, it's 3→4→1→2: 3 steps. So total time becomes 2+3=5.\n\nCurrent position is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Steps from 2 to 3: 1 step. Total time 5+1=6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the total is 6.\n\nAnother sample input is ['4 3\\n2 3 3'], output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: steps from 1 to 2 is 1. Total time 1.\n\nCurrent position is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: steps from 2 to 3 is 1. Total 2.\n\nThird task is 3: steps 0. Total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the algorithm is",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is efficiently calculating the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, as given.\n2. **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the target house for the task.\n3. **Circular Movement Calculation**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving from house `x` to house `y` clockwise can be calculated using the formula `(y - x) % n` if `y >= x`, otherwise `(y - x + n) % n`. This ensures we correctly handle the wrap-around from the last house back to the first.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Sum up the time taken for each movement between consecutive tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    m = int(input[1])\n    a = list(map(int, input[2:2+m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for target in a:\n        if target >= current:\n            total_time += target - current\n        else:\n            total_time += (target - current + n)\n        current = target\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go and split into individual components for processing.\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1, and initialize the total time to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task location, calculate the time needed to move from the current position to the task location using the circular movement formula.\n- **Update Position**: After each move, update the current position to the task's location.\n- **Output Total Time**: Finally, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by considering the circular nature of the ringroad and moving only in the clockwise direction, which is optimal given the constraints. The algorithm runs in O(m) time complexity, making it efficient even for large values of n and m up to 100,000.",
