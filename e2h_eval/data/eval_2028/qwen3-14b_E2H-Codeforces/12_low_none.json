The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the order given.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Start at 1. First task is at 3. How long to get there? From 1 to 3 clockwise: 2 steps (1→2→3). But wait, the initial position is 1. So the first move is from 1 to 3. But since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, the distance between current position and next task's position is (a_i - current_pos) mod n? Wait, no. Because if current position is x and next is y, then moving clockwise, the steps needed is (y - x) if y >=x, else (n - x + y). Or maybe (y - x) % n? Wait, for example, if current is 3 and next is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - 3 + 2) steps. For n=4, that's 4-3+2 = 3 steps. But if you go from 3 to 4 to 1 to 2, which is 3 steps. Yes.\n\nBut for the first example, the initial position is 1. The first task is at 3. So steps from 1 to 3 is 2 steps. Then, the second task is at 2. So from 3 to 2: since moving clockwise, that's (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4? Let's compute (2 - 3) = -1. Adding 4 gives 3. So 3 steps. Then third task is at 3 again. From 2 to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach is to track Xenia's current position, and for each task in order, compute the distance from her current position to the next task's position, add that to the total time, and update her current position.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between current position and next position?\n\nLet me think: for current position curr and next position next_pos, the distance is (next_pos - curr) if next_pos >= curr. Otherwise, (n - curr + next_pos). Alternatively, (next_pos - curr) % n. Wait, no. Because if next_pos is less than curr, then (next_pos - curr) is negative, and mod n would give the correct positive value. For example, if curr is 3, next is 2, n=4. (2-3) is -1 mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between curr and next_pos is (next_pos - curr) if positive, else (n - curr + next_pos). Which can be calculated as (next_pos - curr) % n if we take the modulo. But wait, (next_pos - curr) could be negative. Let me see: for example, if curr is 3, next is 2. (2-3) is -1. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the distance is (next_pos - curr) % n. But wait, if next_pos is equal to curr, then the distance is zero. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the case where next_pos is curr, then the distance is zero, which is correct. So for each task, we can compute the distance between current position and the next task's position, add it to the total, and then update the current position to the next task's position.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So if the next task is in the same house as the current position, then the distance is zero. So no movement needed. So the code should handle that.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. Each task must be completed in sequence, and moving between adjacent houses takes one unit of time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n2. **Iterate through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current position to the next task's house.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two houses on a ringroad can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. If moving from house `curr` to house `next_pos`, the distance is `(next_pos - curr) % n` if `next_pos >= curr`, otherwise `(n - curr + next_pos)`.\n4. **Update Position**: After calculating the distance for each task, update the current position to the task's house and accumulate the total time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor next_pos in a:\n    if next_pos == current:\n        continue\n    diff = (next_pos - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = next_pos\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1, which is given.\n- **Task Iteration**: For each task in the list, we determine the distance from the current position to the task's house.\n- **Distance Calculation**: Using modulo arithmetic ensures that we correctly handle the circular nature of the ringroad. This calculation gives the shortest path in terms of clockwise movement.\n- **Accumulating Time**: Each calculated distance is added to the total time, and the current position is updated to the task's house for subsequent calculations.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the total time required by iterating through each task once, resulting in a time complexity of O(m), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
