Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. The number has 2n digits. Each player takes turns taking the leftmost digit, appending it to their own number. Each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 + S2. The output should be the sequence of moves (H for Homer, M for Marge) that achieves this maximum sum. If there are multiple solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. So the key is to choose, at each step, whether Homer or Marge takes the next digit, such that in the end, the total sum of their numbers is maximized. But since each player must take exactly n digits, the selection of moves must balance between Homer and Marge's choices.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since n can be up to 18, the total number of digits is 36. So the total number of possible sequences is C(36, 18), which is a huge number. Brute force is impossible here. We need a dynamic programming approach.\n\nLet me think about the state. At any point, the number of digits taken by Homer and Marge determines the state. For example, if Homer has taken h digits and Marge has taken m digits, then the current state is (h, m). Since the total number of digits taken so far is h + m, and the remaining digits are the next digits to be considered.\n\nBut how do we model the choices? Because each step, the next move can be either H or M, but only if they haven't taken n digits yet.\n\nWait, the problem says that each player must make exactly n moves. So for the entire sequence, there are exactly n H's and n M's. So the state can be represented by the number of H's and M's chosen so far. For example, when we have h H's and m M's, the next move can be H (if h < n) or M (if m < n).\n\nThe DP state would be (h, m), and the value would be the maximum total sum achievable from this state onwards. But how do we compute this?\n\nThe DP transition would be: for the current state (h, m), the next digit to take is the (h + m)th digit in the original string. Wait, because each time we take the leftmost digit. So the first move takes the first digit, then the second move takes the next leftmost, etc. So the digits are processed in order. The position in the original string is determined by how many digits have been taken so far. For example, if h + m digits have been taken, then the next digit is at index (h + m) in the original string (assuming zero-based or one-based? Well, the input is given as a string, so let's say that the initial A is a string of length 2n. So when h + m digits have been taken, the next digit is A[h + m].\n\nSo, for a given state (h, m), the next digit is A[h + m], and the choice is to take it as H or M. But the choice depends on whether h < n or m < n.\n\nThe DP function could be defined as follows: dp(h, m) = max value of total sum achievable from this state onwards.\n\nFor the base case, when h + m = 2n (i.e., all digits have been taken), the sum is 0.\n\nFor the transitions:\n\nIf the current state is (h, m), then the next digit is A[k], where k = h + m. Then, if h < n, we can choose to take it as H. Then, the next state would be (h + 1, m). Similarly, if m < n, we can choose to take it as M, leading to (h, m + 1). The value of the current state is the maximum of these options, plus the contribution of the current digit to the total sum.\n\nWait, but how does the digit contribute to the sum? For example, when Homer takes a digit, it becomes part of his number. But the value of his number depends on the digits he has collected. However, since the digits are added to the end of the number, the position of the digit in the number affects its value. For example, if Homer takes a digit d at step i (when he has taken h digits so far), then this digit will be the (h+1)th digit in his number. But since the number is built by appending digits, the first digit taken is the most significant digit, and the last digit is the least significant. So, the value of the digit is d multiplied by 10^{n - (h+1)} }, since Homer will take",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The game involves taking digits from a given number in turns, with each player making exactly `n` moves. The challenge is to choose the sequence of moves (H for Homer, M for Marge) that results in the highest possible sum of their numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach where the state is defined by the number of digits each player has taken so far. The state `(h, m)` represents the number of digits taken by Homer and Marge respectively.\n2. **Recursive State Transitions**: For each state `(h, m)`, we consider the next digit to be taken from the original number and decide whether Homer or Marge should take it. This decision is based on which choice leads to the maximum total prize value.\n3. **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations, we memoize the results of each state to ensure efficient computation.\n4. **Backtracking to Determine Moves**: After computing the optimal values for all states, we backtrack from the initial state to determine the exact sequence of moves that leads to the maximum total prize.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    length = 2 * n\n\n    # Precompute the digits as integers\n    digits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h + m == length:\n            return 0, ''\n        k = h + m\n        current_digit = digits[k]\n        max_val = -1\n        best_move = ''\n        # Try Homer's move if possible\n        if h < n:\n            next_val, next_str = dp(h+1, m)\n            val = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (h + 1))) + next_val\n            if val > max_val:\n                max_val = val\n                best_move = 'H' + next_str\n        # Try Marge's move if possible\n        if m < n:\n            next_val, next_str = dp(h, m+1)\n            val = current_digit * (10 ** (n - (m + 1))) + next_val\n            if val > max_val:\n                max_val = val\n                best_move = 'M' + next_str\n        return max_val, best_move\n\n    _, result = dp(0, 0)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Dynamic Programming State**: The function `dp(h, m)` computes the maximum total prize value achievable from the state where Homer has taken `h` digits and Marge has taken `m` digits. The state transitions consider both possible moves (Homer or Marge taking the next digit) and recursively compute the optimal result.\n- **Digit Value Calculation**: Each digit's contribution to the total prize is calculated based on its position in the player's number. For example, the first digit taken by Homer contributes more significantly than the last digit due to its higher place value.\n- **Memoization**: The `lru_cache` decorator is used to store results of previously computed states, ensuring that each state is computed only once, thus optimizing the solution for large inputs.\n- **Result Construction**: The recursive function also constructs the sequence of moves leading to the optimal total prize, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently explores all possible sequences of moves using dynamic programming and memoization, ensuring an optimal solution even for the upper constraint of `n = 18`.",
