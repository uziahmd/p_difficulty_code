A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, each toast requires nl ml of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and np grams of salt per friend.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs these things. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl ml. Because each friend has one toast. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (since each friend uses one slice per toast). And the salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the total resources available:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nSalt: p grams.\n\nSo the number of toasts possible is determined by each resource:\n\nFor drink: total_drink = k*l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, since each toast is for all friends. So if you have T toasts, each friend makes T toasts. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So total drink required for T toasts is T * n * nl. So the maximum T based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: each toast requires n slices (each friend one slice). So total slices needed for T toasts is T * n. So maximum T based on limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires n * np grams. So maximum T is p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink: 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nLimes: 10 *8 =80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80 /3 is 26.666, floor 26. But the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nWait, wait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, how?\n\nAh, because the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Wait, but according to my calculation, each toast requires n slices. So for T toasts, it's T * n slices. So T_max is (c*d) // n. For the first sample, c*d is 10*8=80, n=3. 80//3 is 26. So why does the sample explanation say that limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nWait, maybe I have misunderstood the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend uses one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So for T toasts, each friend makes T toasts, so total slices needed is n * T.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, they have 10 * 8 = 80 slices. So the maximum number of toasts is 80 / (n) ?\n\nWait in the first sample, the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to that, 80 toasts would require 3 * 80 = 240 slices. But the total slices available is 80. That's impossible. So clearly, I have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, what's the correct way? Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. Therefore, per toast, n slices are needed. So for T toasts, total slices needed is T * n.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How?\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nc=10 limes, d=8 slices per lime. So total slices is 10 * 8 =80.\n\nSo if T is the number of toasts, then the number of slices needed is T * n. So for T toasts, we need T * n <= 80.\n\nSo T can be up to 80 / n. For n=3, 80/3 is 26.666, so 26. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which suggests that the sample explanation is considering that each toast requires one slice per friend, but perhaps the sample explanation is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, why is the limes enough for 80 toasts? Because according to the sample explanation, they are calculating the total slices as 80, and each toast requires one slice. But that would imply that each toast requires one slice total, not per friend. Which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps I have misread the problem statement. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo, for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs one slice. Therefore, per toast, n slices are needed. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be possible only if per toast, one slice is needed. So that's conflicting.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So in that case, the total slices available is 80. So for each toast, one slice is needed. So how does that fit with the problem statement?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement says that each friend needs a slice per toast. So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices are needed. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be possible if the total slices is 80 and per toast, one slice is needed. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3, which is 2. So why is that?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. How?\n\nBecause the drink is 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per friend = 9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But the sample explanation says 20 /3 =6. That suggests that the sample explanation is considering that each toast requires 3 ml total, not per friend. Which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait this is very confusing. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs those things. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml. For example, if there are 3 friends, each toast requires 3 * nl ml of drink.\n\nIn the first sample input, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. The total drink is 4 *5 =20. 20 /9 is 2.222, which is 2 toasts. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which suggests that the sample explanation is considering per toast, each friend needs nl ml, but that the total per toast is nl ml, not multiplied by n.\n\nThis is a contradiction. So perhaps I have misread the problem statement.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs these. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl ml. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which implies that per toast, total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl ml per toast, not multiplied by n.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Which indicates that perhaps I have misread the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the note in the problem:\n\nIn the first sample, the note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 ml of drink. It is enough to make 20/3 =6 toasts. So according to this, each toast requires 3 ml of drink. But according to the problem statement, each friend needs nl ml. For the first sample input, nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. For 3 friends, that's 3 *3=9 ml per toast. Which would be 20/9 = 2.222 toasts. But the note says 20/3=6.\n\nSo clearly, there's a misunderstanding here. What's the correct way to interpret the problem statement?\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement once again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for T toasts, each friend uses T * nl ml. So for all friends, the total drink is n * T * nl. \n\nBut in the sample explanation, the drink is 20 ml, and they say that it's enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 6 toasts, which would require 3 *6 *3 = 54 ml. But 20 is less than 54. So that can't be right.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Therefore, perhaps the problem statement is different. Maybe the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, but the total per toast is nl ml. Which would be impossible unless n=1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that per toast, the entire group needs nl ml. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that per toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So the total for one toast is n * nl ml. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl = 3, but divided by n. \n\nWait, maybe the problem statement says that per toast, each friend needs nl ml. But the total for all friends is T * nl ml. Which would be impossible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for T toasts, each friend needs T * nl ml. So total drink is T * nl * n.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be T =6. Then total drink is 6 *3 *3 = 54. Which is more than 20. So that's impossible.\n\nThis suggests that the sample explanation is incorrect, but that's unlikely. So I must have made a mistake in interpreting the problem.\n\nLet me look at the sample input and output again. \n\nFirst sample input is:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', ...]\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSample output is 2.\n\nThe note says that the drink is 4*5=20 ml. It is enough to make 20/3=6 toasts. \n\nWait, why 20/3? If each toast requires 3 ml of drink. How?\n\nAh! Maybe the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. But the total per toast is nl milliliters. That would mean that the total per toast is nl ml, regardless of the number of friends. Which would be strange. But in that case, for the first sample, per toast, 3 ml. So 20 /3 =6.666, floor to 6. Then the limes are 10 *8 =80 slices. Each toast requires one slice. So 80 toasts. Salt is 100 /1 = 100 toasts. Then the minimum of 6, 80, 100 is 6. Then divide by the number of friends? No. Wait the sample says the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 =2. Which would be 6/3=2. So the answer is 2.\n\nBut why is the answer divided by 3? Because the sample says that the answer is the number of toasts each friend can make. So if the total number of toasts possible is 6, then each friend can make 6 toasts? But that would require that each friend can make 6 toasts, but the drink is only 20 ml. So for 6 toasts, each friend needs 3 *6 =18 ml. 3 friends: 3 * 18 =54 ml. Which is way more than 20. So something is wrong.\n\nThis is very confusing. There must be a misunderstanding. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nThe problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as possible, provided that all drink the same amount. So each friend makes the same number of toasts. Let's call this number T. So each friend makes T toasts.\n\nFor each toast, each friend needs:\n\n- nl ml of drink.\n\n- 1 slice of lime.\n\n- np grams of salt.\n\nSo for T toasts per friend, each friend needs:\n\nDrink: T * nl ml.\n\nLime slices: T slices.\n\nSalt: T * np grams.\n\nSo for all friends:\n\nTotal drink needed is n * T * nl ml.\n\nTotal lime slices needed is n * T slices.\n\nTotal salt needed is n * T * np grams.\n\nAh! Oh! This is the correct way to model it. Because for each friend, they have T toasts, each requiring nl ml. So for each friend, T * nl. Multiply by n friends: total drink is n*T*nl.\n\nSimilarly for the lime slices: each friend has T slices, so total n*T slices.\n\nSalt is n*T*np.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nn*T*nl <= total_drink (k*l)\n\nn*T <= total_slices (c*d)\n\nn*T*np <= p\n\nSo T must be such that all three inequalities are satisfied.\n\nSo T is the maximum value such that:\n\nT <= (k*l) / (n*nl)\n\nT <= (c*d) / (n)\n\nT <= p/(n*np)\n\nSo T is the minimum of those three values, then take the floor.\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\nk*l = 4*5=20.\n\nn*nl = 3*3=9.\n\nSo 20 /9 = 2.222 → floor 2.\n\nc*d is 10*8=80. Divided by n (3) is 80/3=26.666 → floor 26.\n\np/(n*np) is 100/(3*1) = 33.333 → floor 33.\n\nSo T is min(2, 26, 33) → 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAh! Now the sample explanation makes sense. The sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. But that's incorrect. Wait why? Because according to the correct calculation, it's 20/(n*nl) = 20/(3*3)= 2.222. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which suggests that the sample explanation is wrong, or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. However, the sample explanation is probably wrong, but the actual calculation is correct. Because the sample output is 2, which comes from the correct calculation.\n\nSo the sample explanation is possibly incorrect, but the correct approach is to calculate the three values as described.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the maximum possible T based on each resource:\n\ndrink_T = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_T = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt_T = p // (n * np)\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo in the first sample, drink_T is 20//9=2, lime_T is 80//3=26, salt_T is 100//3=33. min is 2 → correct.\n\nAnother example: the second input in the sample is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nLet's parse:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000.\n\nnl=4. So drink_T = 1000/(5*4) = 1000/20=50.\n\nc=1, d=19 → total slices 1*19=19. lime_T is 19//5=3 (since 5*3=15 ≤19, 5*4=20>19).\n\nsalt_T: p=90, n*np=5*3=15 → 90//15=6. So min(50,3,6) is 3 → output is 3, which matches the sample.\n\nThird input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink 1e6.\n\nnl=50 → drink_T = 1e6 / (10*50) = 1e6 / 500 = 2000.\n\nc=25, d=23 → total slices 25*23=575. lime_T = 575//10 = 57.5 → floor 57.\n\nsalt_T: p=1, n*np=10*1=10 → 1//10=0. So min(2000,57,0) → 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute the three values and take the minimum.\n\nTherefore, the code should read the input integers, compute the three values, then take the minimum of them.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nFor example, the first line is:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nSo the code can read the input line, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_T = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\nlime_T = total_slices // n\n\nsalt_T = p // (n * np)\n\nanswer = min(drink_T, lime_T, salt_T)\n\nPrint that answer.\n\nBut need to make sure that division is integer division, floor.\n\nBut in Python, using // will do integer division, which is floor for positive numbers.\n\nBut what if the division is not exact? For example, 20//9 is 2, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the line as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute the three values as above.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input line:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\ntotal_drink =4*5=20. n*nl=3*3=9 → 20//9=2.\n\ntotal_slices=10*8=80 → 80//3=26.\n\nsalt_T: 100/(3*1) = 100//3=33. min(2,26,33) → 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother sample input: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink=100*10=1000. n*nl=5*4=20 → 1000//20=50.\n\ntotal_slices=1*19=19 → 19//5=3.\n\nsalt_T: p=90, n*np=5*3=15 → 90//15=6. min(50,3,6) → 3. Correct.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink=1,000,000.\n\nn*nl=10*50=500 → 1e6//500=2000.\n\ntotal_slices: 25 *23=575. 575//10=57.\n\nsalt_T: p=1, n*np=10*1=10 → 1//10=0. So min(2000,57,0) → 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of lines. Wait, the input is given as a single line. The example shows that the input is given as a list of lines, but in reality, the problem says that the input is a single line. For example, the first sample input is given as:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nBut that's for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The first and only line contains positive integers... So the code should read one line from stdin.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple lines. Wait, no. The sample input is given as a list of possible input lines, but in reality, the code should process one line per test case. However, the user's example shows that the input is given as a list of lines, but the code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first and only line contains positive integers... So the code should read a single line.\n\nBut the sample shows multiple input lines. For example, the sample input is given as three lines, but the output is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line. The sample input shows three lines, but that's probably to show multiple test cases. But the actual code should read one line, process it, and output one line.\n\nBut the user's example shows that the input is a list of lines, but that may be for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. So the code should read one line.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nOutput:\n\n['2', '3', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should read multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the user's example is showing multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case per line. Or perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines.\n\nBut according to the problem statement:\n\nInput: The first and only line contains positive integers...\n\nSo the code should read one line. So the sample input may have multiple lines, but that's part of the example. For example, perhaps the user is showing that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem says that it's a single line. This is confusing.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read input from standard input. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines, each being a separate test case. But the problem statement says that the input is a single line. Which is conflicting.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three lines, and the output is three lines. So the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the input is a single line. This is conflicting. However, looking at the original problem statement:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is described as \"The first and only line contains positive integers...\" which implies that there is only one test case. But the sample shows multiple lines. This is confusing.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and print the desired outputs. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each representing a separate test case. For example, the first sample input has three test cases, and the output has three answers.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. Which is conflicting. However, the original problem's sample input shows that the code is supposed to read multiple lines. For example, the first sample input is given as three lines, each being a separate test case. So the code should read multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. This is conflicting. However, looking back to the original problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSample Output:\n\n2\n\nBut the user's example shows that the input is given as a list of lines. So perhaps the original problem is from Codeforces, where the input is multiple lines. But the problem statement's input says that it's a single line. This is a contradiction.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original statement, the user says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\nSo the input is one line. Therefore, the sample input given by the user is incorrect, perhaps. But the sample input shows three lines, but the output shows three lines. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nBut how to resolve this? Well, looking at the user's example:\n\nThey provide the input as a list of lines, and the output as a list of lines. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines from stdin, each line being a separate test case, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single line. This is confusing. However, the user's example shows that the code should handle multiple test cases. For example, the third input line in the sample is '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1' and the output is 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement's input description, the code should read one line. However, the sample shows that the code is supposed to process multiple lines. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original source, perhaps this is from Codeforces. Let me think: the problem is similar to Codeforces problem 703A. Let me check.\n\nBut regardless, the user's code needs to read input from stdin and output to stdout. The sample shows that the code should process multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single line. Which is conflicting. However, the sample input and output given by the user shows that there are multiple lines of input. Therefore, the code should read multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nBut how to proceed? For example, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the result for each.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the input is a single line. Which is conflicting. However, given the sample input and output, it's likely that the code should read multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nBut the user's problem statement says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nSo the code must read from stdin, and output to stdout. Given that the sample input has multiple lines and outputs multiple lines, the code should process each line of input as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that it's a single line. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. Or perhaps the problem is from a programming competition where multiple test cases are provided.\n\nIn any case, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut how to confirm? Let's look at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['2', '3', '0']\n\nSo for each line in the input, the code should output one line.\n\nThus, the code should read all lines from stdin, and for each line, process it as a test case.\n\nSo the code would read all lines from stdin, split into individual lines, process each line, and print the result for each.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is one line. This is a contradiction. However, given the sample input and output, it's better to assume that the code must read multiple lines.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    line = line.strip()\n    if not line:\n        continue\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, line.split())\n    total_drink = k * l\n    drink_T = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    total_slices = c * d\n    lime_T = total_slices // n\n    salt_T = p // (n * np)\n    print(min(drink_T, lime_T, salt_T))\n\nBut what if the input is only one line? Well, the code would process it correctly.\n\nBut in the problem statement's sample input, the code would read three lines and output three lines.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single line. However, given the sample input and output, it's likely that the code should process multiple lines. Hence, the code above is correct.\n\nTesting this code with the first sample input line:\n\nLine: '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1' → outputs 2.\n\nSecond line: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3' → outputs 3.\n\nThird line: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1' → outputs 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut what about edge cases?\n\nFor example, when any of the denominators is zero? No, because the problem states that all input numbers are at least 1. So n, nl, np are >=1. So no division by zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when the division results in zero. Like when the salt is not enough for even one toast.\n\nFor example, n=1, p=0. But the input says that all numbers are at least 1. So p is at least 1. So no.\n\nAnother case: when the drink_T is zero. For example, n=1, k=1, l=1, nl=2. So total_drink is 1. n * nl = 2. 1//2 is 0. So the answer is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the Python code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and we must ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Requirements**: Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend. For `T` toasts, the total requirements are:\n   - Drink: `n * T * nl` milliliters (where `n` is the number of friends, `T` is the number of toasts per friend, and `nl` is the drink needed per toast per friend).\n   - Lime Slices: `n * T` slices (each friend needs one slice per toast).\n   - Salt: `n * T * np` grams (where `np` is the salt needed per toast per friend).\n\n2. **Calculate Maximum Possible Toasts**: For each resource, calculate the maximum number of toasts that can be made based on the available quantity:\n   - **Drink**: `(k * l) // (n * nl)` where `k` is the number of bottles and `l` is the volume per bottle.\n   - **Lime Slices**: `(c * d) // n` where `c` is the number of limes and `d` is the number of slices per lime.\n   - **Salt**: `p // (n * np)` where `p` is the total grams of salt available.\n\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum value among the three calculated values from the above steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        line = line.strip()\n        if not line:\n            continue\n        n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, line.split())\n        total_drink = k * l\n        drink_T = total_drink // (n * nl)\n        total_slices = c * d\n        lime_T = total_slices // n\n        salt_T = p // (n * np)\n        print(min(drink_T, lime_T, salt_T))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines from standard input, each representing a separate test case.\n- **Resource Calculation**: For each test case, the total available drink, lime slices, and salt are calculated. The maximum number of toasts possible for each resource is then computed using integer division.\n- **Determine Result**: The minimum value among the three computed values is printed as the result for each test case, ensuring that all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource limits.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result by focusing on the limiting resource for each test case, ensuring optimal performance and correctness.",
