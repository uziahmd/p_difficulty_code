A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible number determined by the available resources divided by the number of friends, but I need to think about each resource's contribution.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, let's understand the inputs:\n\nWe have n friends. They have k bottles of drink, each with l milliliters. So total drink is k * l.\n\nThey have c limes, each cut into d slices. So total lime slices are c * d.\n\nThey have p grams of salt.\n\nFor each toast, each friend needs:\n\n- nl milliliters of drink per toast. Since there are n friends, each toast requires n * nl milliliters in total. Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends has one toast. So for t toasts, total drink required is t * n * nl.\n\nSimilarly, each toast requires one slice per friend. So for t toasts, total slices needed is t * n. Because each of the n friends has t toasts, each needing a slice. So total slices is n * t.\n\nSalt per toast per friend is np grams. So total salt needed for t toasts is t * n * np.\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum t such that:\n\nTotal drink available >= t * n * nl\n\nTotal lime slices available >= t * n\n\nTotal salt available >= t * n * np\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of the possible t's from each of these constraints.\n\nBut how do we compute t?\n\nLet me think about each constraint:\n\nDrink: total_drink = k * l. So t can be at most (k*l) // (n * nl). Because t * n * nl <= k*l → t <= (k*l) / (n * nl). Since t must be integer, floor division.\n\nLime slices: total_slices = c * d. So t can be at most (c*d) // (n). Because t * n <= c*d → t <= (c*d)/n.\n\nSalt: total_salt = p. So t can be at most p // (n * np). Because t * n * np <= p → t <= p/(n * np).\n\nOnce we compute these three values, the maximum possible t is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo the answer is min( (k*l)//(n * nl), (c*d)//n, p//(n * np) )\n\nWait, but let me check the first example.\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. For each toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the sample's first calculation.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8. Total slices 80. Divided by n=3 → 80 /3 is 26.666... floor is 26. But wait, the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why? Because for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So per toast, total slices needed is 3. So for t toasts, 3t slices. So 80 slices can allow t = 80//3 = 26. So why in the sample explanation, they said that limes are enough for 80 toasts? Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait the sample explanation says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". Wait that's because for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, you need n slices. So total slices needed for t toasts is n * t. So the maximum t for limes is (c*d) // n. Which in the first case is 80//3 = 26. But the sample explanation says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. That seems conflicting. Wait what's the sample explanation saying?\n\nIn the first sample, the explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to our calculation, it's 80//3 = 26. But the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. Wait, that's confusing. Oh wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\nOverall the friends have 20 ml of drink, which is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why 20/3? Because each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast? Or per friend?\n\nWait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for each toast, each friend has one toast. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts, total drink is t * n * nl.\n\nIn the first sample, the drink is 20 ml. For each toast, n * nl is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222, so floor is 2. So why does the sample explanation say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts?\n\nAh, wait the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. That suggests that they are dividing by 3, which is nl. But that would be if each toast requires nl per friend. So perhaps the sample explanation is wrong? Or perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem statement.\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh! So per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. So for t toasts, total is t * n * nl. So for the first sample, the total drink is 20 ml. So t must satisfy t * 3 * 3 <= 20 → t * 9 <= 20 → t can be 2 (since 2*9=18 ≤20, 3*9=27>20). So the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 = 6 toasts. Wait that's not matching. So why is that?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. But according to my calculation, it's 20/(3*3) = 2.222. So why is the sample explanation saying 6?\n\nThis suggests that I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\nAh! Oh! Oh right! The question is how many toasts can each friend make. So for each friend, the number of toasts is t. So for each friend, they have t toasts. So per friend, the drink needed is t * nl. So for all friends, total drink is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 20 / 3 = 6.666, but floor to 6. But according to the calculation, the total drink is 20. So for t toasts per friend, total drink is 3 * t * 3 = 9t. So 9t ≤ 20 → t ≤ 2.222. So the maximum t is 2. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So that suggests that the sample explanation is considering the total number of toasts across all friends, but the problem says that each friend makes the same number of toasts. So maybe the sample explanation is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait why is that? Let me think. Maybe the sample explanation is considering that each toast is per friend. Like, if each friend makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts is n * t. But that's not the case. The problem says that each friend makes t toasts. So the total number of toasts is n * t. But the sample explanation is talking about the number of toasts as 6, but then divides by 3 (number of friends) to get 2. Which is the answer.\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nSo the 6 is the total toasts possible from the drink, and then divided by 3 (number of friends) to get per friend toasts. But that would imply that the total toasts is 6, so each friend can make 6 / 3 = 2 toasts. But how is the 6 calculated?\n\nSo according to that approach, the drink is 20ml. For each toast (per friend?), the drink is 3 ml. So total toasts possible is 20 / 3 = 6.666 → 6. Then, since there are 3 friends, each can make 6 / 3 = 2 toasts. But that would imply that the total toasts is 6, which is 2 per friend. But that would mean that the total drink is 3 friends * 2 toasts per friend * 3 ml per toast = 18 ml, which is within the 20 available. So that works.\n\nBut how is the 6 computed? It's 20 / 3, which is (total drink) / (nl). But that's not the same as the earlier approach. So why is that?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is considering the total number of toasts (across all friends) as t. Then, each friend makes t / n toasts. But that's not correct. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is wrong? Or maybe I have misread the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the question is to find the number of toasts per friend, which is t. So for each friend, they make t toasts. So for all friends, the total toasts is n * t. So the total drink required is n * t * nl. So the maximum t is (total_drink) / (n * nl). So for the first sample, total_drink is 20, n is 3, nl is 3. So 20 / (3 * 3) = 20 / 9 = 2.222, so floor 2. Which would be the answer. But according to the sample explanation, the drink is considered as 20 / 3 = 6 toasts, and then divided by 3 friends gives 2. So that's the same answer, but the way of calculating is different.\n\nSo the sample explanation is thinking of the total number of toasts across all friends as being 6, which would be 2 per friend. But how is that 6 calculated? Because the total drink is 20, and each toast (for any friend) requires nl ml. So for each toast (regardless of which friend), you need nl ml. So total toasts possible is total_drink / nl. But that would be 20 / 3 = 6.666. So 6 toasts. Then, since each friend has to make the same number of toasts, the total toasts is n * t. So t = total_toasts / n. Which would be 6 / 3 = 2.\n\nBut that approach would be equivalent to taking (total_drink // nl) // n. Which is the same as (total_drink // (n * nl)) ?\n\nBecause (total_drink // nl) // n is equal to (total_drink // (n * nl)) ?\n\nNot exactly. For example, if total_drink is 20, nl is 3, n is 3. Then:\n\ntotal_drink // nl = 6 (20//3=6). Then 6//3=2.\n\nWhich is the same as 20 // (3*3) = 20//9=2. So same result.\n\nAnother example: if total_drink is 10, nl is 3, n is 3. Then:\n\ntotal_drink//nl = 3, 3//3=1. Which equals 10//9=1.\n\nSo in general, (total_drink // nl) // n is equal to total_drink // (n * nl). Because:\n\nLet me think mathematically. Let me assume that total_drink is D, nl is m, n is N.\n\nWe want to compute floor(D/(m*N)) ?\n\nWhich is the same as floor( (D/m)/N ), since D/m is a real number, and then divided by N. But when you take floor(D/m) and then divide by N, it's not the same as floor(D/(m*N)). Wait, for example:\n\nD = 10, m=3, N=3. D/(m*N) = 10/(9) = 1.111. So floor is 1.\n\nfloor(D/m) is 3, then divided by N (3) is 1. So same result.\n\nAnother example: D= 11, m=3, N=3.\n\nD/(m*N) = 11/9 = 1.222 → floor 1.\n\nfloor(D/m) is 3 (11//3=3). 3//3=1. Same.\n\nAnother example: D= 9, m=3, N=3. 9/(3*3) = 1. So floor is 1. Also (9//3) is 3, divided by 3 is 1. Same.\n\nAnother example: D= 8, m=3, N=3. D//m is 2, divided by N is 0.666 → floor is 0. But D/(m*N) is 8/9 = 0.888 → floor is 0. So same.\n\nSo in all cases, (D//m) // N equals D// (m*N). So yes, the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the sample explanation's way of calculating is correct. So for the drink, the maximum possible total toasts (across all friends) is (total_drink // nl). Then, since each friend must make the same number, the per-friend toasts is (total_toasts) // n. Which is the same as (total_drink // (nl * n)).\n\nSo the same applies for the other resources.\n\nSo for the limes: each toast (per friend) requires one slice. So per toast (per friend), one slice. So total slices needed for t per-friend toasts is n * t. Because each of the n friends makes t toasts, each needing one slice. So the maximum total_toasts (across all friends) is (total_slices) // 1. Because each toast (per friend) uses one slice. So total_toasts = total_slices. Then, per-friend toasts is total_toasts // n.\n\nWait, that would be (total_slices) // n. Because total_toasts is (total_slices) // 1 = total_slices. Then per-friend is total_slices // n.\n\nWhich is the same as (total_slices) // n.\n\nSimilarly for salt: each toast per friend requires np grams. So for total_toasts (across all friends), the total salt needed is total_toasts * np. So maximum total_toasts is p // np. Then per-friend is (p // np) // n.\n\nWhich is same as (p // (np * n)).\n\nSo the three constraints are:\n\ndrink_total = k * l\n\ndrink_toasts = drink_total // nl\n\ndrink_per_friend = drink_toasts // n\n\nlime_total = c * d\n\nlime_toasts = lime_total // 1 (since each toast per friend uses one slice)\n\nlime_per_friend = lime_toasts // n → which is (c*d) // n.\n\nsalt_total = p\n\nsalt_toasts = salt_total // np\n\nsalt_per_friend = salt_toasts // n → p // (np * n)\n\nSo the answer is the minimum of these three per-friend values.\n\nSo in the first sample:\n\ndrink_total = 4 *5 =20. drink_toasts = 20//3=6. drink_per_friend =6//3=2.\n\nlime_toasts is 10*8=80. lime_per_friend is 80//3=26.\n\nsalt_toasts is 100//1=100. salt_per_friend is 100//3=33.\n\nminimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the answer is min( (k*l // nl) //n , (c*d) //n , (p // np) //n )\n\nSo the code should compute these three values and take the minimum.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // nl\n\ndrink_per_friend = drink_toasts // n\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\nlime_per_friend = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // np\n\nsalt_per_friend = salt_toasts // n\n\nanswer is min(drink_per_friend, lime_per_friend, salt_per_friend)\n\nWait, but what if any of these divisions result in zero? For example, if the total_drink is less than nl, then drink_toasts is zero, and drink_per_friend is zero. Which would make the answer zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input line as integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // nl\n\ndrink_per_friend = drink_toasts // n\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\nlime_per_friend = total_lime_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // np\n\nsalt_per_friend = salt_toasts // n\n\nresult = min(drink_per_friend, lime_per_friend, salt_per_friend)\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but let's check the sample input 1:\n\nInput is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20. drink_toasts = 20//3=6. drink_per_friend =6//3=2.\n\ntotal_lime_slices=10*8=80. lime_per_friend=80//3=26.\n\nsalt_toasts=100//1=100. salt_per_friend=100//3=33. min(2,26,33) is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink=100*10=1000. nl=4. drink_toasts=1000//4=250. drink_per_friend=250//5=50.\n\nc=1, d=19 → total_lime_slices=19. lime_per_friend=19//5=3 (since 19//5 is 3.8 → 3).\n\nsalt: p=90, np=3 → salt_toasts=90//3=30 → salt_per_friend=30//5=6. So min(50,3,6) → 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink = 1e6. nl=50. drink_toasts=1e6//50 = 20000. drink_per_friend=20000//10=2000.\n\nc=25, d=23 → total_lime_slices=25*23=575. lime_per_friend=575//10=57.\n\nsalt: p=1, np=1 → salt_toasts=1//1=1 → salt_per_friend=1//10=0. So min(2000, 57, 0) is 0. Which matches sample output.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the input line, split into the variables.\n\nThen compute each of the three components.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nBut the input is given as multiple lines? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first and only line containing the integers. However, in the example input, there are three lines, but perhaps that's just for the example. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the example input, the user shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nBut that's probably for the test cases. The actual input for the program is one line. So the code should read one line from stdin, split into the variables.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as three lines. But that's probably for the example. The actual code should read one line.\n\nSo the code:\n\nReads the input line, splits into the 8 variables.\n\nSo:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // nl\n\ndrink_per_friend = drink_toasts // n\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\nlime_per_friend = total_lime_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // np\n\nsalt_per_friend = salt_toasts // n\n\nresult = min(drink_per_friend, lime_per_friend, salt_per_friend)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes. So this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All resources are exactly sufficient for 1 toast per friend.\n\nn=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1.\n\ntotal_drink = 1*1=1. drink_toasts = 1//1=1. drink_per_friend=1//1=1.\n\ntotal_lime_slices=1*1=1. lime_per_friend=1//1=1.\n\nsalt_toasts=1//1=1. salt_per_friend=1//1=1.\n\nresult is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when one of the resources is zero. For example, if p is 0, then salt_toasts is 0, so salt_per_friend is 0. So the answer is zero.\n\nAnother case: if the total_drink is zero? Well, since the input constraints say that all numbers are positive integers. So no.\n\nAnother case: when some divisions are zero. For example, if total_drink is 2, nl is 3. Then drink_toasts is 0, drink_per_friend is 0. So answer is 0.\n\nSo the code handles all cases correctly.\n\nSo the code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Requirements**: Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend. We need to calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total available resources.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt available.\n3. **Determine Constraints**: For each resource, determine how many toasts can be made considering the requirements per toast and per friend.\n4. **Find Minimum Constraint**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. Thus, we take the minimum value from the constraints calculated for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // nl\ndrink_per_friend = drink_toasts // n\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\nlime_per_friend = total_lime_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // np\nsalt_per_friend = salt_toasts // n\n\nresult = min(drink_per_friend, lime_per_friend, salt_per_friend)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of several integers representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters of drink per toast, and grams of salt per toast.\n2. **Total Drink Calculation**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n3. **Drink Constraints**: Determine how many total toasts can be made with the available drink, then divide by the number of friends to get the number of toasts per friend.\n4. **Lime Slices Calculation**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available and determine how many toasts per friend can be made with these slices.\n5. **Salt Constraints**: Calculate the total amount of salt available and determine how many toasts per friend can be made with the available salt.\n6. **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum value among the constraints derived from drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring all friends can make the same number of toasts without exceeding any resource limit.",
