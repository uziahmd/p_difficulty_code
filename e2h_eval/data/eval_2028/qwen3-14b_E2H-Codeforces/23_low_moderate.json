            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and we have to find the minimum draws required.\n\nFirst, let's think about what the possible scenarios are. The initial three tiles might already form a mentsu, in which case the answer is 0. If not, we need to check how many more tiles are needed to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nLet me break down the steps:\n\n1. Check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n2. If not, determine the minimum number of tiles needed to add to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut how do I check for possible mentsu?\n\nFor checking a triplet (koutsu): All three tiles must be the same. So for example, if the input is three 9m, then it's a triplet. So for the initial check, if all three are same, then answer is 0.\n\nFor checking a sequence (shuntsu): The three tiles must be consecutive numbers in the same suit. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. But they can be in any order. So I need to check if the three tiles are in the same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence.\n\nSo first, I need to process the three tiles. Let's think about how to represent them. For each tile, extract the number and suit. For example, '1s' is number 1, suit 's'.\n\nNow, for the initial check:\n\nCheck if the three tiles form a triplet. That's easy: check if all three have the same number and suit.\n\nElse, check if they form a sequence. For that, they must be same suit, and the numbers sorted should be consecutive. For example, 3,4,5 or 1,2,3, etc. So sort the numbers and check if the differences between consecutive elements are 1.\n\nIf either of these is true, then answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimum number of tiles to add.\n\nNow, the problem is to find the minimum number of tiles to add to get a mentsu. So, what are the possibilities?\n\nFor example, maybe adding one tile can make a triplet or a sequence.\n\nLet's think about possible cases.\n\nCase 1: The three tiles can be part of a triplet with one more tile. For example, if two tiles are same. Then adding another same tile would make triplet. So for example, if the three tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then adding another 1m would make a triplet. But wait, the original three tiles don't form a triplet. So in this case, the number of tiles to add is 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the three tiles can form a triplet by adding two tiles. Like if there are two different tiles. But that's probably not the minimal case.\n\nSo for the triplet possibility, we need to see how many duplicates there are. For example, if there are two same tiles, then we need one more. If there are only one of a tile, then we need two more. But perhaps there's a better way to form a triplet. But in the case where the three tiles can't form a triplet, the minimal number of tiles to add for triplet is 3 - count of the most frequent tile. For example, if there are two same tiles, then 3-2=1. If there's one, then 3-1=2. But maybe there's a scenario where adding two tiles can form a triplet. But that's the minimal.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal is to take the maximum count of any tile and see how many more are needed. For example, if the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 3m. Then for triplet, you need to add two more of any tile. But that's not helpful. However, maybe forming a sequence is better.\n\nBut the idea is that for each possible way to form a mentsu (triplet or sequence), compute the number of tiles needed, and choose the minimum among all possibilities.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor the given three tiles, check all possible ways to form a mentsu (either triplet or sequence) and compute the minimal number of tiles needed.\n\nBut how do I generate all possibilities?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios for sequences and triplets.\n\nFirst, for the triplet case:\n\nWe can consider that the three tiles can be part of a triplet. For example, if there are two of the same tile, then adding one more. Or, if there is one of a tile, then adding two more",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid meld (mentsu) in a game similar to Mahjong. A valid meld can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Meld**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid triplet or sequence. If they do, the answer is 0.\n2. **Triplet Possibility**: If the three tiles do not form a valid meld, evaluate how many additional tiles are needed to form a triplet. This involves checking the count of each tile and determining how many more are needed to make a triplet.\n3. **Sequence Possibility**: Similarly, evaluate how many additional tiles are needed to form a sequence. This involves checking if the tiles can be extended into a sequence by adding one or two tiles.\n4. **Determine Minimum**: Compare the number of tiles required for both triplet and sequence possibilities and choose the minimum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    tiles = input[:3]\n    \n    # Parse the tiles\n    parsed = []\n    for t in tiles:\n        num = int(t[0])\n        suit = t[1]\n        parsed.append((num, suit))\n    \n    # Check if already a mentsu\n    def is_triplet(tiles):\n        return tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]\n    \n    def is_sequence(tiles):\n        if tiles[0][1] != tiles[1][1] or tiles[1][1] != tiles[2][1]:\n            return False\n        nums = sorted([t[0] for t in tiles])\n        return nums[1] - nums[0] == 1 and nums[2] - nums[1] == 1\n    \n    if is_triplet(parsed) or is_sequence(parsed):\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # If not, compute the minimal draws\n    # For triplet case\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    count = defaultdict(int)\n    for num, suit in parsed:\n        count[(num, suit)] += 1\n    \n    max_count = max(count.values())\n    triplet_needed = 3 - max_count\n    \n    # For sequence case\n    # Try all possible suits and sequences\n    # First, check if all three are same suit\n    same_suit = parsed[0][1] == parsed[1][1] == parsed[2][1]\n    if same_suit:\n        nums = sorted([t[0] for t in parsed])\n        # Check possible extensions\n        # Check if can form a sequence with one more tile\n        # For example, 1,2,3: already sequence\n        # Or 1,2,4: need 3\n        # Or 1,3,4: need 2\n        # Or 2,3,4: already sequence\n        # So check the gaps\n        gaps = []\n        gaps.append(nums[1] - nums[0] - 1)\n        gaps.append(nums[2] - nums[1] - 1)\n        gaps.append(nums[2] - nums[0] - 2)\n        if sum(gaps) == 0:\n            print(0)\n            return\n        # The minimal number of tiles to add is the sum of gaps\n        # But since we can only add one tile to fill a gap\n        # Wait, no.

Maybe the best way is to check for all possible suits and sequences.\n        # However, since the current three tiles are not all same suit, forming a sequence would require that all three tiles are in same suit, which is not the case now. So the only way to form a sequence is to add tiles to make all three in the same suit and form a sequence.\n        # But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal way is to find a suit where at least two tiles are present, and then try to form a sequence with that suit.\n        # For example, if two tiles are in 'm' and one in 'p', then we can try to form a sequence in 'm' by adding tiles, or in 'p' by adding tiles.\n        # However, this requires checking all possible suits that have at least one tile.\n        # This might be complex, but given that the initial three tiles are not in same suit, the minimal sequence would require adding two tiles to get all three in same suit and form a sequence. Or maybe one tile to get two in same suit and form a sequence with existing ones?\n        # For example, suppose the tiles are 1m, 2m, 3p. Then adding a 3m would allow a sequence of 1m, 2m, 3m. That's one tile added.\n        # So the minimal number here is 1.\n        # But how to compute this?\n        # Let me think: For each suit present, collect the numbers of tiles in that suit.\n        # For example, if there are two suits, say m and p. For each suit, check if the numbers can be part of a sequence by adding some tiles.\n        # For example, for suit m, if there are two tiles, then see if they can be part of a sequence with one more tile.\n        # So the approach would be:\n        # For each suit in the current tiles:\n        #   collect the numbers of tiles in that suit\n        #   check how many more tiles are needed to form a sequence\n        # Then take the minimum over all suits.\n        # Additionally, for suits not present, it's not possible.\n        # So let's proceed.\n        suits_present = set()\n        numbers_by_suit = defaultdict(list)\n        for num, suit in parsed:\n            suits_present.add(suit)\n            numbers_by_suit[suit].append(num)\n        \n        min_seq_needed = float('inf')\n        for suit in suits_present:\n            nums_list = numbers_by_suit[suit]\n            # Now, we need to form a sequence with these numbers, possibly adding more tiles.\n            # The idea is to find the minimal number of tiles to add to make a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n            # For example, if the current numbers are [1, 2], then adding 3 (1 tile) gives a sequence.\n            # If the current numbers are [1, 3], then adding 2 (1 tile) gives a sequence.\n            # If the current numbers are [1, 4], then need to add 2 and 3 (2 tiles) or add 5 and 3 (but that's not helpful).\n            # So for a given list of numbers in a suit, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add to make a sequence.\n            # How?\n            # Sort the list.\n            nums_sorted = sorted(nums_list)\n            # For the current numbers, we can consider all possible sequences that can be formed by adding tiles.\n            # For example, if the list has one number, then we need to add two more to form a sequence.
