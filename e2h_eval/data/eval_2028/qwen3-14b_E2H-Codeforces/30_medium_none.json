Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Homer and Marge are playing a game with a number A of 2n digits. They take turns picking the leftmost digit, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. And I have to output the sequence of H and M moves that achieves this maximum.\n\nHmm. So the main challenge is to find the optimal sequence of choices for Homer and Marge such that their total is maximized. Since each choice affects the remaining digits and the future choices, this feels like a dynamic programming problem. But considering that n can be up to 18, which makes the total length of A up to 36 digits. Let's think about the possible states here.\n\nLet me think about the state space. At any point, the number of digits left is 2n - k, where k is the number of moves made so far. But since each player must make exactly n moves, the state can be represented by how many moves Homer and Marge have made so far. For example, if Homer has made h moves and Marge has made m moves, then the total moves so far is h + m. Since each move takes one digit from the front, the current A is the original A with the first (h + m) digits removed. Wait, no. Because each move takes the leftmost digit. So the current state depends on how many digits have been taken so far. So the current A is the original string starting from position (h + m) onwards. So, for example, if we have a string like '1234' (n=2), after two moves, the remaining digits are the last two.\n\nBut the state can be represented by the number of digits taken so far. But also, how many times Homer and Marge have taken digits. Because the next move depends on who's turn it is. Wait, but the players alternate turns? Or do they decide before each turn who will take the next move?\n\nWait the problem says: Before each turn, players determine who will make the next move. Each player makes exactly n moves. So the order of moves is determined by them, but the constraint is that in the end, each has exactly n moves. So the problem is to choose the order of H and M moves, with exactly n H's and n M's, such that when you take the digits in that order, the sum of the numbers formed by H's digits and M's digits is maximized.\n\nSo the problem reduces to choosing the order of H and M moves (with exactly n each) such that the sum of the numbers formed by the digits collected by H and M is as large as possible.\n\nBut how to model this? Because the choice of taking a digit for H or M at a certain step affects the digits available for future steps.\n\nThe key is that the order of taking digits determines which digits go to H and which to M. For example, if the first move is H, then he takes the first digit of A, then the next move could be H or M again, but the next digit is the new first digit of the remaining A.\n\nBut the problem is that the sum of the numbers depends on the digits chosen for each player, but the order of digits in their numbers matters. For example, if H takes digits in the order 1 then 2, his number is 12, whereas if he takes 2 then 1, it's 21. So the order in which the digits are taken by each player directly affects the value of their numbers.\n\nTherefore, the problem is not just about selecting which digits go to H and M, but also the order in which they take them. However, the order of taking is determined by the sequence of moves. For instance, the first move takes the first digit of A, the second move takes the first digit of the remaining A, etc.\n\nSo the challenge is to select the sequence of H and M moves (with exactly n each) that maximizes the sum of the numbers formed by the digits collected by each player.\n\nBut how to model this? For each possible state, which is determined by how many H and M moves have been made so far, and the current position in the original A string.\n\nWait, the current position in the original A string is determined by the number of digits already taken. Let's say that the original A is a string of length 2n. After k digits have been taken, the current A is the substring starting at index k. So for example, if k digits have been taken, then the next digit to take is A[k].\n\nSo, the state can be represented by the number of H moves made so far (h) and the number of M moves made so far (m). Since each move is either H or M, and the total number of moves so far is h + m. Also, since the total number of moves is 2n, and each player makes exactly n moves, the constraints are that h <= n, m <= n, and h + m <= 2n.\n\nAt each state (h, m), the next move can be H or M, provided that h < n or m < n, respectively. However, the choice of H or M must be such that after all moves, both h and m reach n.\n\nSo the problem can be approached with memoization, where for each state (h, m), we track the maximum total sum that can be achieved from that state onward, and the best choice (H or M) to take next.\n\nBut for n=18, the maximum possible h and m are 18. So the number of states is (n+1) * (n+1) = 19*19 = 361 for n=18. That's manageable. But wait, for each state, we need to know the current position in the original A string. Oh, right! Because the current position is determined by h + m. Because each move takes one digit from the front. So for state (h, m), the current position is k = h + m. Therefore, the next digit to take is A[k], and the rest of the digits are A[k+1 ... 2n-1].\n\nSo the state can be represented by h and m. Because k is h + m. Therefore, for each state (h, m), the current digit to take is A[k], where k = h + m.\n\nSo the DP state is (h, m), and for each state, we can decide whether to take H or M next, provided that h < n or m < n.\n\nNow, the DP transition would be:\n\nFor state (h, m), the next digit is A[k], where k = h + m.\n\nIf we choose H next (if h < n), then the next state is (h+1, m). The contribution to the sum is the digit added to H's number. But how does that affect the total sum?\n\nWait, the value of H's number and M's number depends on the order of digits they take. For example, if H takes a digit d now, then that digit is the first digit of his number. If he takes another digit later, that becomes the second digit, etc. Similarly for M.\n\nBut how can we compute the contribution of a digit to the total sum based on when it is taken?\n\nLet me think: For each digit that H takes, its position in his number is determined by when he takes it. Suppose H takes his first digit at step t (i.e., when there have been t moves so far). Then, the digit contributes d * 10^{n - 1 - (number of H's moves he has made so far)}.\n\nWait, for example, suppose n=2. H takes his first digit at step 0 (the first move). Then, that digit is the first digit of his number. If he takes another digit later, say at step 2 (so he has made 2 moves), that digit is the second digit. So the value is d * 10^(n - 1 - (number of H's moves made before this step)).\n\nWait, more precisely: for each digit that H takes, the position in his number is the number of H's moves he has made before this step. For example, when he takes his first digit, that's position 0 (the first digit), then the second is position 1, etc. So the value of that digit in his number is d * 10^{(n - 1 - pos)}, where pos is the count of H's moves before taking this digit.\n\nBut how to track this during the DP? Because the DP needs to track not only the number of H and M moves so far, but also the positions of their digits. However, that seems impossible because the state would be too big.\n\nWait, but perhaps the value contributed by a digit depends on when it is taken. For example, when H takes a digit at step k (i.e., when there are k digits taken so far), then the number of H's moves made before this step is h. So, the digit is the (h+1)th digit in his number. Therefore, the contribution to his number is digit * 10^{n - 1 - h}.\n\nSimilarly for M: when she takes a digit at step k (so total moves so far is k), and she has made m moves before this step, then this digit is her (m+1)th digit, contributing digit * 10^{n - 1 - m}.\n\nAh, that's the key! Because the position of the digit in the number depends on how many times the player has already taken digits. So, when a player takes a digit, the current count of their moves (h or m) determines the place value of that digit.\n\nTherefore, during the DP transitions, when choosing to take H or M, we can calculate the immediate contribution of that digit to the total sum, and then proceed recursively.\n\nSo the DP function can be defined as follows:\n\nDefine dp(h, m) as the maximum total sum achievable from the current state (h, m) onwards.\n\nThe base case is when h == n and m == n. Then, the sum is 0.\n\nFor the transition:\n\ncurrent position is k = h + m.\n\ndigit = A[k]\n\nIf we choose to take H next (if h < n):\n\nThen, the contribution is digit * 10^{n - 1 - h} (since this is the (h+1)th digit in H's number). Then, the next state is (h+1, m).\n\nSimilarly, if we choose to take M next (if m < n):\n\nContribution is digit * 10^{n - 1 - m} (since this is the (m+1)th digit in M's number). Then, the next state is (h, m+1).\n\nSo the DP recurrence is:\n\ndp(h, m) = max( (digit * 10^{...} + dp(h+1, m)), (digit * ... + dp(h, m+1)) )\n\nBut how do we compute 10^{n - 1 - h}? Well, for each h and m, we can precompute these values. But since n can be up to 18, the exponents can be up to 10^17, which is manageable as Python can handle big integers.\n\nSo the problem becomes a standard DP problem with memoization. But for n=18, the number of states is (18+1)*(18+1) = 361. For each state, there are up to two transitions. So the total number of operations is acceptable.\n\nBut how to handle memoization? We can memoize the function dp(h, m) which returns the maximum total sum and the choice (H or M) that leads to it.\n\nBut since we need to reconstruct the path (the sequence of H and M moves), we need to track not only the maximum sum but also the choice made at each step.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the powers of 10 for all possible exponents (from 0 to n-1).\n\n- Use memoization (like lru_cache) for the DP function, which returns the maximum sum for a given (h, m) state.\n\n- Also, track the choices made (whether to choose H or M) for each state, to reconstruct the path once the DP is computed.\n\nBut for Python, memoization with recursion might be possible, but since n is small (up to 18), even a recursive approach should work.\n\nBut let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, parse the input. For example, for n=2 and A='1234', the digits are [1,2,3,4].\n\nThen, precompute the power of 10 for each possible exponent. For example, for h ranging from 0 to n-1, the exponent is (n-1 - h). For example, when h=0, the exponent is n-1 - 0 = n-1. For h=1, it's n-1 -1 = n-2, etc. So for each possible h, the multiplier for H's digit is 10^{n-1 - h}.\n\nSame for M's digits.\n\nNow, the DP function:\n\nWe can memoize the function with parameters h and m, returning the maximum sum possible from that state.\n\nBut for memoization, we can use memoization via a dictionary or functools.lru_cache.\n\nBut since the maximum n is 18, and the h and m can be up to 18, the number of states is 19*19 = 361, which is very manageable.\n\nSo, the steps for code:\n\nRead n and A.\n\nConvert A into a list of integers, say digits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\nprecompute pow10: for each i from 0 to n-1, pow10[i] = 10^i.\n\nWait, but for the exponents, when H takes a digit when he has already made h moves, then the exponent is (n-1 - h). For example, if h is 0, the first digit of H's number contributes digit * 10^{n-1 - 0} = digit * 10^{n-1}, which is correct.\n\nSo, for each h, the multiplier is 10^{n-1 - h}.\n\nSimilarly for m.\n\nSo, during the DP, when we choose to take H, we multiply the current digit by 10^{n-1 - h} and add it to the result of the next state.\n\nSo, the code structure would be something like:\n\nmemo = {}\n\ndef dp(h, m):\n\n    if (h, m) in memo:\n\n        return memo[(h, m)]\n\n    k = h + m\n\n    if k == 2n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    # current digit is digits[k]\n\n    current_digit = digits[k]\n\n    max_val = -infinity\n\n    choice = ''\n\n    if h < n:\n\n        # choose H\n\n        val_h = current_digit * pow10[n-1 - h] + dp(h+1, m)\n\n        if val_h > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val_h\n\n            choice = 'H'\n\n    if m < n:\n\n        # choose M\n\n        val_m = current_digit * pow10[n-1 - m] + dp(h, m+1)\n\n        if val_m > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val_m\n\n            choice = 'M'\n\n    memo[(h, m)] = (max_val, choice)\n\n    return (max_val, choice)\n\nWait, but the function needs to return both the maximum value and the choice made. However, for memoization, perhaps we can separate the two parts. Alternatively, we can compute the maximum value first, and then reconstruct the path once the DP is done.\n\nBut for the DP, the memoization would need to store the maximum value, and then we can have another function to track the choices.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP, for each state, we can track the best choice (H or M) that leads to the maximum sum.\n\nOnce the DP is filled, we can start from (0, 0) and for each step, choose the best option (H or M) based on the stored choice, and build the sequence.\n\nSo, the code would need to compute the DP table, and then reconstruct the path.\n\nBut how to handle the memoization and the choice tracking.\n\nIn Python, for memoization, using lru_cache with a function that returns the maximum value, and then another pass to track the choices.\n\nAlternatively, we can memoize the best choice for each state (h, m).\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to compute the DP table for the maximum sum, and then reconstruct the path by checking for each state whether choosing H or M gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think again. The DP function returns the maximum sum possible from state (h, m). Once we have that, we can reconstruct the path by starting from (0, 0) and at each step, check whether taking H or M gives the maximum sum. But how to know which choice was taken?\n\nAlternatively, during the DP computation, for each state (h, m), we can record which choice (H or M) was made to reach the maximum sum. This can be stored in a separate memo table.\n\nSo, the code could have two memo tables: one for the maximum sum, and another for the choice made.\n\nBut perhaps, for Python, using memoization with a function that returns both the value and the choice.\n\nBut for the purposes of code, perhaps the following approach:\n\nImplement a memoization-based DP that returns the maximum sum possible from (h, m), and then, once the DP is computed, backtrack through the choices.\n\nBut how to backtrack? For example, starting from (0, 0), we check whether taking H or M gives the maximum sum. For that, during the DP computation, we can have a memo table that stores for each (h, m) the choice (H or M) that was taken.\n\nSo, during the DP computation, for each (h, m), we can store the best choice (H or M) that leads to the maximum sum.\n\nOnce the DP is filled, we can generate the sequence by starting at (0, 0), and for each step, append the choice stored for that state, and move to the next state accordingly.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and A.\n\ndigits = list of integers of A.\n\nprecompute pow10 for exponents up to n-1.\n\npow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]\n\nWait, but for H's case, the exponent is (n-1 - h). For example, when h is 0, exponent is n-1. So for h in 0..n-1, the exponent is (n-1 - h). So for pow10, we can compute 10^x where x is from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut for n=18, 10^17 is a big number, but Python can handle it.\n\nNow, the DP function.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python with memoization. Let's think of using memoization with lru_cache. However, since the digits are part of the problem, but the DP is dependent on the digits, which are fixed, the function can be written as follows.\n\nBut the digits are fixed for a given test case, so during the DP processing, the digits are known.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\ndigits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\npow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]  # pow10[i] = 10^i\n\nBut wait, for H's case, when he takes the digit, the exponent is (n-1 - h). For example, if h is the current count of H's moves, then the next digit he takes is his (h+1)th digit. The position in the number is (h+1)th, which is the (n - (h+1))th position from the end. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose H's number has n digits. The first digit he takes is the most significant digit. For example, if he takes digits d1, d2, ..., dn, then his number is d1 * 10^{n-1} + d2 * 10^{n-2} + ... + dn * 10^0.\n\nSo, for the h-th move (when he has already taken h digits), the next digit he takes is the (h+1)th digit. So the contribution of this digit is digit * 10^{n-1 - h}.\n\nYes. So, for h being the current count of H's moves (before taking this digit), the exponent is (n-1 - h).\n\nTherefore, the pow10 array needs to have entries for exponents from 0 to n-1. For example, when h is 0, the exponent is n-1 - 0 = n-1. Which is 10^{n-1}, which is pow10[n-1], assuming pow10 is [10^0, 10^1, ..., 10^{n-1}].\n\nWait, the pow10 list I had earlier is [10^i for i in 0..n-1]. So for exponent e = n-1 - h, which can range from n-1 (when h=0) down to 0 (when h = n-1). So, for example, if h=0, the exponent is n-1, which is pow10[n-1], which is 10^{n-1}.\n\nYes. So, the pow10 list is correct.\n\nNow, the DP function.\n\nBut since the digits are part of the problem, and the function depends on them, we can't use lru_cache directly unless we make the digits a global variable, or pass them as parameters. However, since the digits are fixed during the DP processing, it's acceptable.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n\ndef dp(h, m):\n\n    k = h + m\n\n    if k == 2*n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    current_digit = digits[k]\n\n    max_val = -1\n\n    best_choice = ''\n\n    if h < n:\n\n        # choose H\n\n        val = current_digit * pow10[n-1 - h] + dp(h+1, m)\n\n        if val > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val\n\n            best_choice = 'H'\n\n    if m < n:\n\n        # choose M\n\n        val = current_digit * pow10[n-1 - m] + dp(h, m+1)\n\n        if val > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val\n\n            best_choice = 'M'\n\n    return max_val\n\nWait, but this function returns the maximum value, but not the best choice. So how to track the best choice? Because for the path reconstruction, we need to know which choice was made at each step.\n\nSo, perhaps the DP function returns the maximum value, and then we can have another function or a memoization table that records the best choice.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP calculation, we can track the best choice. But how?\n\nAnother approach is to compute the DP table for maximum values, then reconstruct the path by checking for each (h, m) whether choosing H or M gives the maximum value.\n\nSo, first compute the DP table for all (h, m) pairs, then backtrack from (0, 0) to (n, n), choosing at each step the option (H or M) that leads to the maximum value.\n\nBut how to compute the DP table. Let's think of using memoization with lru_cache, and then during the backtracking, for each (h, m) state, check which choice (H or M) gives the maximum value.\n\nSo, for example, during backtracking:\n\ncurrent_h = 0\n\ncurrent_m = 0\n\nresult = ''\n\nwhile current_h + current_m < 2n:\n\n    k = current_h + current_m\n\n    current_digit = digits[k]\n\n    # check if choosing H is better\n\n    if current_h < n:\n\n        val_H = current_digit * pow10[n-1 - current_h] + dp(current_h + 1, current_m)\n\n    else:\n\n        val_H = -infinity\n\n    if current_m < n:\n\n        val_M = current_digit * pow10[n-1 - current_m] + dp(current_h, current_m + 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        val_M = -infinity\n\n    if val_H > val_M:\n\n        result += 'H'\n\n        current_h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        result += 'M'\n\n        current_m += 1\n\nBut this approach would require recomputing the DP for each step during backtracking, which is not efficient. However, since the DP is already computed, we can cache the values.\n\nBut during the initial DP computation, the function dp(h, m) returns the maximum value. So, during backtracking, for each state (h, m), we can compute what is the value of choosing H and M, and see which one is larger.\n\nBut how to compute the value of choosing H and M? For example, for state (h, m), the value of choosing H is current_digit * ... + dp(h+1, m). But the dp function already returns that value.\n\nBut during backtracking, we can call the dp function again, but since it's memoized, it's fast.\n\nBut in Python, the @lru_cache decorator will memoize the function, so even if we call dp during backtracking, it's already computed.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nCompute the DP function using memoization, and then backtrack by checking for each state which choice gives the maximum value.\n\nBut how to handle the case where both choices are possible and have equal value? The problem says that any of the possible solutions is acceptable.\n\nSo, during backtracking, for each state (h, m), check if choosing H gives a higher value than M. If equal, choose either (e.g., prefer H or M based on some criteria, but the problem allows any of them).\n\nBut how to compute the values of choosing H and M during backtracking?\n\nLet me think. For the current state (h, m), the current digit is digits[k], where k = h + m.\n\nIf we choose H, then the contribution is current_digit * pow10[n-1 - h] plus dp(h+1, m). Similarly for M.\n\nBut since dp is already memoized, we can compute this during backtracking.\n\nBut during the initial DP computation, the dp function returns the maximum of these two options. Therefore, during backtracking, when we check the two options, the one that gives the same value as the dp(h, m) is the correct choice.\n\nSo, during backtracking, for each (h, m), we can check whether choosing H gives the same value as the stored dp(h, m). If yes, then choose H. Else choose M.\n\nBut how to know which choice was taken. Well, during backtracking, for each state (h, m), we can calculate the value of choosing H and M, and compare them with the stored dp value.\n\nBut for example, suppose dp(h, m) is equal to val_H. Then, choosing H is the correct choice. Otherwise, it's M.\n\nSo, during backtracking, the code can be:\n\ncurrent_h = 0\n\ncurrent_m = 0\n\nresult = []\n\nwhile current_h + current_m < 2 * n:\n\n    k = current_h + current_m\n\n    current_digit = digits[k]\n\n    # compute the value of choosing H and M\n\n    val_H = -infinity\n\n    if current_h < n:\n\n        val_H = current_digit * pow10[n-1 - current_h] + dp(current_h + 1, current_m)\n\n    val_M = -infinity\n\n    if current_m < n:\n\n        val_M = current_digit * pow10[n-1 - current_m] + dp(current_h, current_m + 1)\n\n    if val_H > val_M:\n\n        result.append('H')\n\n        current_h += 1\n\n    elif val_M > val_H:\n\n        result.append('M')\n\n        current_m += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # choose H or M arbitrarily. Let's choose H first.\n\n        result.append('H')\n\n        current_h += 1\n\nBut this approach would work. However, during backtracking, we need to call dp again. However, since the dp function is memoized, this is acceptable.\n\nBut what about the time complexity? For each step in backtracking (which is O(2n) steps), we make two calls to dp. But the dp function is already computed, so those calls are O(1) time. Therefore, the backtracking is O(2n) time.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nBut how to handle the pow10? Because for n up to 18, 10^17 is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, the pow10 can be precomputed as a list.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut first, note that the digits are 0-based. For example, for A = '1234', digits[0] is 1, digits[1] is 2, etc.\n\nBut for the DP function, when h + m = k, the current digit is digits[k].\n\nSo, the code:\n\nBut in the code, the digits are stored as a list. Now, the problem is that for the DP function, the digits are accessed as digits[k], which depends on the current state.\n\nBut in Python, the DP function can access the digits as a global variable. However, when using lru_cache, the function must be pure (i.e., not depend on external variables that change). However, since the digits are fixed for a given run of the program, this is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code outline:\n\nRead n and A.\n\ndigits = list of integers.\n\nprecompute pow10 as [10^i for i in 0..n-1]\n\nThen, define the dp function with memoization.\n\nBut for the pow10, when h is the current count of H's moves, the exponent is (n-1 - h). So, the multiplier is pow10[n-1 - h].\n\nBut for example, when h is 0, the exponent is n-1, which is pow10[n-1].\n\nBut pow10 is [10^0, 10^1, ..., 10^{n-1}], so pow10[n-1 - h] is correct.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut for the DP function, the code:\n\nBut in Python, the lru_cache decorator requires that the parameters to the function are hashable. So, h and m are integers, which is fine.\n\nBut for the digits and pow10, they are global variables. However, since the DP function is called once per test case, and the digits and pow10 are fixed during that time, this is okay.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut let's test for the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n2\n\n1234\n\nSample Output: HHMM\n\nLet's compute the maximum sum.\n\nThe digits are [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\nn=2.\n\npow10 = [1, 10]\n\nFor H's first move (h=0, m=0), the digit is 1. Choosing H gives 1 * 10^(2-1 - 0) = 1 * 10^1 = 10. Then, the next state is h=1, m=0.\n\nIn that state, the current digit is 2 (k=1). Choosing H again (h=1 < 2) gives 2 * 10^(2-1 -1) = 2 * 10^0 = 2. Then, the next state is h=2, m=0. Then, the remaining digits are 3 and 4. Now, the next moves must be M's.\n\nSo the sum would be 10 + 2 + (3 * 10^1) + (4 * 10^0) ?\n\nWait, no. Because the DP function returns the maximum sum from the current state. So for the entire process, the sum is the sum of all the contributions made at each step.\n\nSo for the sequence HHMM:\n\nH takes 1 and 2, M takes 3 and 4.\n\nH's number is 12, which is 1*10^1 + 2*10^0 = 12.\n\nM's number is 34, which is 3*10^1 +4*10^0 = 34. Total sum is 46.\n\nAnother possible sequence is HMHM: H takes 1 and 3, M takes 2 and 4. H's number is 13, M's is 24. Sum is 37. Which is less than 46.\n\nAnother sequence is HMMH: H takes 1 and 4, M takes 2 and 3. H's number is 14, M's is 23. Sum 37.\n\nSo the maximum is indeed 46, achieved by HHMM.\n\nSo the code should return 'HHMM'.\n\nBut how does the DP function compute this?\n\nFor the initial state (0,0), the code chooses between H and M.\n\nIf choosing H, the value is 1*10^1 + dp(1, 0).\n\nWhat is dp(1, 0)?\n\nAt that state, k = 1 + 0 = 1, digit is 2.\n\nPossible choices: H or M.\n\nIf choosing H, h=1 < 2, so:\n\ncontribution is 2 * 10^(1 -1) = 2 * 1 = 2, then dp(2, 0).\n\ndp(2, 0): k=2+0=2, digit is 3.\n\nAt this state, h=2, m=0. Since h is already n=2, only M can take.\n\nSo, choosing M: contribution is 3 * 10^(n-1 - m) = 3 * 10^(1 - 0) = 3 * 10^1 = 30. Then, next state is (2, 1).\n\nIn that state, k=2+1=3, digit is 4. Now, m=1 < 2. So choose M again: 4 * 10^(1 -1) = 4 * 1 =4. Next state (2,2). Total sum is 2 + 30 +4 = 36. So the value for dp(2,0) is 30 + 4 = 34? Or wait, the DP function returns the sum of all contributions from that state onwards.\n\nSo for dp(2, 0), the value is 3 * 10^(1 - 0) + dp(2, 1) ?\n\nYes. So:\n\ndp(2, 0) = 3 * 10^1 + dp(2, 1)\n\ndp(2, 1) = 4 * 10^ (1 -1) + dp(2, 2) → 4 * 1 + 0 = 4.\n\nThus, dp(2,0) = 30 +4=34.\n\nSo, dp(1, 0) when choosing H is 2 + 34 = 36.\n\nIf instead, at state (1,0), choosing M:\n\ncontribution is 2 * 10^(n-1 - m) = 2 * 10^(1 -0) = 2*10=20. Then, next state is (1, 1).\n\nAt (1,1), k=2, digit is 3. Now, possible choices: H or M.\n\nIf choosing H: contribution is 3 * 10^(1 -1) = 3 *1 =3. Then, next state (2,1). Which gives 3 + 4 =7. So total for this path is 20 +3 +4 = 27.\n\nIf choosing M: contribution is 3 * 10^(1 -1) =3*1=3. Then next state (1,2). Then, the next digit is 4. Now, h=1 < 2, so choose H. contribution is 4 * 10^(1 -1) =4*1=4. So total is 20 +3 +4 =27. So dp(1,1) is max(3 + ... , 3 + ... ) → 7. So dp(1,0) when choosing M is 20 +7 =27. So between 36 (choosing H) and 27 (choosing M), the maximum is 36. Thus, dp(1,0) is 36.\n\nSo back to dp(0,0) when choosing H: 10 + 36 =46.\n\nIf instead, at (0,0) the code chooses M:\n\ncontribution is 1 * 10^(1 -0) =10. Then, next state (0,1). Let's compute dp(0,1).\n\nAt (0,1), k=0+1=1, digit is 2. Now, possible choices are H or M.\n\nIf choosing H: contribution is 2 * 10^(1 -0) =2*10=20. Next state (1,1). As before, dp(1,1) is 7. So total 20 +7 =27. So total for this path is 10 +27 = 37.\n\nIf choosing M: contribution is 2 * 10^(1 -1) =2*1=2. Next state (0,2). Then, k=0+2=2, digit is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that the total sum of their respective numbers formed from the digits of a given number A is maximized. Each player must make exactly n moves, and the sequence of moves must be determined to maximize the sum.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a dynamic programming approach to explore all possible sequences of moves while keeping track of the maximum total sum achievable from each state.\n2. **State Representation**: The state is represented by the number of moves made by Homer (h) and Marge (m).
