A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible number determined by the constraints of each resource.\n\nLet me break down the problem. \n\nFirst, the inputs are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend). \n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. But since there are n friends, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait: For one toast, each friend makes one toast. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends needs nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (each friend has one slice per toast). And salt is n * np per toast.\n\nSo the total resources available:\n\nDrink: total_drink = k * l. How many toasts can be made based on drink? total_drink / (n * nl). But since we can't have fractions, it's integer division. Or wait, maybe we need to take the floor of the division. Because if you have 20 ml, and each toast requires 3 ml, then 20 / 3 is 6.666, but you can only do 6 toasts.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: total_slices = c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So total_toasts_by_lime = total_slices // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np grams. So total_toasts_by_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of those three values. Because each of these resources can't be exceeded. So the maximum possible toasts is the minimum of the three possible values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink: 4*5 = 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml? Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink needed is n * nl. For the first example, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So total toasts possible from drink is 20 / 9 = 2.222..., which is 2 when floored. But in the note, they said that the drink allows 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, what's the note saying?\n\nAh, the note says: the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, why is that? Because the note says that the drink is 20 ml, and each toast requires 3 ml per friend. But for each toast, each friend uses 3 ml. So for one toast, total is 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But according to the note, they have 20 / 3 = 6. That seems like a mistake. Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, the note says: \"the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". Wait, but that would be if each toast requires 3 ml per friend. But for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. So for the first example, n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. But according to the note, the drink allows 6 toasts. So why is that?\n\nWait, maybe I have the problem statement wrong. Let me recheck.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend has one toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. So the total number of toasts possible",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources for each friend, and we must ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: \n   - **Drink**: Calculate the total amount of drink available by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime.\n   - **Salt**: Use the given amount of salt directly.\n\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the total lime slices available. Each toast requires `n` slices.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Determine how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available. Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt.\n\n3. **Compute Result**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum value among the constraints derived from the drink, lime slices, and salt.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split the input into individual numbers\n    numbers = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    # Extract the values\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = numbers\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available (ml)\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Each toast requires n * nl ml\n    toasts_by_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available\n    total_slices = c * d\n    # Each toast requires n slices\n    toasts_by_lime = total_slices // n\n    \n    # Calculate total salt available (grams)\n    total_salt = p\n    # Each toast requires n * np grams\n    toasts_by_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three values\n    result = min(toasts_by_drink, toasts_by_lime, toasts_by_salt)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers for processing.\n- **Resource Calculation**: The total available resources (drink, lime slices, salt) are calculated based on the given inputs.\n- **Toast Constraints**: For each resource, the number of possible toasts is determined by integer division of the total resource by the required amount per toast.\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum value among the three constraints gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all constraints are satisfied. This approach efficiently computes the result using basic arithmetic operations and ensures correctness by considering each resource's limitation.",
