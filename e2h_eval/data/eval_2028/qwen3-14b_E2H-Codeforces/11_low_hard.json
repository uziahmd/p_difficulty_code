A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, each toast requires nl ml of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and np grams of salt per friend.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs these things. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl ml. Because each friend has one toast. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (since each friend uses one slice per toast). And the salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for each toast, each friend requires these. So if there are t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts. So for all friends, total drink required is n * t * nl. Because each friend has t toasts, each requiring nl ml. Similarly, for lime slices: each toast per friend requires a slice, so total slices needed is n * t. And salt is n * t * np grams.\n\nSo the resources available are:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nTotal salt: p grams.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts per friend (t) is limited by each of these resources. So for each resource, compute how much t is possible, then take the minimum of those.\n\nSo for drink: total_drink = k*l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So maximum t from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, because if (k*l) divided by (n * nl) gives the maximum t where n*t*nl <= total_drink.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: total_slices = c*d. Each toast requires n slices. So t can be at most (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt is p. Each toast requires n * np grams. So t can be at most p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of those three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. Let's compute:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Because per toast, each of the 3 friends needs 3 ml. So per toast, total drink is 3 * 3 =9 ml. Then 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation. Then the lime slices: c=10, d=8. Total slices is 80. Each toast requires 3 slices (n=3). So 80 /3 is 26.666... floor 26. But the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous calculation. Wait, what's the correct way here?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How?\n\nAh, because the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me check:\n\nIn the first sample, the total slices is 10 * 8 =80. Each toast requires n slices, which is 3. So 80 /3 is 26.666, so floor 26. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that seems conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources for each friend, so we need to calculate the maximum possible toasts based on each resource and take the minimum value among them.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink available, total number of lime slices, and total amount of salt.\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - **Drink**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total number of lime slices available.\n   - **Salt**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total amount of salt available.\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts per Friend**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the minimum value of the constraints derived from each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_slices = c * d\ntotal_salt = p\n\n# Calculate maximum toasts based on each resource\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoast_lime = total_slices // n\ntoast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\n# The answer is the minimum of the three\nprint(min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n- **Total Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is found by multiplying the number of limes by the number of slices per lime.\n- **Resource Constraints**:\n  - **Drink Constraint**: The number of toasts is determined by dividing the total drink by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n  - **Lime Slices Constraint**: The number of toasts is determined by dividing the total slices by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n  - **Salt Constraint**: The number of toasts is determined by dividing the total salt by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n- **Result**: The minimum value among the three constraints gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring that all resources are sufficient.",
