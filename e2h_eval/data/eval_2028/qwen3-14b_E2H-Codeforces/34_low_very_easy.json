And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. Each week is k consecutive days. For each of these weeks, I need to compute the sum of their sleep times, then take the average of all those sums.\n\nFirst, let's think about the example given. For instance, when n=3 and k=2, the weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their sums are 7 and 11, average is (7+11)/2 = 9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum of all possible consecutive k-day periods, then dividing by the number of such periods (which is n - k + 1).\n\nThe challenge here is to compute these sums efficiently. Because n can be up to 2e5, a naive approach of calculating each sum by iterating through each window would be O(n*k), which would be 4e10 operations in the worst case. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a more efficient approach. Oh right! Sliding window technique. Let's think about that.\n\nThe idea is to compute the sum for the first window (the first k elements), then for each subsequent window, subtract the element that's leaving the window and add the new element that's entering. This way, each sum is computed in O(1) time after the initial sum, leading to O(n) time overall.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Add this sum to a total sum variable.\n3. Then, for each next window (from i=1 to i = n -k), subtract a[i-1] and add a[i + k -1], then add to total.\n4. Finally, divide the total by the number of windows (n -k +1) to get the average.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Now, let's think about the edge cases. For example, when k equals n. Then there's only one window, which is the entire array. So the average is the sum of all elements divided by 1.\n\nAnother case is when k is 1. Then each window is a single element, and the average is the average of all elements. But since each window is one element, the sum is sum of all elements, divided by n (since n -1 +1 =n).\n\nWait, but in that case, the sum of all windows is sum(a1) + sum(a2) + ... + sum(an) which equals sum(a) * 1. So the average is sum(a)/n. Which is correct.\n\nSo the sliding window approach works for all cases.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nRead the input: first line has n and k. Second line has the list of a's.\n\nCompute the initial sum. Then iterate through the rest.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the initial sum? For example, for the first window, it's sum(a[0..k-1]).\n\nThen, for each next window, subtract a[i-1], add a[i + k -1], where i starts from 1 to (n -k) ?\n\nWait, the number of windows is (n -k +1). So for the first window, index 0. Then next is index 1, etc., up to index (n -k).\n\nSo the loop for the sliding window would run from 1 to (n -k) ?\n\nWait, the initial sum is for the first window. Then, for each of the next (n -k) windows, we do the sliding step. So total number of steps is (n -k) steps. So the total sum is initial_sum plus the sum of each of the subsequent steps.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nCompute initial_sum as sum of a[0...k-1]\n\ntotal = initial_sum\n\nthen for i in range(1, n -k +1):\n\nWait, the number of windows is (n -k +1). So the first window is 0, then 1, up to (n -k). So the loop for the sliding part would run (n -k) times. Because after the first window, there are (n -k) more windows.\n\nSo for i from 1 to (n -k):\n\ncurrent_sum = previous_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\nSo in code:\n\ncurrent_sum = initial_sum\n\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, n -k +1):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total += current_sum\n\nWait, but the initial_sum is the sum for the first window. Then, for each i starting at 1, the next window is",
