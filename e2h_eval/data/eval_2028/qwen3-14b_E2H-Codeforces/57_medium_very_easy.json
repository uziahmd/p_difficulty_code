His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the first and second tour scores, but they are not linked to names. So, we need to consider all possible pairings of the first and second tour scores for the participants, and find out what's the best and worst possible rank Vasya can get given that there's at least one pair (ai + bj) >= x.\n\nWait, but how do we model Vasya's possible scores? Because Vasya's actual scores are some ai from the first tour and some bj from the second tour. But the problem says that there exists i and j such that ai + bj >= x. So, for the purposes of calculating best and worst positions, we can assume that Vasya's total is exactly ai + bj for some pair (i,j) that satisfies that condition. However, since the problem wants the best and worst possible positions, we need to choose the best possible scenario (where Vasya's total is as high as possible) and worst possible scenario (where Vasya's total is as low as possible, but still meets the x condition).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. So, when considering possible scenarios, we need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that their sum is >=x. But for the best possible rank, we want Vasya's sum to be as high as possible, so that he can be placed first. For the worst possible rank, we want his sum to be as low as possible (but still >=x), so that as many others as possible have higher sums.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nLet me think. For the best possible rank:\n\nWe need to maximize Vasya's total. So, the maximum possible sum he can have is the maximum possible a_i + b_j. But since the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x, but perhaps the maximum possible sum is higher than x. So, in this case, the best possible rank would be 1, because if Vasya's total is the maximum possible, then he can be placed first.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple people with the same maximum sum? Then the jury can assign him any position. But in the best case, he can be first. So, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's someone else who has a higher sum. Wait no, because the maximum possible sum is the maximum of all a_i + b_j. So if Vasya's sum is that maximum, then he can be placed first.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, it's 1. But wait, maybe there are other people with the same maximum sum. But the problem allows the jury to assign positions in such cases. So in the best case, Vasya can be considered first. Therefore, the best possible rank is always 1?\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first example has all participants with 1+1=2 points. So Vasya's total is 2. Since all have the same sum, the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is 5. Which matches the sample output. So yes, the best possible is 1.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is always 1. Wait, but why? Because even if there are others with the same maximum sum, the jury can arrange for Vasya to be first. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut how do we confirm that? Because the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya has at least x points. So in the best scenario, Vasya's total is as high as possible, which would be the maximum possible sum of a_i + b_j. So if that maximum is >=x, then he can be placed first.\n\nBut wait, what if the maximum sum is less than x? But the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x. So the maximum sum must be >=x. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but that seems too easy. So the best possible rank is always 1. So the first part of the output is always 1?\n\nBut looking at the sample input, the first example's output is 1 5. So yes. The second sample's output is 1 5. So the first number is 1. So that seems to be the case.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1. Therefore, the first part of the answer is 1. But why?\n\nBecause the teacher can choose the best possible scenario where Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. So regardless of other possibilities, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo now, the main challenge is to compute the worst possible rank.\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to find the scenario where Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still >=x) and as many other participants as possible have higher totals than him.\n\nSo, to find the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible value of Vasya's total (s) such that s >=x, and then count how many participants can have a total higher than s. Then, the worst rank would be that count plus 1. But since the problem allows for ties, we need to consider that in the worst case, all participants with higher sums are ranked above Vasya, and those with equal sums can be placed after him. But since the jury can arrange the order, in the worst case, Vasya is placed as low as possible.\n\nWait, but how to model this. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that Vasya's total is s (which is the minimal possible value >=x). Then, the worst possible rank would be determined by how many participants have a total strictly greater than s. Because in that case, those people are ranked above him. Then, the worst possible rank is (number of people with total > s) + 1. Because even if others have the same as s, the jury can arrange them to be placed after Vasya. But if there are people with the same s as Vasya, then in the worst case, they can be placed after him. So the worst possible rank is (number of people with total > s) + 1. But how to find s?\n\nBut how do we choose s? Because s can be any value >=x, but we want to choose s as small as possible (so that as many as possible people can have higher totals than s). But s has to be achievable by some pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So, the minimal possible s is the minimal possible sum that is >=x. Wait, but how do we find that?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst possible scenario, we want to choose s as the minimal possible sum that is >=x. Because that way, more people can have higher sums than s, leading to a worse rank.\n\nSo the steps for the worst case:\n\nFind the minimal possible s (Vasya's total) that is >=x. Then, compute how many participants have a total sum > s. Then, the worst possible rank is (count + 1). But how do we find s?\n\nWait, but s is the minimal possible sum that is >=x. How do we find that?\n\nBut the minimal possible sum that is >=x is the minimal possible value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. Because if we choose that, then any higher s would allow fewer people to have higher sums than s, leading to a better (lower) rank. So to get the worst possible rank, we need to choose the minimal possible s that is >=x. Then, count how many people have a total sum that is strictly larger than s. Then, the worst possible rank is count + 1.\n\nBut how do we find that minimal s?\n\nWait, but how can we find the minimal s such that s >=x and s is a_i + b_j for some i and j. Because the problem says that there exists at least one such pair. So, the minimal s is the minimal possible a_i + b_j that is >=x. However, this may not be the case. For example, suppose that x is 5, and there are pairs with sum 6, 7, etc. Then the minimal s is 6. So, in that case, the worst rank is based on that.\n\nBut how do we find this minimal s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal s is the minimal possible sum that is at least x. But how to find that?\n\nBut perhaps the way to approach this is to find the minimal possible s (>=x) such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j = s. Then, for that s, we need to count how many pairs (a_k + b_l) are strictly greater than s. Then the worst rank is that count + 1.\n\nBut how to find this minimal s?\n\nBut perhaps the minimal s is the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. So, to find that, we can generate all possible a_i + b_j, take those that are >=x, and find the minimal one. However, since n can be up to 1e5, generating all possible pairs would be O(n^2), which is impossible.\n\nWait, that's a problem. Because n is up to 1e5, then n^2 is 1e10, which is way too big. So, we need a smarter approach.\n\nBut the problem says that the teacher has the two lists of a and b. But the problem is that the actual pairing between a and b is unknown. For example, the first tour's a_i and the second tour's b_j are not necessarily paired for the same participant. So, for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j where i and j can be any indices, but each a_i is used exactly once, and each b_j is used exactly once. Wait, no! Wait, the problem says that each participant is present in both tours. So, the original data is that each participant has a score in the first tour (a_i) and a score in the second tour (b_i). But the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tours, but the problem is that the results have only points, no names. So, the teacher doesn't know which a_i corresponds to which b_j. Therefore, when trying to find the best and worst possible positions for Vasya, we can choose any possible pairing of a's and b's, as long as each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa. Wait, no. Wait, the participants are the same. Each participant has a first tour score and a second tour score. But the teacher has the list of first tour scores and the list of second tour scores, but they are not linked. So, for example, the first tour's a1, a2, ... an are the scores of the participants, and the second tour's b1, b2, ..., bn are the same participants' scores. But the teacher doesn't know which a_i belongs to which b_j. So, the problem is that when trying to find the best and worst possible ranks for Vasya, we can choose any possible permutation of the b's, i.e., for each participant, their total is a_i + b_{sigma(i)}, where sigma is a permutation of 1..n. But the problem says that Vasya is one of the participants, so there must be at least one pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. But the teacher is trying to find the best and worst possible rank for Vasya, considering that the actual pairing of a and b is unknown.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have, given that there's some possible pairing of a and b (each a_i matched with exactly one b_j, and each b_j matched with exactly one a_i) such that in that pairing, Vasya's total is at least x. But how does that affect the possible positions?\n\nBut perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nThe teacher has the results of the first and the second tour. The problem is that the results have only points, no names. So, the teacher doesn't know which a_i corresponds to which b_j. But Vasya was present in the Olympiad, so there exists some i and j such that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nBut the teacher needs to find the best and worst possible rank that Vasya could have, considering all possible pairings of a and b (i.e., all possible permutations of the b array, as the pairing between a and b is unknown).\n\nWait, but the problem says that the participants are the same. So each participant has a first tour score and a second tour score. But the teacher has the first tour scores in a list and the second tour scores in another list, but they are not linked. So, the actual pairing of a_i and b_j is unknown. Therefore, when considering all possible ways to pair the a's and b's (each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, and vice versa), the teacher needs to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have, given that in the actual pairing, Vasya's total is at least x.\n\nBut how can we model this? For example, the best possible scenario for Vasya is when his total is as high as possible, and the worst possible scenario is when his total is as low as possible (but still meeting the x condition).\n\nBut how to find the best and worst possible scenarios?\n\nAh! So, for the best possible scenario, we can pair a_i and b_j in such a way that Vasya's total is as high as possible. Similarly, for the worst possible scenario, we can pair a_i and b_j in a way that Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still at least x), while maximizing the number of participants with higher totals than him.\n\nBut how do we find these pairings?\n\nLet me think. For the best scenario:\n\nWe want to maximize Vasya's total. To do that, we can pair the maximum a_i with the maximum b_j. So, the maximum possible sum is max_a + max_b. So in this case, Vasya's total is that maximum sum. Then, in the ranking, he can be placed first. Hence, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nFor the worst scenario:\n\nWe want to minimize Vasya's total (but it has to be at least x). At the same time, we want as many other participants as possible to have a higher total than him. So, how to pair the a's and b's such that Vasya's total is as small as possible (but >=x) and other participants have as high totals as possible.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we want to find the minimal possible sum s >=x that can be achieved by some a_i + b_j. Once we have that s, then we can arrange the rest of the pairings so that as many as possible other participants have higher sums than s.\n\nBut how to find that minimal s?\n\nBut how to find the minimal possible s such that there exists a pair a_i + b_j >=x. Well, the minimal possible s is the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x.\n\nBut how to find this minimal s?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we need to find the minimal possible sum >=x that can be formed by a_i + b_j. However, since the pairing of a and b can be arbitrary (as per the problem), perhaps we can find the minimal s by taking the minimal possible a_i + b_j that is >=x, but how?\n\nWait, but in the worst case scenario, we can choose for Vasya's pairing a_i and b_j such that their sum is the minimal possible s >=x. Then, for the other participants, we can pair their a's and b's in a way that maximizes their total, thus increasing the count of people with higher totals than s.\n\nBut how to find that minimal s?\n\nTo find the minimal s >=x, perhaps we can sort the a array and the b array. Let me think: For example, if we want to find the minimal possible sum >=x, we can sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, and then for each a_i, find the smallest b_j that when added to a_i gives >=x. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal s can be found by considering all possible pairs of a_i and b_j, but since n is 1e5, that's O(n^2), which is impossible.\n\nSo, we need an efficient way to find the minimal possible s >=x, where s is a_i + b_j for some i and j.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis sounds like the classic problem of finding the minimal sum >=x in two arrays. The standard approach for that is to sort one array and use binary search on the other.\n\nFor example, sort array a in ascending order, and array b in ascending order. Then, for each element in a, find the smallest element in b such that a[i] + b[j] >=x. Then, among all these possible pairs, take the minimal sum.\n\nBut since we need to find the minimal s >=x, that's the approach.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nSort array a in ascending order, and array b in ascending order.\n\nFor each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, the minimal s is the minimal of all these a_i + b_j.\n\nBut how to find this efficiently.\n\nLet me think. For example, for each a_i, the minimal b_j that can be paired with it to reach >=x is found by binary search in the sorted array b.\n\nOnce we find that, for each a_i, we can get the minimal b_j that can be paired with it. Then, the overall minimal s is the minimal among all these a_i + b_j.\n\nBut since we can pair any a_i with any b_j, this approach should work.\n\nBut also, there might be cases where a_i is very large, and even the smallest b_j (say, 0) gives a_i + b_j >=x. In that case, the minimal s would be a_i + 0, but perhaps there's a smaller sum elsewhere.\n\nSo, this approach would find the minimal possible s.\n\nOnce we have this minimal s, then we can proceed to calculate how many pairs (a_k, b_l) can have a sum greater than s. But how?\n\nWait, but in the worst case scenario, the pairing is arranged so that Vasya's sum is s, and others are paired in a way that maximizes the number of people with sum >s.\n\nBut how to compute how many such pairs exist?\n\nBut wait, in the worst case scenario, the pairing of a and b is such that as many as possible participants have sum greater than s. How?\n\nBut since the pairing is arbitrary, the maximum number of participants that can have sum greater than s is the maximum possible number of pairs (a_k, b_l) where a_k + b_l > s. However, since each a and b can be used exactly once, this becomes a problem of matching a and b in such a way that as many as possible pairs have sum >s. But how to compute that maximum number?\n\nBut perhaps, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s is equal to the maximum possible number of pairs that can be formed with a_i + b_j >s, given that each a and b is used exactly once. This seems like a problem that can be solved with greedy algorithms.\n\nFor example, to maximize the number of pairs with sum >s, we can sort a in ascending order, and sort b in descending order, and then pair the largest b with the smallest a that can form a sum >s. Or something like that.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j > s, with each element used once.\n\nThe standard approach for this is to sort a and b. Let's say we sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each element in a, we try to pair it with the largest possible b that hasn't been used yet and such that a_i + b_j >s. If that's possible, we count it. Otherwise, we move on.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method:\n\nSort a in ascending order and b in ascending order.\n\nThen, use two pointers approach. Let's start with the largest elements in a and b.\n\nInitialize i = n-1 (the last element of a, which is largest), j = n-1 (last element of b, largest). Count =0.\n\nIf a[i] + b[j] >s, then we can pair them. Increment count, decrement i and j.\n\nElse, we need to decrease j (since a[i] is too big, but b[j] is too small. So, if a[i] + b[j] <=s, then we can't pair this a[i] with any b[j], because even the largest available b[j] is not enough. So we move to the next a[i] (i--). \n\nWait, no. Wait, the idea is to pair a_i with the largest possible b_j that can make a_i + b_j >s. So, for the sorted a and sorted b, the approach is:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i =0 (smallest a), j =n-1 (largest b). Count =0.\n\nFor each a_i, check if a_i + b_j >s. If yes, then we can pair them. count +=1, i++, j--. Else, we need to move to the next a_i (i++), because even the largest b_j can't pair with a_i to make the sum >s. \n\nWait, this approach is used in the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs with sum greater than a certain value. Let me think.\n\nYes, this is a standard approach. Let me think with an example:\n\nSuppose a is [1,2,3], b is [4,5,6]. s=5.\n\nWe want to find the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j >5.\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\ni=0, j=2 (a[0]=1, b[2]=6). 1+6=7>5. count=1. i=1, j=1.\n\na[1]=2, b[1]=5. 2+5=7>5. count=2. i=2, j=0. a[2]=3, b[0]=4. 3+4=7>5. count=3. So all 3 pairs can be formed.\n\nAnother example: a = [1,2,3], b=[1,2,3], s=3.\n\nWe want maximum pairs with sum >3.\n\nsorted a: [1,2,3], sorted b: [1,2,3].\n\ni=0, j=2. 1+3=4>3. count=1. i=1, j=1. 2+2=4>3. count=2. i=2, j=0. 3+1=4>3. count=3. All pairs.\n\nAnother example: a = [1,2,3], b = [1,1,1], s=2.\n\nWe want sum>2. So possible pairs: 1+1=2 (no), 2+1=3>2, 3+1=4>2. So maximum pairs is 2.\n\nUsing the algorithm:\n\ni=0, j=2. 1+1=2 not >2. So we move i to 1. Now i=1, j=2. 2+1=3>2. count=1. i=2, j=1. 3+1=4>2. count=2. i=3, exit. So yes.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nTherefore, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s is computed by this two-pointer approach.\n\nSo, putting this together:\n\nFor the worst possible rank:\n\n- Find the minimal s >=x that can be achieved by a_i + b_j. Let's call this s_min.\n\n- Then, compute the maximum number of pairs (participants) that can have sum >s_min. Let's call this count_max.\n\n- Then, the worst possible rank is count_max + 1.\n\nBut how to compute s_min?\n\nAs discussed earlier, we can sort a and b, and for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, take the minimal among all those a_i + b_j.\n\nBut how to find this efficiently.\n\nLet me think. Sort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\nFor each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, the minimal s is the minimal of a_i + b_j for all i.\n\nBut to find that, for each a_i, we can perform a binary search on the sorted b array to find the minimal b_j that is >= (x - a_i). Then, for that a_i, the minimal possible sum is a_i + b_j. Then, among all these, take the minimal.\n\nBut since we want the minimal possible s >=x, this approach would work.\n\nBut how to handle cases where even the largest b_j is less than (x - a_i), which would mean that there's no possible b_j for this a_i. But the problem states that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. So, for at least one a_i, there exists a b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nSo, the code steps would be:\n\nSort a and b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize min_s to a very large value.\n\nFor each a_i in a:\n\n   target = x - a_i\n\n   find the smallest index j in b where b[j] >= target.\n\n   if such j exists:\n\n       current_sum = a_i + b[j]\n\n       if current_sum < min_s:\n\n           min_s = current_sum\n\nSo, after checking all a_i, min_s is the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there's a pair (a_i, b_j) where a_i is not the one being checked here. For example, maybe for a_i, the minimal b_j is not the best option. But since we are checking all a_i's, and for each a_i, the minimal b_j that can be added to it to reach x, then the minimal s is the minimal of all those possibilities.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, if a_i is small, but b_j is large, but for another a_i', which is larger, the corresponding b_j' is smaller. So, the minimal sum could be a_i + b_j where a_i is small and b_j is large, or a_i' is large and b_j' is small.\n\nBut by checking all a_i, and for each a_i, the minimal possible b_j that can be added to it to reach x, we can find the minimal possible s.\n\nOnce we have this s_min, then compute the maximum number of pairs that can have sum > s_min. Then, the worst possible rank is count_max + 1.\n\nBut how to handle the case where multiple pairs can have sum equal to s_min. For example, if s_min is 5, and there are several pairs with sum 5. But in the worst case scenario, the jury can arrange that those pairs are placed after Vasya, so the count_max would be the number of pairs with sum >s_min, and the rank is count_max +1.\n\nSo, the steps for the worst possible rank are:\n\nCompute s_min as the minimal possible sum >=x.\n\nCompute the maximum number of pairs (participants) that can have sum >s_min. Let this be 'count'.\n\nThe worst rank is count + 1.\n\nNow, putting all this into code.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen read the list a and list b.\n\nSort a and sort b.\n\nThen, find the minimal s_min as described.\n\nOnce we have s_min, then compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min using the two-pointer approach.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n, x.\n\na = list of integers from input.\n\nb = list of integers from input.\n\nSort a.\n\nSort b.\n\nCompute s_min.\n\nThen compute the count_max for sum >s_min.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplementing the computation of s_min.\n\nFor that, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j >= (x - a_i). How to do that?\n\nWe can use the bisect module in Python. For example, for each a_i, compute target = x - a_i. Then, use bisect_left on the sorted b array to find the first index where b[j] >= target. If such index exists (i.e., if index is within the array), then take b[j] and add to a_i. Then track the minimal sum.\n\nBut since the array is sorted, we can do this for all a_i.\n\nBut for n up to 1e5, this would be O(n log n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce we have s_min, then compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min.\n\nImplementing the two-pointer approach:\n\nInitialize i = 0 (start of a), j = n-1 (end of b), count =0.\n\nWhile i < n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] > s_min:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1\n\nSo, this is O(n) time.\n\nBut wait, let me test this with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5 2\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\ns_min is 2. Because for each a_i=1, target is 2 -1 =1. So the first b_j >=1 is index 0. So sum is 1+1=2.\n\nSo s_min is 2.\n\nThen compute the maximum number of pairs with sum>2. Since all sums are 2, which is not >2. So count is 0. Thus, worst rank is 0+1=1? But the sample output says 5. Wait, this contradicts.\n\nWait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait in the first sample input, the output is 1 5. So the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nBut according to this approach, the count is 0. So the worst rank is 0+1=1. Which is wrong.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh right, because in the worst case scenario, the s_min is 2. But for the worst case, we need to arrange the pairing such that Vasya's sum is s_min (2), and as many other participants as possible have sum greater than s_min (which is 2). However, in this case, all possible pairings have sum exactly 2. So, the maximum number of pairs with sum >2 is zero. So the worst possible rank is 0 +1=1. But according to the sample, the worst possible rank is 5. So clearly, there's a mistake in this reasoning.\n\nWait, this indicates that my approach is incorrect. What's wrong here?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nThe problem is that the worst possible rank depends on how many participants have a total higher than Vasya's. But when all participants have the same sum as Vasya's, then the worst possible rank is n (the total number of participants). Because the jury can arrange them in any order, so Vasya can be placed last.\n\nBut according to my previous approach, the count_max is the number of participants with sum >s_min. Which is zero. So the worst rank is 0+1=1. Which is wrong.\n\nAh, here's the error. The count_max is the number of participants that have sum >s_min. But the worst possible rank is count_max + 1 + number_of_participants_with_sum_equal_to_s_min ?\n\nNo, no. Because the participants with sum equal to s_min can be placed either before or after Vasya. In the worst case, they are placed after him. So the worst possible rank is count_max + 1.\n\nBut in the first sample input, all participants have sum equal to 2. So count_max is zero. So the worst possible rank is 0 +1 = 1. But the sample says 5. So clearly, this approach is wrong.\n\nSo what's wrong with the logic here?\n\nAh! The mistake is in the assumption that the worst possible rank is count_max + 1, where count_max is the number of participants with sum >s_min. But in reality, the worst possible rank is count_max + 1, but only if the other participants have sum equal to s_min. Because in that case, the jury can arrange them after Vasya.\n\nBut in the case where all participants have sum equal to s_min, then the count_max is zero, and the worst possible rank is n (because there are n participants with sum equal to s_min, and Vasya can be placed last).\n\nBut according to the previous approach, the worst rank would be 0 +1 =1, which is wrong.\n\nSo the previous approach is incorrect. So what's the correct way to compute the worst possible rank?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn the worst case scenario, Vasya's sum is s_min. We need to find how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than s_min. Let's call that number 'cnt_gt'. Also, the number of participants that have sum equal to s_min is 'cnt_eq'.\n\nIn the worst case, all participants with sum > s_min are placed before Vasya, and all participants with sum == s_min are placed after him. So the worst possible rank is cnt_gt + 1.\n\nBut in the first sample input, cnt_gt is 0, cnt_eq is 5. So the worst possible rank is 0+1=1? Which contradicts the sample output of 5.\n\nWait, this suggests that the previous reasoning is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, in the first case, all participants have sum 2. So Vasya can be placed last (rank 5). So the worst possible rank is 5. But according to cnt_gt +1 = 0+1=1. Which is wrong.\n\nSo there's a fundamental flaw in the logic here.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the total results' table sorts participants by the sum of points. If two or more participants have the same sum, it's up to the jury to assign places according to their choice.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank for Vasya is when the jury assigns as many participants as possible to be ranked higher than him, and the rest (including those with equal sums) are ranked lower.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, if there are k participants with sum >s_min, then Vasya can be placed after all of them. The participants with sum ==s_min can be placed either before or after him. But in the worst case, they are placed after him. So the worst possible rank is k+1.\n\nBut in the first sample input, k=0. So the rank is 0+1=1. But the sample says 5. So why is this discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because the problem says that Vasya is one of the participants. So, when calculating the number of participants with sum >s_min, we must exclude Vasya himself.\n\nWait, that's a key point. Because in the worst case, when we compute the number of participants with sum >s_min, it's the number of other participants, not including Vasya. Because Vasya's sum is s_min.\n\nSo, the total number of participants is n. The number of participants with sum >s_min is cnt_gt. The number of participants with sum ==s_min is cnt_eq. But since Vasya is one of them, the number of participants with sum ==s_min is cnt_eq_total, which includes Vasya.\n\nSo, the worst possible rank is cnt_gt + 1. Because in this case, all participants with sum >s_min are ranked above Vasya, and the participants with sum ==s_min can be placed after him. So, the worst possible rank is cnt_gt + 1. However, in the first sample input, the cnt_gt is zero, so the worst rank is 1. But the sample says 5. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me think about the first sample input:\n\nAll participants have sum 2. So s_min is 2. Now, how many participants have sum >2? Zero. So cnt_gt is zero. So the worst possible rank is zero +1 = 1. But according to the sample explanation, the worst possible rank is 5. This indicates that there's a misunderstanding in the way we're counting.\n\nAh! Here's the mistake. The cnt_gt is not the number of participants with sum >s_min, but the number of participants that can have sum >s_min in the pairing. However, in the worst case scenario, the pairing is chosen to maximize the number of participants with sum >s_min. But when all possible pairings have sum equal to s_min, then cnt_gt is zero, and the worst possible rank is 1. But according to the sample explanation, it's 5.\n\nThis indicates that the approach is completely wrong. So what is the correct way to model the worst possible rank?\n\nLet me think differently. The worst possible rank occurs when Vasya's sum is as low as possible (s_min), and the number of participants with sum strictly greater than s_min is as large as possible.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s_min, given that the pairing of a and b is arbitrary.\n\nWait,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves efficiently calculating these ranks using sorting and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: The best possible rank Vasya can achieve is always 1. This is because we can always pair Vasya's scores such that his total is the maximum possible sum of any participant's scores from both tours.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To determine the worst possible rank, we need to:\n   - Find the minimum possible sum (s_min) that Vasya can achieve which is at least the given minimum points x.\n   - Calculate how many participants can have a total score greater than s_min.

For the worst case, Vasya's total is s_min. The number of participants that can have sum strictly greater than s_min is count_gt. The number of participants that have sum equal to s_min is count_eq. Since Vasya is one of them, the worst possible rank is count_gt + 1. However, in the first sample, count_gt is zero, so the rank is 1, but the correct answer is 5. This suggests that the count_gt is not computed correctly.\n    \n    # Let's re-examine the calculation of count_gt.\n    # In the first sample, all pairs sum to 2. So for s_min = 2, the count_gt should be zero. Hence, the worst rank is 0 + 1 = 1. But sample says 5. So the previous logic is incorrect.\n    \n    # The correct way to find the worst rank is to consider that when Vasya's sum is s_min, the number of participants that can have sum >= s_min is the total number of participants, because all have sum equal to s_min. So in this case, the worst possible rank is n.\n    \n    # Therefore, the previous approach is missing something. We need to calculate the number of participants that can have sum greater than or equal to s_min, and then subtract the ones that are strictly greater.\n    \n    # Alternative approach:\n    # The worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum > s_min + 1.\n    # However, in the first sample, this would be 0 + 1 = 1, which is wrong.\n    # So why is the sample answer 5?\n    \n    # Because when all participants have the same sum, the worst possible rank is n. Hence, the formula must be:\n    # worst_rank = count_gt + 1 if count_gt < n, else n.\n    # But how to adjust for this?\n    \n    # Perhaps the correct way is to calculate how many participants can have sum >= s_min. Let's say total_ge = number of participants with sum >= s_min. Then, the worst possible rank is total_ge.\n    \n    # But how to calculate total_ge?\n    \n    # To find total_ge, we can use the two-pointer approach again, but for sum >= s_min.\n    # Let's try that.\n    \n    # So for the worst rank:\n    # We need to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= s_min. Then, the worst rank is that number.\n    \n    # But this is not correct either.\n    \n    # Given the time constraints, I'll refer to the correct approach based on the sample.\n    \n    # After checking, the correct way to compute the worst possible rank is:\n    # The worst possible rank is the number of participants who can have a sum greater than or equal to s_min, but this is not directly applicable.\n    \n    # Another idea: When Vasya's sum is s_min, the worst possible rank is the number of participants that can have sum > s_min plus 1. However, in cases where all participants have sum equal to s_min, this would be 0+1=1, but the actual worst rank is n. Hence, this suggests that the count_gt is not being calculated correctly.\n    \n    # Let's re-calculate count_gt properly.\n    # In the first sample, s_min is 2. We want to find the maximum number of pairs with sum > 2. But since all sums are 2, count_gt is 0. So the worst rank is 0+1=1, but the sample says 5. This indicates that the entire approach is wrong.\n    \n    # Alternative approach:\n    # The worst possible rank is determined by the number of participants that can have a sum higher than Vasya's sum. But Vasya's sum is s_min, which is the minimal possible sum >=x. However, in the worst scenario, the other participants can be paired in a way that maximizes the number of participants with sum greater than s_min.\n    \n    # However, in the first sample, there is no such participant, so the worst rank is 1, but the sample says 5. This suggests that the initial understanding of the problem is incorrect.\n    \n    # Re-reading the problem statement:\n    # The problem states that the total results' table sorts participants by the sum of points. If two or more participants have the same sum, it's up to the jury to assign places according to their choice.\n    \n    # In the first sample, all participants have sum 2. So the jury can assign Vasya the last place, hence rank 5. This means that the worst possible rank is the number of participants, which is n.\n    \n    # So the previous approach is incorrect. The correct way to calculate the worst possible rank is:\n    # If all participants can have sum equal to s_min, then the worst possible rank is n.\n    # Otherwise, it's count_gt + 1.\n    \n    # How to determine whether all participants can have sum equal to s_min?\n    \n    # It's impossible to check this directly. Hence, the correct approach is to calculate the number of participants that can have sum greater than s_min, and then the worst rank is count_gt + 1, but if all participants can have sum equal to s_min, then the worst rank is n.\n    \n    # But how to determine this?\n    \n    # This is getting too complex. Let's look at the sample input again:\n    \n    # Sample Input 1:\n    # n=5, x=2\n    # a = [1,1,1,1,1]\n    # b = [1,1,1,1,1]\n    # s_min is 2.\n    # All possible pairs have sum 2.\n    # Hence, the worst rank is 5.\n    \n    # So, the correct formula for the worst rank is:\n    # worst_rank = count_gt + 1 + (number of participants with sum == s_min - 1)\n    # No, that doesn't make sense.\n    \n    # Another idea: The worst possible rank is the number of participants that can have sum >= s_min, but since Vasya is one of them, the worst rank is the number of participants with sum >= s_min.\n    \n    # In the first sample, this would be 5, which matches the sample.\n    \n    # To calculate the number of participants that can have sum >= s_min, we can use a similar two-pointer approach.\n    \n    # Let's modify the code to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= s_min. Then, the worst possible rank is that number.\n    \n    # However, this would give the worst rank as the number of participants that can have sum >= s_min, which in the first sample is 5.\n    \n    # So, how to compute this?\n    \n    # Modify the two-pointer approach to count the number of pairs with sum >= s_min.\n    \n    # Let's implement this.\n    \n    # Compute count_ge (number of pairs with sum >= s_min)\n    count_ge = 0\n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        if a[i] + b[j] >= min_s:\n            count_ge += 1\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    # Now, the worst rank is count_ge.\n    # But in the first sample, count_ge is 5, which matches the sample.\n    \n    # Let's test this with the second sample:\n    \n    # Sample Input 2:\n    # n=6, x=7\n    # a = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n    # b = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n    # After sorting:\n    # a = [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n    # b = [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n    # s_min is the minimal sum >=7. Let's see:\n    # For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=7.\n    # For example, a_i=3: target is 7-3=4. The smallest b_j >=4 is 4 (index 2). Sum is 3+4=7.\n    # a_i=4: target is 3. b_j >=3 is index 1 (3). sum 4+3=7.\n    # a_i=4: target is 3, same as above.\n    # etc. So s_min is 7.\n    # Then count_ge is the number of pairs with sum >=7.\n    # Using the two-pointer approach:\n    # i=0 (a[0]=3), j=5 (b[5]=8). 3+8=11 >=7 → count_ge=1. i=1, j=4.\n    # a[1]=4, b[4]=6 → 10 >=7 → count_ge=2. i=2, j=3.\n    # a[2]=4, b[3]=4 → 8 >=7 → count_ge=3. i=3, j=2.\n    # a[3]=4, b[2]=4 → 8 >=7 → count_ge=4. i=4, j=1.\n    # a[4]=5, b[1]=3 → 8 >=7 → count_ge=5. i=5, j=0.\n    # a[5]=6, b[0]=0 → 6+0=6 <7 → i=6, loop ends.\n    # count_ge=5. Hence, worst rank is 5, which matches the sample output.\n    \n    # So this approach seems correct.\n    \n    # Hence, the correct way to compute the worst possible rank is to find the maximum number of pairs with sum >= s_min, and the worst possible rank is that count_ge.\n    \n    # But wait, in the first sample, count_ge is 5, which is the correct worst rank.\n    \n    # So the previous approach was incorrect, and the correct approach is to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= s_min, which gives the worst possible rank.\n    \n    # Therefore, the code needs to be modified to compute count_ge instead of count_gt.\n    \n    # Let's update the code accordingly.\n    \n    # Recompute count_ge:\n    count_ge = 0\n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        if a[i] + b[j] >= min_s:\n            count_ge += 1\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    # The worst possible rank is count_ge.\n    \n    # But in the first sample, count_ge is 5, which is correct.\n    # In the second sample, count_ge is 5, which is correct.\n    \n    # So, the final answer is best_rank = 1, worst_rank = count_ge.\n    \n    print(\"1\", count_ge)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
