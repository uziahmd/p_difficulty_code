On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray of the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nSo the key is to figure out which subarray to reverse so that when you reverse it, the overall longest non-decreasing subsequence is as long as possible. But how do I approach this efficiently?\n\nFirst, let me think about the original array. The maximum possible length without any reversal would be the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence. But by reversing a subarray, maybe we can make more of the array non-decreasing.\n\nBut considering all possible subarrays to reverse is O(n²) possibilities, and for each of them, computing the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) would be O(n²) time. For n up to 2000, that would be O(n^4), which is way too slow. So this brute-force approach isn't feasible.\n\nI need a smarter way. Let's think about the structure of the problem. Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, maybe there's a way to model the optimal reversal based on the counts and positions of 1s and 2s.\n\nWait, the longest non-decreasing subsequence for a sequence of 1s and 2s is just the count of 1s plus the count of 2s if they are in order. But since the array can be modified by reversing a subarray, perhaps the optimal way is to maximize the number of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nAlternatively, think of the original array. Let's say there are some transitions from 1 to 2 and from 2 to 1. Reversing a subarray that contains such transitions might help to reduce the number of transitions, thereby increasing the LNDS.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input: [1, 2, 1, 2]. The original LNDS is 2 (like 1,2 or 1,2). But reversing [2,3] gives [1,1,2,2], which has LNDS of 4.\n\nSo the idea is to find a segment where reversing it will merge some 1s and 2s into a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the optimal reversal. The best scenario is that after reversing, the entire array is non-decreasing. But that's not always possible. However, even if not, we can try to find the best possible way.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the array. Since the elements are 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. Wait, no. Actually, the LNDS is simply the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are in non-decreasing order. But since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 is followed by a 1. Because each such inversion (a 2 followed by a 1) breaks the non-decreasing sequence. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS for the original array can be found by counting the number of 1s and the number of 2s. Wait, no. Because if the array is like 1,2,1,2, then the LNDS is 2. But the total number of 1s is 2 and 2s is 2. So that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, but for a sequence of 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of \"drops\" (places where a 2 is followed by a 1). Because each drop represents a place where the sequence can't be extended. But I'm not sure. For example, in the array [1,2,1,2], there are two drops (2→1 and 2→1). The LNDS is 2. But the total elements are 4. 4 - 2 = 2. That matches. Another example: [1,1,2,2]. No drops. LNDS is 4. Which is 4-0=4. So maybe that formula holds. Then, if we can find a reversal that reduces the number of drops, that would increase the LNDS.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a reversal that minimizes the number of drops. Because each drop reduces the LNDS by 1. So the maximum LNDS is (n - number_of_drops_after_reversal).\n\nBut how does reversing a subarray affect the number of drops?\n\nLet me think.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray of the given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that the LNDS for a sequence of 1s and 2s can be maximized by minimizing the number of \"drops\" (i.e., positions where a 2 is immediately followed by a 1).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Drops**: Calculate the initial number of drops in the original sequence.\n2. **Evaluate Reversals**: For each possible subarray reversal, compute how many drops are introduced or removed by that reversal.\n3. **Optimize Reversal**: Determine the optimal subarray reversal that minimizes the total number of drops, thereby maximizing the LNDS.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    def count_drops(arr):\n        drops = 0\n        for i in range(len(arr) - 1):\n            if arr[i] == 2 and arr[i+1] == 1:\n                drops += 1\n        return drops\n    \n    original_drops = count_drops(a)\n    max_lnds = n - original_drops\n    \n    # Try all possible intervals [l, r]\n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Reverse the subarray a[l..r]\n            new_a = a[:l] + a[l:r+1][::-1] + a[r+1:]\n            current_drops = count_drops(new_a)\n            current_lnds = n - current_drops\n            if current_lnds > max_lnds:\n                max_lnds = current_lnds\n    print(max_lnds)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Count Drops**: The function `count_drops` iterates through the array to count the number of positions where a 2 is immediately followed by a 1.\n2. **Original Drops**: Calculate the initial number of drops in the original array.\n3. **Evaluate Reversals**: For each possible subarray `[l, r]`, reverse it and count the drops in the modified array. This helps determine the effect of the reversal on the number of drops.\n4. **Maximize LNDS**: By minimizing the number of drops through optimal reversal, the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is maximized.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible subarray reversals efficiently, leveraging the fact that the elements are only 1s and 2s, allowing us to focus on minimizing transitions from 2 to 1.",
