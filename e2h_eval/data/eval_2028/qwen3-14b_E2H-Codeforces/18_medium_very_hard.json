The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about a frog jumping on a number line, and we need to compute the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m, where f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what f(x) represents. The frog starts at 0. It can jump forward by a or backward by b. But it can't go below 0 or above x. So for each x, we need to find all positions reachable under these constraints.\n\nBut since m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute this for each x individually. We need a mathematical approach here.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Let's consider the general case where the frog can move in both directions. However, the movement is constrained by the boundaries. But maybe there's a pattern here based on some mathematical properties.\n\nLet's think about the possible positions. Suppose that the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo d, where d is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Wait, but since the frog can only add a or subtract b, perhaps the reachable positions are those that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b. But since the frog starts at 0, the positions must be in the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. However, considering that the frog can't go beyond x or below 0.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find the set of positions that can be reached given that the frog can move freely (without considering the boundaries) and then see how the boundaries affect this.\n\nWait, but the frog can only move forward by a or backward by b. So, the movement is not symmetric. For example, if the frog jumps forward a steps, it can reach a, then from there, it can jump again forward to 2a, etc. But to go back, it needs to subtract b. So the positions that can be reached are those that are in the form of (some multiple of a) minus (some multiple of b), but also ensuring that during the process, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut considering that the frog can jump multiple times, maybe the positions that can be reached are all numbers that are congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b). Because the steps are adding a and subtracting b. So the total displacement is a*k - b*l. The set of all such numbers is the multiples of d, where d = gcd(a, b). \n\nSo, for the frog to reach a position k, it's necessary that k is a multiple of d. But even that may not be sufficient, because the frog might not be able to reach it due to the constraints of the boundaries. But when x is large enough, maybe all multiples of d within [0, x] can be reached.\n\nWait, but the frog starts at 0, which is a multiple of d. Then, for example, if a and b are coprime, then any integer can be reached if there's no boundary constraints. But with boundaries, it's different.\n\nBut how do we model the reachable positions?\n\nLet me think of the case where the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, provided that it can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. Wait, but that's not exactly right. Because the frog can make multiple jumps. For example, if the frog jumps forward a, then jumps backward b, then it can reach a - b. But this requires that during the movement, the frog doesn't go below 0 or above x.\n\nBut perhaps the main idea is that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, provided that it can be written as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. However, this seems similar to the coin problem, where you can make change with coins of denominations a and b. But in that case, the largest unattainable number is ab - a - b when a and b are coprime. However, this is for non-negative combinations. But here, the frog can also subtract b steps, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, and is >=0, and can be written as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. But again, this is not directly applicable because the frog can go back and forth.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to find the minimal set of positions that can be reached, considering that the frog can move forward and backward. For example, if the frog can reach some position k, then from there, it can jump forward to k + a, or backward to k - b, provided that those positions are within [0, x]. \n\nBut for large x, perhaps the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d, provided that they are in the range [0, x], and that they are greater than or equal to some value. For example, if a and b are coprime, then once x is sufficiently large, the frog can reach all positions from 0 upwards. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem can be divided into two cases: when a and b are coprime, and when they are not. But I'm not sure yet.\n\nLet me look at the sample input. For example, the first sample input is m=7, a=5, b=3. The output is 19. According to the note, f(5) is 3. Let's see:\n\nAt x=5, the frog can reach positions 0, 5 (by jumping forward once), and 5-3=2 (by jumping forward once and then back once). Also, can it reach 2 +5=7? No, because x=5. So the positions are 0, 2, 5. Hence f(5)=3. Similarly for x=7, the frog can reach more positions.\n\nBut what's the pattern here?\n\nAnother sample is when a=1 and b=2019. The note says that f(i)=i+1. Which implies that the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. How is that possible? Well, since a=1, the frog can jump forward by 1 each time. So even if b is large, the frog can reach every position by just jumping forward. Because when the frog is at position k, it can jump to k+1. Since the frog can't go beyond x, but since a=1, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x by moving forward. So for any x, the number of positions is x+1. Hence the sum from 0 to m is sum_{i=0}^m (i+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2. Which matches the second sample input.\n\nIn the third sample, a=100000, b=1. The frog can't make any jumps. Because to jump forward, it would go to 100000, but since m is 100, which is less than 100000. So for any x up to 100, the frog can't make any jumps. Hence f(x) is 1 for all x, so the sum is 101.\n\nSo the key seems to be whether the frog can reach positions beyond 0. If a is larger than x, then the frog can't jump forward. Similarly, if b is larger than x, then the frog can't jump backward. But in the case where a=1, the frog can always jump forward, so it can reach all positions.\n\nSo the problem depends on whether the frog can reach positions beyond 0, and how that affects the reachable positions.\n\nLet me think of the general case. Let's assume that d = gcd(a, b). Then, all reachable positions must be multiples of d. So the first step is to check if the frog can reach any positions other than 0. If not, then f(x) is 1 for all x. Otherwise, for x large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut how to determine for each x, how many multiples of d are reachable.\n\nBut perhaps the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >= some value, and <=x. But what is that value?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two parts:\n\n1. Determine if the frog can reach positions beyond 0. This depends on whether the frog can make a forward jump (i.e., a <= x) or whether it can make a backward jump (but that would require being at a position >=b, which may not be possible initially).\n\nWait, the frog starts at 0. To make a backward jump (k -b), the frog would have to be at position >=b. But initially, the frog is at 0, which is less than b. So the first jump can't be backward. So the first possible jumps are forward by a. So if a is larger than x, then the frog can't make any forward jumps, and thus can't reach any other positions. Hence, f(x) is 1.\n\nSo for x < a, the frog can't make any forward jumps. So the only position is 0. Hence f(x) is 1. For x >=a, the frog can jump to a. Then, from a, it can jump forward again to a+a, or backward to a -b, if that's >=0. So if a >=b, then a -b is non-negative. So the frog can reach a -b.\n\nBut this seems complicated. How can we model this for arbitrary x?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b, but with certain constraints. However, since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps the problem reduces to the following:\n\nIf the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is in [0, x], and is >= some lower bound. But how to find that lower bound?\n\nAnother thought: Since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps once it can reach some position, it can reach all positions beyond that that are multiples of d. For example, if the frog can reach position k, then by adding a steps multiple times, it can reach k + n*a for any n >=0. However, this depends on whether the frog can reach k + n*a without going beyond x.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's think of the problem in terms of BFS. For small x, we can model the reachable positions, but for large x (up to 1e9), we need an efficient way to compute f(x).\n\nBut given that m is up to 1e9, and a and b are up to 1e5, we need an O(1) or O(a + b) solution per test case.\n\nLet me think again about the problem. The key is to find for each x, the number of positions reachable, considering that the frog can't go beyond [0, x]. But how?\n\nLet me think of the case where the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x], provided that x is large enough. Let's suppose that once the frog can reach some position, it can reach all higher multiples of d. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows:\n\nThe frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d. Let's say that the frog can reach any such position that is >= L, where L is some minimal value. Then, for x >= L, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1 (if x is large enough). But how to find L?\n\nBut what determines L? Well, the minimal position that the frog can reach beyond 0. For example, if a and b are coprime, then the minimal positive position is a. But with the possibility of moving backward, perhaps the frog can reach positions like a - b, but only if that is non-negative.\n\nBut this seems tricky. Let's take an example. Let's say a=5, b=3, d=1. Then the frog can reach any integer. But in the first sample, for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. How does that fit? Because 0+5=5, then from 5, subtract 3 to get 2. But 2 is less than 5, so it's allowed. Then from 2, can the frog jump forward again to 2+5=7, but that's beyond x=5, so not allowed. So for x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. But if x were larger, say 7, then from 2, the frog can jump forward to 7 (which is allowed) and then from 7, subtract 3 to get 4, then again subtract 3 to get 1, etc. So for x=7, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6 (from 7-3=4, 4+5=9 which is over x=7, but from 4 you can subtract 3 to get 1, then add 5 to get 6, etc.)\n\nBut this seems complicated. How can we model this for general a and b?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is >= (some value) and <=x. Let's find that value.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and that can be written as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. However, since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps the problem is more complex. But perhaps the minimal value that the frog can reach beyond 0 is a - k*b, but this has to be non-negative.\n\nBut this seems like the classic problem of finding the minimal positive integer that can be formed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. However, this is known as the Frobenius problem, but it's only solvable for two numbers when they are coprime. The Frobenius number is ab - a - b. But this is the largest number that cannot be formed. However, in our case, the frog can also subtract steps, which allows for more possibilities.\n\nWait, but the frog's movement is not limited to adding steps. For example, the frog can reach a - b, but that requires that a >= b. So perhaps the reachable positions are all multiples of d, and once the frog can reach some position, it can reach all positions beyond that by adding multiples of a or subtracting multiples of b. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: Once the frog can reach some position k, then it can reach k + n*a for any n >=0, as long as k +n*a <=x. Similarly, from k, it can reach k - m*b for any m >=0, as long as k -m*b >=0. But how to model this for the entire set.\n\nThis seems too vague. Let's think of the problem in terms of the reachable positions when there are no boundaries (i.e., x is very large). In that case, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d. Because, for example, if we can express the position as a linear combination of a and b. However, since the frog can move forward and backward, the question is whether the frog can reach any multiple of d. For example, if d divides k, then there exist integers x and y such that xa - yb = k. But since the frog can make multiple forward and backward jumps, perhaps any multiple of d can be reached. However, this is not necessarily true, because the frog can't use negative steps. Wait, no. The frog can make multiple steps. For example, to reach k, the frog can start at 0, then jump forward a steps multiple times, then jump backward b steps multiple times. So the problem becomes whether the frog can reach any multiple of d, given that the steps are allowed to be in either direction, but the path must not go out of [0, x].\n\nBut when x is large enough, the frog can reach any multiple of d. For example, if x is large enough, then the frog can reach any multiple of d between 0 and x. So the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to determine when x is large enough?\n\nBut this depends on the values of a and b. For example, if a and b are coprime, then once x is large enough, the frog can reach any multiple of 1 (i.e., any integer). So for x >= some value, f(x) = x + 1. However, for smaller x, it may not be possible.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each x, f(x) is equal to the number of multiples of d in [0, x] that can be reached by the frog. But how to compute this?\n\nLet me think again. Let's define d = gcd(a, b). Let's divide a and b by d. Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, a' and b' are coprime. So the problem reduces to the case where a and b are coprime. Because any position reachable with original a and b is a multiple of d, and vice versa.\n\nSo, now we can assume that a and b are coprime. Let's proceed under that assumption. If not, we can divide them by their gcd.\n\nSo, assuming a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of d (which is 1 in this case), so any integer. But how?\n\nWait, no. The frog can reach any integer that is a linear combination of a and b, but with the steps allowed. But since the frog can move forward and backward, it can reach any integer. But this is only possible if the frog can reach that integer through some sequence of steps, without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut for x being large enough, the frog can reach any integer in [0, x]. So for example, when x is large enough, the frog can reach all integers. Thus, for x >= some value, f(x) = x + 1. But what is that value?\n\nBut according to the first sample, when a=5, b=3 (coprime), for x=5, f(x)=3. Which is not x+1. So clearly, there's a threshold beyond which f(x) becomes x+1.\n\nSo the key is to find for each x, the minimal value such that all positions from that value up to x are reachable. Once that is found, the count is the number of reachable positions up to that value, plus the count from that value to x.\n\nBut how to find this minimal value?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: The frog can reach any integer that is >= (a - b) and can be expressed as a combination of a and b. But again, not sure.\n\nLet me think of the case where a and b are coprime. For example, a=5, b=3. What is the minimal x where f(x) = x + 1?\n\nIn the first sample, when x=7, f(7)=8. Which is 7+1=8. So for x=7, it's achieved. But for x=6, the sample says f(6)=3, which is less than 6+1=7. So the threshold is somewhere around x=7.\n\nWhat's the condition for the frog to be able to reach all positions up to x?\n\nPerhaps the threshold is when x >= a + b. Or something like that. Let's think of the classic Frobenius problem. For two coprime numbers a and b, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients is ab -a -b. But in our problem, the frog can move forward and backward, so it's different. For example, if the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k + a, k - b, etc. So even if k is not reachable via non-negative coefficients, it can be reached via a combination of steps.\n\nBut perhaps when x is large enough, the frog can reach any position in [0, x]. Let me think of the example where a=5 and b=3. For x=7, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. Wait, how?\n\nWait, starting from 0:\n\nJump to 5 (forward). From 5, subtract 3 to get 2. From 2, add 5 to get 7. From 7, subtract 3 to get 4. From 4, subtract 3 to get 1. From 1, add 5 to get 6. From 6, subtract 3 to get 3. So yes, all positions from 0 to 7 are reachable. So f(7)=8=7+1. Hence, for x >=7, the frog can reach all positions. So the threshold here is x >= (a + b - 1) ?\n\nWait, a=5, b=3. a + b -1 = 7. Which matches the example. So maybe the threshold is when x >= a + b -1. Then, for x >= that, f(x) = x+1. But why?\n\nIn the general case, when a and b are coprime, the threshold is x >= a + b -1. Because once the frog can reach all positions from a + b -1 onwards, then for any x >= that, it can reach all positions up to x. But how to confirm this?\n\nAlternatively, the threshold could be when x is large enough that the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. For example, when x is at least (a -1) + (b -1), which is a + b - 2. But in our example, a=5, b=3, a +b -2 = 6. But for x=6, the sample says f(6) is 3. Which is not equal to 6+1. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the threshold is when x is larger than or equal to (a * b). But for a=5, b=3, that's 15. But in the example, x=7 already allows all positions. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the threshold is when x is larger than or equal to max(a, b). But for x=5 (a=5), the sample shows that f(5) is 3, which is not 5+1=6.\n\nSo this approach isn't working. Let's think differently.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: Once the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k + a, k + 2a, etc., as long as they are within x. Similarly, it can reach k -b, k - 2b, etc., as long as they are within 0. So for example, if the frog can reach a position that is in the interval [b, x], then it can reach that position minus b, and so on. Hence, if the frog can reach some position in [b, x], it can generate positions down to 0 by subtracting b steps. But this depends on the position.\n\nAlternatively, if the frog can reach a position that is in [0, x], and it is possible to reach all positions from that position down to zero by subtracting b steps, then all positions from 0 up to that position are reachable. But this is only possible if the position is a multiple of b. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where nodes are positions and edges are jumps. The frog can reach any node that is reachable from 0 via these edges, without leaving [0, x]. For large x, the graph is connected in the sense that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d. But how to find the minimal x where this is true.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. The frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d. For the case where a and b are coprime (d=1), the frog can reach any integer. However, the ability to reach all integers depends on the ability to reach positions that allow the frog to generate all numbers through forward and backward jumps.\n\nBut how to determine for a given x whether the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that once the frog can reach a position that is greater than or equal to b, then from there, the frog can subtract b steps to reach lower positions. So for example, if the frog reaches a position >=b, then it can subtract b to get a new position, and so on. So if the frog can reach a position that is in the range [b, x], then it can generate positions down to 0. Hence, if the frog can reach any position >=b, then it can reach all positions from 0 up to that position. But how to ensure that.\n\nBut for this to work, the frog must be able to reach a position that is at least b. For example, if the frog can reach a position >=b, then subtracting b steps multiple times can reach positions down to 0. But how to ensure that the frog can reach such a position.\n\nSo the key is to determine whether the frog can reach a position >=b. Once that is possible, then for x >= that position, the frog can reach all positions from 0 up to x.\n\nSo let's think about this. For the frog to reach a position >=b, it needs to have made some forward jumps. Since the frog starts at 0, the first forward jump is to a. If a >=b, then the frog can reach a >=b, and thus can subtract b steps to reach a -b, etc. However, if a < b, then the frog needs to make multiple forward jumps to reach a position >=b.\n\nFor example, a=5, b=3: a >=b, so the frog can reach 5 >=3. Then subtract 3 to reach 2, and so on.\n\nAnother example: a=2, b=3. Then, the frog starts at 0, jumps forward to 2. Since 2 <3, it can't subtract b. So it jumps forward again to 4, which is >=3. Then subtract 3 to reach 1. From 1, can't subtract 3. Jump forward to 3 (1+2=3), which is >=3. Subtract 3 to reach 0. So in this case, the frog can reach positions 0, 2, 4, 1, 3, etc. So for x >=3, the frog can reach all positions up to x?\n\nWait, let's see for x=4. Positions reachable are 0, 2, 4, 1 (from 4-3). Then from 1, adding 2 gives 3. So 3 is reachable. So for x=4, the positions are 0,1,2,3,4. So f(4)=5=4+1. So yes, for x >=3, the frog can reach all positions.\n\nSo the threshold here is when the frog can reach a position >=b. Which for a=2, b=3, the frog can reach 4 (which is >=3) after two forward jumps. So once x is >=4, the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where the frog can reach a position >=b. Let's think:\n\nThe frog can reach positions by adding a steps. So the minimal number of forward jumps needed to reach a position >=b is ceil(b /a). But since the frog can also combine forward and backward jumps, perhaps there's a better way. However, initially, the frog can't do any backward jumps until it has made some forward jumps.\n\nSo the minimal position that the frog can reach that is >=b is the minimal k*a where k*a >=b. Let's call this value s = ceil(b/a) *a. But if a >=b, then s =a.\n\nOnce the frog can reach s, then it can subtract b steps to reach s -b, then s - 2b, etc., down to 0. But this requires that s -b >=0.\n\nSo once the frog can reach s, which is >=b, then for any x >=s, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nIn the example where a=2, b=3. s=ceil(3/2)*2 = 2*2=4. Which is >=3. Then, for x >=4, the frog can reach all positions.\n\nSimilarly, in the first example, a=5, b=3. s=5, which is >=3. So for x >=5, the frog can reach all positions. However, the sample says that for x=5, f(5)=3, which is not 5+1=6. So this suggests that my reasoning is incorrect.\n\nWait, what's wrong here? Because for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. But according to this reasoning, once the frog can reach s=5 (>=b=3), then for x >=5, the frog can reach all positions up to x. But in reality, for x=5, the frog can't reach 1, 3, 4. So why is that?\n\nAh, because the reasoning assumes that once you can reach s, you can subtract b steps to reach positions down to 0. However, that requires that s -b is reachable, and then subtracting again, etc. But for s=5, subtracting 3 gives 2. Then, from 2, you can't subtract 3 (since 2-3=-1 <0). So you can't reach 2 -3 =-1. So the frog can't reach 2 -3. But how can the frog reach positions below 2?\n\nWait, but from 2, the frog can add a steps. For example, 2 +5=7. But if x is 5, then that's not allowed. So for x=5, the frog can't reach positions beyond 5. So the frog is stuck at 0, 2, 5. But for x=7, the frog can reach 7, then subtract 3 to get 4, then subtract 3 again to get 1. Then from 1, add 5 to get 6, and so on. So for x=7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7.\n\nSo the threshold is not when the frog can reach s >=b, but when the frog can reach a position such that s -k*b >=0 for some k, allowing the frog to reach positions down to zero. However, this depends on the ability to reach positions that are in the range [b, x], and then subtract b steps.\n\nSo perhaps the correct threshold is when x is >= (a + b - gcd(a, b)) ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the threshold is when x is >= (a + b). For example, in the first sample, a=5, b=3, a+b=8. For x=7, which is less than a+b, the frog can reach all positions. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. This seems really challenging. Maybe I should think about the problem differently. Let's think of the reachable positions as follows:\n\nThe frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, and is >=0 and <=x. But how to determine which of those positions are actually reachable.\n\nBut for this to be true, the frog must be able to reach all multiples of d in [0, x], but how?\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be viewed as a graph where each node is a position, and edges are jumps. The reachable positions are those that can be reached from 0 without leaving [0, x]. For large x, the graph is connected in the sense that the frog can reach any multiple of d. However, for small x, it's not.\n\nBut how to find for a given x, the number of reachable positions.\n\nBut since m can be up to 1e9, we need an O(1) formula for each x. So perhaps the solution is to find for each x, whether it's large enough that the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x], and otherwise calculate it based on some precomputed values.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nLet d = gcd(a, b). Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Since a' and b' are coprime.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to the case where a and b are coprime. Because any reachable position must be a multiple of d. So, for the general case, the number of reachable positions is equal to the number of reachable positions in the a', b' problem multiplied by d.\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase: For the original problem, the reachable positions are multiples of d. So, the number of reachable positions is equal to the number of reachable positions in the problem where a' and b' are used, multiplied by d. Or perhaps, for the original problem, the number of reachable positions is equal to the number of reachable positions in the a' and b' problem, but scaled by d. Not sure.\n\nBut perhaps focusing on the case where a and b are coprime will help.\n\nAssume a and b are coprime. We need to find for each x, the number of positions in [0, x] that are reachable.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nThe frog can reach any position that is >= (some value) and <=x. For x >= this value, the count is x + 1. For x < this value, the count is something else.\n\nBut what is this value?\n\nLet me think of the following. If the frog can reach all positions from 0 up to x, then for any x >= some value, this holds. What is that value?\n\nIn the first sample, with a=5 and b=3, the threshold was x=7. Which is a + b - 1 = 5+3-1=7. And in the example with a=2, b=3, the threshold was x=3, which is a + b - 2 = 2+3-2=3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=2. Then, a + b -1 = 4. Let's see:\n\nAt x=4, can the frog reach all positions?\n\nStarting at 0:\n\nJump to 3 (a=3). From 3, subtract b=2 to get 1. From 1, add a=3 to get 4. From 4, subtract 2 to get 2. From 2, subtract 2 to get 0. So the positions are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So yes. So for x=4, which is a +b -1 = 3+2-1=4, the frog can reach all positions.\n\nAnother example: a=4, b=3. a +b -1 =6. Let's see:\n\nAt x=6, can the frog reach all positions?\n\nStart at 0. Jump to 4. From 4, subtract 3 to get 1. From 1, add 4 to get 5. From 5, subtract 3 to get 2. From 2, add 4 to get 6. From 6, subtract 3 to get 3. So positions are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Yes. So for x=6, which is a +b -1=4+3-1=6, it works.\n\nSo this seems to suggest that the threshold is x >= a + b -1. Once x is at least that, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. For x < a +b -1, the frog can't reach all positions.\n\nSo, for the general case where a and b are coprime, the number of reachable positions is:\n\nif x >= a + b -1: x + 1\n\nelse: some function that depends on x.\n\nSo, the problem now is to compute for x < a + b -1, the number of reachable positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, for x < a + b -1, the number of reachable positions can be computed using BFS or dynamic programming. However, since a and b are up to 1e5, and m can be up to 1e9, we need to find a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut given that a and b are up to 1e5, and the threshold is up to 2e5, perhaps we can precompute for all x up to a + b -1, the value of f(x), and then for x >= threshold, use the formula x + 1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCompute d = gcd(a, b)\n\nLet a' = a/d, b' = b/d.\n\nIf a' and b' are not coprime, then there's a mistake, but since we divided by d, they should be.\n\nNow, compute the threshold T = a' + b' -1.\n\nThen, for any x >= T, the number of reachable positions is x + 1.\n\nBut wait, no. Because in the original problem, the reachable positions are multiples of d. So for the general case, the number of reachable positions is the number of multiples of d in [0, x], which is floor(x/d) + 1, provided that x >= T.\n\nBut wait, earlier examples showed that when a and b are coprime, the threshold T is a +b -1. For x >= T, the frog can reach",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these values from 0 to a given integer $ m $. The solution involves understanding the reachable positions based on the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the jump lengths and leveraging mathematical properties to efficiently compute the result.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump forward by $ a $ or backward by $ b $. The reachable positions are determined by the gcd of $ a $ and $ b $, denoted as $ d $. All reachable positions must be multiples of $ d $.\n2. **Threshold Calculation**: For sufficiently large $ x $, the frog can reach all multiples of $ d $ within the interval $[0, x]$. This threshold is determined by the sum $ a + b - 1 $ when $ a $ and $ b $ are coprime.\n3. **Efficient Summation**: For values of $ x $ below the threshold, we precompute the reachable positions using BFS. For values above the threshold, we use a direct formula based on the number of multiples of $ d $ within the range.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        m = int(input[idx])\n        a = int(input[idx+1])\n        b = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        d = math.gcd(a, b)\n        a_prime = a // d\n        b_prime = b // d\n        \n        # Now a_prime and b_prime are coprime\n        if a_prime == 0 or b_prime == 0:\n            # This case shouldn't happen since a and b are positive\n            pass\n        \n        T = a_prime + b_prime -
