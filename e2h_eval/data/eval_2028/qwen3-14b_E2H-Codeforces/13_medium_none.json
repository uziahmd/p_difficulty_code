For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order. The list given is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again.\n\nEach consecutive pair is a semitone apart. So the distance between two notes is the number of steps between them in this order, moving forward. For example, C to E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, then D is 2, D# 3, E is 4). But if you go the other way, like E to C, that would be 8 semitones because you go E to F (1), F# (2), G (3), G# (4), A (5), B (6), H (7), C (8). But the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. Wait, but how do we know which is lower? Oh, the problem says that for the distance between X and Y, it's the distance along the musical scale from X to Y. So if X is lower than Y, then it's the number of semitones moving forward. But if X is higher than Y, then perhaps the distance is calculated as the number of steps when moving forward from X to Y, which would wrap around?\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement. The distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. The distance between X and Y is taken from the lowest to the highest. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Between E and C, it's 8 semitones. Because E is lower than C? No, wait, maybe the distance is always calculated as the minimal steps? No, no. The problem says that the distance is from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is positive. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance would be the number of steps when moving forward from X to Y, which would be (total steps in circle) minus the steps from Y to X. Wait, but how do we determine which is lower?\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured along the musical scale. So, for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. But the distance between E and C would be 8 semitones. Because when you go from E to C, you have to go through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the distance is always calculated as the number of steps moving forward from X to Y, regardless of whether Y is higher or lower. Wait, but how do we know which direction to take? Because if you have two notes, there are two possible directions. But according to the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So perhaps the distance is the minimal steps? No, no. The example given says that between C and E is 4 semitones. Which is correct if you move up. But between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. So the distance is calculated as the number of steps moving forward from the first note to the second. So if you have two notes, X and Y, the distance is (Y - X) mod 12, but multiplied by 1 semitone per step. Wait, but how to compute that?\n\nSo the problem defines the distance between X and Y as the number of semitones when moving from X to Y in the cyclic order. So for example, if X is C and Y is E, the distance is 4. If X is E and Y is C, then the distance is 8 (since moving forward from E to C requires going through 8 steps). So the distance is not symmetric. It's directional. So for two notes, the distance from X to Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper, but how do we know which is lower? Oh, perhaps the problem defines that when you have two notes, the distance between them is the number of semitones when you go from the first to the second in the cyclic order, regardless of which is higher. So, for example, if X is C and Y is E, the distance is 4. If X is E and Y is C, the distance is 8. So the direction matters. Therefore, the distance between X and Y is (Y's position - X's position) mod 12, but since each step is a semitone, the value is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12, but multiplied by 1 semitone. Wait, but the problem says that between consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone. So for example, the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12, multiplied by 1 semitone. But since the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest to the upper. But how does that fit with that calculation?\n\nWait, maybe the problem defines the distance between X and Y as the number of semitones when moving from X to Y in the upward direction. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is (Y - X) semitones. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) semitones. So for example, X is E (index 4?), and Y is C (index 0). Then the distance from E to C is (0 + 12 -4) = 8 semitones. So yes.\n\nSo the first thing I need to do is map each note to its index in the list. Let's create a list of the notes in order. Let's check the order again:\n\nThe notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again.\n\nSo let's assign indexes from 0 to 11. So:\n\nC is 0\n\nC# is 1\n\nD is 2\n\nD# is 3\n\nE is 4\n\nF is 5\n\nF# is 6\n\nG is 7\n\nG# is 8\n\nA is 9\n\nB is 10\n\nH is 11.\n\nSo for any two notes, X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper, perhaps that's equivalent to the number of semitones when moving forward from X to Y. So, for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), the distance is 4. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), the distance is (0 -4 + 12) = 8. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) if positive, else (Y_index - X_index + 12). Which can be written as (Y_index - X_index) % 12. But since the problem defines the distance as the number of semitones when moving from X to Y upwards. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the problem defines a major triad as follows: the triad can be ordered as X, Y, Z such that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. Then the distance between X and Z is 7 semitones. Similarly, a minor triad is when the distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4.\n\nBut the triad is an unordered set. So, given three notes, we need to check all possible permutations of them to see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nSo for the three notes, we need to generate all possible orderings (permutations) and check for each if they meet the criteria.\n\nBut since the order of the three elements in the triad can be any, perhaps there are 6 permutations (3! = 6) for each set of three distinct notes. However, since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we can check all permutations and see if any of them meet the major or minor condition.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor the given three notes, generate all possible permutations of the three notes. For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check if the distance from X to Y is 4 and from Y to Z is 3 (for major). Or check if distance from X to Y is 3 and from Y to Z is 4 (for minor). If any permutation meets the major condition, then the answer is 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, then 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations of the three notes? Well, since the order of the three notes in the permutation is important for checking the conditions.\n\nBut since the problem says that the triad is unordered, but the order in the permutation is considered for checking the conditions.\n\nSo for example, for the input C E G, the permutation (C, E, G) would satisfy the major condition. Because distance from C to E is 4, and from E to G is 3.\n\nAnother permutation, like (E, G, C) would not satisfy the major condition. Because distance E to G is 2 semitones (E is index 4, G is 7. 7-4=3. Wait, 7-4 is 3, so the distance is 3. So if the permutation is (E, G, C), then distance between E and G is 3, and between G and C is (0 -7 +12) = 5? Wait, 0 is C's index. So G is 7, C is 0. So distance from G to C is (0 -7) mod 12? Wait, no. The distance is computed as (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. Wait, but for X being G (7) and Y being C (0), the distance is (0 -7) mod 12 = 5? No, because (0 -7) is -7, mod 12 is 5? Because 12 -7 = 5. So the distance from G to C is 5 semitones. So in that case, for permutation (E, G, C), the distance between E and G is 3, and between G and C is 5. So that doesn't meet the major condition. So the order of the permutation is important.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each of the 6 permutations of the three notes, check if the first two steps meet the major or minor conditions.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations? Well, in Python, itertools.permutations can generate all possible orderings.\n\nSo first, I need to map the input notes to their indices. Let's create a dictionary for that. For example, note_map = {'C':0, 'C#':1, ... 'H':11}.\n\nThen, for each input note, get their indices. Let's say the three notes are a, b, c. Then, for all permutations of [a, b, c], check for each permutation (x, y, z):\n\ndistance between x and y is 4, and between y and z is 3 → major.\n\nOR\n\ndistance between x and y is 3, and between y and z is 4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor. Otherwise, 'strange'.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three input notes. For example, input could be something like ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\n2. For each note, get their index using the note_map.\n\n3. Generate all permutations of the three indices.\n\n4. For each permutation (x, y, z):\n\n   a. Compute distance between x and y (d1) = (y - x) mod 12. Wait, no. Wait, the distance between x and y is (y_index - x_index) if positive, else (y_index - x_index + 12). But (y_index - x_index) mod 12 gives the same result. For example, if y is 0 and x is 7, then (0 -7) mod 12 is 5. Which is correct. So yes, the distance from x to y is (y_index - x_index) % 12.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, if x is lower than y, then the distance is (y -x). If x is higher than y, then the distance is (y + 12 -x). Which is the same as (y -x) mod 12, but since the mod operation returns a non-negative value. So yes, the distance from x to y is (y_index - x_index) % 12.\n\nBut wait, for example, x is E (index 4), y is C (index 0). Then (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So yes, the formula holds.\n\nSo for each permutation, compute d1 = (y - x) % 12, d2 = (z - y) % 12.\n\nThen, check if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\nOr check if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets either condition, then return accordingly.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, create the note_map.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_map = {note: index for index, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nBut wait, the input is given as three space-separated notes, for example, in the sample input, the first case is 'C E G'.\n\nSo the input is read as a list of three strings.\n\nOnce the three notes are converted into their indices, then generate all permutations of the three indices.\n\nFor each permutation, check the two distances.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the input line. Split into three notes.\n\nFor example, input_line = input().strip().split()\n\nThen, get their indices.\n\nThen generate all permutations of the three indices.\n\nFor each permutation in permutations:\n\nx, y, z = permutation\n\nd1 = (y - x) % 12\n\nd2 = (z - y) % 12\n\nif d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\nif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, then output 'major'.\n\nSimilarly for minor.\n\nNow, once any permutation meets the major condition, we can immediately return 'major' as the answer, since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous.\n\nSo, the code can check all permutations, and if any of them meets the major condition, then return 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, return 'strange'.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, the note_map.\n\nBut note that the input uses 'H' as the last note, which is the same as the note before C. So the note_order list must be correctly built.\n\nLet me write the note_order list as:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nYes. So the indexes are 0 to 11.\n\nSo the note_map is built as:\n\nnote_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nNow, for example, note_map['C'] is 0, note_map['H'] is 11.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n\n# Get the three notes as a list\n\nnotes = input_notes\n\n# Convert to their indices\n\nindices = [note_map[note] for note in notes]\n\n# Generate all permutations of the three indices\n\nfound_major = False\n\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor p in permutations(indices):\n\n    x, y, z = p\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        found_major = True\n\n    if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n\n    print(\"major\")\n\nelif found_minor:\n\n    print(\"minor\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but what if multiple permutations meet the conditions? For example, if two permutations meet the major condition. But since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there can't be both major and minor possibilities. So the code can check for any occurrence of major or minor.\n\nBut the code above checks all permutations and sets found_major and found_minor flags. However, the problem says that the answer is unique. So, for example, if there is at least one permutation that satisfies major, then the answer is major. Similarly for minor. But in the code, even if some permutations meet major and others meet minor, but according to the problem statement, this is not possible. So the code can proceed.\n\nBut the code may have both flags set, but according to the problem statement, that can't happen. So the code can check if found_major is True, then output major, else if found_minor is True, output minor, else strange.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWait, but the input is given as a single line with three notes. Wait, the sample input shows that the input is a list of three examples. But the actual input for the code is a single line with three notes. For example, the first example input is \"C E G\", which is the first case.\n\nBut in the problem statement's sample input, it's written as:\n\nInput:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake. Because the actual input for the code is a single line with three notes. For example, the sample input is three separate test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single line with three notes. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo the input is a single line with three notes. For example, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting error. The actual input for the code would be three notes separated by spaces. For example, the first test case is \"C E G\" (so the input line is \"C E G\"), the second is \"C# B F\", etc. So the sample outputs are ['major', 'minor', 'strange'].\n\nSo the code should process a single line of input, split into three notes.\n\nSo in the code, the input is read as:\n\ninput_notes = input().strip().split()\n\nBut in the sample input, perhaps the input is three lines? No, the problem says that the input is a single line with three notes.\n\nSo, for example, the sample input would be:\n\nC E G\n\nWhich outputs 'major'.\n\nBut the sample input shown in the problem is a list of three examples. But perhaps that's just for illustration. So the code is supposed to process one line of input.\n\nSo the code as written is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst case: C E G → indices are 0,4,7.\n\nPermutations:\n\nCheck all permutations. Let's take (0,4,7):\n\nd1 = (4-0) mod 12 =4 → yes. d2 = 7-4=3 → yes. So found_major is True.\n\nThus, output is 'major'.\n\nSecond case: C# B F → the notes are C#, B, F. Let's convert to indices:\n\nC# is 1, B is 10, F is 5.\n\nLooking for permutations. For example, B, C#, F → indices 10, 1,5.\n\nCheck d1: (1 -10) mod 12 → (1-10) is -9 mod 12 → 3. Because 12 -9 =3. So d1 is 3. Then d2 is (5-1) mod 12 =4. So this permutation meets minor condition. So found_minor is True.\n\nThird case: A B H → indices are 9,10,11.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's see:\n\nTake permutation (9,10,11):\n\nd1 = 10-9 =1 → no. d2 = 11-10=1 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: (9,11,10). d1 = (11-9)=2. d2 = (10-11) mod 12 → 10 -11 is -1 mod 12 → 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: (10, 9, 11). d1 is (9-10) mod 12 → 11. d2 is 11-9=2. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (10, 11, 9). d1 is 11-10=1. d2 is 9-11 mod 12 → (9-11) is -2 → 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (11, 9, 10). d1 is 9-11 mod 12 → (9-11) = -2 → 10. d2 is 10-9=1. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (11, 10, 9). d1 is 10-11 mod 12 → 11. d2 is 9-10 mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nNo permutations meet major or minor. So output is strange.\n\nSo the code would work for the sample.\n\nNow, possible edge cases.\n\nWhat if two notes are same? But the problem says that the input is three notes, but perhaps they can be same? But according to the problem statement, the chord is a set of three notes. However, the problem says that the input is three notes, but perhaps they can be same. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. But for example, if all three are same note. Then, the distance between X and Y is 0, so no major or minor. So output strange.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is three notes. The problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So perhaps the input is always three distinct notes. But the code can handle any input.\n\nAnother case: for example, the notes are C, E, G#. Let's see. Let's check permutations.\n\nBut regardless, the code will check all permutations.\n\nAnother possible case: a minor chord. For example, B, C#, F. As in the sample. Which is handled.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code is correct. However, permutations returns all possible orderings, which is 6 for three elements.\n\nBut for the code, it's okay.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that the code needs to read from stdin. So:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n\n    notes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\n    note_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\n    input_notes = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n\n    # Get the three notes\n\n    # Check that input_notes has exactly three elements\n\n    # Assuming that the input is correct as per the problem statement\n\n    indices = [note_map[note] for note in input_notes]\n\n    found_major = False\n\n    found_minor = False\n\n    for p in permutations(indices):\n\n        x, y, z = p\n\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n        if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n            found_major = True\n\n        if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n            found_minor = True\n\n    if found_major:\n\n        print(\"major\")\n\n    elif found_minor:\n\n        print(\"minor\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the code, permutations returns all possible orderings. For example, if the three notes are the same, then all permutations are same. But the code will check them, but since d1 and d2 will be 0, no flags are set.\n\nBut the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input. Let's take the first sample input as input.\n\nSample input line: 'C E G' → output is 'major'.\n\nSample input line: 'C# B F' → output is 'minor'.\n\nSample input line: 'A B H' → output is 'strange'.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nAnother test case: 'C# B F' → the code converts to indices 1, 10, 5. Let's check permutations.\n\nOne of the permutations is (10, 1, 5). Let's compute d1 = (1 - 10) mod 12 → (1-10) = -9 mod 12 → 3. d2 = (5 -1) mod 12 =4. So this is minor. So found_minor is True.\n\nSo the code returns 'minor'.\n\nAnother test case: 'C E G#'.\n\nLet's compute indices: C is 0, E is 4, G# is 8.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's take (0,4,8). d1 is 4-0=4. d2 is 8-4=4. So 4 and 4. Not major or minor. Another permutation: (0,8,4). d1 is 8-0=8 mod 12 is 8. d2 is 4-8 mod 12 → (4-8) is -4 → 8. No. Another permutation: (4,0,8). d1 is 0-4 mod 12 is 8. d2 is 8-0=8. No. Another permutation (4,8,0). d1 is 8-4=4. d2 is 0-8 mod 12 → 4. So 4 and 4. Not matching. Another permutation (8,0,4). d1 is 0-8 mod 12 → 4. d2 is 4-0=4. Again 4 and 4. No. Another permutation (8,4,0). d1 is 4-8 mod 12 → (4-8) is -4 → 8. d2 is 0-4 mod 12 → 8. So no. So output is strange.\n\nSo code returns strange.\n\nAnother test case: 'C# E G' → indices 1,4,7.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's check (1,4,7): d1 is 3, d2 is 3. Not major or minor. Another permutation (1,7,4): d1 is 7-1=6, d2 is 4-7 mod 12 → (4-7) is -3 → 9. No. Another permutation (4,1,7): d1 is 1-4 mod 12 → 9. No. Another permutation (4,7,1): d1 is 3, d2 is 1-7 mod 12 → 6. No. Another permutation (7,1,4): d1 is 1-7 mod 12 → 6. d2 is 4-1=3. So d1=6, d2=3. Not matching. Another permutation (7,4,1): d1 is 4-7 mod 12 → 9. No. So no match. So output is strange.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: minor chord. For example, 'B C# F' → indices 10,1,5. Let's check permutations. One of them is (10,1,5). d1 is (1-10) mod 12 → (1-10) = -9 mod 12 → 3. d2 is (5-1) mod 12 → 4. So this is minor. So code returns minor.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code needs to be written. Also, note that the input may have the notes in any order, but the code handles all permutations.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on semitone distances.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to an index based on its position in the musical scale. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three given notes. For each permutation, calculate the semitone distances between consecutive notes.\n3. **Check Major and Minor Triads**: For each permutation, check if the distances between the first and second note, and the second and third note match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n4. **Determine Result**: Based on whether any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad, output the corresponding result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    notes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_map = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n    \n    input_notes = sys.stdin.read().strip().split()\n    indices = [note_map[note] for note in input_notes]\n    \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for p in permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = p\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n    \n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `notes_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes, and `note_map` converts each note to its corresponding index for quick lookup.\n2. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line of three space-separated notes.\n3. **Generating Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three notes are generated to check each possible arrangement for triad conditions.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, the semitone distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n5. **Triad Check**: Each permutation is checked against the criteria for major and minor triads. If any permutation meets the criteria, the corresponding flag is set.\n6. **Result Determination**: Based on the flags set during the permutation checks, the result is printed as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the three notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical scales.",
