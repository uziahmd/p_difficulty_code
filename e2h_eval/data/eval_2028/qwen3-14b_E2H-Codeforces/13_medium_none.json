For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, let me understand the note structure. There are 12 notes in order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. And they repeat cyclically. So after H comes C again. The distance between consecutive notes is 1 semitone. But when calculating the distance between two notes, it's the number of steps moving upwards. For example, the distance from C to E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, then D is 2, D# 3, E is 4). But the distance from E to C would be 8 semitones because you go E to F (1), F# (2), G (3), G# (4), A (5), B (6), H (7), C (8). Wait, but the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So when you have two notes, the distance is calculated as the number of semitones you move upwards from the lower note to reach the higher one. So for example, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is positive. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance would be calculated as (Y's position - X's position + 12) mod 12? No, wait, no. Because the problem says that the distance is measured along the musical scale from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, since E is higher than C, but if you're going from E to C, that's not the case. Wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones from X to Y when moving upwards. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is positive. If X is higher than Y, then the distance would be (Y's position - X's position + 12) mod 12? Or perhaps the distance is always the minimal steps in the cyclic scale. Wait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"the distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones.\"\n\nAh! So the distance is always calculated from the lower note to the upper note. So if you have two notes, say X and Y, then the distance is computed as follows: if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones between them. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones when you go from X to Y by going up (which would wrap around the cycle). Wait, no. Wait, the example says that between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Let me think: the distance between E and C is calculated as going from E up to C. Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the distance is calculated as the number of semitones between X and Y when moving upwards from X. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is (Y - X) semitones. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y - X + 12) semitones. Because for example, E is at position 4 (assuming C is 0?), then C is at 0. So the distance from E to C would be (0 - 4 + 12) = 8 semitones. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo first, I need to assign each note a numerical value. Let's create a list of the notes in order, and map each note to its index. For example:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the indexes are 0 to 11. So for any note, we can find its index in this list.\n\nSo for example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc. Then, for two notes X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) if y_index >= x_index, else (y_index - x_index + 12). Wait, no. Because if X is lower than Y, then the distance is (Y - X). If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). For example, X is E (index 4), Y is C (index 0). Then the distance is (0 + 12 - 4) = 8. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the formula for distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) if y_index >= x_index, else (y_index - x_index + 12). Alternatively, (y_index - x_index) % 12? No, because for example, if y_index is 0 and x_index is 4, (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. Wait, but mod 12 gives a result between 0 and 11. But the problem says that the distance between consecutive notes is 1 semitone. So for example, between C and C#, the distance is 1. So for X being C (0) and Y being C# (1), (1-0) mod 12 is 1. Correct. For X being C# (1) and Y being C (0), (0-1) mod 12 is 11. Which is 11 semitones. Which is correct, because moving from C# to C would require going up 11 semitones (since the next note after C# is D, and so on up to C again).\n\nSo the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones from the lower to the upper. So in that case, the distance between X and Y is (y_index - x_index) if y is higher than x. Otherwise, it's (y_index - x_index + 12). Which is equivalent to (y_index - x_index) mod 12. Because if y is higher than x, then the difference is positive. Else, adding 12 makes it positive. So yes.\n\nBut how to compute that. For example, for X and Y, the distance is (y_index - x_index) if y_index >= x_index, else (y_index - x_index + 12). So that's how I'll compute the distance between X and Y.\n\nNow, for the chord. The chord is a set of three notes. The problem says that the order doesn't matter. But for checking major or minor, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes to see if any of them fits the criteria.\n\nFor a major triad: there exists an ordering X, Y, Z such that distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. Then, the total between X and Z is 7 semitones. But since the problem says that the chord is unordered, we have to check all permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies this condition.\n\nSimilarly, for minor triad: there exists an ordering X, Y, Z where distance between X and Y is 3, and between Y and Z is 4.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For the three input notes, generate all possible permutations (since the order matters for checking the conditions).\n\n2. For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4, and second to third is 3 (for major), or first to second is 3 and second to third is 4 (for minor).\n\n3. If any permutation meets the major condition, then output \"major\". Similarly for minor. If none, output \"strange\".\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Since there are three elements, there are 3! = 6 permutations. For each of them, check the conditions.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. For example, for any triplet of notes, we can check all possible orderings of the three notes. However, since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we can check all permutations and see if any of them meets the criteria.\n\nSo first, I need to map the notes to their indices. Let's create a dictionary for that. For example:\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nWait, but the problem says that the notes are given in the order C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the indexes are 0 to 11. So that's correct.\n\nSo, for each of the three input notes, we can get their indices.\n\nOnce I have the three indices, let's call them a, b, c. But since the order of the three notes is not fixed, I need to consider all permutations of these three.\n\nBut for each permutation, say (x, y, z), check if distance between x and y is 4, and between y and z is 3. Or for minor, check if distance between x and y is 3, and between y and z is 4.\n\nSo for example, for the input C E G, the indices are 0, 4, 7. Let's take permutation (0,4,7). The distance between 0 and 4 is 4 (correct for major). Between 4 and 7: 7-4=3. So that's a major triad.\n\nAnother example: C# B F. Let's convert to indices. C# is 1, B is 10, F is 5. Let's check the permutation B, C#, F. B is 10, C# is 1. Distance from B to C#: (1 - 10) mod 12 is (1-10) = -9 mod 12 is 3. So that's 3 semitones. Then from C# (1) to F (5): 5-1 =4. So that's 4. So this permutation is minor.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor the three notes, generate all permutations (there are 6 permutations for three elements). For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4 and second to third is 3 (major) or first to second is 3 and second to third is 4 (minor). If any permutation satisfies major, return major. If any permutation satisfies minor, return minor. Otherwise, strange.\n\nBut how to generate permutations. In Python, itertools.permutations can be used.\n\nSo steps for code:\n\nRead the input line. Split into three notes.\n\nFor example, input is like ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] but in the actual input, the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. Wait, the sample input shows that the input is a list of three elements, but in reality, the input is a single line with three notes separated by spaces. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input says: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo for example, for the first example, the input is \"C E G\", and output is \"major\".\n\nSo the code needs to read a line, split into three elements.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead input line, split into three notes. For example, input_notes = input().split()\n\nThen, for each note in input_notes, get their index.\n\nOnce we have the three indices, generate all permutations of them.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCompute distance between x and y (d1), and between y and z (d2).\n\nCheck if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\nCheck if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, then return major. Similarly for minor.\n\nNow, how to compute the distance between two notes.\n\nFunction to compute distance between two indices:\n\ndef distance(a, b):\n\n    return (b - a) % 12\n\nWait, but according to the problem, the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones from X to Y (lower to upper). So for example, if a is X's index, and b is Y's index, then if Y is higher than X, then the distance is (b -a). If Y is lower than X, then the distance is (b -a + 12). Which is equivalent to (b -a) mod 12. But wait, (b -a) mod 12 gives the correct value. For example, if a=4 (E), b=0 (C), (0-4) mod 12 is 8, which is correct.\n\nYes. So the function for distance between a and b is (b -a) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower note to the upper. So for example, if a is lower than b, then the distance is (b -a). If a is higher than b, then the distance is (b -a + 12). Which is exactly (b -a) mod 12. So yes.\n\nSo, for two indices a and b, the distance from a to b is (b -a) mod 12.\n\nBut in the code, when we have a permutation (x, y, z), we need to check the distance between x and y, and between y and z. So for the first part, distance between x and y is (y -x) mod 12. Then between y and z is (z - y) mod 12.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the major triad requires that the distance between X and Y is 4 semitones, and between Y and Z is 3 semitones. So in the permutation (X, Y, Z), the distance between X and Y is 4, and between Y and Z is 3. So the code for that is:\n\nd1 = (y -x) mod 12 → should be 4.\n\nd2 = (z - y) mod 12 → should be 3.\n\nBut in the example of C E G, x is C (0), y is E (4), z is G (7). So (4-0) mod 12 is 4. (7-4) mod 12 is 3. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: B C# F. B is 10, C# is 1, F is 5. So for permutation (B, C#, F):\n\ndistance between B and C# is (1 -10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 is 3. Which is correct. Then between C# and F is (5 - 1) mod 12 → 4. So that's 3 and 4, which is minor.\n\nSo the code for checking major and minor is:\n\nfor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\n    d1 = (y -x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nSo in code, for each permutation, check these conditions.\n\nOnce any permutation satisfies major, then return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the three notes.\n\nConvert them into their indices.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three indices.\n\nCheck for each permutation if it meets major or minor conditions.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, then output 'major'.\n\nIf any permutation meets minor, then output 'minor'.\n\nElse, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate permutations. For example, for the three notes, the permutations can be generated using itertools.permutations.\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations([a, b, c], 3) will generate all 6 possible orderings.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but for each permutation, we check once. But for example, if there are multiple permutations that satisfy the same condition, but once found_major is True, we can break early. However, since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there's no need to check further once a condition is found. However, in code, even if multiple permutations meet the condition, it's okay to check all of them, but once found_major is True, we can just proceed to check all permutations, but the code will still work.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps once found_major is True, we can break early. However, since there are only 6 permutations, it's not a big deal. So the code as written is acceptable.\n\nBut what about the sample input?\n\nSample Input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nLet's take the first case, C E G. The permutations would include (C, E, G) which gives d1=4, d2=3 → major. So found_major is True. So output is major.\n\nSecond case: C# B F. The indices are 1, 10, 5. One of the permutations is (10, 1, 5). Then d1 = (1 -10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 = (5 -1) mod 12 = 4 → minor. So found_minor is True.\n\nThird case: A B H. The indices are 9, 10, 11. Let's check all permutations.\n\nFor example, permutation (A, B, H): d1 is (10-9) =1 mod 12 →1. d2 is (11-10) =1 → 1. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: (A, H, B). d1 is (11 -9) =2. d2 is (10 -11) mod 12 → ( -1 ) mod 12 = 11. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: (B, A, H). d1 is (9 -10) mod 12 → ( -1 ) mod 12 = 11. d2 is (11 -9) mod 12 = 2. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: (B, H, A). d1 = (11 -10) =1. d2 is (9 -11) mod 12 → ( -2 ) mod 12 = 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (H, A, B). d1 is (9 - 11) mod 12 → -2 mod 12 is 10. d2 is (10 -9) mod 12 =1. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (H, B, A). d1 is (10 -11) mod 12 → -1 mod 12 →11. d2 is (9 -10) mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output is 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the same note is present more than once? But the problem says that the input is three notes, but the problem says that the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But the problem says that the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so perhaps the input will not have duplicates. But the code will handle that regardless.\n\nNow, what about the case where a permutation has X, Y, Z where X and Y are same note? Well, since the problem says that the input is three notes, but they could be same. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so perhaps the input will not have such cases. But the code will process them regardless.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is three notes. So, for example, if all three are same, then for any permutation, d1 and d2 would be zero. So no match, output 'strange'.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code is correct. But need to make sure that the note_to_index is correctly defined. Let me check the order again.\n\nThe problem says the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nSo the indexes are:\n\nC → 0\n\nC# → 1\n\nD → 2\n\nD# →3\n\nE →4\n\nF →5\n\nF# →6\n\nG →7\n\nG# →8\n\nA →9\n\nB →10\n\nH →11.\n\nYes. So the note_to_index is correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, the input is read as input().split(), which splits by whitespace. For example, if the input is 'C E G', then input().split() gives ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what about the note 'B' and 'H'? For example, in the third sample input, 'A B H' is given. So B is 10, H is 11.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, test another case. Let's take the example of C# B F. The input is 'C# B F'. The code would read the three notes as ['C#', 'B', 'F'], which are mapped to 1, 10, 5. Then permutations would include (10, 1, 5). For that permutation:\n\nd1 = (1 - 10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 = (5 -1) mod 12 =4. So minor.\n\nSo code returns minor.\n\nAnother test case: if the input is 'C E G', code returns major.\n\nAnother case: 'C E G#'. Let's see. C is 0, E is 4, G# is 8. Let's check permutations.\n\nLooking for any permutation where d1 is 4 and d2 is 3.\n\nPermutation (0,4,8): d1 is 4, d2 is 4. So no.\n\nAnother permutation (0, 8, 4): d1 is 8-0=8 mod 12 is 8. Not 4. So no.\n\nAnother permutation (4, 0, 8): d1 is 0-4 mod 12 → 8. No.\n\nWhat about (4, 8, 0)? d1 is 8-4=4. d2 is 0-8 mod 12 → 4. So d1 is 4, d2 is 4. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation (8, 0, 4): d1 is 0-8 mod 12 → 4. Then d2 is 4-0 mod 12 →4. So again 4 and 4. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation (8,4,0): d1 is 4-8 mod 12 → ( -4 ) mod 12 → 8. No.\n\nSo no major or minor. So output is strange.\n\nSo code would return strange.\n\nAnother example: 'C# E G' → indices 1,4,7. Let's check permutations.\n\nTake permutation (1,4,7): d1 is 3 (4-1=3), d2 is 3 (7-4=3). Not matching. So no. What about permutation (1,7,4)? d1 is 7-1=6. d2 is 4-7 mod 12 → ( -3 ) mod 12 →9. No. Another permutation (4,1,7): d1 is 1-4 mod 12 → 9. No. Maybe another permutation (4,7,1): d1 is 7-4=3, d2 is 1-7 mod 12 → ( -6 ) mod 12 →6. So 3 and 6. Not matching. So no. So this is strange.\n\nSo code would output strange.\n\nAnother test case: minor triad. Let's take B, C#, F. Which is the second sample. So the code finds that permutation (B, C#, F) gives d1=3 and d2=4. So code returns minor.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code uses itertools.permutations. So need to import itertools.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes = input().split()\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple permutations that meet both major and minor? According to the problem statement, the answer is always unambiguous. So the code can safely check for major first, then minor. Because if a permutation meets both (but according to the problem, it's impossible), but the problem says that there are no such cases.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is always unique. So the code is correct.\n\nBut let's think: can a permutation satisfy both major and minor conditions? For example, d1=4 and d2=3 (major) and also d1=3 and d2=4? That would require that 4=3 and 3=4, which is impossible. So no. So the code can safely check for major and minor in separate conditions.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, let me check the sample input.\n\nSample Input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nFor the first input, the code returns 'major'.\n\nFor the second input, returns 'minor'.\n\nThird input returns 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the specific semitone distance criteria for major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in a predefined list of musical notes. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between notes.\n2. **Generating Permutations**: Since the order of notes in a triad can vary, generate all permutations of the three input notes.\n3. **Checking Distances**: For each permutation, check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major or minor triad:\n   - A major triad requires a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note.\n   - A minor triad requires a distance of 3 semitones between the first and second note, and 4 semitones between the second and third note.\n4. **Determine Result**: Based on the checks, determine if the triad is major, minor, or strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_to_index = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E': 4,\n    'F': 5,\n    'F#': 6,\n    'G': 7,\n    'G#': 8,\n    'A': 9,\n    'B': 10,\n    'H': 11\n}\n\nnotes = input().split()\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: Each note is mapped to an index based on its position in the musical scale. This allows for easy calculation of semitone distances.\n2. **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the three input notes, we ensure that all possible orderings are considered for both major and minor triad checks.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Using modulo arithmetic, the distance between two notes is calculated considering the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Result Determination**: After checking all permutations, the result is determined based on whether any permutation met the criteria for a major or minor triad. If neither is found, the result is \"strange\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the input notes and ensures the correct classification based on the given criteria.",
