    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain conditions based on the given A, B, C, D. Let's think through the problem step by step.\n\nThe constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the triangle inequality simplifies to x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in non-decreasing order, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side.\n\nSo the main condition is x + y > z. Now, how do I count all possible triples (x, y, z) that satisfy the given inequalities and this condition?\n\nLet me break down the problem:\n\nFirst, x ranges from A to B, inclusive. Then y ranges from B to C, inclusive. And z ranges from C to D, inclusive. However, the problem says that x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C. So for each x in [A, B], y is in [B, C], and z is in [C, D]. But also, since x ≤ y (since x is up to B and y starts at B), and y ≤ z (since z starts at C which is ≥ y's upper bound). Wait, no. The original condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be up to B, y starts at B (so x ≤ y), and y is up to C, and z starts at C (so y ≤ z). Therefore, x ≤ y ≤ z. So the triangle inequality is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], z ∈ [C, D], and x + y > z.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently given the constraints on the input size (up to 5e5)? Brute-forcing all possible x, y, z would be O(B * C * D), which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the variables. For each possible x and y, we can find the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ min(D, x + y - 1). Because z has to be less than x + y. But since z must be ≥ C, the valid range for z is from C to min(D, x + y - 1). However, if x + y - 1 < C, then there are no such z's. So for each (x, y), the count of valid z is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut even this approach would be O(B*C) which could be up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow. So we need to find a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nWait, but maybe we can find for each x and y, the number of z's that are between C and D, and also less than x + y. So z's range is [C, D], but also z < x + y. So the number of valid z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: for all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], compute the number of z's in [C, D] that are less than x + y. Sum all these counts.\n\nBut again, with B and C up to 5e5, this is O(B*C) which is not feasible. So we need to find a way to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the variables. Let me note that for x and y, their possible values are:\n\nx ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. But since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, x can be as small as A and as large as B, and y can be as small as B and as large as C.\n\nBut perhaps we can find for each possible value of s = x + y, the number of (x, y) pairs that sum to s, and then compute for each s the number of z's that are less than s, and multiply accordingly.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for a fixed y, x can range from A to B, and for each x, we can compute the contribution. But again, for each y, x ranges up to B, which is O(B*C) total.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the constraints again. Since x is in [A, B], and y is in [B, C], then x + y ranges from (A + B) to (B + C). For each possible x and y, the minimum z is C, and the maximum z is D. So for each (x,y), the number of valid z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= C.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nIf x + y -1 < C: 0\n\nElse:\n\ncount_z = min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1\n\nWhich is same as:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1 )\n\nBut min(D, x + y -1) can be written as:\n\nif x + y -1 >= D → D\n\nelse x + y -1\n\nSo the count_z is:\n\nif x + y -1 < C → 0\n\nelse if x + y -1 >= D → D - C + 1\n\nelse → (x + y -1) - C + 1 = x + y - C\n\nSo the problem can be split into two parts:\n\nFor each (x,y), compute whether x + y > C (since z starts at C). If not, then no z satisfies the condition. Otherwise, the number of z is either (D - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= D, or (x + y - C) otherwise.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x and y (with x in [A,B], y in [B,C]) of:\n\nif x + y > C:\n\n   if x + y -1 >= D → add (D - C + 1)\n\n   else → add (x + y - C)\n\nelse:\n\n   0\n\nSo how can we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me consider that for x and y, the sum x + y can be considered as a variable. Let me denote S = x + y.\n\nWe can split the problem into two parts:\n\n1. For all (x, y) where S > C and S <= D + 1 (since x + y -1 can be up to B + C -1, which may be larger than D). Wait, no. For S = x + y, the z needs to be less than S. So z can be from C to min(D, S-1).\n\nBut S can be as small as A + B (since x ≥ A and y ≥ B). So for each (x, y), S ranges from A + B to B + C.\n\nSo the key is to find for each possible S, the number of (x, y) pairs that have x + y = S, and then multiply that by the corresponding count of z's.\n\nBut how to compute the number of (x, y) pairs for each S?\n\nLet me think about that. Let me first find the range of S. Let S_min = A + B, S_max = B + C.\n\nFor each S in [S_min, S_max], we can compute the number of (x, y) pairs where x is in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y = S.\n\nOnce we have that, then for each S, we can calculate how much it contributes to the total sum.\n\nSo for a particular S, the contribution is:\n\nif S <= C → 0 (since x + y = S, and z must be >= C. So S must be > C for x + y > z to be possible when z is >= C. Wait, no. Because z is >= C. So x + y must be > z. But since z is at least C, the minimal z is C. So x + y must be > C. Otherwise, even the smallest z (C) will not satisfy x + y > z. So for S = x + y, if S <= C, then x + y <= C, and thus x + y <= z (since z >= C). So no valid z. Therefore, only S > C contribute.\n\nSo for each S in [S_min, S_max], if S > C, then the contribution is:\n\nnumber_of_pairs * (number of z's for this S).\n\nNow, for a given S, what is the number of z's?\n\nAs before, for a given S, the number of z's is:\n\nif S - 1 >= D → D - C + 1\n\nelse if S -1 >= C → (S - 1) - C + 1 = S - C\n\nSo for S > C, the number of z's is min(D, S - 1) - C + 1 = min(D - C + 1, S - C).\n\nWait, because min(D, S-1) - C + 1 = min(D - C + 1, (S-1) - C + 1) = min(D - C +1, S - C).\n\nSo for S > C, the number of z's is:\n\nif S - C <= D - C + 1 → which is always true when S <= D + 1. Wait, D - C + 1 is the maximum possible count of z's. So for S > C, the count is:\n\nif S - 1 >= D → D - C + 1\n\nelse → S - C\n\nBut S - 1 >= D is equivalent to S >= D + 1.\n\nSo for a given S, the count_z is:\n\nif S >= D + 1 → D - C + 1\n\nelif S > C → S - C\n\nelse → 0\n\nSo putting it all together, the total number of triangles is:\n\nsum_{S = S_min}^{S_max} [count_pairs(S) * count_z(S)] \n\nwhere count_pairs(S) is the number of (x, y) pairs with x in [A, B], y in [B, C], x + y = S, and count_z(S) is as above.\n\nSo now the problem is to compute count_pairs(S) for each S in [S_min, S_max], and then multiply by count_z(S) and sum all.\n\nNow, how to compute count_pairs(S)?\n\nLet me think about x and y. x ranges from A to B, y ranges from B to C. So for each possible S, how many (x, y) pairs are there such that x + y = S.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the number of integer solutions (x, y) to x + y = S with x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C].\n\nLet me think of y = S - x. So for x to be in [A, B], and y must be in [B, C]. So substituting y = S - x:\n\ny = S - x >= B → S - x >= B → x <= S - B.\n\nAlso y = S - x <= C → S - x <= C → x >= S - C.\n\nAdditionally, x must be between A and B.\n\nSo combining all these constraints, x must satisfy:\n\nmax(A, S - C) ≤ x ≤ min(B, S - B)\n\nand also, since y must be ≥ B and ≤ C, and x must be ≥ A and ≤ B.\n\nBut for there to be any solution, the lower bound must be ≤ upper bound.\n\nSo for each S, the number of x's is:\n\nmax( 0, min(B, S - B) - max(A, S - C) + 1 )\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me rephrase:\n\nThe x must be in [A, B], and also satisfy:\n\nS - C ≤ x ≤ S - B.\n\nBecause y = S - x must be between B and C.\n\nSo the x's valid are the intersection of [A, B] and [S - C, S - B].\n\nSo the lower bound for x is L = max(A, S - C)\n\nupper bound for x is U = min(B, S - B)\n\nif L > U, then count_pairs(S) is 0.\n\nElse, count_pairs(S) is U - L + 1.\n\nSo for each S, we can compute this count_pairs(S) as:\n\nif L <= U → U - L + 1 else 0.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to:\n\nFor each S in [S_min, S_max], compute count_pairs(S) as above, and multiply by count_z(S) as discussed, then sum all these products.\n\nNow, the next question is how to iterate over all S in [S_min, S_max], compute count_pairs(S), and accumulate the sum.\n\nBut what is the range of S? S_min is A + B, S_max is B + C.\n\nBut since A, B, C can be up to 5e5, S_max can be up to 1e6. So iterating over all S from S_min to S_max is O(1e6) steps, which is manageable.\n\nSo the overall plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each S in [S_min, S_max], compute count_pairs(S) and count_z(S), multiply them, and sum all.\n\nNow, let's think about how to compute count_z(S):\n\ncount_z(S) is:\n\nif S > C:\n\n   if S >= D + 1 → D - C + 1\n\n   else → S - C\n\nelse:\n\n   0\n\nBut S can be up to B + C, which could be larger than D + 1.\n\nSo for each S, the count_z(S) is:\n\nif S <= C → 0\n\nelse:\n\n   if S >= D + 1 → (D - C + 1)\n\n   else → (S - C)\n\nSo combining all of this, the steps are:\n\nCompute S_min = A + B\n\nS_max = B + C\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor S in S_min ... S_max:\n\n   if S <= C:\n\n       continue\n\n   else:\n\n       if S >= D + 1:\n\n           cz = D - C + 1\n\n       else:\n\n           cz = S - C\n\n       compute L = max(A, S - C)\n\n       U = min(B, S - B)\n\n       if L > U:\n\n           continue\n\n       else:\n\n           count_pairs = U - L + 1\n\n           total += count_pairs * cz\n\nSo this seems manageable. But let's check with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4 → Output 4.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nS_min = 1+2=3, S_max = 2 + 3=5.\n\nSo S ranges from 3 to 5.\n\nFor each S:\n\nS=3:\n\nCheck if S > C (C is 3). No, 3 is not greater than 3. So skip.\n\nS=4:\n\nS > C (3). Yes.\n\nCheck if S >= D + 1? D is 4, D +1 is 5. 4 < 5 → cz = 4 -3 =1.\n\nNow compute L and U.\n\nL = max(A=1, S - C = 4-3=1) → 1.\n\nU = min(B=2, S - B = 4 -2 = 2) → 2.\n\nSo count_pairs = 2 -1 +1 = 2.\n\nMultiply by cz=1 → 2*1=2 added to total.\n\nS=5:\n\nS > C (3) yes. Check if S >= D+1 (5 >= 5 → yes). cz is D - C +1 =4-3+1=2.\n\nCompute L and U:\n\nL = max(1, 5-3=2) → 2.\n\nU = min(2, 5-2=3) → 2.\n\ncount_pairs = 2-2 +1 =1 → 1 * 2 = 2 added.\n\nSo total so far is 2 + 2 =4. Which matches the first sample's output of 4. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input '1 2 2 5' → output 3.\n\nLet me see:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nS_min is 1+2=3, S_max is 2+2=4.\n\nFor S in 3,4:\n\nS=3:\n\nCheck if S > C (2). Yes.\n\nCheck if S >= D+1 (5+1=6)? 3 <6 → cz = 3 - 2 =1.\n\nCompute L and U:\n\nL = max(1, S - C =3-2=1) →1.\n\nU = min(2, S - B =3 -2=1) →1.\n\ncount_pairs is 1-1 +1=1 → 1 * 1=1 added.\n\nS=4:\n\nS>2 yes. cz is 4 -2 =2.\n\nL = max(1, 4-2=2) →2.\n\nU = min(2, 4-2=2) →2. count_pairs is 1 → 1*2=2 added.\n\nTotal is 1+2=3. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output 1.\n\nS_min = 500000 + 500000 = 1e6.\n\nS_max = 500000 + 500000 = 1e6.\n\nSo S is 1e6.\n\nCheck if S > C (500000). Yes.\n\nCheck if S >= D +1? D is 500000, D+1 is 500001. S is 1e6 which is larger. So cz = D - C +1 = 500000 - 500000 +1 =1.\n\nCompute L and U:\n\nL = max(A=500000, S - C = 1e6 - 500000 = 500000) →500000.\n\nU = min(B=500000, S - B = 1e6 -500000 = 500000) →500000.\n\ncount_pairs is 1 → 1 *1=1. Correct.\n\nSo the approach works for samples.\n\nNow, the code needs to implement this logic.\n\nBut how to loop through S from S_min to S_max?\n\nBut for large values (like up to 1e6), looping is acceptable. Because 1e6 iterations is manageable in Python.\n\nNow, the steps in code:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute S_min = A + B\n\nS_max = B + C\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nLoop S from S_min to S_max:\n\n   if S <= C:\n\n       continue\n\n   else:\n\n       if S >= D + 1:\n\n           cz = D - C + 1\n\n       else:\n\n           cz = S - C\n\n       # compute L and U\n\n       L = max(A, S - C)\n\n       U = min(B, S - B)\n\n       if L > U:\n\n           continue\n\n       else:\n\n           count_pairs = U - L + 1\n\n           total += count_pairs * cz\n\nreturn total\n\nBut wait, what about S - B?\n\nWait, for the upper bound of x: x must be ≤ S - B, because y = S -x must be ≥ B → S -x ≥ B → x ≤ S - B.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase when C is very small. For example, when C is less than S_min. For example, if A=1, B=2, C=2, D=... Then S_min is 3, which is larger than C=2. So for all S >=3, which is S > C.\n\nAnother case: when S - C is less than A. For example, S is 3, C is 2. Then S - C is 1. So L is max(A, 1). If A is 2, then L is 2. So for example, if S is 3, C is 2, A is 2, B is 2. Then S - B is 3 - 2 = 1. So U is min(B=2, 1) → 1. Then L=2, U=1 → no solution.\n\nSo code correctly skips.\n\nAnother edge case: when S - B is less than A. For example, S is 4, B is 2. S - B is 2. If A is 3, then L is max(3, ...) which is 3. U is min(B=2, 2) → 2. So L > U, so no count.\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input. For each test case (but the input is one line, but the sample shows multiple test cases? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is given as four integers on the first line. The sample shows multiple input lines, but in the problem statement, the input is the first line containing four integers. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input says:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nBut in the sample input, it's given as:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should read multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is three lines, each line being a test case. The output is three lines, each line being the answer for the respective test case.\n\nWait, but the original problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each given in a line.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as four integers. However, the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each line being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem's input description says:\n\nThe first line contains four integers... So perhaps the sample input is given as three separate test cases, each on their own line. So the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate test case.\n\nBut the original problem's input is one line. However, the sample shows multiple lines. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines from input, each line being a separate test case.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers. However, in the sample input, there are three lines. So perhaps the problem allows multiple test cases, and the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, and compute the answer for each.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. However, the sample input shows three lines. This might be a mistake in the problem statement, but looking at the sample input and output, it's clear that the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem's input is a single test case, but the sample shows multiple lines for illustration. However, the problem's sample input shows that the code must read multiple lines. Therefore, the code must read each line from stdin, process each as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem's input says that the first line contains four integers. However, the sample input shows that there are multiple lines. So perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, and for each line, process the four numbers.\n\nIn any case, the code should read all lines from stdin, split into four integers per line, and process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement's sample input, the first example input is \"1 2 3 4\", which outputs 4. So the code must process each line as a separate test case.\n\nThus, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nNow, coding that.\n\nBut for the code, the main part is the function that computes the answer for given A, B, C, D.\n\nSo, let's code that function.\n\nNow, in Python, the code could look like this:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_triangles(A, B, C, D):\n    total = 0\n    S_min = A + B\n    S_max = B + C\n    for S in range(S_min, S_max + 1):\n        if S <= C:\n            continue\n        if S >= D + 1:\n            cz = D - C + 1\n        else:\n            cz = S - C\n        # compute L and U\n        L = max(A, S - C)\n        U = min(B, S - B)\n        if L > U:\n            continue\n        count_pairs = U - L + 1\n        total += count_pairs * cz\n    return total\n\nThen, read each line from input, split into A, B, C, D, call this function and print the result.\n\nBut let's test this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4 → returns 4. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 1 2 2 5 → returns 3. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → returns 1. Correct.\n\nBut what about when S_max is very big?\n\nBut in Python, looping from S_min to S_max can be O(1e6) steps, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut what about when A=1, B=5e5, C=5e5, D=5e5. Then S_min is 1 + 5e5 = 500001, S_max is 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6. So the loop runs 5e5 times. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut for the worst case, when B and C are 5e5 each, S_max is 1e6. So the loop runs 1e6 times. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, a loop of 1e6 steps is okay, as each step is simple.\n\nBut for some cases, the S_min can be larger than S_max? No. Because S_min is A + B, and S_max is B + C. Since A ≤ B ≤ C, then A + B ≤ B + C. So S_min ≤ S_max.\n\nSo the loop is correct.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut also, note that in Python, for large ranges, using range(S_min, S_max + 1) can be a problem if S_max is up to 1e6. But for 1e6, it's manageable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead from stdin:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        total = 0\n        S_min = A + B\n        S_max = B + C\n        for S in range(S_min, S_max + 1):\n            if S <= C:\n                continue\n            if S >= D + 1:\n                cz = D - C + 1\n            else:\n                cz = S - C\n            L = max(A, S - C)\n            U = min(B, S - B)\n            if L > U:\n                continue\n            count_pairs = U - L + 1\n            total += count_pairs * cz\n        print(total)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the third case is 500000 500000 500000 500000. Let's compute:\n\nS_min = 500000 + 500000 = 1e6.\n\nS_max = 500000 + 500000 = 1e6.\n\nSo S is 1e6.\n\nCheck if S > C (500000). Yes.\n\nCheck if S >= D + 1 → D is 500000, D+1 is 500001. S is 1e6 which is >= 500001 → cz = D - C +1 = 500000 - 500000 + 1 = 1.\n\nL = max(500000, S - C = 1e6 - 500000 = 500000) → 500000.\n\nU = min(500000, S - B = 1e6 - 500000 = 500000) → 500000.\n\ncount_pairs is 1 → 1 * 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: when A=2, B=2, C=2, D=2. Then S_min is 4, S_max is 4. S=4. C is 2. So S > C. cz is S >= D+1? D is 2, D+1=3. 4 >=3 → cz = 2-2+1=1. L = max(2, 4-2=2) →2. U = min(2, 4-2=2) →2. count_pairs = 1. total is 1. Which is correct, as the only possible triangle is (2,2,2).\n\nAnother case: A=1, B=3, C=3, D=3. So S ranges from 1+3=4 to 3+3=6.\n\nFor S=4: check if > C (3). Yes. cz: S=4, D=3. So S >= D+1? D+1 is 4. S=4 is equal. So cz is 3-3+1=1. Compute L and U:\n\nL = max(1, 4 - 3=1) →1. U = min(3, 4-3=1) →1. count_pairs is 1. So contribution is 1*1=1.\n\nFor S=5: cz is D - C +1 = 1. L = max(1, 5-3=2). U = min(3, 5-3=2). So L=2, U=2 → count_pairs 1 → 1*1=1.\n\nFor S=6: same as S=5. cz is 1. L = max(1, 6-3=3). U = min(3, 6-3=3). count_pairs 1 → 1*1=1. So total is 3.\n\nWhat are the possible triangles?\n\nx can be 1, 2, 3. y can be 3. z can be 3.\n\nFor x=1, y=3: z must be < 1+3=4. So z can be 3. So (1,3,3) → valid.\n\nFor x=2, y=3 → z must be <5 → 3. So (2,3,3).\n\nFor x=3, y=3 → z must be <6 → 3. So (3,3,3).\n\nSo three triangles. Which matches the code's calculation. So code works.\n\nAnother test case: A=1, B=1, C=2, D=3. What's the answer?\n\nPossible x is 1, y is between 1 and 2. So y can be 1 or 2.\n\nz is between 2 and 3.\n\nFor each (x,y):\n\nx=1, y=1: S = 2. C is 2. So S must be > C → 2>2 is false. So no contribution.\n\nx=1, y=2: S=3. Which is > C=2. cz: S=3. D=3. D+1=4. So S=3 <4 → cz = 3 - 2 =1. So z can be 2 or 3? Wait, no. For S=3, z must be <3. So z can be 2. Because z is >= C=2. So z can be 2. So count_z is 1. So for this (x,y), count_pairs is 1, multiplied by 1 → 1.\n\nSo total is 1.\n\nBut what about other possibilities?\n\nx=1, y=2, z can be 2 or 3?\n\nWait, the condition is x + y > z. For x=1, y=2, z can be 2 or 3?\n\nWait, z must be between 2 and 3 (C=2, D=3). So z can be 2 or 3.\n\nBut x + y = 3. So for z to be valid, 3 > z. So z can be 2. 3>2 → yes. 3>3 → no. So only z=2 is valid. So count_z is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo code's calculation is correct.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut in the code, the for loop for S in range(S_min, S_max + 1). But when S_max is up to 1e6, and for each line, this is O(1e6) steps. But for multiple test cases, this could be slow. However, given that the constraints are up to 5e5, and per test case, the code runs in O(1e6) steps, which for Python may be acceptable for the problem's time constraints. However, perhaps we can optimize further.\n\nBut for the purposes of solving the problem, this approach is acceptable.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nBut in the code, the loop is for S in range(S_min, S_max + 1). However, in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper limit. So range(a, b) includes a, a+1,..., b-1. So to include S_max, the code uses range(S_min, S_max + 1). Correct.\n\nAnother thing to note is that when S_max is very large, but for some cases, the code may take a long time. However, given that the constraints are up to 5e5, and S_max is up to 1e6, this is manageable.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy the conditions $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The key insight is to use the triangle inequality theorem, which states that for a triangle with sides $x \\leq y \\leq z$, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side, i.e., $x + y > z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: Given the constraints $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$, we need to consider all valid combinations of $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $x + y > z$.\n2. **Sum Range Calculation**: For each possible sum $S = x + y$, we determine the valid range of $S$ values (from $A + B$ to $B + C$) and check if they can form valid triangles with $z$ values in the range $[C, D]$.\n3. **Efficient Counting**: For each valid sum $S$, calculate the number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs and the corresponding valid $z$ values efficiently using arithmetic ranges and conditions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        total = 0\n        S_min = A + B\n        S_max = B + C\n        for S in range(S_min, S_max + 1):\n            if S <= C:\n                continue\n            if S >= D + 1:\n                cz = D - C + 1\n            else:\n                cz = S - C\n            L = max(A, S - C)\n            U = min(B, S - B)\n            if L > U:\n                continue\n            count_pairs = U - L + 1\n            total += count_pairs * cz\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines from standard input, each containing four integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n2. **Range Calculation**: For each test case, compute the minimum and maximum possible values of $S = x + y$ (i.e., $S_{\\text{min}} = A + B$ and $S_{\\text{max}} = B + C$).\n3. **Valid Sum Check**: For each sum $S$ within the calculated range, check if it can form a valid triangle with $z$ values in the range $[C, D]$.\n4. **Count Valid Pairs**: For each valid $S$, determine the number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs and the corresponding count of valid $z$ values. This is done by checking bounds and using arithmetic to avoid iterating through all possible values explicitly.\n5. **Accumulate Results**: Sum the contributions of all valid $(x, y, z)$ combinations to get the total number of non-degenerate triangles for each test case.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation by leveraging arithmetic range checks and avoiding unnecessary iterations, making it feasible even for large input sizes.",
