Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about Leha wanting to choose two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x days, and they don't overlap. And we need to find the minimal total cost of such a pair. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the constraints. Each voucher has a duration of ri - li + 1. So for two vouchers i and j, their durations must sum to x. Also, they must not overlap. Which means either the first ends before the second starts, or vice versa.\n\nThe input has n vouchers, and x is given. The output is the minimal sum of costs for two such vouchers, or -1.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think about possible steps:\n\nFirst, for each voucher, compute its duration. Then, for each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with duration (x - duration_i), and that they don't overlap.\n\nBut checking all pairs would be O(n²), which is not feasible when n is up to 2e5. So that approach would be too slow.\n\nWe need a more efficient way.\n\nLet me think: For each voucher, we can look for vouchers with a specific duration (like x - duration_i). But how to find those vouchers that don't overlap with the current one?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can group vouchers by their duration. For example, create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we can check if there's a voucher with duration (x - d) that doesn't overlap with it.\n\nBut even then, for each voucher, how do we efficiently find the minimal cost voucher in the other group that doesn't overlap?\n\nLet's think about the case where we have two durations d1 and d2, such that d1 + d2 = x. For each voucher of duration d1, we need to find a voucher of duration d2 that doesn't overlap with it. And among all such pairs, find the minimal sum.\n\nSo, for each voucher i with duration d, we need to find the minimum cost of a voucher j with duration (x - d) that ends before li (so that j ends before i starts) or starts after ri (so that i ends before j starts). \n\nBut how to efficiently find that?\n\nMaybe for each duration, we can pre-process the vouchers sorted by their end time and start time. For example, for vouchers of duration d2, we can have them sorted by their end time. Then, for a voucher i with duration d1, we can check for vouchers of duration d2 that end before li. The earliest possible ones would have the earliest end times, but we need the minimal cost. Or maybe for each duration, we can keep track of the minimal cost for vouchers that end before a certain day, or start after a certain day.\n\nWait, here's an idea:\n\nFor each duration d, we can pre-process two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers' end times, along with their minimal cost up to that end time. So for vouchers of duration d, sorted by their end time, and for each position, we can have the minimum cost from the start up to that point. This would help us quickly find the minimal cost voucher of duration d that ends before a certain day.\n\nSimilarly, another sorted list of vouchers' start times, and for each position, the minimal cost from that point onwards. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have vouchers of duration d2. For a given voucher i with duration d1, and x = d1 + d2, we want to find vouchers of duration d2 that end before li (so that they don't overlap with i's start). Or start after ri (so that they don't overlap with i's end).\n\nSo, for each voucher i, we can check:\n\n1. Find the minimal cost of a voucher of duration (x - d_i) that ends before l_i. Because that voucher would end before i starts (since l_i is the start of i). So the first condition is r_j < l_i.\n\nOR\n\n2. Find the minimal cost of a voucher of duration (x - d_i) that starts after r_i. Because that voucher would start after i ends, so r_i < l_j.\n\nSo, for each voucher i, we need to find the minimal cost of vouchers of duration (x - d_i) that satisfy either of these two conditions.\n\nIf we can find that, then for each voucher i, we can compute the minimal possible pair with some voucher j, and then take the overall minimum across all such pairs.\n\nNow, how to efficiently find these minima?\n\nLet me think about the first case: vouchers of duration d2 that end before l_i. For this, we can pre-process for each d2, a sorted list of end times, and for each end time, keep track of the minimum cost up to that point. Then, for a given l_i, we can perform a binary search on the end times of vouchers with duration d2 to find the largest end time that is less than l_i. Then, the minimum cost up to that point would be the minimal cost for vouchers that end before l_i.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case: vouchers of duration d2 that start after r_i. For this, we can pre-process for each d2, a sorted list of start times, and for each start time, keep track of the minimum cost from that start time onwards. Then, for a given r_i, we can perform a binary search on the start times of vouchers with duration d2 to find the smallest start time that is greater than r_i. Then, the minimum cost from that point onwards would be the minimal cost for vouchers that start after r_i.\n\nBut how to structure this data?\n\nLet me think. For each duration d, we can have:\n\n- A list of vouchers sorted by their end time. Then, for each position in this list, we can have a prefix minimum array. So, for example, if the list is sorted by end time, then prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers. Then, when we want to find the minimal cost of vouchers with end time <= some value, we can find the largest end time <= that value using binary search, and then get the prefix_min at that index.\n\nSimilarly, for the start times: for vouchers of duration d, sorted by their start time, and a suffix min array. For example, suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost among vouchers from index i to the end. Then, for a given r_i, we can find the first start time >= r_i + 1 (since the voucher's start must be after r_i). Then, the suffix_min at that index would give the minimal cost for vouchers starting after r_i.\n\nWait, but the start time of voucher j must be > r_i. So, the start time of j must be >= r_i + 1.\n\nSo for the second case, for vouchers of duration d2, sorted by start time, we can find the first start time that is >= r_i + 1. All vouchers from that index onwards have start time >= r_i + 1, so they are non-overlapping with voucher i.\n\nSo, for each duration d, we need two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by end time, with prefix minima.\n- Sorted by start time, with suffix minima.\n\nBut how to build these structures?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. So, create a dictionary, say, duration_map, where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration.\n\n2. For each duration d in duration_map, process the vouchers:\n\n   a. Sort them by end time (ri). Then, create a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers in this sorted list.\n\n   b. Also sort them by start time (li). Then, create a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost among vouchers from i to the end of the list.\n\nOnce these structures are built, for any voucher i with duration d1, we can check if x - d1 is present in duration_map. If not, skip. Otherwise, for the duration d2 = x - d1, we can query the two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: Find vouchers of duration d2 that end before l_i. So, in the sorted end time list for d2, find the largest end time <= l_i - 1. Then, if such a voucher exists, take the prefix_min at that index.\n\nCase 2: Find vouchers of duration d2 that start after r_i. So, in the sorted start time list for d2, find the first start time >= r_i + 1. Then, if such a voucher exists, take the suffix_min at that index.\n\nThen, for each voucher i, the minimal possible cost for case 1 and case 2 are considered, and the minimum between them (if any) is added to the current voucher's cost, and we track the overall minimum.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize min_total = infinity.\n\nFor each voucher i:\n\n   d1 = ri - li + 1\n\n   d2 = x - d1\n\n   if d2 not in duration_map: continue\n\n   else:\n\n      check case 1: find vouchers of duration d2 ending before l_i.\n\n         get the min cost from case 1.\n\n      check case 2: find vouchers of duration d2 starting after r_i.\n\n         get the min cost from case 2.\n\n      if either case 1 or case 2 has a valid min cost:\n\n         current_min = cost_i + min_case1_or_case2\n\n         if current_min < min_total:\n\n             min_total = current_min\n\nAfter processing all vouchers, if min_total is still infinity, output -1, else output min_total.\n\nBut wait, there's a problem here. For each voucher i, when checking case 1 and case 2, we need to consider vouchers j that are different from i. Because the problem states that i and j must be different vouchers.\n\nSo, for example, if a voucher i has duration d1, and d2 = x -d1. Suppose there is only one voucher j with duration d2, and it's the same as voucher i. Then, we can't use it. So, during the query, we need to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as i.\n\nBut how can that happen? Well, if the voucher i's duration is d1, and d2 = x -d1, and d1 + d2 = x. Then, if d1 = d2, then x must be 2*d1. So, for example, if x is even and d1 is half of x. Then, voucher i could be paired with itself, but only if there are at least two vouchers with that duration.\n\nBut in our code, when we process voucher i, and check for vouchers of duration d2, which may be same as d1, we need to ensure that when we find the minimal cost, it's not the same voucher.\n\nThis adds a bit of complexity.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nWell, during the preprocessing, for each duration d, the list of vouchers includes all vouchers with that duration. So, for example, if voucher i is part of that list, then when querying for the min cost, we need to exclude voucher i itself if it's the only one in the list.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, considering that for each voucher i, when checking for vouchers j with duration d2, which may be same as d1, but we need to make sure that j is not i.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nAn alternative approach is to allow the code to include voucher i in the possible candidates, but then during the check, if the voucher j is i, then we can't take it. But since we're looking for pairs (i,j) where i != j, we need to ensure that.\n\nBut this seems tricky. Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose there are two vouchers with same duration d. Both have same start and end times. Then, when processing voucher i, the code would look for vouchers of duration d2 = x -d1 = d. So, during the query, if we find that the minimal cost is voucher i itself, but there's another voucher j with same duration, then we can take j. But how to know that?\n\nAlternatively, during the query, when we find the minimal cost, we need to check if there is at least one voucher in the list that is not i. But how?\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe the easiest way is to allow the code to find the minimal cost, but subtract the case where the voucher is the same as i. However, this may not be straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, when we process voucher i, and look for vouchers of duration d2, which is x - d1, and during the query, if the minimal cost comes from voucher i itself, but there's another voucher in the same duration group, then that's allowed. However, if the duration group has only one voucher (which is i), then we cannot pair it with itself.\n\nSo, perhaps during the query, when we find the minimal cost, we need to check whether there's more than one voucher in that duration group. But how?\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps we can handle this by, during the query, when we find the minimal cost, check if the voucher is the same as the current voucher. If yes, then check if there are other vouchers in the group. If there are, then we can take the next minimal cost.\n\nBut this would complicate the code.\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration d, we can have multiple entries. So, when processing voucher i, during the query, we can find the minimal cost, but if the voucher i is the only one in the duration group, then we can't use it. However, if there are multiple vouchers in the group, then even if the minimal is voucher i, there's another voucher that can be used.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the query, when we find the minimal cost, we can check if that minimal cost is achieved by a voucher that is not the current voucher i. However, how to do that?\n\nThis seems quite involved, and perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think again.\n\nThe problem says that the two vouchers must be different. However, when we process each voucher i, and check for vouchers j with duration d2, we need to make sure that j is not i. But during the query for vouchers of duration d2, we can include all vouchers except i. But how?\n\nBut during the preprocessing, for each duration d, we have a list of vouchers. When processing voucher i, which has duration d1, and d2 = x -d1, and if d2 is same as d1 (i.e., x is 2*d1), then during the query, we need to find the minimal cost among all vouchers of duration d2 (which is same as d1) except i.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems challenging. One approach is to, for each voucher i, during the query, check if the voucher j that gives the minimal cost is not i. If it is, then see if there are other vouchers in the group.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nPerhaps, for each duration d, during the query, when we find the minimal cost, we can check if there are multiple vouchers in the group. For example, if the duration group has multiple vouchers, then even if the minimal cost is voucher i, there's another voucher in the group that can be used. However, if the duration group has only one voucher (voucher i), then we can't use it.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps the problem allows for the same voucher to be considered in the query. But since the code is processing all vouchers, including i, but during the query, the voucher j can be i, but in that case, we need to avoid that.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative Idea: For each voucher i, when we check for vouchers j with duration d2, we can check if the voucher j is different from i. But how to do that?\n\nAnother Idea: Since the code processes each voucher i, and for each i, looks for j in the duration group. But during the query, when we find the minimal cost, we can check if that minimal cost is from a voucher that is not i. However, how to track that?\n\nBut perhaps, during the preprocessing, for each duration d, we have sorted lists, and for each sorted list, we can have a prefix min and suffix min. However, those minima may be from any voucher in the group. So, if during the query, the minimal cost is from the current voucher i, then we need to see if there's another voucher with the same minimal cost in the group.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the query, when we find the minimal cost, we can check if there's at least one voucher in the group that is not i. If yes, then proceed. Otherwise, ignore that case.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that during the query, the minimal cost is found. Let's say that the minimal cost is m. Now, for the case where the duration group has multiple vouchers, then even if the minimal is from voucher i, there's another voucher with the same m. So, the code can proceed. However, if the duration group has only one voucher (voucher i), then we can't take it.\n\nBut how to know if the duration group has more than one voucher?\n\nSo, for each duration d, we can precompute the count of vouchers. So, during the query, if d2 is same as d1, and the count of vouchers in duration d2 is 1, then we can't use that voucher (because it's the same as i). Otherwise, if count >= 2, then even if the minimal is from i, there's another voucher.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nBut this seems possible. So, during the query for case 1 and case 2, when we find a possible minimal cost, we need to check if the duration group for d2 has more than one voucher. If not, then we can't use that voucher. But how to know if the current voucher i is the only one in the group?\n\nBut perhaps, when we process voucher i, and during the query, we find that the duration group has only one voucher (i itself), then we can't use it. Otherwise, if there are multiple vouchers, then even if the minimal is from i, there's another one.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, during the query, when we find the minimal cost, we can check if the voucher j is different from i. However, since the code is processing voucher i, and the query is for vouchers of duration d2, which may include i, but we need to exclude it.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems like a problem. Perhaps the easiest way is to process all vouchers, and for each voucher i, when checking for vouchers j in the duration group, we can check if the voucher j is not i. However, since the duration group is stored as a list, perhaps during the query, we can find the minimal cost excluding voucher i.\n\nBut that would complicate the preprocessing steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the same voucher to be considered twice, but during the code's processing, the pair (i, j) would be considered once when processing i and once when processing j. However, since we are looking for pairs (i, j) where i != j, and during the code's processing, when voucher i is processed, the j's are checked, but if j is i, then it's invalid. So, during the code's processing, when a voucher i is being considered, and the query finds a voucher j which is i, then that pair is invalid and should be skipped.\n\nBut how to check if the voucher j is i?\n\nThis seems difficult, because during the query, we are getting the minimal cost, not the actual voucher.\n\nHmm. Maybe this is a problem that can be handled by considering that the minimal cost may come from voucher i. However, if that's the case, then we need to check if there exists another voucher in the same duration group that is not i and meets the criteria.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process all vouchers, and for each voucher i, when checking for vouchers j, we can consider all vouchers in the group except i. But this would require modifying the data structures to exclude i during the query. Which would be computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be handled by allowing the code to consider j = i, but then during the final check, we can verify that i and j are different. However, since we are looking for pairs (i, j), and the code checks all possible i and j, perhaps during the processing, when voucher i is considered, and during the query, the code finds voucher j which is i, then that pair would be invalid. But since the code is processing voucher i, and j is i, then it's invalid. So, in that case, the code would have to ignore that possibility.\n\nBut how to detect that?\n\nThis seems very complicated. However, perhaps the number of cases where j = i is very small. For example, when x is even and the voucher's duration is x/2. So, when processing voucher i, and looking for vouchers j with duration x/2, which includes voucher i itself. But if there's another voucher j with the same duration and non-overlapping with i, then it's acceptable.\n\nBut during the query, the code would find the minimal cost, which could be from voucher i. However, since that's not allowed, the code would have to check if there are other vouchers in the group that meet the criteria.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems really tricky. Maybe there's a way to avoid this problem. Let's think again: when processing voucher i, we are looking for j's that are different from i. So, for the case where d2 = x -d1, and during the query, we find a minimal cost, but that minimal cost is from voucher i, then we need to check if there are other vouchers in the group that meet the criteria.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the query, we can find the minimal cost, and then check if the voucher j that achieves this minimal cost is not i. If it is, then we need to find the next minimal cost in the group that is not i. However, this would require more complex data structures.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps we can proceed under the assumption that the problem is manageable, and that the code will pass all test cases even if there are some edge cases where j = i is considered. However, that's risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the same voucher to be considered twice. For example, if there are two vouchers with same duration and same start/end times. Then, during the query, the code would find that voucher i can be paired with another voucher j (same as i) which is allowed. But if there's only one voucher, then it's not allowed.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose n=2, x=4, and both vouchers have duration 2. Each voucher has li=1, ri=2, cost 1. Then, the two vouchers can be paired. So, during processing voucher 1, when looking for vouchers of duration 2 (since x=4, d1=2, d2=2), the code would check for vouchers that end before l_i (1) or start after r_i (2). For voucher 1, l_i is 1, so vouchers ending before 1 would have ri < 1, but none. Vouchers starting after 2 would have li > 2. The second voucher has li=1, which is not > 2. So, no. Therefore, during processing voucher 1, no valid j is found. However, during processing voucher 2, the same situation occurs. But in reality, the two vouchers are non-overlapping? No, because both have ri=2 and li=1. So they overlap. Hence, they can't be paired. So the answer would be -1. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but in this case, the two vouchers have the same start and end times. So they overlap. Hence, they can't be paired. So the code would correctly return -1.\n\nAnother example: suppose voucher 1 has li=1, ri=2, cost 1. Voucher 2 has li=3, ri=4, cost 1. x=4. Each has duration 2. So d1=2, d2=2. For voucher 1, during case 1: check vouchers of duration 2 that end before l_i=1. None. Case 2: check vouchers of duration 2 that start after r_i=2. Voucher 2 starts at 3>2. So it's valid. The cost is 1. So the total cost is 1+1=2. Similarly for voucher 2. So the code would find this pair.\n\nIn this case, during processing voucher 1, the code would find voucher 2, which is different. So no problem.\n\nSo, the problem arises only when the voucher j is the same as i. For example, if there is only one voucher in the group, but during the query, the code thinks that there is a voucher j (which is i itself) that meets the criteria. But since it's the same voucher, it's invalid.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet's take an example where voucher i is the only one in the group. So, during processing voucher i, when looking for vouchers of duration d2=x-d1, which is same as d1. For example, x=4, voucher i has duration 2. There's only one voucher. Then, during case 2, the code would check for vouchers of duration 2 that start after r_i. But since there's only one voucher (i itself), which starts at l_i=1, which is not after r_i=2. So no. Hence, the code would not consider this case. Thus, no problem.\n\nAnother example: x=4, voucher i has duration 2. There's another voucher j with same duration and same start/end times. So during processing voucher i, when checking for vouchers of duration 2 that start after r_i. Since voucher j has same start and end times as i, which is 1 and 2. So, j's start is 1, which is not after 2. So no. Hence, the code would not consider it. So, the code would not find any valid pairs.\n\nThus, in this scenario, the code would not select j=i as a valid pair, because the voucher j=i would not satisfy the non-overlapping condition.\n\nWait, but what if the voucher j is i itself, but the non-overlapping condition is satisfied?\n\nIs there a scenario where a voucher i's duration is d1, and during the query, we look for vouchers j with duration d2=x-d1, and j is i itself, and they don't overlap?\n\nThat would require that voucher i's start and end times are such that it doesn't overlap with itself. Which is impossible. Because a voucher overlaps with itself.\n\nTherefore, during the query, when we are looking for vouchers j that are non-overlapping with i, the voucher j cannot be i itself. Because the voucher i's start and end times would overlap with itself.\n\nThus, during the query, even if the code considers the voucher j=i, it would not satisfy the non-overlapping condition. Hence, the code can safely ignore the possibility of j=i, because such a case would not satisfy the non-overlapping condition.\n\nTherefore, during the query, the code does not have to worry about j=i being considered, because even if it is, it would not satisfy the non-overlapping condition.\n\nWait, let's think again. Suppose voucher i has li=1, ri=2. Then, during case 1, the code is looking for vouchers j with end time < li=1. Since voucher i's end time is 2, which is not less than 1. So, voucher i is not considered in case 1. Similarly, during case 2, the code looks for vouchers j with start time > ri=2. Voucher i's start time is 1, which is not > 2. So, voucher i is not considered in case 2. Hence, during the query, the code would not consider j=i as a candidate. Thus, the code can safely proceed without worrying about j=i.\n\nAh! That's a crucial insight. Because when we are processing voucher i, during case 1, we are looking for vouchers j with end time < li. Voucher i's end time is ri, which is >= li (since li <= ri). So, voucher i's end time is not less than li. Hence, during case 1, j cannot be i. Similarly, during case 2, we are looking for vouchers j with start time > ri. Voucher i's start time is li, which is <= ri. Hence, voucher i's start time is not > ri. Thus, during case 2, j cannot be i. Therefore, during the query, j cannot be i. Hence, the code can proceed without worrying about j=i.\n\nThat's a relief! So, the earlier problem of j=i is automatically handled. Because during the query, the code is looking for vouchers j that are non-overlapping with i. Since j=i would overlap with i, it's not included in the query results. Hence, no need to worry about j=i.\n\nSo, this simplifies the code. We don't have to worry about j=i because during the query, the code is looking for vouchers j that are non-overlapping with i. Hence, j cannot be i.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as outlined earlier, without worrying about j=i.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic.\n\nLet's outline the steps again:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each duration, store two sorted lists:\n\n   a. Sorted by end time (ri), with prefix minima.\n\n   b. Sorted by start time (li), with suffix minima.\n\nThen, for each voucher i:\n\n   d1 = ri - li + 1\n\n   d2 = x - d1\n\n   if d2 is not in duration_map, skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      process case 1: find vouchers in duration d2 with end time < li.\n\n         in the sorted end time list for d2, find the largest end time <= li - 1.\n\n         if exists, take the prefix_min at that index.\n\n      process case 2: find vouchers in duration d2 with start time > ri.\n\n         in the sorted start time list for d2, find the first start time >= ri + 1.\n\n         if exists, take the suffix_min at that index.\n\n      if either case 1 or case 2 has a valid value, add to current voucher's cost and update the global minimum.\n\nSo, how to implement the binary searches?\n\nFor case 1: For the sorted list of end times (sorted_end_times), we can perform a binary search for the value (li - 1). The largest end time <= li - 1 is the target.\n\nFor example, in Python, we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point, then subtract 1.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: For the sorted list of start times (sorted_start_times), we can perform a bisect_left to find the first start time >= (ri + 1). Then, if that index is within the list, take the suffix_min at that index.\n\nNow, let's think about how to build the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nFor example, for the sorted_end_times list (sorted by end time):\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], current voucher's cost)\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_start_times list (sorted by start time):\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], current voucher's cost)\n\nSo, for the prefix_min array:\n\nsorted_end = sorted(vouchers by end time)\nprefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_end)\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0].cost\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_end)-1:\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for the suffix_min array:\n\nsorted_start = sorted(vouchers by start time)\nsuffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start)\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1].cost\nfor i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i].cost)\n\nOnce these arrays are built, during the queries, we can quickly find the minima.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nEach duration in duration_map will have:\n\n- sorted_end: list of vouchers sorted by end time.\n\n- prefix_min: array of minima for the sorted_end list.\n\n- sorted_start: list of vouchers sorted by start time.\n\n- suffix_min: array of minima for the sorted_start list.\n\nSo, for each duration d, we can precompute these.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n vouchers. For each voucher, compute duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nThen, build duration_map, which maps duration to a list of vouchers.\n\nFor each duration d in duration_map:\n\n   sort the vouchers by end time (ri) and compute prefix_min.\n\n   sort the vouchers by start time (li) and compute suffix_min.\n\nStore these in the duration_map.\n\nThen, for each voucher in the original list:\n\n   compute d1 = duration.\n\n   d2 = x - d1.\n\n   if d2 not in duration_map: continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      process case 1 and case 2.\n\nFor case 1:\n\n   get the sorted_end list for d2.\n\n   target_end = li - 1.\n\n   find the largest end time <= target_end.\n\n   if found:\n\n      min_cost_case1 = prefix_min[index]\n\nFor case 2:\n\n   get the sorted_start list for d2.\n\n   target_start = ri + 1.\n\n   find the first start time >= target_start.\n\n   if found:\n\n      min_cost_case2 = suffix_min[index]\n\nThen, take the min between case1 and case2, add to current voucher's cost, and update the global min.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to handle the binary search?\n\nImplementing the binary search for case 1:\n\nFor the sorted_end list, which is sorted in increasing order of end time.\n\nWe can extract the end times into a separate list, say, end_times = [v.end for v in sorted_end].\n\nThen, for target_end, use bisect_right(end_times, target_end) - 1.\n\nIf the result is >=0, then the prefix_min at that index is the min cost.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2:\n\nsorted_start list is sorted by start time. Extract start_times = [v.start for v in sorted_start].\n\ntarget_start = ri + 1.\n\nUse bisect_left(start_times, target_start) to find the first index where start_time >= target_start.\n\nIf the index is < len(start_times), then the suffix_min at that index is the min cost.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\nimport bisect\n\nfor case 1:\n\nend_times = [voucher.ri for voucher in sorted_end_list]\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, target_end) - 1\n\nif index >= 0:\n\n   min_case1 = prefix_min[index]\n\nelse:\n\n   min_case1 = infinity\n\nSimilarly for case 2:\n\nstart_times = [voucher.li for voucher in sorted_start_list]\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, target_start)\n\nif index < len(start_times):\n\n   min_case2 = suffix_min[index]\n\nelse:\n\n   min_case2 = infinity\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these steps.\n\nNow, considering the data structures, for each duration, we need to store:\n\nsorted_end_list, prefix_min, sorted_start_list, suffix_min.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps for each duration, we can store:\n\na tuple (sorted_end, prefix_min, sorted_start, suffix_min).\n\nBut how to build this?\n\nLet me think of the code structure.\n\nOnce the vouchers are read, for each duration d in duration_map:\n\n   vouchers_d = duration_map[d]\n\n   sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\n   end_times = [v.ri for v in sorted_end]\n\n   prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_end)\n\n   prefix_min[0] = sorted_end[0].cost\n\n   for i in 1 to len(sorted_end)-1:\n\n       prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_end[i].cost)\n\n   sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda v: v.li)\n\n   start_times = [v.li for v in sorted_start]\n\n   suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n\n   suffix_min[-1] = sorted_start[-1].cost\n\n   for i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n       suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_start[i].cost)\n\n   Then, store in duration_map for d:\n\n       (sorted_end, prefix_min, sorted_start, suffix_min)\n\nBut in Python, perhaps we can store for each duration d, a dictionary with keys 'sorted_end', 'prefix_min', etc. Or perhaps store as separate entries.\n\nBut for code efficiency, perhaps we can precompute these for each duration.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut first, let's think about the data structures for each voucher. We can represent each voucher as a tuple (li, ri, cost). Then, during preprocessing, for each duration, we can collect the vouchers.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen, read n lines, each line has li, ri, cost.\n\nvouchers = list of tuples (li, ri, cost)\n\nThen, duration_map is a defaultdict(list). For each voucher, compute duration = ri - li + 1. Add to duration_map[duration] the voucher.\n\nOnce that is done, for each duration d in duration_map, we process the vouchers as described.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nimport bisect\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers from a list such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preprocessing by Duration**: Group all vouchers by their duration. This allows us to efficiently check for pairs of vouchers whose durations sum up to the required value.\n2. **Sorting and Minimization**: For each duration, sort vouchers by their end time and start time. Additionally, compute prefix minimums for end-sorted lists and suffix minimums for start-sorted lists. This helps in quickly finding the minimum cost of non-overlapping vouchers.\n3. **Binary Search**: For each voucher, use binary search to efficiently determine if there exists another voucher with the required duration that does not overlap with the current voucher. This is done by checking two conditions: one where the other voucher ends before the current one starts, and another where the other voucher starts after the current one ends.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ri = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        cost = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    duration_map = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        duration_map[duration].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess each duration's data\n    preprocessed = dict()\n    for d in duration_map:\n        vouchers_d = duration_map[d]\n        # Sort by end time and compute prefix min\n        sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_end:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, v[2])\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        # Sort by start time and compute suffix min\n        sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_start)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        preprocessed[d] = (sorted_end, prefix_min, sorted_start, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d1 = ri - li + 1\n        d2 = x - d1\n        if d2 not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        # Case 1: find vouchers with duration d2 ending before li\n        sorted_end, prefix_min, sorted_start, suffix_min = preprocessed[d2]\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n        target_end = li - 1\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, target_end) - 1\n        if pos >= 0:\n            case1 = prefix_min[pos]\n        else:\n            case1 = float('inf')\n        # Case 2: find vouchers with duration d2 starting after ri\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n        target_start = ri + 1\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, target_start)\n        if pos < len(start_times):\n            case2 = suffix_min[pos]\n        else:\n            case2 = float('inf')\n        current_min = min(case1, case2)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = cost + current_min\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Preprocessing**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration. For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end times and start times, and prefix/suffix minimum costs are computed.\n- **Binary Search**: For each voucher, binary search is used to quickly find non-overlapping vouchers with the required duration.
