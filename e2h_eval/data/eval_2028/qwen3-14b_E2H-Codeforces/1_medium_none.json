    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate based on certain parameters. Let me try to understand the problem.\n\nThe plate is divided into w rows and h columns. We need to add k rings of gilding. The first ring is along the edge. The second is two cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring is one cell thick. The i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, right. Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so for each ring, the next inner rectangle is 4 less in both width and height. Like, for example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. Then the second ring is the perimeter of a rectangle that's 4 smaller in each dimension, so that the next ring is two steps in from the original edges.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), I need to compute the perimeter of that rectangle and sum them all up.\n\nBut wait, how do you calculate the perimeter of a rectangle? Well, for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter in cells would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because the perimeter is (W * 2) + (H * 2) - 4 (since the four corners are counted twice). Or maybe think of it as (W * 2) + (H - 2) * 2? No, wait, the formula for the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because for a rectangle, the perimeter in cells is the total cells on the borders. For example, a 3x3 rectangle has a perimeter of 8 cells (the outer ring). Which is 2*(3+3) -4 = 8. Correct. So yes, for each ring, the number of cells is 2*(current_width + current_height) - 4.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for each i from 1 to k, we calculate the perimeter of that rectangle and sum them all.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), compute the current width and height. Then compute the perimeter for that ring, and add it to the total.\n\nBut wait, let's check the examples.\n\nFirst example input is 3 3 1. So the first ring is the perimeter of 3x3. Which is 2*(3+3) -4 = 8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example input is 7 9 1. So the perimeter is 2*(7 + 9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 32-4=28. Which matches the output of 28. Correct.\n\nThird example is 7 9 2. So first ring is 7x9, perimeter 28. Second ring is (7 -4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1) = 9-4=5. So the rectangle is 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop for each of the k rings. For each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nWait, because 2*(current_w + current_h) -4 equals 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). So either way.\n\nBut wait, let me recheck: 2*(w + h) -4 = 2(w + h - 2). Yes. So the perimeter for each ring is 2*(current_w + current_h - 2).\n\nSo for each ring, compute that value and add to the total.\n\nBut we need to make sure that for each i, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Well, according to the input constraints, k is up to floor( (min(n,m)+1)/4 ). Wait, the input says that k is up to floor( (min(n,m)+1)/4 ), but n and m are w and h. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput constraints:\n\nk is between 1 and floor( (min(n, m) +1)/4 )\n\nWait, but for example, if w and h are 3, then min is 3, so (3+1)/4 is 1, so floor is 1. So k can be 1. Which makes sense, since for 3x3, the first ring is the perimeter, and the next would require 3 -4*(i-1) >= 3? For i=2, 3 -4*(1) = -1, which is invalid. So the input constraints ensure that for given k, each ring is possible.\n\nSo, the code can safely compute for each i from 1 to k, the current_w and current_h, and compute their perimeters.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nAdd perimeter to total.\n\nReturn total.\n\nWait, but let me test with the third example. For i=1, current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Then for i=2, current_w=7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=2. Then first ring is 5x5: perimeter 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Second ring: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. So perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 2*(0) = 0? Wait that can't be right. But according to the input constraints, k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). For w=5, h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So in this case, the input would not allow k=2. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code can proceed as described.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line as three integers w, h, k.\n\nThen compute the sum for each i from 1 to k of 2*( (w -4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) - 2 )\n\nBut perhaps we can simplify the formula. Let's see:\n\nFor each i, the term is 2*( (w + h - 8*(i-1)) - 2 ) ?\n\nWait, current_w + current_h = (w -4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) ) = w + h - 8*(i-1). Then subtract 2: (w + h - 8*(i-1) - 2). Multiply by 2.\n\nSo the perimeter for each ring is 2*(w + h - 8*(i-1) - 2) ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a formula that allows us to compute the sum without looping. But since k is small (since for w and h up to 100, the maximum k is floor( (100+1)/4 )=25. So even for maximum k=25, looping is trivial.\n\nSo the code can proceed with a loop.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead input as w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check for another case. Let's take w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is correct. For a 5x5 square, the perimeter is 5*4 -4 = 16 (since each side is 5, but corners are counted twice. So 5*4 -4 = 16). Correct.\n\nAnother example: let's say w=4, h=4, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(4+4-2) = 2*6=12. Which is correct. The perimeter of a 4x4 square is 4*4 - 4 (since each side has 4 cells, but the four corners are counted twice. So 4*4 - 4 = 12. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's check the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Let's compute:\n\ncurrent_w =3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 2*6= 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, handle the input. The input is given as three integers on one line. So in Python:\n\nWe can read the input line, split into parts, and convert to integers.\n\nSo:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute the sum as discussed.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, what about when k is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, k is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nEdge cases: when k is maximum allowed. For example, when min(w, h) is 3. Then k is 1. For example, 3x3, k=1. Which is handled.\n\nAnother case: when w and h are 7 and 7, k=2. Then:\n\nFirst ring: 7x7 → perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24.\n\nSecond ring: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2)= 2*4=8. Total is 24+8=32.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nThus, the Python code should be as follows.\n",
