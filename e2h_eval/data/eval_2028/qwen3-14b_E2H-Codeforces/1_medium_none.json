    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, the i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring takes away two cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the next inner rectangle would be 2 less in both width and height. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a ring around a rectangle, then the next inner rectangle would be (original width - 2) by (original height - 2). Because the ring is one cell thick. So for example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. The second ring would be the perimeter of the rectangle that's 2 cells in from each edge. So the dimensions of that inner rectangle would be (w - 2*2) by (h - 2*2)? Wait, no. Wait, the first ring is the outermost layer. Then the second ring is two cells in from the edge. So for the second ring, the rectangle that's being considered would be (original width - 2*2) in width and same for height? Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side. Wait, maybe for the i-th ring, the rectangle that it's the perimeter of is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1))? Because for the first ring, i=1, so it's w and h. For the second ring, i=2, so subtract 4*(2-1) =4 from each dimension. Wait, but that would be 4*(i-1) from each dimension. Wait, but why 4? Because for each ring, you take away two cells from each side. So for the first ring, the next inner rectangle would be (w - 2*2) by (h - 2*2) for the second ring. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 2*(i-1)*2) ? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the original rectangle is 7x9. For the first ring, it's the perimeter. The perimeter's area is 2*(7 + 9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 28? Wait, wait, the perimeter of a rectangle with width w and height h is 2*(w + h) - 4. Because each side is counted once. Wait, for example, a 3x3 rectangle: the perimeter is 4*3 -4 = 8, which matches the first example input where output is 8. So yes, the formula for the perimeter is 2*(w + h) -4. But for each ring, the perimeter is calculated for a rectangle that's smaller than the previous one.\n\nSo for the first ring, the perimeter is 2*(w + h) -4. Then, the next ring is 2 cells in from the edge. So the rectangle for the second ring would be (w - 4) by (h -4), since we subtract 2 from each side (left and right, top and bottom). So the perimeter for that would be 2*( (w-4) + (h-4) ) -4. And so on for each ring.\n\nSo for each i-th ring, the rectangle dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and the perimeter is 2*( (w -4*(i-1)) + (h -4*(i-1)) ) -4. Wait, but that simplifies to 2*(w + h - 8*(i-1)) -4? Or perhaps I should compute it as 2*(width + height) -4, where width and height are for that ring's rectangle.\n\nBut then, for each ring, we can compute the perimeter and sum them all up. So the total number of gilded cells is the sum of perimeters for each of the k rings.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each ring is added. So the first ring is the outermost perimeter, then the second ring is the perimeter of the next inner rectangle, etc. So for each ring i from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum them all.\n\nWait, but what if the rectangle becomes too small? Like, for example, if the dimensions after subtracting 4*(i-1) from each side are less than 3? But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's allowed. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense. For example, for a 3x3 plate, the first ring is the perimeter (8 cells), and then the next ring would require 3-4*(2-1) = 3-4 = -1, which is invalid. So the input ensures that k is such that each ring is possible.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\nsum all these perimeters.\n\nBut wait, let's check the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Which is 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1 → perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16-4= 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So first ring is 2*(7+9) -4 = 28. Second ring: current_w = 7 -4*(2-1) = 7-4=3. current_h =9-4*(2-1)=5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4= 16-4=12. Sum 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. Yes.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: loop from 1 to k, compute for each i the current_w and current_h, compute perimeter, add to total.\n\nNow, the code needs to read w, h, k from input, then compute this sum.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases. For example, when k is 0? No, the constraints say k is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: when the current_w or current_h becomes 0? Well, the input constraints ensure that k is such that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Or not? Let's think. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let's see for example, if min(w, h) is 5. Then (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can be 1. For i=1, current_w and current_h are w-0 and h-0. For i=2, 4*(i-1) =4. So min(w, h) -4*(i-1) = 5-4=1. Which would be less than 3. But the input constraints ensure that k is chosen so that it's allowed. Wait, but the problem says that the input k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me see for example, if min(w, h) is 5. Then floor( (5+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. So for i=1, the current_w and current_h are 5, and for i=2, it would be 5-4=1. But the input will not allow k=2. So the code doesn't have to handle cases where current_w or current_h is less than 3, because the input is constrained to ensure that for all i up to k, the current_w and current_h are valid. So the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total =0\n\nFor i in 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\ntotal += perimeter\n\nReturn total.\n\nYes.\n\nSo let's code this in Python.\n\nThe code would read the input line, split into three integers. Then compute the sum as described.\n\nTesting with the examples:\n\nFirst example: 3 3 1 → 2*(3+3) -4 = 8 → correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4= 28 → correct.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5)-4 = 28 + 12 =40 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: say, 5 5 1 → perimeter is 2*(5+5)-4 = 16. For k=1. If k=2, then current_w and current_h are 5-4=1. But the input constraints would not allow k=2 here. Because min(w, h) is 5. (5+1)/4 = 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can be 1.\n\nAnother example: if w=7, h=7, k=2. Then for i=1, current_w=7, current_h=7. perimeter is 2*(7+7) -4 = 24. For i=2, current_w=7-4=3, current_h=7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 8. Total is 24+8=32.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, coding in Python:\n\nRead input line as w, h, k. Split into integers.\n\nThen loop from 1 to k, inclusive.\n\nCompute for each i:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\nAdd to total.\n\nThen print total.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead input line as w, h, k.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as three integers on one line. So for example, the first sample input is '3 3 1'.\n\nIn Python, we can do:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen total = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nThat's the code. Let me test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 3: 7 9 2 → output 40.\n\nLet me compute:\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_w=7, current_h=9 → perimeter 2*(7+9) -4= 2*16-4=28.\n\ni=2:\n\ncurrent_w=7-4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5 → 2*(3+5) -4= 16-4=12. 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: if w=5, h=5, k=1 → 2*(5+5) -4 = 16. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input, process as said.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me write it.\n",
