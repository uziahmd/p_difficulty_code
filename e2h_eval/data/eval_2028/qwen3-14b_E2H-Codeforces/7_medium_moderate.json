The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given number n can be the number of vertices in a snowflake as defined. Let's try to understand what a snowflake graph is.\n\nFrom the description, the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, that initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k > 1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those leaves) are each connected to k new vertices. This process must be done at least once. So, the construction is like building layers. \n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows with each step. Let's model this.\n\nLet's say the initial step is level 0: 1 node.\n\nThen, level 1: add k nodes connected to the root. Now total nodes is 1 + k.\n\nThen, each of those k nodes (which are leaves) get k new nodes each. So, for each of the k nodes, we add k new nodes. So that's k * k = k² new nodes. Now total nodes is 1 + k + k².\n\nBut wait, the problem says that this step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) should be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do this once. So the minimal number of vertices is 1 + k + k². But wait, the example given for k=4, the minimal is 1+4+4²= 21? But the sample input includes n=6 which outputs NO. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps.\n\nWait, the problem says that after the initial step (adding k nodes), then each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So the initial step is adding k nodes (so the first step is level 1). Then, the second step (the first time this step is done) is adding k new nodes to each of the leaves. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do this once. So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k * k. So for example, if k=2, then the minimal is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 nodes.\n\nBut according to the sample input, n=6 outputs NO. So for n=6, there's no possible k. Let's see: For example, if k=2, then the minimal is 7. So 6 can't be achieved. So the sample output makes sense.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written in the form of 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1 (since the step must be done at least once). Wait, no. Let me re-examine the construction steps.\n\nThe initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the step of adding k nodes to each leaf is done at least once. So the construction is:\n\nStart with 1 node.\n\nFirst, add k nodes connected to the root. Now total is 1 + k.\n\nThen, perform the expansion step (each leaf gets k new nodes). Let's call this step 1. So after step 1, each of the k leaves (from the first step) has k new nodes. So total added is k * k. So total nodes is 1 + k + k².\n\nIf we perform another expansion step (step 2), then each of the leaves from the previous step (which were the k² nodes added in step 1) are now leaves. Each of them adds k nodes. So the total added is k² * k = k³. So total nodes is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nBut wait, the expansion step is applied to all leaves. So each time you do the expansion step, all the current leaves (those that have only one connection) are expanded. So the process is that each expansion step adds k times the number of leaves from the previous step.\n\nBut the initial step (adding k nodes to the root) is not an expansion step. The expansion steps are done at least once. So the snowflake can be built with any number of expansion steps, but at least one.\n\nSo the general formula for the number of nodes is:\n\nn = 1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m) where m ≥ 1 ?\n\nWait, let's think again. Let me model the steps:\n\nInitial: 1 node.\n\nAfter first expansion (the initial step): adding k nodes to the root. So total is 1 + k. But this is before any expansion steps. Then, the expansion steps are done. The first expansion step is done on the k leaves. Each of those k leaves gets k new nodes. So adding k * k nodes. Now total is 1 + k + k². Then, if we do another expansion step, each of those k² leaves (from the previous step) gets k new nodes, adding k³. So total becomes 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k*(1 + k + k² + ... +k^m), where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, no. Because the initial step (adding k nodes) is not part of the expansion steps. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe initial step is adding k nodes to the root. Then, each expansion step adds k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step. The first expansion step (which must be done at least once) adds k * k nodes. The second adds k * (k^2) nodes, etc.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is:\n\nTotal = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + ... + k^{m+1} }, where m is the number of expansion steps (m ≥ 1).\n\nWait, let's think for m=1 expansion steps:\n\nTotal is 1 + k (initial) + k^2 (after first expansion step). So that's 1 + k + k^2.\n\nFor m=2 expansion steps: initial is 1 +k, then first expansion adds k², second adds k^3. Total is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo the total is 1 + k*(1 + k + k² + ... +k^m) ?\n\nNo. Let me compute:\n\nThe total is 1 + (k + k^2 + ... + k^{m+1} } ), where m ≥ 1? Because:\n\nFor m=1 expansion steps, the sum is k + k^2. So 1 +k +k^2. Which is correct.\n\nYes. Because the initial step adds k (level 1), and each expansion step adds k^2 (level 2), k^3 (level 3), etc. So the total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} k^i }, where m ≥ 1. Wait, no. Because the number of expansion steps is m, and the initial step is adding k. So for m expansion steps, the total is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? Because the initial is k (level 1), then expansion steps add level 2 (k^2), level 3 (k^3), up to level m+1 (k^{m+1}).\n\nAlternatively, the total can be written as 1 + sum_{i=1}^{s} k^i }, where s is the number of levels. The initial step is level 1 (k^1), then expansion steps add level 2 (k^2), level 3 (k^3), etc. The number of expansion steps is s-1. Since the expansion steps must be done at least once, s-1 ≥ 1 → s ≥ 2. So the total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^s k^i, where s ≥ 2.\n\nBut sum_{i=1}^s k^i is equal to (k^{s+1} -k)/(k-1). So the total number of nodes is 1 + (k^{s+1} -k)/(k-1) = [ (k^{s+1} -k) + (k-1) ] / (k-1) ) = (k^{s+1} -k +k -1 )/(k-1) ) = (k^{s+1} -1 )/(k-1).\n\nWait, that's interesting! Because sum_{i=0}^s k^i = (k^{s+1} -1)/(k-1). So sum_{i=1}^s k^i = sum_{i=0}^s k^i - 1 = [ (k^{s+1} -1)/(k-1) ] - 1. But that's not matching with the previous calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the total number of nodes is 1 + sum_{i=1}^s k^i. Let me compute that:\n\nsum_{i=1}^s k^i = sum_{i=0}^s k^i - 1 = [ (k^{s+1} -1)/(k-1) ] - 1.\n\nSo total nodes is 1 + that, which is [ (k^{s+1} -1 )/(k-1) ] - 1 + 1 = (k^{s+1} -1 )/(k-1).\n\nAh, right! So the total number of nodes is (k^{s+1} -1 )/(k-1). But this is the same as the sum from i=0 to s of k^i. Which means that the total number of nodes is the sum of a geometric series from 0 to s, which equals (k^{s+1} -1 )/(k-1).\n\nBut according to our previous analysis, the total nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^s, which is the same as sum_{i=0}^s k^i. So for example, when s=2, it's 1 +k +k^2. Which is the case when there is one expansion step (since the initial step is adding k, then one expansion step adds k^2).\n\nSo the conclusion is that the number of nodes in the snowflake is equal to (k^{s+1} -1 )/(k-1), where s ≥ 1 (since the expansion steps are done at least once, which implies that s ≥ 1. Wait, because the initial step is adding k (level 1), and the expansion steps are done once (so adding level 2). So s is 2? Or perhaps I need to re-express s in terms of the expansion steps.\n\nLet me rephrase. The snowflake must have at least one expansion step. So the minimal case is when we have s=2, which gives (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. Which matches the earlier example. So the general formula is n = (k^{m} -1 )/(k-1), where m ≥ 3? No, because for s=2, m is s+1? Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nEarlier, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^s k^i = (k^{s+1} -1 )/(k-1). And s is the maximum exponent. So for the minimal case where there is one expansion step, s is 2. So m = s+1? No, the formula is (k^{s+1} -1)/(k-1). So for s=2, it's (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k². Which is correct. So the problem reduces to finding whether there exists integers k>1 and m ≥ 3 such that n = (k^m -1)/(k-1). Because m is s+1, where s is the number of levels. Wait, m is s+1? For example, in the minimal case, s was 2, and the formula is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So m is 3. So m must be ≥ 3?\n\nWait, but m can be 2? Let me think. If m is 2, then the formula would be (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which would correspond to the case where the snowflake is constructed with initial step (adding k nodes) and no expansion steps. But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. Therefore, the minimal m is 3. Because m is the exponent in the formula. So for the snowflake to be valid, m must be ≥ 3, and k ≥ 2.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The formula (k^m -1)/(k-1) equals 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1}. For example, when m=3, it's 1 +k +k². Which is the minimal case (with one expansion step). So the problem requires that m ≥ 3. So the question is: given n, does there exist integers k ≥ 2 and m ≥ 3 such that n = (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut wait, what about the case where m=2? Then the formula is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. So for example, if n=3, then k=2, m=2. But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So in this case, the snowflake would have been constructed with initial step (adding k nodes) and no expansion steps. Which is invalid. Therefore, m must be ≥ 3. Hence, for n to be valid, there must be some k ≥2 and m ≥3 such that n equals (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking for each n whether it can be expressed as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some integers k ≥2 and m ≥3.\n\nBut how do we check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches.\n\nFirst, note that for each possible m ≥3, we can check if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nBut since m can be up to log_2(n) (since for k=2, m can't be larger than log_2(n) + 1), perhaps we can iterate over m from 3 up to 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18, so for m up to 60, we can check).\n\nFor each m, we can perform a binary search on k to see if there exists a k such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me note that (k^m -1)/(k-1) is equal to 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1}.\n\nSo for each m, we can perform a binary search on k. For example, for a fixed m, the value of the expression increases with k. So for each m, we can find if there exists a k such that this sum equals n.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nCheck if there exists m ≥3 and k ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i = n.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nLoop m from 3 up to max_m (like 60, since for m=60, even k=2 gives 2^60-1/(2-1) = 2^60-1 which is about 1e18, so for n up to 1e18, m can't be larger than 60).\n\nFor each m:\n\nWe need to find if there exists k ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i = n.\n\nBut how to compute that sum for given k and m?\n\nWell, for a given m and k, the sum is (k^m -1)/(k-1). But calculating this directly may be problematic for large k and m, but since we're doing a binary search, perhaps we can compute it in a way that avoids overflow (but in Python, integers are arbitrary precision, so maybe not a problem).\n\nBut for binary search, we need to find if there's a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nLet me think about the possible range of k for a given m.\n\nFor a given m, the minimal sum is when k=2: sum is 2^m -1/(2-1) = 2^m -1. Wait, no. Wait, sum_{i=0}^{m-1} 2^i = 2^m -1. So for example, when m=3, sum is 1+2+4=7. Which is 2^3 -1 = 7. So yes.\n\nThe maximum possible k for a given m and n is such that sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i ≤n. Since the sum increases with k, for each m, we can binary search k in the range [2, upper_bound].\n\nBut what is the upper bound for k for a given m?\n\nWell, since sum_{i=0}^{m-1}k^i = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1} ≥k^{m-1} (since all terms are positive). So for this to be ≤n, we have k^{m-1} ≤n → k ≤ n^{1/(m-1)}.\n\nTherefore, for binary search, the upper bound for k can be n^(1/(m-1)) + 1. But since m can be up to 60, for n up to 1e18, the upper bound is manageable.\n\nSo for each m from 3 to say 60:\n\nCompute the possible k using binary search between 2 and upper_bound.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for a given k and m, without overflowing? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's not a problem.\n\nBut during the binary search, for a given k and m, we can compute the sum and compare with n. However, for large m and k, this could take O(m) time. Since m is up to 60, and per test case, this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum using the formula (k^m -1)//(k-1). But for large exponents, computing k^m can be expensive? Well, for m up to 60, even if k is up to 1e9, k^m would be 1e9^60 which is way beyond even 1e18, but since in the binary search, we can check if the computed value exceeds n, and break early.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can compute the sum incrementally and check for overflow. For example, for a given k and m, compute the sum step by step:\n\nsum = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to m-1:\n\n    sum += k^i\n\nBut for large m, this would take O(m) time. However, since m is up to 60, and t is 1e4, this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the formula (k^m -1) // (k-1). But how to compute k^m?\n\nIn Python, exponentiation is straightforward. However, for large exponents, even for k=2 and m=60, 2^60 is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, during the binary search, for a given k and m, compute the sum as follows:\n\nsum = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}\n\nBut if during the computation, the sum exceeds n, we can break early and return that it's larger than n.\n\nSo here's an idea: for a given k and m, compute the sum incrementally, and if at any step the sum exceeds n, return early.\n\nThis is important because for large m and k, the sum can be very big, but we can avoid unnecessary calculations.\n\nSo for a given k and m, let's compute the sum step by step:\n\ncurrent_sum = 0\n\nterm = 1 (k^0)\n\nfor i in 0 to m-1:\n\n    current_sum += term\n\n    if current_sum > n:\n\n        return current_sum\n\n    term *=k\n\nreturn current_sum\n\nThis way, we can compute the sum and check if it's equal to n. Also, if during the computation, the current_sum exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nThis would be efficient.\n\nNow, the plan for each test case:\n\nCheck for all possible m from 3 up to max_m (like 60). For each m, perform a binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (like n^(1/(m-1)) + 1). For each candidate k, compute the sum as described above, and check if it equals n.\n\nIf for any m and k, the sum equals n, return YES. Otherwise, after checking all possibilities, return NO.\n\nBut what about m=2? For example, if the sum is 1 +k = n. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. So m must be ≥3. Hence, m starts from 3.\n\nBut wait, what about when m=2? Let me think again. The formula for m=2 is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which would correspond to the case where the snowflake is constructed with initial step (adding k nodes) and no expansion steps. But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So m must be ≥3. Therefore, m starts from 3.\n\nSo the code will loop m from 3 up to max_m.\n\nNow, what is the maximum possible m for which we need to check?\n\nFor example, for n=1e18, the minimal k is 2. For m, the maximum possible m is such that 2^m -1 <= 1e18. Let's compute log2(1e18 + 1) ≈ 60, since 2^60 is about 1.15e18. So m can be up to 60. So for m up to 60, we can check.\n\nThus, for each test case, we can iterate m from 3 to 60.\n\nNow, for each m, we can perform a binary search for k in the range [2, ... , upper_bound], where upper_bound is something like n^(1/(m-1)) + 1. But how to compute that upper_bound?\n\nWell, for a given m, the minimal sum is when k=2: sum is 2^m -1. If this is larger than n, then there's no possible k for this m. So for example, if m is such that 2^m -1 >n, then we can skip this m.\n\nSo for each m, first check if 2^m -1 <=n. If not, then no possible k for this m. Else, proceed to binary search.\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for k for a given m?\n\nThe sum for k is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m-1} ≥k^{m-1} (since all terms are positive). So for the sum to be ≤n, we need k^{m-1} ≤n → k ≤ n^{1/(m-1)}.\n\nSo upper_bound can be set to n^(1/(m-1)) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute that in Python? We can compute it as int(n ** (1/(m-1))) + 2. However, due to floating point inaccuracies, perhaps it's better to compute it via binary search. Alternatively, during the binary search, we can start with low=2, high= some upper limit.\n\nBut perhaps for binary search, we can set the initial high as 2, and keep doubling until the sum for that k is larger than n, then set high to that value.\n\nBut that might be more efficient. For example, for a given m, we can find the upper bound for k by starting with low=2, high=2, and while the sum for high is less than n, multiply high by 2. Once we have a high that gives sum >=n, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nThis way, we don't have to compute the upper bound with exponents, which can be error-prone.\n\nSo for each m, the steps are:\n\nCheck if the minimal sum (for k=2) is larger than n. If yes, skip this m.\n\nElse:\n\nFind the upper bound for k (using exponential search).\n\nThen perform binary search between low=2 and high=upper_bound.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for a given k and m?\n\nAs discussed earlier, compute the sum incrementally, and break early if it exceeds n.\n\nSo putting this together, here's the plan for each m:\n\ndef check(n, m):\n\n    # Check if there exists k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i ==n\n\n    # First, check if the minimal possible sum (k=2) is <=n.\n\n    min_sum = 2^m -1 ?\n\nWait, no. For m steps, the sum for k=2 is 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^{m-1} = 2^m -1. So yes.\n\nSo if 2^m -1 >n, then no possible k for this m.\n\nElse:\n\nWe need to find k such that sum is n.\n\nSo for the binary search:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile compute_sum(high, m) <n:\n\n    high *=2\n\nOnce high is found, perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut how to compute compute_sum?\n\nImplement a helper function that, given k and m, returns the sum, or returns early if it exceeds n.\n\nSo for example:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, target):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current_term = 1\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n\n        total += current_term\n\n        if total > target:\n\n            return total\n\n        current_term *=k\n\n    return total\n\nSo for the binary search, for a given k and m, we compute the sum. If it's equal to target (n), return True. Else, adjust the binary search accordingly.\n\nSo during the binary search, for mid = (low + high)//2:\n\ns = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n\nif s ==n: return True\n\nelif s <n: need to search higher\n\nelse: search lower.\n\nBut how to handle cases where compute_sum returns a value larger than n?\n\nSo for each m, the steps are:\n\nCompute the minimal sum (for k=2). If that is larger than n, skip.\n\nElse:\n\nFind the upper bound for k via exponential search.\n\nThen binary search between low and high.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nBut for very large m (like 60), even for k=2, the sum is 2^60 -1 which is about 1e18, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, considering that for each test case, for each m from 3 to 60, we perform this check. For t=1e4, and m up to 60, and binary search steps being O(log (upper_bound)), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nFor example, n=1. According to the problem statement, the snowflake starts with one node. But according to the construction rules, the initial step is adding k nodes. So the minimal snowflake has 1 +k + ... ?\n\nWait, for the snowflake to be valid, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when m=3 (sum is 1 +k +k²). So for n=1, the answer is NO. Which matches the sample input.\n\nAnother sample input: n=13. The output is YES. Let's see:\n\nCheck for m=3: 1 +k +k² =13 →k² +k -12=0 →k=( -1 ± sqrt(1 +48 )) /2 → sqrt(49)=7 → ( -1 +7)/2 = 3. So k=3. So yes. So 1+3+9=13. So answer is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=6. The output is NO. For m=3, 1 +k +k² =6 →k² +k -5=0 → discriminant is 1 +20=21 → sqrt(21) is irrational. So no integer solution. For m=4: sum is 1 +k +k² +k^3 =6. For k=2, sum is 1+2+4+8=15>6. So no. For m=3, no solution. So answer is NO.\n\nAnother sample input: n=255. Output is YES. Let's see: 255 is 2^8 -1. So for m=8, k=2: sum is 2^8 -1 = 255. So m=8 ≥3. So yes.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nn = input number.\n\nCheck if n is 1: output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck for all m from 3 to 60:\n\n   if 2^m -1 >n → skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      perform binary search for k in [2, ... ] to see if sum equals n.\n\nIf any of the m passes, output YES. Else, NO.\n\nBut how to compute 2^m -1? For m up to 60, 2^60 is manageable.\n\nNow, code steps in Python.\n\nBut for m up to 60, let's precompute the maximum m. Let's say up to 60.\n\nNow, implement the helper function compute_sum as discussed.\n\nBut in Python, for very large exponents, even for m=60 and k=2, the sum is 2^60 -1 which is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n\n    if n ==1:\n\n        return False\n\n    for m in range(3, 61):\n\n        # Check if minimal possible sum (k=2) is <=n.\n\n        min_sum = (2**m -1)\n\n        if min_sum >n:\n\n            continue\n\n        # Now find k such that sum is n.\n\n        # Find upper bound for k.\n\n        low =2\n\n        high =2\n\n        while True:\n\n            s = compute_sum(high, m, n)\n\n            if s >n:\n\n                break\n\n            high *=2\n\n        # Now binary search between low and high.\n\n        left =2\n\n        right = high\n\n        while left <= right:\n\n            mid = (left + right) //2\n\n            s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n\n            if s ==n:\n\n                return True\n\n            elif s <n:\n\n                left = mid +1\n\n            else:\n\n                right = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut wait, the code for compute_sum needs to be implemented. Let's code that:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, target):\n\n    total =0\n\n    current =1\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > target:\n\n            return total\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut note that for m steps, the loop runs m times. For example, for m=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nBut in the code, the for loop runs m times, adding current (which starts as 1, then multiplied by k each time). So yes.\n\nBut in the code, the 'm' in the function is the number of terms. For example, for m=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nBut in the code for the problem, for each m in the loop, the 'm' is the number of terms. So for the code above, the helper function is correct.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nTest case n=13.\n\nFor m=3:\n\nmin_sum = 2^3 -1 =7 ≤13.\n\nThen find high:\n\nstart with high=2. compute_sum(2, 3, 13) is 1+2+4=7 <13 → high *=2 →4.\n\ncompute_sum(4, 3, 13) →1+4+16=21>13 → break.\n\nbinary search between left=2 and right=4.\n\nmid =3. compute_sum(3,3,13) is 1+3+9=13 → yes. return True.\n\nThus, returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: n=6.\n\nCheck m=3. min_sum is 7>6 → skip. So no.\n\nOther m's?\n\nFor m=3, no. For m=4, min_sum is 2^4-1=15>6. So no. So returns false.\n\nThus, output is NO.\n\nSample input for n=15:\n\nIn the sample input, n=15 is present. Let's see.\n\nFor m=3: min_sum is 7 ≤15. Check for k.\n\nbinary search:\n\nhigh starts at 2. compute_sum(2,3,15) is 7 <15. high becomes 4. compute_sum(4,3,15) is 1+4+16=21>15. So binary search between 2 and 4.\n\nmid=3 → sum is 13 <15. left becomes 4.\n\nmid=4 → sum is 21>15. right becomes 3. loop ends. No solution for m=3.\n\nCheck m=4. min_sum for m=4 is 2^4 -1=15. Which equals n=15. So yes. So returns true.\n\nThus, answer is YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample input (the fifth test case is 15 → output YES).\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother sample input: n=255. For m=8, 2^8 -1 = 255. So returns yes.\n\nAnother sample input: n=1000000000000000000. Output is NO. Let's see why. Let's think about possible m and k.\n\nFor example, for m=3, we have 1 +k +k² =n. So solving k² +k +1 =n. For n=1e18, k is roughly sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. So check if 1e9^2 + 1e9 +1 = 1e18 + ... which is larger than 1e18. So no.\n\nFor m=4: sum is 1 +k +k² +k^3. For large k, this is approximately k^3. So solving k^3 ≈1e18 →k≈1e6. Let's see for k=1e6, sum is 1 +1e6 + 1e12 + 1e18 → which is about 1e18. But the exact value would be larger than 1e18. So perhaps no solution.\n\nBut perhaps there's some m and k for which the sum equals 1e18. However, according to the sample input, the answer is NO.\n\nBut how to know? Well, the code would check all possibilities.\n\nNow, for code, the code must handle very large numbers. But in Python, that's okay.\n\nNow, what about n=7 (which is 1+2+4=7). For m=3, k=2. So returns YES. So for n=7, the answer is YES.\n\nBut according to the sample input, the third test case is n=3 → output NO. Which is correct, because for m=3, the minimal sum is 7, which is larger than 3. So no.\n\nNow, let's think about the code for n=7. For m=3, min_sum is 7, which equals n. So returns True.\n\nNow, code for the test case n=7 would return YES.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the sample input for n=6 is NO, which is correct.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n\nBut what about when m is larger than log2(n) +1? For example, for m=60, 2^m is way larger than n. So in that case, the code skips.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut for the case where n=1, returns False.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut also, note that for m=3, the minimal sum is 7. So for n=1,2,3,4,5,6, the answer is NO.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t test cases. For each n, check if any m and k exist.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for exponents, 2**m can be calculated. However, for m up to 60, 2**60 is manageable.\n\nBut for large m, like 60, and for n=1e18, 2^60 is about 1.15e18. So for m=60, min_sum is 2^60 -1 which is 1.15e18-1. For n=1e18, that's larger than n,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in such a way that it starts with one vertex and expands by adding layers of vertices according to specific rules. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A valid snowflake graph can be represented by the formula $ n = \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1} $ for integers $ k > 1 $ and $ m \\geq 3 $. Here, $ k $ is the number of new vertices added at each step, and $ m $ is the number of expansion steps.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Values**: For each test case, we check all possible values of $ m $ from 3 up to 60 (since $ 2^{60} $ is slightly larger than $ 10^{18} $).\n3. **Binary Search for Valid $ k $**: For each $ m $, we use binary search to check if there exists an integer $ k $ such that the sum of the geometric series $ 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^{m-1} $ equals $ n $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, target):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(m):\n        total += current\n        if total > target:\n            return total\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    for m in range(3, 61):\n        # Check if minimal possible sum (k=2) is <=n\n        min_sum = (2 ** m) - 1\n        if min_sum > n:\n            continue\n        # Find upper bound for k\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        while True:\n            s = compute_sum(high, m, n)\n            if s > n:\n                break\n            high *= 2\n        # Binary search between low and high\n        left = 2\n        right = high\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Checking Validity**: The `is_possible` function checks if a valid snowflake can be formed for a given $ n $ by iterating over possible values of $ m $ and using binary search to find a suitable $ k $.\n3. **Geometric Series Sum**: The `compute_sum` function calculates the sum of the geometric series incrementally to avoid overflow and early termination if the sum exceeds the target value $ n $.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all potential configurations of the snowflake graph within the constraints, ensuring correctness and performance even for very large values of $ n $.",
