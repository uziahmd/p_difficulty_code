The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure of the snowflake.\n\nFrom the description: The snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) must be connected to k more new vertices. This process must be done at least once. So the construction is recursive, adding layers where each leaf node from the previous layer gets k children.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's model this.\n\nLet me consider the steps:\n\n- Initially, there is 1 node. Let's call this level 0.\n- Then, we add k nodes connected to the root. Now total nodes is 1 + k. These k nodes are leaves (each has degree 1).\n- Then, each of these leaves gets connected to k new nodes. So for each of the k nodes, we add k nodes. So that's k * k new nodes. Now total nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But wait, after this step, the nodes from the first level (the ones directly connected to the root) now have degree 1 + k (since they are connected to the root and their own k children). But the new nodes added in this step are leaves again. \n\nBut the process requires that this step (adding k children to each leaf) is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do this once. Wait, the example says that for k=4, the minimal snowflake has 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 +4 +16 = 21? But the example input includes n=13 as a YES. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the construction steps.\n\nWait the problem says: the initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (i.e., the leaves) is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So the process is that after the initial step (level 1), we have to perform the step of expanding each leaf once. So the minimal snowflake is when we have two levels of expansion. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the construction steps:\n\nThe snowflake is built in stages. Let's think recursively.\n\nStage 0: 1 node.\n\nStage 1: Add k children to the root. Total nodes: 1 + k.\n\nStage 2: For each node that is a leaf (i.e., all the nodes added in stage 1), add k children. So each of the k nodes adds k children. So total added here is k*k. Total nodes: 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut the problem says that the step of expanding each leaf must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when we have stage 1 and then stage 2. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. However, what if we do more steps?\n\nFor example, stage 3: each of the leaves from stage 2 (which are k^2 nodes) get k children. So adding k^3 nodes. Total nodes is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nBut the problem says that the step of expanding each leaf must be done at least once. So the initial step (stage 1) is required, then stage 2 (the first expansion) is required. So the minimal snowflake has 1 +k +k^2 nodes. However, perhaps there are multiple possibilities for the number of nodes depending on how many times we expand.\n\nBut the snowflake can be constructed with any number of expansions. For example, after stage 1, we could do one expansion (stage 2) or more. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the process:\n\nThe initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, each expansion step is taking all current leaves and adding k children to each. Each expansion step must be done at least once. So the minimal case is that after the initial step, we do one expansion step. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But if we do more expansion steps, say two expansion steps, then after initial step (stage 1), we do expansion step 1 (stage 2) and expansion step 2 (stage 3). So the total nodes would be 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nBut the problem states that the step of expanding each leaf should be done at least once. So the number of expansion steps is at least 1. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1. Wait, no. Because the initial step is adding k children (stage 1), then each expansion step adds another layer. So the number of expansion steps is the number of times we do the expansion. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe snowflake is built as follows:\n\nStart with root (1 node).\n\nThen, perform the first expansion: add k children to root. Now, the leaves are these k nodes.\n\nThen, perform the expansion step (at least once): for each leaf, add k children. So after one expansion step, the total nodes is 1 + k + k^2. After two expansion steps, it's 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. And so on.\n\nBut the expansion step must be done at least once. So the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1. Wait, but the initial step (adding the k children) is not considered an expansion step. The expansion steps are the ones that take the leaves and add k children to them. So the initial step is just the first part, and then the expansion steps are done once or more.\n\nSo the formula for the total nodes would be:\n\nTotal nodes = 1 + k*( (k^m -1)/(k-1) )) ?\n\nWait, let's think again. Let me model the total number of nodes.\n\nThe root is 1 node.\n\nAfter the first expansion (adding k children to root): total nodes is 1 + k.\n\nThen, each expansion step adds k^d nodes, where d increases. For example:\n\nFirst expansion step (after initial step) adds k^1 nodes (the initial k nodes are leaves, each adds k children. So k * k = k^2 nodes added.)\n\nSecond expansion step: the leaves are the k^2 nodes added in the first expansion step. Each adds k children, so k^3 added.\n\nSo the total number of nodes after m expansion steps is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m+1} ?\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nInitial step: 1 node.\n\nAfter first expansion (adding k children to root): 1 + k.\n\nAfter first expansion step (the first expansion step is done once): adding k^2 nodes. So total becomes 1 +k +k^2.\n\nAfter second expansion step: adding k^3 nodes. Total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m}, where m is the number of expansion steps plus 1? Or m is the number of expansion steps. Let me think:\n\nNumber of expansion steps is t ≥ 1. Then the total nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{t+1} ? No. Let's think for t=1 expansion steps:\n\nOriginal step (adding k children) is done once. Then, expansion steps done once: adding k^2 nodes. So total nodes is 1 +k +k^2. Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. So the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). But since the expansion steps are t=1, which leads to sum from i=0 to 2.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1) ), where t is the number of expansion steps (t ≥ 1). Wait, but when t=1, that gives (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. But that's not correct. Wait, no. Wait the formula for the sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for the example where t is the number of expansion steps, the sum would be 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t+1}? No. Let me re-express.\n\nLet me think again. The initial step is the root (1 node). Then, we add k nodes (so 1 +k). Then, for each expansion step, we add k^2, then k^3, etc. So if we have t expansion steps, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{t+1} ?\n\nNo, because the first expansion step adds k^2 nodes. So the total after t expansion steps is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t+1}? Wait, for t=1 expansion steps, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is sum from i=0 to 2, which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So that would be (k^{t+2} -1)/(k-1) ? No, for t=1, it's (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So the exponent is t+2? That seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m}, where m ≥ 2. Because the minimal expansion steps is 1 (so m=2). For example, m=2 gives 1 +k +k^2. m=3 gives 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, etc. So S is the sum of a geometric series from 0 to m, which equals (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But m can be any integer ≥ 2? Or m ≥ 1?\n\nWait, when m is 2, that gives 1 +k +k^2. Which is the case when there is 1 expansion step. So the number of expansion steps is m-1. So m can be 2 or higher. Therefore, for any n that can be written as S = (k^{m} -1)/(k-1) where m ≥ 2, and k ≥ 2, then n is possible.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that k must be greater than 1. So for any n that can be expressed as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some integer k ≥ 2 and m ≥ 2, then answer is YES. Because that's the sum of the geometric series with m terms (from 0 to m-1?), no. Wait the sum of 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} is (k^m -1)/(k-1). So if the total nodes is that sum, then m is the number of terms. So for example, m=2 gives 1 +k = (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. But according to the earlier example, the minimal snowflake is 1 +k +k^2. So that suggests that m is 3? Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me take the example from the problem statement. The example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Let's check. Let's see if 13 can be written as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some k ≥2 and m ≥ 2.\n\nLet's try m=3. Then (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1. So set this equal to 13. So k^2 +k +1 =13 → k² +k -12=0. Solving: k = [-1 ± sqrt(1+48)]/2 → sqrt(49)=7. So ( -1 +7)/2= 3. So k=3. Yes! So 3² +3 +1= 9+3+1=13. So yes. So that's why n=13 is a YES.\n\nAnother example from the sample input: n=6. The output is NO. Let's see. Let's check for possible k and m.\n\nFor m=2: (k^2-1)/(k-1) =k+1. So set k+1=6 →k=5. Which is allowed. But wait, that would be m=2. But according to our previous analysis, m is the number of terms. For m=2, the sum is 1 +k. Which would correspond to the case where we have the initial step (adding k children) and no expansion steps. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. So this case would be invalid. Oh! Here's the mistake.\n\nAh! So the problem requires that after the initial step (adding the k children to the root), the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) is done at least once. Therefore, the minimal number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2. Which corresponds to the sum of 1 +k +k^2. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1. So m must be ≥3. Wait no. Let me re-express.\n\nThe initial step is adding k children (so the sum is 1 +k). Then, the expansion step must be done at least once. So after that, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is the sum of three terms: 1 +k +k^2. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So m=3. So the formula for the total number of nodes is (k^m -1)/(k-1), where m ≥3. But wait, if we do more expansion steps, then m increases. For example, if after the initial step and one expansion step (total nodes 1 +k +k^2), then another expansion step adds k^3 nodes, making the total sum 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 = (k^4 -1)/(k-1). So m is 4. So the general formula is that the total number of nodes is (k^m -1)/(k-1), where m ≥3. Wait, but for m=3, the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. Which is exactly the minimal case. For m=4, it's 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the total number of nodes can be written as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for m ≥3 and k ≥2.\n\nWait, but then in the case where m=2, the sum is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) =k+1. Which would be 1 +k. Which would correspond to the initial step (adding k children) but without any expansion steps. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. Therefore, such cases (m=2) are not allowed. So the correct condition is that the number of nodes must be equal to (k^m -1)/(k-1) where m ≥3 and k ≥2.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple expansion steps? For example, m=4. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. Which would be allowed. So the problem reduces to checking if the given n can be written as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for integers k ≥2 and m ≥3.\n\nBut then the sample input has n=6. Let's see: can 6 be written as (k^m -1)/(k-1) with m ≥3 and k ≥2?\n\nFor m=3: (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k² +k +1. Set equal to 6: k² +k +1 =6 →k² +k -5=0. Discriminant 1+20=21. sqrt(21) is irrational. So no integer solution.\n\nFor m=4: (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k^2 +k +1. For k=2: 8+4+2+1=15. Which is larger than 6. For k=1, but k must be ≥2. So no solution. Hence, n=6 is not possible. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is n=15. Output is YES. Let's check. For m=3, k^2 +k +1 =15. k^2 +k -14=0. Discriminant 1 +56=57. Not square. For m=4: (k^4-1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k^2 +k +1. Let's try k=2: 8+4+2+1=15. Yes! So m=4, k=2. So yes. So n=15 is possible. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for integers k≥2 and m≥3.\n\nBut how to check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nThe approach is for each test case n, check if there exists integers k ≥2 and m ≥3 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut how?\n\nFirst, note that (k^m -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}.\n\nSo for each possible m ≥3, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that this sum equals n.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 1e18, we need to find an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about possible values of m. For each possible m, we can try to compute possible k.\n\nBut for a given m, the value of k can be found via binary search. Because for fixed m, the function f(k) = 1 +k + ... +k^{m-1} is strictly increasing with k. So for each m, we can binary search on k to see if there's a k that makes f(k) =n.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible m?\n\nFor m ≥3, the minimal value of f(k) is when k=2 and m=3: 1+2+4=7. So for n <7, answer is NO. But in the sample input, n=1 is NO, n=2 is NO, etc.\n\nBut for larger n, we need to consider possible m.\n\nWhat is the maximum m that we need to check? For a given n, the maximum possible m is log_2(n). Because for k=2, the sum is 2^m -1 (since 1 + 2 + ... + 2^{m-1} = 2^m -1). So for m such that 2^m -1 ≤n. So m can be up to log2(n+1). Since n can be up to 1e18, log2(1e18) is about 60. So for each test case, we can iterate m from 3 up to log2(n)+1 (like up to 60), and for each m, perform a binary search for k.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- If n < 7, output NO (since the minimal possible is 7 for m=3 and k=2: 1+2+4=7).\n\nWait, but let's check for m=3 and k=2: sum is 1 + 2 + 4 =7. So for n=7, answer is YES.\n\nBut the sample input has n=6 as NO, which is correct.\n\nSo for each n:\n\nCheck for all possible m from 3 up to max_m (say, 60), and for each m, check if there's a k ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i =n.\n\nHow to compute that for each m?\n\nFor a fixed m, the sum is S = (k^m -1)/(k-1). We need to solve for k in integers ≥2.\n\nWe can binary search k between 2 and some upper bound. What's the upper bound for k for a given m?\n\nFor a given m and n, since S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} =n.\n\nThe sum is at least 1 +k +k^2 (when m≥3). For k ≥2, the sum is at least 1+2+4=7. For a given m, the maximum possible k is such that k^{m-1} ≤n. Because the sum is at least k^{m-1} (since all terms are positive). So k ≤ n^(1/(m-1)).\n\nSo for binary search, for each m, we can set low=2, high= something like n^(1/(m-1)) +1.\n\nBut how to compute that? Well, for binary search, we can set high to be n, but that might be slow for large n. However, since m is up to 60, even for m=3, the binary search per m would take O(log n) steps, and multiplied by 60, it's acceptable for t=1e4.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nIf n is 1, output NO.\n\nElse, for m from 3 to 60:\n\n   Compute the minimal possible sum for k=2. If that sum exceeds n, break (since higher m would give even larger sums for same k).\n\n   Else, perform binary search for k in [2, ... ] to find if there's a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and m?\n\nBut for large m and k, the sum can be very big. So during the binary search, we need to compute the sum and check if it's equal to n, but also avoid overflow.\n\nBut in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem.\n\nBut for efficiency, we can compute the sum incrementally and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nSo for a given k and m, compute the sum s = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1}.\n\nWe can compute this as follows:\n\nInitialize s = 0\n\nfor i in 0..m-1:\n\n   s += k^i\n\nBut for large m and k, this can be time-consuming. Alternatively, we can compute it using the formula (k^m -1)//(k-1) if k !=1. But since k >=2, this is valid.\n\nBut calculating k^m can be done with pow(k, m), but for very large exponents, this may be slow. However, since m is up to 60, and for each binary search step, it's manageable.\n\nBut for the binary search, we need to compute the sum for a given k and m, and compare it with n. So let's proceed.\n\nSo for each m in 3 to 60:\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = 2 (initial guess). But need to find upper bound for k.\n\n   Wait, perhaps we can compute high as follows: since the sum is at least k^{m-1} (since the last term is k^{m-1} and others are positive). So k^{m-1} <=n → k <=n^(1/(m-1)).\n\nSo high can be set to n^(1/(m-1)) +1. But how to compute that in Python? For example, for m=3, the upper bound is n^(1/2) +1. So for each m, compute high as int(n ** (1/(m-1))) + 2.\n\nBut for exponents, using floating points can be error-prone, but for the purposes of binary search, even if the high is a bit larger than needed, it's okay.\n\nSo for each m:\n\n   compute the maximum possible k as upper = int(n ** (1/(m-1))) + 2.\n\n   perform binary search between low=2 and high=upper.\n\n   for mid in binary search:\n\n      compute the sum s = (mid^m -1) // (mid -1)\n\n      if s ==n: return YES.\n\n      elif s <n: need to increase k → move low.\n\n      else: decrease k → move high.\n\nBut wait, for the formula (mid^m -1) // (mid -1) ?\n\nYes, because when k is mid, the sum is (mid^m -1)/(mid-1). However, since mid is integer ≥2, and m is integer ≥3, this is correct.\n\nBut calculating mid^m can be a problem for very large m and mid. For example, if m=60 and mid=2, 2^60 is about 1e18, which is manageable. For mid=3 and m=60, 3^60 is way larger than 1e18, but in that case, during binary search, the code would check if the sum is larger than n, and adjust accordingly.\n\nBut for the binary search, we need to calculate s = (k^m -1) // (k-1). However, when k is large, this can be very big. However, since we're comparing it with n, which is up to 1e18, we can compute this safely in Python.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to compute the sum, avoiding possible overflows (though in Python it's not an issue). However, for the sake of efficiency, perhaps we can compute the sum incrementally and break early if it exceeds n.\n\nFor example, for a given k and m, compute the sum step by step:\n\nsum = 0\n\ncurrent_term = 1\n\nfor i in 0 to m-1:\n\n   sum += current_term\n\n   if sum >n: break\n\n   current_term *=k\n\nSo for example, for m=3, sum is 1 +k +k². If during the computation, the sum exceeds n, we can stop early.\n\nThis approach can be more efficient, especially for large k and m.\n\nSo for each candidate k and m, we can compute the sum incrementally and check if it equals n.\n\nSo during the binary search steps, for a given k and m, we can compute the sum as follows.\n\nNow, the question is: for each test case, how to loop through m from 3 up to some maximum value.\n\nWhat is the maximum m we need to check?\n\nFor example, for m=60, the minimal sum is when k=2: sum is 2^60 -1. Which is about 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, m can be up to 60.\n\nSo for m in range 3 to 60.\n\nSo the steps for each test case:\n\nif n <7: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for m in 3 to 60:\n\n      compute the minimal possible sum for k=2, which is (2^m -1)/(2-1) = 2^m -1. If this is larger than n, then for higher m, the minimal sum will be even larger, so break the loop.\n\n      else:\n\n         perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (as discussed earlier) to see if there exists a k where the sum equals n.\n\n         if found, return YES.\n\n   after checking all m, if no such k and m found, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute upper_bound for k for each m?\n\nWell, for the sum to be equal to n, the sum is at least k^{m-1} (since sum = 1 +k + ... +k^{m-1} ≥k^{m-1}).\n\nThus, k^{m-1} ≤n → k ≤n^{1/(m-1)}.\n\nSo for upper_bound, we can compute it as int(n ** (1/(m-1))) + 2.\n\nBut in Python, taking the root can be done with exponentiation. However, for example, for m=3, m-1=2. So upper_bound = int(n**0.5) +2.\n\nBut for large exponents, this can be approximated.\n\nBut for binary search, even if the upper bound is a bit larger than needed, it's okay.\n\nSo putting this together.\n\nNow, some edge cases.\n\nFor example, n=7: m=3, k=2. sum is 1+2+4=7 → yes.\n\nn=13: m=3, k=3 → 1+3+9=13 → yes.\n\nn=15: m=4, k=2 → 1+2+4+8=15 → yes.\n\nAnother example: n=255. Let's see. 255 is 2^8 -1 = 255. So for m=8, k=2. The sum would be (2^8 -1)/(2-1) = 255. So m=8, which is ≥3. So yes. So output is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is 1000000000000000000 (1e18). The output is NO. Let's see why. Let's check if there exists m and k such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =1e18.\n\nFor example, m=3: (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k² +k +1 =1e18. Solving for k. Let's approximate k² ≈1e18 →k≈1e9. Let's check k=1e9: k² +k +1 = 1e18 + 1e9 +1 ≈1e18. So the actual value would be slightly larger than 1e18. So no solution. What about m=2? Not allowed. For m=4, k^3 +k^2 +k +1 =1e18. For k=1e6, k^3 is 1e18. So sum would be 1e18 + 1e12 + ... which is larger than 1e18. So perhaps for m=4, there's no solution. So 1e18 may not be expressible as such sum, hence output is NO.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nFirst, for each test case, read n.\n\nIf n is 1, output NO.\n\nElse, for m in 3 to 60:\n\n   compute the minimal sum for k=2. Which is 2^m -1. If this is larger than n, break (since higher m would have even larger minimal sum).\n\n   else:\n\n      compute upper_bound for k as floor(n^(1/(m-1))) + 2.\n\n      perform binary search between low=2 and high=upper_bound.\n\n      for each mid in binary search:\n\n         compute the sum for mid and m. If sum equals n → return YES.\n\nSo, how to compute the sum for mid and m?\n\nImplement the incremental approach:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut for m up to 60, this is manageable.\n\nSo for each candidate k and m, compute the sum as above, and compare with n.\n\nSo the code outline:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    n = ... \n\n    if n < 7:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        continue\n\n    found = False\n\n    for m in range(3, 61):\n\n        # compute minimal sum for k=2: 2^m -1\n\n        min_sum = 2**m -1\n\n        if min_sum > n:\n\n            break  # since higher m would have higher min_sum\n\n        # else, check for possible k in this m\n\n        # compute upper bound for k: n^(1/(m-1)) + 2\n\n        # but for m-1=1, when m=2, but m starts from 3, so m-1 is 2 and above.\n\n        # compute upper_bound:\n\n        upper_k = int(n ** (1/(m-1))) + 2\n\n        low = 2\n\n        high = upper_k\n\n        while low <= high:\n\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n            # compute sum for mid and m\n\n            s = 0\n\n            current = 1\n\n            for _ in range(m):\n\n                s += current\n\n                if s > n:\n\n                    break\n\n                current *= mid\n\n            if s == n:\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n            elif s < n:\n\n                low = mid +1\n\n            else:\n\n                high = mid -1\n\n        if found:\n\n            break\n\n    if found:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, for m=3, the upper_k is n^(1/2) +2. For example, for n=1e18, upper_k is 1e9 + 2. Binary search between 2 and 1e9+2 would take O(30) steps. For each step, m=3, the loop runs 3 times. So overall, for each test case, it's O(60 * 30 * 3) steps. For t=1e4, this is acceptable.\n\nBut for some cases, the upper_k can be very big. For example, when m=3 and n=1e18, upper_k is 1e9 + 2. But binary search for this would take about 30 steps. So for each m, the binary search is O( log (n^(1/(m-1))) )) steps, which is O( log n / (m-1) ) steps. But since m can be up to 60, the overall complexity is acceptable.\n\nBut how to handle the case where m is such that m-1 is 0? No, m starts from 3, so m-1 is 2 and higher.\n\nBut let's code this.\n\nBut there's a problem with the calculation of upper_k. For example, when n is 1e18 and m-1=2, then n^(1/(m-1)) is sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. So upper_k is 1e9 + 2. But for m=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So for k=1e9, the sum is 1 + 1e9 + 1e18. Which is larger than 1e18. So the upper_k may be too high, but the binary search will adjust.\n\nBut in the binary search, when mid is too large, the sum will be larger than n, and the high will be adjusted down.\n\nAnother possible optimization: in the compute_sum function, we can break early if the sum exceeds n.\n\nNow, testing this code with sample inputs.\n\nSample Input:\n\nTest case n=1 → output NO.\n\nn=2 → NO.\n\nn=3 → NO.\n\nn=6 → NO.\n\nn=13 → YES (m=3, k=3).\n\nn=15 → YES (m=4, k=2).\n\nn=255 → YES (m=8, k=2: 2^8-1=255, which is sum for m=8, which is (2^8-1)/(2-1) = 255. So yes.\n\nn=10101 → let's see. Let's see if 10101 can be expressed as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some m ≥3 and k≥2.\n\nLet me try m=3: k² +k +1 =10101 →k² +k -10100=0 → discriminant 1 + 40400 = 40401. sqrt(40401) is 201. So k=( -1 +201)/2 = 200/2=100. So yes. So k=100, m=3. So answer is YES. Hence sample input 10101 outputs YES.\n\nSample input 1e18 → output NO.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in Python, for exponents, 2**m can be very large. However, for m up to 60, 2**60 is around 1e18, which is manageable.\n\nBut in the code, for each m, the code checks if the minimal sum (for k=2) is larger than n. If yes, break the loop.\n\nBut for m=3, the minimal sum is 7. For m=60, the minimal sum is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a valid snowflake graph as defined. A snowflake graph is constructed by starting with a single vertex and then repeatedly adding layers of vertices such that each leaf node from the previous layer is connected to $ k $ new vertices, where $ k > 1 $. The challenge is to check if there exists such a $ k $ and the number of layers $ m $ (with $ m \\geq 3 $) that results in exactly $ n $ vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph can be represented as a geometric series sum $ S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m-1} $, which simplifies to $ S = \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1} $ for integers $ k \\geq 2 $ and $ m \\geq 3 $.\n2. **Constraints Check**: For $ n < 7 $, it's impossible to form a valid snowflake since the smallest valid configuration requires at least 7 vertices.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Layers**: For each possible number of layers $ m $ (from 3 to 60), check if there exists an integer $ k $ such that the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $.\n4. **Binary Search for Valid $ k $**: For each $ m $, use binary search to find if there exists a valid $ k $ such that the sum of the series equals $ n $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_m = 60\n    for m in range(3, max_m + 1):\n        # Calculate minimal sum for k=2\n        min_sum = (2**m - 1)\n        if min_sum > n:\n            break\n        # Compute upper bound for k\n        exponent = 1.0 / (m - 1)\n        upper_k = int(n ** exponent) + 2\n        low = 2\n        high = upper_k\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            s = 0\n            current = 1\n            for _ in range(m):\n                s += current\n                if s > n:\n                    break\n                current *= mid\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Minimum Vertices**: Directly return \"NO\" for values of $ n $ less than 7 since they cannot form a valid snowflake.\n3. **Iterate Over Layers**: For each possible number of layers $ m $ from 3 to 60, compute the minimum sum for $ k = 2 $ and break early if the minimum sum exceeds $ n $.\n4. **Binary Search for $ k $**: For each $ m $, perform a binary search on $ k $ to check if the geometric series sum equals $ n $.
