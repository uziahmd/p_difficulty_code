The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Xenia moving around a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the clockwise direction. But since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, the distance between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nWait, let's think about how to compute the time between consecutive tasks. Let's say she is currently at position current, and the next task is at position next. How much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince it's a ringroad with n houses, moving clockwise, the distance between current and next is (next - current) mod n if we take the shortest path? No, wait. Wait, no. Because movement is only allowed clockwise. So if current is 3 and next is 2, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is n - (current - next) steps? Or maybe (next - current + n) % n ?\n\nWait, for example, n=4. If current is 3, next is 2. Then moving clockwise, the steps are 3→4→1→2: that's 3 steps. Which is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4 = (3) mod 4 = 3. So yes, the formula would be (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which can be written as (next - current) % n if we take modulo n. Wait, but (next - current) could be negative. For example, next is 2, current is 3. 2-3 = -1. mod 4 would be 3. Which is correct. So the distance between current and next is (next - current) mod n. But since moving clockwise, that's the correct number of steps.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are 3, 2, 3. Let's see:\n\nShe starts at 1. First task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: steps are 2 (1→2→3). Then the next task is at 2. So from 3 to 2: since moving clockwise, that's 3→4→1→2: 3 steps. Then next task is 3 again. From 2 to 3: 1 step. Total steps: 2+3+1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach is to track the current position, and for each task, compute the steps needed to get from current to the next position, add that to the total, and then update current to the next position.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given in order. So for each task a_i, she must be at a_i, but she can have multiple consecutive tasks in the same house. So for example, if two consecutive tasks are both at 3, then the time between them is zero. So we need to process each task in order, and for each, calculate the time from the previous position to the current task's position, and accumulate that.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1 (starting point).\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n    compute the distance from current_position to a_i (clockwise)\n\n    add that distance to total_time\n\n    set current_position to a_i\n\nSo the key is to compute the distance between current and next, which is (next - current) mod n if the movement is clockwise. Wait, but (next - current) could be negative. Let me think again. For example, if current is 3 and next is 2, then (2 - 3) = -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the formula (next - current) % n gives the correct number of steps.\n\nBut wait, when next is equal to current, the distance is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo, for each task, the steps required is (a_i - current) % n, and then add that to the total.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nFirst task is 3. current is 1. (3 - 1) = 2 mod 4 is 2. Correct. Add 2.\n\nThen next task is 2. (2 - 3) = -1 mod 4 is 3. Add 3. Then next task is 3. (3-2) = 1 mod 4 is 1. Add 1. Total 2+3+1=6. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 3, tasks are 2,3,3. Let's see:\n\nStart at 1. First task is 2: (2-1) mod 4 is 1. Add 1. Current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: (3-2) mod 4 is 1. Add 1. Current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: (3-3) mod 4 is 0. Add 0. Total is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nInitialize current = 1, total = 0.\n\nFor each a in the list:\n\n    compute delta = (a - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = a\n\nAt the end, print total.\n\nBut wait, why is this correct? Because the movement is always clockwise, and the minimal steps between two points in a circle when moving clockwise is exactly (a - current) mod n. Because if a is ahead of current, then the steps are a - current. If a is behind, then it's (a - current + n) mod n, which is the same as (a - current) mod n.\n\nYes. So this formula works.\n\nNow, considering that the input can be up to 1e5 elements, and n up to 1e5, but the code is O(m) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's test some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=2, m=1, a1=1. So initial position is 1. Steps needed: (1-1) mod 2 = 0. Total is 0. Correct.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, m=1, a1=2. Steps: (2-1) mod 2 = 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, current is 5, next is 1. (1-5) mod 5 = (-4) mod 5 = 1. Which is correct: moving from 5 to 1 is 1 step (clockwise). So yes.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would read n and m, then the list of a's.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple lines. For example, in the sample input given, the first input is '4 3\\n3 2 3', which is n=4, m=3, and the list is [3,2,3]. The output is 6.\n\nSo the code needs to read the first line as n and m, then the second line as m integers.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead from stdin. So perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen, current = 1, total = 0.\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let's test the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent = 1.\n\nFirst num is 3: (3-1) mod 4 = 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond num is 2: (2-3) mod 4 = (-1) mod 4 = 3. total becomes 5. current is 2.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total becomes 6. Correct.\n\nSample output is 6. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nFirst num is 2: (2-1) mod 4 = 1. total 1. current 2.\n\nSecond num is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total 2. current 3.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-3) mod 4 = 0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for these cases.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2, 1]. Then:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst step: (2-1) mod 2 = 1. total 1. current 2.\n\nSecond step: (1-2) mod 2 = -1 mod 2 = 1. total is 2. So the answer is 2. Which is correct: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). Total 2.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=3, a=[5, 1, 5]. Starting at 1.\n\nFirst step: 5-1 =4 mod5 is 4. total 4. current 5.\n\nSecond step: 1-5 = -4 mod5 is 1. total 5. current 1.\n\nThird step: 5-1=4 mod5 is 4. total 9. So total steps 4+1+4=9. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct. Now, implement it in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, the modulo operation can return negative results if the numerator is negative. Wait, no. Wait, in Python, (-1) % 4 returns 3. So (a - current) can be negative, but mod n will give the correct positive value.\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nRead n and m, then the list of a's. Then process as above.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntotal = 0\nfor num in a:\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n    total += delta\n    current = num\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nLet me check the sample inputs again.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → output 6. Which the code gives.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → output 2. Which the code gives.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0? But according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. Because input constraints say m ≥1? Wait, the input says m can be 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. So no, m can't be zero. So the code is okay.\n\nAnother case where the same house is repeated. Like m=2, a=[1,1]. Then the total is (1-1) + (1-1) = 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving from one house to another clockwise can be calculated using modular arithmetic. The time to move from the current house to the next task's house is determined by the difference in their positions modulo the number of houses.\n2. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, as specified in the problem.\n3. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current position to the task's house using the formula `(next_house - current_house) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses. This formula ensures that the movement is always considered in the clockwise direction.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Sum up the time taken for each movement between consecutive tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        delta = (num - current) % n\n        total += delta\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Modular Arithmetic**: The movement time between houses is calculated using `(num - current) % n`, which correctly handles both forward and backward movements on the circular road.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution processes each task in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(m), which is optimal for the given constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required for Xenia to complete all tasks by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.",
