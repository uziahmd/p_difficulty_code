The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Xenia moving around a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement. But how?\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are at 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1. First task is at 3. How long does that take? Well, moving clockwise from 1 to 3: that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Then, the second task is at 2. But since she's at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around: 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. Then third task is at 3 again. From 2 to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is that for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the time it takes to move from the current position to the next task's house, considering the direction (clockwise only). But since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise from current position to target can be calculated as (target - current) mod n if target is greater than current, but if target is smaller, then it's (target + n - current) mod n? Wait, no. Let me think again. For example, if current is 3, target is 2, and n is 4. The clockwise distance is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4? Or maybe (target - current) if target > current, else (target + n - current). Because moving clockwise, the number of steps between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target + n - current). So for example, current is 3, target is 2. Steps needed: 3 →4 →1 →2. That's 3 steps. Which is (2 +4 -3) = 3. So yes.\n\nSo for each consecutive task, we need to compute the distance from the previous position to the current task's house, and sum all those distances.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given in order. So Xenia must do them in the order a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. But the problem says that for task i, she must have completed all tasks with numbers less than i. So the order is fixed as per the input list. So the sequence of tasks is a_1, a_2, ..., a_m, and she has to do them in that order. So the initial position is 1, then she moves to a_1, then from a_1 to a_2, etc.\n\nWait, but the first task is a_1. So the initial position is 1. So the first movement is from 1 to a_1. Then from a_1 to a_2, then a_2 to a_3, etc. So the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive positions, starting from 1.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current_position as 1. Then for each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\nCalculate the distance from current_position to a_i, add that to the total time. Then set current_position to a_i.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between current_position and a_i?\n\nAs discussed earlier, for each step, the distance is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target + n - current). Alternatively, (target - current) % n if moving clockwise. Wait, let's check:\n\nIf current is 3, target is 2, n=4. (2 -3) is -1. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes. So the distance between current and target is (target - current) if target >= current, else (target - current + n). Which can be written as (target - current) % n. But since in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values, but perhaps we can compute it as (target - current) % n. Let me check.\n\nFor example:\n\ncurrent = 3, target = 2, n=4. (2-3) = -1. -1 mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the distance is (target - current) mod n. But wait, what if target is equal to current? Then the distance is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for distance between current and target is (target - current) % n. But wait, for example, current is 1, target is 3, n=4. (3-1)=2 mod 4 is 2. Which is correct. So that works.\n\nSo for each step, the distance is (a_i - current) % n. Then add that to the total. Then set current to a_i.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nThe first task is a_1 = 3. So current is 1. (3-1) mod 4 is 2. So that's correct. Then current becomes 3.\n\nNext, a_2 is 2. (2-3) mod 4 is ( -1 ) mod 4 = 3. Which is correct. Then current becomes 2.\n\nThen a_3 is 3. (3-2) mod 4 is 1. So adding 2+3+1=6. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So that seems to work.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current = 1. total_time = 0.\n\nFor each ai in the list:\n\n   distance = (ai - current) % n\n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current = ai\n\nSo return total_time.\n\nBut wait, what about when the list is empty? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nLet me check the second example:\n\nInput is 4 3, and the tasks are 2,3,3.\n\nSo initial current is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: (2-1) mod 4 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: (3-3) mod 4 = 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes. So this approach works.\n\nSo the code needs to read n and m, then the list of m integers. Then compute the sum as described.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the list of m integers. Then process each element in order.\n\nBut wait, in the input, the second line is m integers. So for example, in the first sample input, the second line is '3 2 3'.\n\nSo in code:\n\nIn Python, read the first line as n, m. Then read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen, initialize current = 1, total = 0.\n\nLoop through each ai in the list:\n\n   total += (ai - current) % n\n\n   current = ai\n\nThen print total.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 1? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 2. So no problem.\n\nYes. So that's the code.\n\nLet me test another case. Suppose n=2, m=2, and the list is [1, 2]. Then:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 1: (1-1) mod 2 is 0. total is 0. current is 1.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-1) mod 2 is 1. total is 1. So output is 1. Which makes sense: move from 1 to 2, which is one step.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, list is [2, 1]. So first step: (2-1) mod 2 = 1. total is 1. Then current is 2. Next step: (1-2) mod 2 = ( -1 ) mod 2 = 1. total is 2. So the total is 2. Which is correct: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). So total 2 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead the input. For example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nSo the code would read n=4, m=3, and the list is [3,2,3].\n\nSo the code would process:\n\ncurrent = 1.\n\ntotal = 0.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) mod 4 is 2. total is 2.\n\ncurrent is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod4 is 3. total is 5.\n\ncurrent is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1. total is 6. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, the modulo operation returns a non-negative result when the denominator is positive. So (ai - current) can be negative, but %n will give the correct positive value.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list of m integers.\n\nInitialize current = 1, total = 0.\n\nFor each a in the list:\n\n   total += (a - current) % n\n\n   current = a\n\nPrint total.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for the input, the code needs to read from stdin. So in Python, something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na_list = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor a in a_list:\n\n    total += (a - current) % n\n\n    current = a\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, let me check the sample input. For the second example:\n\nInput is 4 3, and the list is 2,3,3. So:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 2: (2-1) mod4 is 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond a is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird a is 3: (3-3) mod4 is 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0? No, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1.\n\nWhat if all tasks are in the same house? For example, n=5, m=3, and the list is [1,1,1]. Then the total is (1-1) + (1-1) + (1-1) = 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when moving around the ring multiple times. Like n=5, m=2, list is [3, 1]. The first step is (3-1) mod5 = 2. Then (1-3) mod5 = ( -2 ) mod5 = 3. Total is 2+3=5. Which is correct: 1→2→3 (2 steps), then 3→4→5→1 (3 steps). Total 5 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nThus, the Python script is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes one unit of time.\n2. **Circular Movement Calculation**: The movement between two houses on a circular road can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. For any two houses `current` and `target`, the time required to move clockwise from `current` to `target` is `(target - current) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from house 1, iterate through each task, compute the time required to move from the current house to the target house for each task, and accumulate the total time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a_list = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for a in a_list:\n        total += (a - current) % n\n        current = a\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of houses `n`, the number of tasks `m`, and the list of house numbers where each task must be completed.\n2. **Initialization**: We start at house 1 and initialize the total time to 0.\n3. **Iterating Through Tasks**: For each task, we calculate the time required to move from the current house to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road. This time is added to the total, and the current position is updated to the target house.\n4. **Output the Result**: After processing all tasks, the accumulated total time is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modulo arithmetic to handle circular movements, resulting in an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
