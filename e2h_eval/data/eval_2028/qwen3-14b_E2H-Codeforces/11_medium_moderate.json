A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input consists of n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (milliliters per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (milliliters per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFirst, calculate how much total drink they have. That's k multiplied by l. Then, each toast requires n * nl milliliters. Because each of the n friends needs nl per toast. So total drink per toast is n * nl. So the maximum possible toasts based on drink is total_drink // (n * nl). Wait, but wait: the total drink is k*l. For each toast, each friend uses nl, so per toast, total is n * nl. So the number of toasts possible from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, if there's any remainder, it's not enough for another toast. So integer division here.\n\nThen, for the lime slices. Each lime is cut into d slices. So total slices is c * d. Each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices are needed. So the maximum toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor the salt: total salt is p grams. Each toast requires np grams per friend, so total per toast is n * np. So maximum toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three resources are required for each toast. So the maximum possible is the minimum of the three calculated values.\n\nWait, let me check the example given. The first input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo:\n\nTotal drink: 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. 20 / 9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the example's note. Then limes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each: 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices (since 3 friends each have one). 80 / 3 is 26.666..., floor 26. But the example says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait wait, no. Wait the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait, the note says that in the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, how?\n\nAh, because each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, n slices are needed. So for the first example, n is 3. So each toast requires 3 slices. The total slices available is 10 * 8 = 80. So 80 / 3 is 26.666..., which would be 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Oh wait, that's a mistake? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait no. Let me recheck the note. The note says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to my calculation, the total slices is 80. Each toast requires 3 slices. So 80 / 3 = 26.666, so 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, the note says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". But why?\n\nAh, maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice per person. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices are needed. So for the first example, 3 friends per toast. So per toast, 3 slices. So with 80 slices, 80 / 3 = 26.666, so 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which contradicts that. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait looking back at the note:\n\nIn the first sample, the note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 20ml of drink, which is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nWait, but why is the limes considered as 80 toasts? Because according to that, the limes are sufficient for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, each toast requires 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80/3 = 26.666 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So clearly, there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait maybe I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nAh! So for each toast, each friend needs one slice of lime. So for each toast, the number of slices needed is n (since each of the n friends needs one slice). Therefore, the total number of slices available is c*d. So the number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nBut in the note, the limes are 10 * 8 = 80 slices. So according to that, the number of toasts possible from limes is 80 / n, where n is 3. 80/3 is 26.666, so 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So that's conflicting. What's going on here?\n\nWait the note says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How?\n\nAh! Wait maybe the note is wrong? No, probably not. Let me check again the note.\n\nThe note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, but why is the limes count 80 toasts? Because according to the note, that's the number of toasts that the limes can support. But according to our calculation, the limes can support (c*d) / (n) toasts. So in this case, 80 / 3 = 26.666, which would be 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which implies that the number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) divided by 1, not divided by n. But that would be the case if each toast requires only one slice, not per friend. But according to the problem statement, each friend needs a slice. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices are required.\n\nBut according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which suggests that the number of toasts is (c*d) divided by 1. Which would be 80. But that would imply that each toast requires one slice, not per friend. Which contradicts the problem description.\n\nThis is a critical point. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\neach friend needs ... a slice of lime.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend must have a slice. So for each toast, n slices are needed. Therefore, the number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nBut according to the note, in the first sample, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that the calculation is (c*d) // 1. So 80//1=80. But that would be the case if each toast requires one slice. So why is this discrepancy?\n\nWait, maybe the note is wrong? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is correct, and I'm miscalculating. Let me check the first sample again.\n\nSample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nn=3, c=10, d=8. So total slices is 10*8=80. Each toast requires 3 slices (each friend has one). So 80 / 3 is 26.666, which would be 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How?\n\nWait, perhaps the note is considering that each toast requires one slice per person, but the problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. So perhaps the note is wrong? Or maybe the problem statement is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the note is correct, but the calculation is different. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So how can that be? Let me think: if each toast requires one slice per person, then for each toast, n slices are needed. So the number of toasts possible is total_slices // n. For the first sample, 80//3=26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So that suggests that the note is wrong. But that's impossible. There must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is referring to the number of toasts that can be made with the limes, but not considering that each toast requires one slice per person. Maybe the note is wrong. Or perhaps I have misread the problem statement.\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs ... a slice of lime.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. So for example, if there are 3 friends, each toast requires 3 slices. So for 80 slices, the number of toasts is 80//3 = 26.\n\nBut the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that each toast requires only one slice. So why is the note saying that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is not considering the number of friends. But that seems unlikely. Let me read the note again:\n\n\"In the first sample: Overall the friends have 20ml of drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, but why divide by 3? Because the answer is the number of toasts each friend can make. So the total number of toasts possible is min(...), and then divided by n? Or is the min(...) already the number of toasts per friend?\n\nWait, that's the key. Let me think again.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nThe problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided that they all drink the same amount. So each friend makes t toasts. So the total number of toasts made by all friends is t * n.\n\nBut for each toast, each friend needs some resources. So for each toast, the total resources required are:\n\nDrink: n * nl (because each of the n friends needs nl per toast)\n\nSalt: n * np (same reasoning)\n\nLime slices: n (each of the n friends needs one slice per toast)\n\nSo the total number of toasts that can be made (total_toasts) is limited by:\n\ntotal_drink / (n * nl) → which is the total number of toasts possible based on drink.\n\ntotal_salt / (n * np) → same for salt.\n\ntotal_limes / n → same for limes.\n\nThen, the maximum possible total_toasts is the minimum of those three numbers.\n\nBut the answer is the number of toasts per friend, which is total_toasts divided by n?\n\nNo, wait. Because total_toasts is the number of toasts that can be made in total. But since each toast is made by all friends, the number of toasts per friend is the same as the total_toasts. Because each toast is a single event where all friends take part. So if there are t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. So the answer is t.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let's think of an example. Suppose there are 3 friends. They make 2 toasts. Each toast requires that all 3 friends take part. So each friend makes 2 toasts. So the answer is 2. So the total_toasts is 2. So the answer is t.\n\nSo the answer is the minimum between the three computed values.\n\nBut in the note, the explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Which suggests that the min is 6, and then divided by 3. Which would be 2. But according to the previous reasoning, the min is the total_toasts, which would be 6, and then the answer is 6. But the note says that the answer is 2. Which contradicts that.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. So where is the mistake?\n\nLet me re-examine the note. The note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. Which implies that the total_toasts is 6, and then divided by 3 to get the per-friend number. But that would suggest that the total_toasts is 6, but the per-friend toasts is 2. Which would mean that the total_toasts is 2 * n = 6. Which would imply that the total_toasts is the per-friend toasts multiplied by n.\n\nSo the problem is that the initial calculations are for the total_toasts, which is the number of toasts that can be made in total (each toast involves all friends). But the answer is the number of toasts per friend, which is total_toasts / n ?\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Because if there are t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. So the answer is t. So why does the note say that min(6, 80, 100) is divided by 3?\n\nThis suggests that the initial calculations are wrong. Let me think again.\n\nLet me re-analyze the problem.\n\nEach toast requires:\n\n- For each friend, nl milliliters of drink. So for one toast, the total drink needed is n * nl.\n\n- For each friend, one slice of lime. So per toast, n slices.\n\n- For each friend, np grams of salt. So per toast, n * np grams.\n\nSo the total number of toasts that can be made is limited by:\n\ndrink_total = k * l → total_toasts_drink = drink_total // (n * nl)\n\nlime_total = c * d → total_toasts_lime = lime_total // n\n\nsalt_total = p → total_toasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThen the maximum total_toasts is min(total_toasts_drink, total_toasts_lime, total_toasts_salt).\n\nAnd since each toast is made by all friends, the number of toasts per friend is exactly total_toasts. So the answer is total_toasts.\n\nBut according to the first sample, the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Which suggests that the min is 6, then divided by 3. So according to this, the answer is 2. Which would imply that the total_toasts is 2 * 3 = 6.\n\nWhich would be the case if the total_toasts is the per-friend toasts multiplied by n.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial calculations are wrong. Let me re-calculate for the first sample.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5. So drink_total = 4 * 5 = 20.\n\nnl=3. So per toast, total drink is 3 * 3 = 9. So total_toasts_drink = 20 // 9 = 2. Because 2*9=18, 3*9=27 which is more than 20. So 2 toasts.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which is 20 / 3 = 6. So why is that?\n\nAh, here's the mistake. The note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which suggests that the drink per toast is nl, not n * nl. Which would be the case if per toast, each friend uses nl, but the total is nl per toast. Which would be wrong. But why is the note saying that?\n\nWait, the note says:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nBut that suggests that per toast, the total drink needed is 3 ml. But according to the problem statement, each friend needs 3 ml per toast. For 3 friends, that would be 3 * 3 = 9 ml per toast. So 20 / 9 = 2.222, which is 2 toasts. But the note says 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. This implies that the per toast drink is 3 ml, not 3 * 3.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Which means that the note must have a different logic, and I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nLet me re-express the problem statement:\n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend consumes nl, so for all friends, the total is n * nl.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be the case if per toast, the total is nl. Not n * nl.\n\nSo this suggests that the problem is that the note is calculating the total_toasts as (total_drink) / (nl) and then dividing by n? Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend requires these items. So for one toast, each of the n friends requires nl, so total drink is n * nl.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is 20ml, which allows 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be the case if per toast, the drink required is 3 ml (nl), not multiplied by n. So this suggests that the problem statement may have a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total for all friends is nl. Which would be impossible. Or perhaps the problem statement is written differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is that each toast requires nl milliliters for each friend. But the total for each toast is nl, not multiplied by n. That would be a mistake in the problem statement, but the note seems to indicate that.\n\nBut that would be a contradiction. How can the note's example be explained?\n\nLet me think again. In the note's first sample:\n\nn=3 friends. They have 20ml of drink. The note says that it is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would mean that each toast requires 3ml of drink. But since there are 3 friends, that would imply that each friend gets 1ml per toast. But the problem says that each friend needs nl=3ml per toast. So that would be a contradiction.\n\nUnless the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. So where is the error here?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total for all friends is nl. That would be a mistake in the problem statement, but that would explain the note.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters in total, not per friend. Which would make the note correct.\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem statement says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nAh! So for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, the total drink needed is n * nl. So the note's calculation of 20/3=6 is incorrect. Unless there's a misunderstanding.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So 6 toasts would require 6 * 3 * 3 = 54 ml. But the total is 20ml. Which is impossible. So the note's explanation must be wrong. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is referring to the number of toasts that can be made per friend, not total. Let me re-examine the note.\n\nThe note says:\n\nHowever, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nAh! So the min is 6, and then divided by 3 to get 2. Which would be the answer. So what is that 6?\n\nIt seems that the 6 is the total number of toasts that can be made, but then divided by the number of friends to get the per-friend number of toasts. But that doesn't make sense. Because if there are 6 toasts, each friend would have made 6 toasts.\n\nUnless the total_toasts is the number of toasts per friend. Which would mean that the total number of toasts is n * t, where t is the per-friend toasts.\n\nBut that would imply that for each toast, each friend participates once. So for example, if there are t toasts per friend, then each friend makes t toasts. But the total number of toasts is t, not n*t. Because each toast is a single event that all friends participate in. So if there are t toasts, each friend makes t toasts.\n\nSo why would the note say that the answer is min(...) divided by n?\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me try to think of the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo:\n\nDrink: 4 * 5 = 20 ml.\n\nEach toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So total_toasts_drink = 20 // 9 = 2. So 2 toasts.\n\nLimes: 10 * 8 = 80 slices. Each toast requires 3 slices. So 80 // 3 = 26.\n\nSalt: 100 grams. Each toast requires 3 * 1 = 3 grams. 100 // 3 = 33.\n\nSo the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample output. But according to the note's explanation, the min is 6, which is not the case.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. Which would be the case if the total drink per toast is 3 ml. So why is that?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total for all friends is nl. Which would be a mistake in the problem statement. Or perhaps the problem statement is that each friend needs nl milliliters per toast, but the total is nl per toast, not per friend.\n\nBut that would be a contradiction. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem statement says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters. So for one toast, the total amount of drink required is n * nl. So for the first sample, that's 3 * 3 = 9 ml. And 20 / 9 = 2.222, so 2 toasts.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which suggests that the per toast total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl, not n * nl.\n\nSo this implies that the note is wrong. Or perhaps the problem statement is different. But since the sample output is 2, which matches the calculation of 2, the note's explanation must have an error.\n\nBut the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. Which would be 6/3 = 2. So the note is assuming that the drink allows for 6 toasts, which is 20 / 3 = 6. So this suggests that the drink is being divided by nl, not by n * nl.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way to calculate the total_toasts is:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l.\n\ntotal_toasts_drink = total_drink // nl.\n\nBut this would be the case if each toast requires nl milliliters in total, not per friend. Which would contradict the problem statement.\n\nBut how to reconcile this with the sample input?\n\nIf we use this approach for the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink = 20.\n\ntotal_toasts_drink = 20 // 3 = 6.\n\nLimes: total slices is 80. Each toast requires 1 slice (not per friend). So total_toasts_lime = 80 // 1 = 80.\n\nSalt: 100 // 1 = 100.\n\nThen the minimum is 6, and then divided by n (3) gives 2, which matches the sample output. But this would mean that the problem statement is misunderstood.\n\nSo what is the correct way to interpret the problem?\n\nThe problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for each toast, each friend uses nl. So for one toast, the total is n * nl. But according to the note, the calculation is total_drink / nl, then divided by n.\n\nBut why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the number of toasts per friend, and each toast requires nl milliliters for each friend. So for t toasts per friend, the total drink required is n * t * nl. Which would be the same as t * n * nl.\n\nSo the total drink must be >= n * t * nl.\n\nSimilarly for salt: total salt is p >= n * t * np.\n\nLimes: total slices is c*d >= n * t (since each toast requires n slices, one per friend).\n\nSo solving for t:\n\nt <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nt <= (c*d) / (n)\n\nt <= p / (n * np)\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\nt_drink = 20 / (3 * 3) = 20 / 9 = 2.222 → 2.\n\nt_limes = (10 * 8) / 3 = 80 / 3 = 26.666 → 26.\n\nt_salt = 100 / (3 * 1) = 33.333 → 33.\n\nSo the minimum is 2. Which is the correct answer.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts, and then divides by 3 to get 2. Which suggests that the calculation was done as t_drink = (k*l) / nl, then divided by n. Which would be 20 / 3 = 6.666, floor to 6, then divided by 3 gives 2.\n\nSo that would be the same result as the correct approach. But why would the note do that?\n\nBecause the correct approach is t_drink = (k*l) / (n * nl), which is equal to ((k*l) / nl) / n. So the note's explanation is using the same calculation, but splitting it into two steps.\n\nSo the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts (which is (k*l)/nl), and then divides by n to get the number of toasts per friend. Which is the same as the correct approach.\n\nAh! So the note is not saying that the drink allows for 6 toasts in total, but that the drink allows for 6 toasts per friend. Which would be incorrect, but the calculation is correct.\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase:\n\nThe note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. But that's the value of (k*l) / nl. Which is the total amount of drink divided by the amount per toast per friend. But this value represents the maximum number of toasts that each friend can make, assuming that there is enough of other resources. Because for each toast per friend, the total drink needed is n * nl * t. So t = (k*l) / (n * nl).\n\nBut (k*l) / nl = (k*l / nl) = t * n. So the note's calculation of 20 / 3 = 6 is t * n. So then dividing by n gives t.\n\nSo the note is calculating the total possible toasts per friend as (k*l / nl) / n = (k*l) / (n * nl), which is the same as the correct approach.\n\nSo the note's explanation is correct, but it's broken down into steps that may be confusing. So the correct approach is to compute for each resource the maximum number of toasts per friend, which is:\n\ndrink: (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nlimes: (c*d) // n\n\nsalt: p // (n * np)\n\nthen take the minimum of these three.\n\nSo the code should calculate these three values and take the minimum.\n\nLet me test this with the first sample:\n\ndrink: (4*5) // (3 * 3) = 20 // 9 = 2.\n\nlimes: (10*8) // 3 = 80 // 3 = 26.\n\nsalt: 100 // (3 * 1) = 33.\n\nminimum is 2 → correct.\n\nIn the note's explanation, the drink is said to allow 6 toasts, which is 20/3 = 6.666, floored to 6. Then divided by 3 (number of friends) gives 2. Which is the same as the correct calculation.\n\nSo the code should compute the three values as described, then take the minimum.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead the input integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCalculate total_drink = k * l.\n\nmax_toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_limes = c * d\n\nmax_toasts_limes = total_limes // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\nmax_toasts_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_limes, max_toasts_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes. So that's the correct approach.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → outputs 2.\n\nAs above.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink = 100 *10 = 1000.\n\nnl=4 → per toast per friend: 4 ml. So per toast, total is 5 *4 = 20. So max_toasts_drink = 1000 // (5 *4) = 1000 // 20 = 50.\n\nlimes: c=1, d=19 → total slices 19. max_toasts_limes = 19 // 5 = 3 (since 5*3=15 ≤19, 5*4=20>19).\n\nsalt: p=90. np=3. per toast total is 5 *3=15. 90//15=6. So min(50,3,6) → 3. Which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink = 1,000,000.\n\nnl=50. per toast total is 10 *50 = 500. max_toasts_drink = 1e6 // 500 = 2000.\n\nlimes: c=25, d=23 → 25*23=575. max_toasts_limes = 575 // 10 = 57.\n\nsalt: p=1. np=1. per toast total is 10 *1 =10. 1//10=0. So min(2000,57,0) is 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nRead the input line as integers. The input is given as a single line with 8 integers.\n\nSo in Python, the code can read the input line, split into parts, and convert to integers.\n\nThen compute the three values as explained.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_limes = c * d\n\nmax_limes = total_limes // n\n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_drink, max_limes, max_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this with the samples.\n\nSample 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → 20//9=2, 80//3=26, 100//3=33 → min(2,26,33)=2 → correct.\n\nSample 2: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → 100*10=1000, 5*4=20 → 1000//20=50; 1*19=19//5=3; 90//(5*3)=90//15=6 → min(50,3,6)=3.\n\nSample 3: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → 1000*1000=1e6, 10*50=500 → 1e6//500=2000. 25*23=575//10=57. 1//(10*1)=0 → min is 0.\n\nAll correct.\n\nNow, handle edge cases.\n\nWhat if any of the denominators is zero? But according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive integers. So no division by zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when any of the max_* is zero. Like in sample 3, the salt is zero.\n\nAnother case: when the division results in zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The goal is to find the minimum number of toasts that can be made considering all resources.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Determine the total amount of drink available, the total number of lime slices, and the total amount of salt.\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - **Drink**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total drink available. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total number of lime slices. Each toast requires `n` slices.\n   - **Salt**: Calculate how many toasts can be made based on the total salt available. Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt.\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum value from the three resource constraints calculated above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_limes = c * d\nmax_limes = total_limes // n\n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_drink, max_limes, max_salt)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated as `k * l`. The number of toasts possible with this drink is determined by dividing this total by the amount needed per toast (`n * nl`).\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is `c * d`. Each toast requires `n` slices, so the number of toasts possible is the total slices divided by `n`.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total amount of salt available is `p`. Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt, so the number of toasts possible is the total salt divided by this value.\n- **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum of the three values calculated above, as this represents the limiting factor in how many toasts can be made given all resources.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make by considering all constraints and using integer division to handle the resource limits accurately.",
