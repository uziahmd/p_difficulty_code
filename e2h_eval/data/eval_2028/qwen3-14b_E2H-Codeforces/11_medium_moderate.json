A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible number based on the constraints of each resource.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each friend needs nl milliliters of drink per toast. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl ml? Or per friend? Wait the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" Oh right. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends has their own nl.\n\nSimilarly, each toast requires one slice per friend. So for one toast, n slices are needed. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the resources available:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml. How many toasts can this support? Let's say total toasts is t. Then total drink needed is t * n * nl. So t can be at most (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, if there's any remainder, it's not enough. So integer division here.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d. Each toast needs n slices. So maximum t is (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt: p grams. Each toast needs n * np grams. So maximum t is p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink: 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml? Wait, no. Wait for each toast, each friend needs nl=3 ml. So per toast, total is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222..., so floor to 2. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nLimes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each. 10*8=80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. So 80 / 3 is 26.666... which would be 26. But wait, the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait wait, no. Wait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the calculation, each toast requires n slices. For the first example, n is 3. So each toast requires 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80 / 3 = 26.666, which is 26 toasts. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait that doesn't add up. Wait what's the problem here?\n\nWait wait, maybe I made a mistake in understanding the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices are needed. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the total number of slices available is c * d. So maximum t is (c*d) // n.\n\nBut in the first example, c is 10, d is 8. So 10 * 8 = 80 slices. n is 3. So 80 // 3 is 26. So why does the sample explanation say that limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nWait the sample explanation says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to this calculation, it's 26. So there's a contradiction here. Which means I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait looking back at the note for the first sample:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait why is the limes allowing 80 toasts? Because according to the note, they have 80 slices. But each toast requires 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80 / 3 = 26.666 toasts, but the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice per person. But perhaps the note is considering that each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, n slices. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So how?\n\nIn the first sample, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But that would mean that the total slices required for t toasts is t * n. So for t=80, that would be 80 * 3 = 240 slices. But the available slices are 80. So that can't be. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh! Oh! So for each toast, each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs one slice. So for each toast, n slices are required. So for t toasts, n * t slices.\n\nBut in the note, the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So how?\n\nIn the first sample, the limes are 10 * 8 = 80 slices. So if each toast requires n slices (3), then 80 slices would allow 80 / 3 = 26.666 toasts, which is 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So this suggests that perhaps the problem is that each toast requires one slice per friend, but the note is saying that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would require that for each toast, only one slice is needed. But that's not possible. So there's a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is wrong. No, the note is part of the problem. So I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the note:\n\nIn the first sample, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How?\n\nLet me look at the numbers. The first sample input is:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n is 3, c is 10 limes, d is 8 slices per lime. So total slices is 10 * 8 = 80. The note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. So that would imply that each toast requires exactly one slice. But why?\n\nAh! Wait maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice per person, but the note is considering that each toast requires one slice per person. But perhaps the note is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the problem statement is different.\n\nWait the problem says: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\". So for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs one slice. So total slices per toast is n. So for t toasts, n * t slices.\n\nBut in the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which implies that the total number of slices is 80, and each toast uses 1 slice. Which would mean that the number of toasts is 80. So how does that fit with the problem statement?\n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding here. Let me recheck the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs ... a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs a slice. So for one toast, n slices. So for t toasts, n * t slices. So the maximum number of toasts possible from the limes is (c*d) // (n). Because total slices is c*d. So for example, in the first sample, 80 slices divided by 3 per toast gives 26.666, which is 26.\n\nBut according to the note, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that the maximum is 80. So why is that?\n\nWait the note says: \"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts\". So maybe the note is considering that each toast requires one slice, not per friend. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires a slice of lime, not per friend. But that would be different. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs ... a slice of lime\". So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So if there are three friends, each toast requires three slices. So the note must be wrong, but that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is correct, but I'm miscalculating. Let me re-examine the note.\n\nIn the note, the sample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So:\n\nDrink: 4*5 = 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend = 9 ml per toast. 20 / 9 = 2.222, so 2 toasts. Which is the first value in the min.\n\nLimes: 10 * 8 = 80 slices. The note says that this is enough for 80 toasts. How? If each toast requires one slice, then 80 toasts would take 80 slices. But if each toast requires 3 slices (for 3 friends), then 80 slices allows 80 / 3 = 26.666, which is 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So that suggests that the note is considering that each toast requires one slice, not per friend. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nBut the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Wait why 6? Let me check that.\n\nThe note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why 20 / 3? Because 20 is the total drink. For each toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, total drink is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 = 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But the note says that it's 20 / 3 = 6. That suggests that the drink is being calculated as (total drink) / (nl per toast). But that would be if each toast requires nl ml per friend. But that's not the case. So why is the note saying that?\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me recheck the note.\n\nThe note says: \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait 20 divided by 3 is 6.666... which is 6. But why is that the case? What's the logic here?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml. So for t toasts, total drink is t * n * nl. So the maximum t is (k * l) // (n * nl). \n\nIn the first sample, k*l is 20, n is 3, nl is 3. So 3 * 3 = 9 per toast. 20 / 9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that the per toast is nl ml. But that would be per friend. So if there are t toasts, each friend makes t toasts, requiring t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 20 / (nl) = 6.666, but that would be if the total drink is divided by nl per toast. Which suggests that the problem is that each toast requires nl ml per friend, but the total is per toast. \n\nWait this is getting really confusing. Let me try to think of the note's explanation.\n\nThe note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So 20 is the total drink. 3 is the nl value. So 20 / 3 is 6.666. But why? What does that represent?\n\nIf each toast requires nl ml per friend, then for one toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml. So for t toasts, it's t * n * nl. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nIn the first sample, k*l is 20. n * nl is 3 * 3 = 9. 20//9 is 2. So the maximum is 2 toasts. But the note says that it's 6. So why?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the problem statement is different. Maybe each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So the total drink per toast is nl * n. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the drink required is 3 ml. Which is nl. So that suggests that per toast, the total drink is nl, not multiplied by n. Which would be conflicting with the problem statement. \n\nThis is a contradiction. How can the note say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but according to the problem statement, it should be 2?\n\nSo perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me read the problem statement again carefully.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, the total amount of drink required is n * nl ml. \n\nBut in the note, the sample says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 20 divided by 3. So that would suggest that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which is nl. So that would mean that the total per toast is nl, not multiplied by n. Which would be a contradiction.\n\nBut why is the note like that? There's something wrong here. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs those things. So for one toast, the total drink is n * nl. The total lime slices is n * 1. The total salt is n * np.\n\nSo in the first sample, the total drink is 4*5 = 20 ml. For each toast, it's 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 = 2.222 toasts. So the maximum possible is 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So why?\n\nThis suggests that the problem statement is different from what I thought. Let me recheck the problem statement again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the total drink for all friends is n * t * nl. Which is what I thought before. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. So 20 is the total drink, divided by 3 (nl) gives 6. Which would be t = 6. Then total drink needed would be n * t * nl = 3 * 6 * 3 = 54 ml. Which is more than 20. That's impossible. \n\nThis suggests that the note is incorrect, which is unlikely. So I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem. \n\nLet me look at the sample input and output again. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nOutput is 2.\n\nThe note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So min(6, 80, 100) is 6, divided by 3 gives 2.\n\nSo the 6 comes from 20 / 3 = 6. So why is that?\n\nAh! Maybe the problem is that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total drink is divided by nl, and then divided by the number of friends. Or perhaps the number of toasts per friend is t. So for each friend, they make t toasts, requiring t * nl ml. So total for all friends is n * t * nl. Which is what I thought before. But in the note, the calculation is 20 / 3 = 6, which would be 20 / nl = 6.666, which is 6. Then divided by n (3) gives 2. \n\nAh! So the note's calculation is:\n\ntotal_drink = k*l = 20.\n\ntotal_drink / nl = 20 / 3 = 6.666. This represents the total number of toasts across all friends. Then, since each friend must make the same number of toasts, you divide by n to get per friend toasts. \n\nWait, that's a different approach. Let me think.\n\nLet me think of it this way: Suppose that each friend makes t toasts. Then, the total number of toasts across all friends is n * t. \n\nFor the drink: each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for each friend's t toasts, it's t * nl ml. Total for all friends is n * t * nl. Which must be <= k * l.\n\nSo solving for t:\n\nt <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nSimilarly, for the lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So for each friend's t toasts, it's t slices. Total for all friends is n * t slices. Which must be <= c * d. So t <= (c*d) / n.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires np grams per friend. Total per friend is t * np. Total for all friends is n * t * np. Which must be <= p. So t <= p / (n * np).\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of those three values.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\n(k*l) / (n * nl) = (4*5) / (3 * 3) = 20 / 9 = 2.222 → floor to 2.\n\n(c*d)/n = (10*8)/3 = 80/3 = 26.666 → 26.\n\np/(n * np) = 100/(3 * 1) = 33.333 → 33.\n\nSo the minimum is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which seems to be (k*l)/nl = 20 / 3 = 6.666. Which would be the total number of toasts across all friends, if each toast required nl ml per friend. But that would be the case if each toast requires nl ml per friend. But how?\n\nLet me think again. If each toast requires nl ml per friend, and each friend makes t toasts, then the total drink per friend is t * nl. So total for all friends is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be the total number of toasts across all friends. Because 20 / 3 = 6.666. So if the total number of toasts across all friends is 6, then per friend it's 6 / 3 = 2. Which is the correct answer. \n\nSo the note's calculation is:\n\ntotal_drink / nl = 20 / 3 = 6.666 → 6 toasts total. Then divided by n (number of friends) gives per friend toasts. \n\nBut how does that relate to the formula?\n\nBecause total toasts across all friends is t_total = n * t. \n\nSo for drink: t_total * nl <= k*l → t_total <= (k*l) / nl → t = t_total / n <= (k*l) / (nl * n). \n\nWhich is the same as before. So the note is calculating the total toasts across all friends, then dividing by n to get per friend.\n\nSo the three values are:\n\ndrink: (k*l) // nl → total toasts across all friends. Then divided by n.\n\nlimes: (c*d) // 1 → total toasts across all friends (since each toast requires one slice per friend, so total slices needed is t_total * 1. So t_total <= c*d. So t_total is c*d // 1. Then divided by n.\n\nsalt: p // np → total toasts across all friends. Then divided by n.\n\nSo the answer is min( (k*l)//nl, (c*d), p//np ) // n ?\n\nWait no. Let me think again.\n\nLet me rephrase:\n\nFor the drink, the maximum total toasts across all friends is (k*l) // nl. Because each toast (per friend) requires nl ml. So for example, if there are t_total toasts across all friends, then total drink is t_total * nl. So t_total can be up to (k*l) // nl.\n\nSimilarly, for the limes: each toast (per friend) requires one slice. So for t_total toasts across all friends, we need t_total slices. So t_total can be up to (c*d).\n\nFor salt: each toast (per friend) requires np grams. So total salt is t_total * np. So t_total can be up to p // np.\n\nThen, the maximum t_total is min( (k*l)//nl, c*d, p//np ). Then, the maximum per friend is t_total // n.\n\nAh! That's the key. Because the total toasts across all friends is t_total, and since each friend must make the same number of toasts, the per friend is t_total // n. \n\nSo for the first sample:\n\ndrink: (4*5)/3 = 20/3 = 6.666 → floor to 6.\n\nlimes: 10 *8 = 80 → 80.\n\nsalt: 100 / 1 = 100.\n\nt_total is min(6, 80, 100) = 6. Then per friend is 6 // 3 = 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAh! Now everything makes sense. So my initial approach was wrong. I had thought that the per friend toasts is the min of the three values computed as (k*l) // (n * nl), etc. But actually, the correct approach is to compute for each resource the maximum total toasts across all friends, then divide by n to get per friend.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute for each resource the maximum total toasts (t_total):\n\n- Drink: total_drink = k * l. Each toast (per friend) needs nl ml. So t_total_drink = total_drink // nl.\n\n- Limes: total_slices = c * d. Each toast (per friend) needs 1 slice. So t_total_limes = total_slices // 1 = total_slices.\n\n- Salt: total_salt = p. Each toast (per friend) needs np grams. So t_total_salt = total_salt // np.\n\nThen, the maximum t_total is min(t_total_drink, t_total_limes, t_total_salt). Then, the answer is t_total // n.\n\nBecause each friend must make the same number of toasts. So if the total toasts across all friends is t_total, then each friend can make t_total // n toasts, since t_total may not be divisible by n.\n\nSo in the first sample, t_total is 6. 6 divided by 3 friends is 2.\n\nAnother example: if t_total is 7, and n is 3, then each friend can make 2 toasts (7//3=2).\n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate the three t_total values, take the minimum, then divide by n (integer division).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate:\n\nt_drink = (k * l) // nl\n\nt_lime = (c * d) // 1 → which is just c*d\n\nt_salt = p // np\n\nt_total = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nanswer = t_total // n\n\nYes! That makes sense now. So the mistake earlier was thinking that each resource's limit was calculated as (available_resource) // (per_toast_per_person * n), but instead it's (available_resource) // per_toast_per_person, and then divided by n.\n\nSo for the drink, per_toast_per_person is nl. So total toasts across all friends is (k*l) // nl.\n\nFor the limes, per_toast_per_person is 1 slice. So total toasts across all friends is (c*d) // 1 = c*d.\n\nFor salt, per_toast_per_person is np. So total toasts across all friends is p // np.\n\nOnce we have that, the answer is the minimum of these three divided by n.\n\nSo now, the code can be written accordingly.\n\nLet's test this with the first sample:\n\nSample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nt_drink = (4*5) // 3 = 20//3 = 6.\n\nt_lime = 10*8 = 80.\n\nt_salt = 100 // 1 = 100.\n\nt_total = min(6, 80, 100) = 6. answer = 6 // 3 = 2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample from the example:\n\nSecond input line: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3.\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000. nl=4. t_drink = 1000 //4 = 250.\n\nt_lime: c=1, d=19 → 1*19=19. t_lime=19.\n\nt_salt: p=90, np=3 → 90//3=30. \n\nt_total = min(250, 19, 30) → 19. answer = 19//5 = 3. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThird input line: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\nn=10.\n\nt_drink: 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000. nl=50. 1e6 //50 = 20000.\n\nt_lime: 25 *23 = 575. \n\nt_salt: p=1, np=1 → 1//1=1.\n\nt_total is min(20000, 575, 1) → 1. answer is 1//10=0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code needs to compute these values.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the input line as integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l.\n\nt_drink = total_drink // nl.\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d.\n\nt_lime = total_lime_slices // 1 → which is just c*d.\n\ntotal_salt = p.\n\nt_salt = total_salt // np.\n\nt_total = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nanswer = t_total // n\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut need to handle cases where division is zero? Well, since all inputs are at least 1, so for example, nl is at least 1. So t_drink can be zero if k*l < nl. But in that case, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\nt_drink = total_drink // nl\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\n\nt_lime = total_lime\n\nt_salt = p // np\n\nt_total = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nans = t_total // n\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes. Let's test the first sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → \n\nt_drink = 4*5=20 //3 =6\n\nt_lime = 10*8=80\n\nt_salt = 100//1=100 → min is 6. ans 6//3=2.\n\nSample 2: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → \n\nt_drink=100*10=1000//4=250, t_lime=1*19=19, t_salt=90//3=30. min is 19. 19//5=3.\n\nSample3: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → \n\nt_drink=1000*1000=1,000,000 //50 = 20000. t_lime=25*23=575. t_salt=1//1=1. min is 1. 1//10=0.\n\nAll correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, code that.\n\nBut what about when some of the divisions are zero?\n\nLike, for example, if k*l is zero? But the input constraints say that all inputs are positive integers. So no problem.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n\nRead the line, split into variables, compute the three t's, take min, divide by n.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead input line as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute the values.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\nt_drink = total_drink // nl\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\nt_lime = total_lime\n\nt_salt = p // np\n\nt_total = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nans = t_total // n\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nTesting the examples, it works.\n\nAnother test case: if n=1, and all other values are 1. So:\n\ninput: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 → \n\nt_drink = 1*1//1 =1. t_lime=1*1=1. t_salt=1//1=1. t_total=1. ans=1//1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: if t_total is 5, n=2 → 5//2=2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Requirements**: Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend. Therefore, for `t` toasts, each friend will need `t * nl` milliliters of drink, `t` slices of lime, and `t * np` grams of salt.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total available resources:\n   - Total drink available is `k * l` milliliters.\n   - Total lime slices available is `c * d`.\n   - Total salt available is `p` grams.\n3. **Determine Maximum Possible Toasts**: Calculate the maximum number of toasts that can be made with each resource:\n   - For drink: `total_drink // nl`\n   - For lime slices: `total_lime_slices` (since each toast requires one slice per friend)\n   - For salt: `total_salt // np`\n4. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the minimum of the values calculated from the three resources. This value is then divided by the number of friends to ensure each friend makes the same number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\nt_drink = total_drink // nl\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\nt_lime = total_lime\n\nt_salt = p // np\n\nt_total = min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt)\n\nans = t_total // n\n\nprint(ans)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated as `k * l`. The maximum number of toasts possible with this drink is determined by dividing this total by the amount needed per toast (`nl`).\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices available is `c * d`. Since each toast requires one slice per friend, the total number of toasts possible is simply the total number of slices.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total amount of salt available is `p`. The maximum number of toasts possible with this salt is determined by dividing this total by the amount needed per toast (`np`).\n- **Determine Minimum Resource Constraint**: The limiting factor for the number of toasts is the minimum value obtained from the drink, lime slices, and salt calculations. This value is then divided by the number of friends to ensure each friend makes the same number of toasts.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the maximum number of toasts each friend can make by considering each resource's constraints and ensuring equitable distribution among all friends.",
