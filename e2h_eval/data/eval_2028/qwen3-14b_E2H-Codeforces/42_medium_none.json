Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that are shown simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment during the file copying process. Both progress bars are updated after each byte is copied. The first bar shows the percentage of the current file, and the second shows the overall percentage across all files. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer.\n\nSo, the approach is to simulate all possible moments when a byte is copied and check for each moment what the two percentages are. Then collect all the values that appear in both bars at the same time.\n\nBut simulating every byte might be computationally feasible since the maximum total bytes is 100 * 1000 = 100,000 bytes. For each byte, we can compute the current percentage for the current file and the overall percentage. Then check if they are equal, and collect those values.\n\nWait, but how do we track the current file and the current byte within that file?\n\nLet me think: For each file i (from 0 to n-1), and for each byte x in 1..a_i (since after each byte is copied, the progress is updated). But also, the total bytes copied up to that point is sum of previous files plus x. So for each byte copied, we can compute the current progress for the current file and the overall progress.\n\nBut how do I model this? Let's think of the entire process as a sequence of events. Each time a byte is copied, there's a new state. For example, for the first file, after copying x bytes (x from 1 to a_1), the current progress is floor(100*x/a_1) and the overall progress is floor(100*(x)/total_sum). But for the next files, the sum of bytes copied is the sum of the previous files plus x.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the total sum of all files, total_sum = sum(a).\n\n2. For each file i in 0..n-1:\n\n   a. For each byte x in 1..a[i]:\n\n      i. Compute current_percent = floor(100 * x / a[i])\n\n      ii. Compute overall_bytes = sum_prev + x, where sum_prev is the sum of the first i files (before this one). Wait, sum_prev is sum(a[0]...a[i-1]).\n\n      iii. overall_percent = floor(100 * overall_bytes / total_sum)\n\n      iv. Check if current_percent == overall_percent. If yes, add this value to a set.\n\n3. Also, consider the initial state where both are 0. Because before any bytes are copied, both are 0. So 0 is included. But according to the note, the initial state is considered. However, in the simulation above, when x=0, but the problem says that the progress bars update after each byte. So the initial state is when no bytes are copied, which is before any bytes are copied. So maybe we need to include 0 as a possible value.\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the progress bars show 0% at the beginning. So the initial moment (before any bytes are copied) is considered. But in the simulation steps, when x=0 for the first file, but the code above starts from x=1. So we need to handle that initial state separately.\n\nWait, the problem says that after copying each byte, the progress bars are updated. So the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. So that's a valid moment. Then, for each byte copied, after that, the progress is updated. So the initial 0% is included, and then for each byte, after copying, we check.\n\nSo, the initial 0% is a valid case. So we need to check that. Then, for each byte copied, after it's copied, check the two percentages. So, the steps would be:\n\n- Add 0 to the result set if there's a moment when both are 0. Well, the initial moment is when both are 0. So 0 is always present. But maybe in some cases, even after some bytes, both percentages can be 0 again. But the initial moment is definitely one.\n\nBut according to the example input, in the first example, the output includes 0 and 100. So for the first example, which is a single file of size 6, the progress bars are the same. So when x is 0, both are 0. Then, when x increases, the percentages are same. At the end, when x=6, the overall percent is 100, and the current percent is 100. So 100 is also included.\n\nBut how to capture the initial 0? Because when you start, the progress bars are 0. So we need to check that. Then, during the simulation, for each byte copied, after the copy, check the percentages. Also, after the last byte is copied, the progress bars are 100% (since the overall is total_sum / total_sum * 100, which is 100, and the current file's percent is 100 as well).\n\nSo the steps:\n\nInitialize a set to collect the valid percentages.\n\nAdd 0 to the set, since the initial state is both 0.\n\nThen, for each file i, and for each byte x in 1 to a[i], compute the current and overall percentages. If they are equal, add to the set.\n\nWait, but what about when the overall percent is 100? For example, when the last byte is copied. The overall is 100, and the current percent for the current file is (x / a[i]) * 100, which for x = a[i] is 100. So that's included.\n\nBut in the simulation, for each x in 1..a[i], the code would process that. So for the last byte of the last file, x is a[i], and the overall is 100. So that's captured.\n\nBut wait, the initial 0 is added. However, maybe there are other times when both percentages are 0. For example, in the second sample input, the output includes 0, 95, 96, etc. But the initial 0 is included. So the initial 0 is part of the answer.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\n- Initialize a set with 0.\n\n- Then simulate all the bytes copied, and for each, compute the two percentages. If they are equal, add them to the set.\n\nBut wait, the initial 0 is a moment when both are zero. However, when processing the first byte of the first file, after that byte is copied, the progress bars may be 0 again. For example, if the first file is 100 bytes, then after 1 byte, the current percent is 1% (floor(100 * 1 / 100) = 1). But if the total sum is 1000, then the overall is 0.1%, which is 0. So in that case, the two percentages are different. However, if the total sum is 100, then after 1 byte, the overall is 1% as well. So in that case, both are 1% and thus added.\n\nBut the initial 0 is added. However, during the simulation, for each byte copied, after that, the percentages are computed. So the initial 0 is already added. But during the simulation, after the first byte is copied, the percentages could be 0 again. For example, if the first file is 1000 bytes, and the total sum is 1000. Then after 1 byte, the current percent is 0.1% (floored to 0), and the overall is 0.1% (floored to 0). So both are 0. So that would be added again. But in our code, the initial 0 is added once, but during the simulation, that same 0 would be added again. However, since we are using a set, duplicates are not an issue.\n\nBut the problem says to collect all numbers that exist at some moment. So even if 0 occurs multiple times, it's only added once.\n\nSo the code should proceed as follows:\n\n- Compute total_sum = sum of all a_i.\n\n- Initialize a set called result = {0}.\n\n- For each file i in 0..n-1:\n\n   - sum_prev = sum of a[0] to a[i-1]\n\n   - for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n      - current_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n      - overall_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n      - overall_percent = (100 * overall_bytes) // total_sum\n\n      - if current_percent == overall_percent:\n\n          add to result.\n\n- After processing all bytes, collect all elements in the result set, sort them, and output.\n\nBut wait, what about the case when the overall_percent is 100? For example, when overall_bytes is exactly total_sum. That would be when x is the last byte of the last file. In that case, the code would process it as x = a[-1], and overall_bytes would be sum_prev + x = total_sum. Then, (100 * total_sum) // total_sum = 100. And the current_percent would be (100 * x) // a[i], which is (100 * a[i])//a[i] = 100. So that's added. So the 100 is included in the result set.\n\nBut in the initial code, the result starts with 0. So in the first example, the code would add 0, and then during the simulation, for each x from 1 to 6, compute current and overall percent. Since for all x, the overall is same as current percent (because total_sum is 6). So for each x, current_percent is (100x)/6, and overall is same. So all these values are added. For example, when x=1, 100*1/6=16.666..., floored to 16. So 16 is added. Similarly, when x=2, 33.333... floored to 33. And so on. Then, when x=6, 100*6/6 = 100, which is added. So the result set includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first example's output.\n\nBut the initial code adds 0, and during the simulation, for x=1 to 6, the code adds 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. So the set is {0,16,33,50,66,83,100}, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother example: the second input in the sample is 2 files, 100 and 500. Total sum is 600. The output is 0,95,96,...,100.\n\nLet me see. For example, when the first file is being copied. Let's say during the first file (size 100), the sum_prev is 0. For each x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100x)/100 = x. So for x from 1 to 100, current percent is 1 to 100.\n\noverall_percent is (100*(x))//600. For x=1, 100*1/600 = 0.166... floored to 0. So current is 1, overall is 0. Not equal. So nothing added. For x=599? No, that's in the second file. Let me think about when the overall percent could match the current.\n\nBut in the second sample, the output includes 95, 96, etc. So perhaps during the second file. Let's take the case when the second file is being copied. The sum_prev is 100. The total is 600. For x in 1..500.\n\ncurrent_percent is (100x)/500 = 0.2x. So for x=475, 0.2*475 = 95. So current percent is 95. The overall bytes is 100 + x. So for x=475, overall bytes is 575. 575 * 100 / 600 = 95.833... floored to 95. So both are 95. So that's added. Similarly, for x=480, current is 0.2*480=96. overall is (100 + 480) = 580. 580 *100 / 600 = 96.666..., floored to 96. So both are 96. So added. And so on until x=500. For x=500, current is 100, overall is (100+500)*100/600 = 600 * 100 / 600 = 100. So 100 is added.\n\nBut during the first file, when x=100, the current is 100, and overall is 100*100/600 = 16.666... floored to 16. So not equal. So during the first file, the only time when both percentages are same is when x=0 (initial 0). But during the second file, there are several points where the percentages match. Also, when the overall is 100, which is when x=500.\n\nSo the code would collect 0, and then during the second file's processing, collect 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. So the output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that correctly.\n\nNow, what about the case when the same value appears in multiple moments? For example, 0 is added once, but perhaps during the simulation, another moment when both are 0. But the set will take care of that.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n, then read a list of integers.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a)\n\nInitialize a set called result = {0}\n\nThen for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\nsum_prev = sum of a[0] to a[i-1]. How to compute that? Well, we can precompute prefix sums.\n\nAlternatively, for each i, sum_prev is sum(a[0..i-1]).\n\nFor example, for i-th file (starting from 0), sum_prev can be calculated as sum(a[:i]).\n\nBut for n up to 100, and a_i up to 1000, this is manageable.\n\nSo:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n\n    sum_prev = sum(a[:i])\n\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n        overall_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n        overall_percent = (100 * overall_bytes) // total_sum\n\n        if current_percent == overall_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\nOnce all that is done, collect the sorted list of elements in result.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the code adds 0, and then during processing of the first file, for x from 1 to 6, the current_percent and overall_percent are same. So for x=1, current is 100*1//6 = 16, and overall is (1*100)//6 = 16. So added. Similarly for others. So the code would generate all the required values.\n\nBut what about the moment when the overall is 100? For example, when the last byte is copied. The code would process that x as the last byte of the last file, and add 100 to the set.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, handling the initial 0. But what if the total_sum is zero? But according to the input constraints, each a_i is at least 1, so total_sum is at least 1. So division by zero is not possible.\n\nNow, let's test the code against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput is 1 followed by 6. So n=1, a=[6]. total_sum=6.\n\nresult starts as {0}.\n\nThen, for i=0, sum_prev is sum(a[:0]) = 0.\n\nLoop x from 1 to 6:\n\nfor x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = 100 *1 //6 = 16\n\noverall_bytes = 0+1=1. 100 * 1 //6 = 16. So added.\n\nSimilarly for x=2: 200//6=33. 200//6 is 33.333... floored to 33. So added.\n\nSame for all x. So the set will have 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first sample's output.\n\nAnother sample input is 2\\n100 500. So n=2, a = [100,500]. total_sum=600.\n\nresult starts with 0.\n\nFor i=0, sum_prev is 0. x ranges from 1 to 100.\n\ncurrent_percent is (100x)/100 = x. overall is (100 * x)/600. For x=1, 100*1=100, 100/600 is 0.166... floored to 0. So current is 1, overall is 0. Not equal. So nothing added. For x=600? No, because the first file is 100 bytes. So during this loop, x is 1-100. For all x, the current_percent is x, and overall is (100x)/600. So for x=6, 600/600 is 1, but x is 6. So current is 6, overall is 1. Not equal. So during the first file, no additions except possibly when x=0 (already in the set).\n\nThen for i=1, sum_prev is sum(a[:1]) = 100. x ranges from 1 to 500.\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // 500 = (x * 100) // 500 = x//5.\n\noverall_bytes = 100 + x.\n\noverall_percent = (100*(100 + x)) // 600.\n\nWe need to find when x//5 equals (100*(100 +x )) //600.\n\nLet's take x=475:\n\nx//5 = 475//5 = 95.\n\noverall_bytes = 100 +475 = 575. 575 *100 = 57500. 57500 /600 = 95.8333... floored to 95. So equal. So added.\n\nSimilarly, x=480:\n\nx//5 = 96. overall is (100+480)=580. 580 *100 = 58000 /600 = 96.666..., floored to 96. So added.\n\nSimilarly, for x=500:\n\nx//5=100. overall is 600. 600*100/600 = 100. So added.\n\nSo during the second file, the code adds 95,96,97,98,99,100. So the result set includes 0, 95,96,97,98,99,100. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if all the files are 1 byte? For example, n=2, a=[1,1]. total_sum=2.\n\nThe initial 0 is added.\n\nFor first file, x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent is 100*1//1 = 100.\n\noverall is (0+1)*100//2 = 50. Not equal. So nothing added.\n\nFor second file, sum_prev is 1. x runs from 1 to 1.\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 *1 )//1 = 100.\n\noverall is (1+1)*100//2 = 100. So added. So the result set has 0, 100.\n\nSo the output would be 0, 100.\n\nAnother case: when the two percentages are same at some point during the first file.\n\nFor example, n=1, a=[2]. total_sum=2. So during x=1, current is 50, overall is 50. So added. So the result set includes 0,50,100.\n\nSo output would be 0,50,100.\n\nAnother case: when during the same file, multiple x's produce same percentage. For example, n=1, a= [5]. So for x=1: 20, x=2:40, x=3:60, x=4:80, x=5:100. So all these are added. So the result set includes 0,20,40,60,80,100.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nIn Python, read n, then the list a.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the input is read from stdin. For example, in the sample input, the first input is ['1\\n6', ...], but the actual input is read as lines. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as:\n\nIn the first line, n is given. In the second line, the a_i are given.\n\nSo in code, the code should read n from stdin, then read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen compute total_sum = sum(a)\n\nresult = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    sum_prev = sum(a[:i])\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n        overall_bytes = sum_prev + x\n        overall_percent = (100 * overall_bytes) // total_sum\n        if current_percent == overall_percent:\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\nThen, collect the sorted list of elements in result.\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nprint('\\n'.join(map(str, sorted_result)))\n\nWait, but in the sample outputs, the outputs are like '0\\n16\\n33...' etc. So the code should print each number in the sorted list on separate lines.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the outputs are given as lists of strings. For example, the first sample output is ['0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100'] but the actual output is each number on separate lines.\n\nWait, the sample outputs in the problem description are given as lists of strings, but the actual output should be each number printed on its own line. For example, the first sample output is:\n\n0\n16\n33\n50\n66\n83\n100\n\nWhich would be generated by the code as sorted_result = [0,16,33,50,66,83,100], then for each element in sorted_result, print it.\n\nSo in code, after generating sorted_result, we can print each element on a separate line.\n\nSo:\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n\nBut in Python, when you have a list of integers, you can print them with '\\n'.join(map(str, sorted_result)), but that would produce a string with newlines, which when printed would be correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is given as a list of strings, but the actual output is each number on its own line.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nprint('\\n'.join(map(str, sorted_result)))\n\nBut let's test for the first sample. The sorted_result is [0,16,33,50,66,83,100], so the output is:\n\n0\n16\n33\n50\n66\n83\n100\n\nWhich matches the first sample.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is given as a list of strings, but the actual output is the numbers separated by newlines.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, testing for the case when the total_sum is 1. For example, n=1, a=[1]. Then, during x=1, current_percent is 100, overall is 100. So the result set is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: when the total_sum is 1000, and the first file is 1000 bytes. Then, during x=500, current_percent is 50, overall is (500 * 100)/1000 = 50. So added.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the case when the sum_prev is 0 and the current file is 1 byte. For example, n=2, a = [1, 1]. total_sum is 2.\n\nFor the first file, x=1: current_percent is 100, overall is (1 * 100)/2 = 50. Not equal. So not added. For the second file, sum_prev is 1. x=1: current_percent is 100, overall is (1+1)*100 / 2 = 100. So added. So the result set is {0, 100}.\n\nSo the code would output 0 and 100.\n\nNow, let's think about the third sample input:\n\nSample input: 4\\n1000 2 2 998. The output is 0,50,99,100.\n\nLet me see:\n\ntotal_sum = 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002.\n\nLet me think about when the percentages are same.\n\nAt initial moment, 0.\n\nAt some point during the first file (size 1000). For x=1000, the current_percent is 100, overall is (1000 * 100)/2002 = 49.95... floored to 49. So not equal. So during the first file, perhaps there's a point where the overall is 50. Let's see:\n\noverall_bytes = sum_prev + x = 0 + x. So overall_percent = (100 * x) // 2002.\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 * x) // 1000.\n\nWe need to find x where (100x)/1000 == floor( (100x)/2002 )\n\nBut 100x/1000 = x/10. 100x/2002 = x/20.02. So for x=1000, x/10 is 100, x/20.02 is ~49.95.\n\nBut when x is 1001? No, because the first file is 1000 bytes. So x ranges up to 1000.\n\nWait, but for x=1001, it's not possible here. So during the first file, perhaps there is no x where the two percentages are same except 0.\n\nThen, during the second file. The sum_prev is 1000. The file size is 2. So x can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 * 1)/2 = 50.\n\noverall_bytes is 1000 + 1 = 1001. overall_percent is (100 * 1001)/2002 = 50.0... (since 1001 * 100 = 100100. 100100 / 2002 = 50. So 50. So current is 50, overall is 50. So added. So 50 is in the set.\n\nSo that's why in the third sample, 50 is present.\n\nThen, during the second file, x=2:\n\ncurrent_percent is (200)/2 = 100. overall is (1000 + 2)*100 / 2002 = 1002 * 100 / 2002 = 100200 / 2002 ≈ 50.049... floored to 50. So current is 100, overall is 50. Not equal. So not added.\n\nSo 50 is added here.\n\nThen, during the third file (size 2), sum_prev is 1000 + 2 = 1002. For x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 * 1)/2 = 50. overall_bytes = 1002 +1 = 1003. 1003 * 100 / 2002 = 100300 / 2002 ≈ 50.1... floored to 50. So current is 50, overall is 50. So added again. But since it's a set, it's already present.\n\nFor x=2: current is 100. overall is 1002+2=1004. 1004 *100 / 2002 = 100400 / 2002 ≈ 50.149... floored to 50. So current is 100, overall is 50. Not equal.\n\nThen, during the fourth file (size 998). sum_prev is 1000 + 2 + 2 = 1004. The total_sum is 2002. So for x in 1..998:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 *x)/998.\n\noverall_bytes = 1004 +x.\n\noverall_percent = (100*(1004 +x )) // 2002.\n\nWe need to find when these two are equal.\n\nAt x=998, overall_bytes is 1004 + 998 = 2002. So overall_percent is 100. current_percent is (100 *998)/998 = 100. So added.\n\nAlso, perhaps during this file, when x is 998 - 2 = 996? Let's see.\n\nBut maybe there's another case. Let's see when overall is 99. Let's see:\n\nLet me think of when overall_percent is 99. So:\n\n(100 * (1004 +x )) // 2002 = 99.\n\nWhich implies:\n\n99 <= 100*(1004 +x)/2002 < 100.\n\nMultiply all by 2002:\n\n99 * 2002 <= 100*(1004 +x) < 100 * 2002.\n\nDivide by 100:\n\n(99 * 2002)/100 <= 1004 +x < (100 * 2002)/100.\n\nCalculate:\n\nLeft side: 99 * 2002 / 100 = ?\n\nWell, 2002 * 99 = 2002*(100 -1) = 200200 - 2002 = 198198.\n\nDivide by 100: 1981.98.\n\nSo 1004 +x >= 1981.98 → x >= 1981.98 -1004 → x >= 977.98. So x ≥ 978.\n\nRight side: 100 * 2002 / 100 = 2002. So 1004 +x < 2002 → x < 2002 - 1004 = 998. So x can be from 978 to 997.\n\nSo during this range, the overall_percent is 99.\n\nNow, current_percent is (100 *x)/998.\n\nWe need to check if this is also 99.\n\nSo (100x)/998 >= 99 → 100x >= 99*998 → x >= (99*998)/100.\n\nCalculate 99*998 = 98802. Divided by 100 is 988.02. So x ≥ 989.\n\nBut x can be from 978 to 997. So for x in 989 to 997, current_percent is 99.\n\nLet me check for x=989:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * 989) // 998 = 98900 // 998.\n\nLet me compute 998 * 99 = 98802. 98900 - 98802 = 98. So 98900 / 998 = 99 + 98/998 → floor is 99. So yes.\n\nSimilarly, for x=989, current is 99, overall is 99. So added.\n\nSo in this case, during the fourth file, for x from 989 to 997, the current_percent is 99 and overall is 99. So added.\n\nThus, 99 is in the result set.\n\nAlso, when x= 998, the current is 100, and overall is 100. So added.\n\nSo the result set includes 0,50,99,100. Which matches the third sample's output.\n\nThus, the code would capture that.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut for sum_prev, using sum(a[:i]) for each i. For n up to 100, and a_i up to 1000, this is acceptable.\n\nBut to optimize, perhaps precompute prefix sums.\n\nBut for small n, it's not necessary.\n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nRead n, read a.\n\nCompute total_sum.\n\nInitialize result as a set containing 0.\n\nLoop over each file, compute sum_prev as sum of a[:i].\n\nLoop x from 1 to a[i], compute current and overall percent.\n\nAdd to the set if equal.\n\nFinally, sort and print.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    total_sum = sum(a)\n    result = {0}\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_file_size = a[i]\n        sum_prev = sum(a[:i])\n        for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n            current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n            overall_bytes = sum_prev + x\n            overall_percent = (100 * overall_bytes) // total_sum\n            if current_percent == overall_percent:\n                result.add(current_percent)\n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    for num in sorted_result:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the third sample, the output includes 99. So in the code, during the fourth file, for x=989, etc., the code would add 99. Which is correct.\n\nTesting this code with the samples.\n\nBut for the third sample input:\n\nInput is 4\\n1000 2 ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer values between 0 and 100 (inclusive) that appear simultaneously on both progress bars during the file copying process. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file being copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied so far. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Total Sum Calculation**: Compute the total size of all files combined to determine the overall progress.\n3. **Simulate Copying Process**: For each byte copied in each file, calculate the current file's progress percentage and the overall progress percentage.\n4. **Track Matching Percentages**: Use a set to collect all unique values where both progress bars show the same percentage.\n5. **Output Results**: Sort the collected values and print them in ascending order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    total_sum = sum(a)\n    result = {0}\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_file_size = a[i]\n        sum_prev = sum(a[:i])\n        for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n            current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n            overall_bytes = sum_prev + x\n            overall_percent = (100 * overall_bytes) // total_sum\n            if current_percent == overall_percent:\n                result.add(current_percent)\n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    for num in sorted_result:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line gives the number of files, and the second line gives the sizes of these files.\n2. **Total Sum Calculation**: The total size of all files is computed once to facilitate the calculation of the overall progress percentage.\n3. **Simulating Copying Process**: For each file, we simulate the copying of each byte. For each byte copied, we compute the current progress percentage for the file and the overall progress percentage across all files.\n4. **Tracking Matching Percentages**: A set is used to collect all unique values where both progress percentages match. This ensures that each value is only recorded once, even if it appears multiple times during the simulation.\n5. **Output**: The collected values are sorted and printed in ascending order, ensuring the required output format.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the copying process and checks for matching progress percentages, leveraging the constraints provided to ensure performance and correctness.",
