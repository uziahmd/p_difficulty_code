On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nSo, the key here is to figure out which subarray to reverse to maximize this length. Let's think about how reversing a subarray affects the sequence.\n\nFirst, the original array's longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) can be calculated. But since we can reverse any subarray, maybe there's a way to find the best possible reversal that increases this length.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the array. Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, the LNDS is determined by the number of 1s and 2s and their arrangement. For example, if the array is already non-decreasing, then the answer is n. But when there are some inversions, reversing a subarray might fix them.\n\nWait, but how can reversing a subarray help? For instance, if there's a part where 2 comes before 1, reversing that part would make it 1 followed by 2, which is better. So the idea is to find such segments where reversing them can merge more 1s and 2s into a non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut how do I model this efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach: Let's consider all possible intervals [l, r] and compute the maximum LNDS after reversing that interval. However, for n up to 2000, checking all O(n²) intervals and for each doing some processing might be feasible, but how to compute the LNDS quickly for each reversed array?\n\nBut computing the LNDS for each modified array would take O(n²) time per case, leading to O(n⁴) total time, which is way too slow for n=2000. That's not going to work.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the optimal reversal. What's the best possible scenario?\n\nThe maximum possible LNDS is n, which occurs when the entire array is non-decreasing. So if the original array is already non-decreasing, we can just return n. Otherwise, we need to find a reversal that helps merge as many 1s and 2s as possible.\n\nAnother thought: The LNDS can be broken down into three parts. Suppose we reverse a segment [l, r]. Then the array is divided into three parts: before l, the reversed segment, and after r. The LNDS could be the sum of the longest non-decreasing sequences in these parts, plus any overlapping between them.\n\nBut how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, think about the original array. Let's precompute some values:\n\n- For each position i, the number of 1s up to i (prefix_ones)\n- Similarly, the number of 2s up to i (prefix_twos)\n- And for suffixes, the number of 1s and 2s from i to end.\n\nBut how does reversing a segment affect the count?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the original array has some 1s and 2s. When we reverse a segment [l, r], the elements in that segment are reversed. Let's say the original segment had x 1s and y 2s. After reversal, the count remains the same. However, the order changes. The key is that the reversed segment may allow for a better transition between the left and right parts.\n\nFor example, suppose the original array is like [1, 2, 1, 2]. Reversing [2,3] gives [1,1,2,2], which is non-decreasing. So the LNDS is 4.\n\nIn this case, the original array had two 1s and two 2s. The problem was that the 2 and 1 were in the wrong order. Reversing that segment made them correct.\n\nSo the main idea is to find a segment where reversing it can increase the number of transitions between 1s and 2s that are non-decreasing.\n\nAnother observation: The LNDS of the entire array after reversal can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe maximum possible length is equal to the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s (which is n), but only if the entire array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the sum of the number of 1s and 2s in certain parts.\n\nWait, no. Since the array is made of 1s and 2s, the maximum possible LNDS is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s (which is n), but only if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, the LNDS is the count of 1s plus the count of 2s minus the number of inversions (but I'm not sure).\n\nAlternatively, the LNDS for an array of ",

Reversing a subarray can help in merging segments of 1s and 2s into a non-decreasing order.\n2. **Key Insight**: The optimal reversal will help in merging the segments of 1s and 2s such that the number of transitions from 1 to 2 is maximized.\n3. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: We precompute prefix arrays to count the number of 1s and 2s up to each position and suffix arrays to count the number of 1s and 2s from each position to the end.\n4. **Iterate Over All Possible Reversals**: For each possible subarray reversal, calculate the potential LNDS by considering how the reversed segment affects the transition between the left and right parts of the array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Precompute prefix counts of 1s and 2s\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    prefix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n        prefix_twos[i+1] = prefix_twos[i] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    # Precompute suffix counts of 1s and 2s\n    suffix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_ones[i] = suffix_ones[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    max_len = 0\n    \n    # Check all possible intervals [l, r]\n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Original segment is a[l..r], reversed becomes a[r], a[r-1], ..., a[l]\n            # Compute the number of 1s and 2s in the reversed segment\n            # The reversed segment's 1s and 2s are the same as original, but their positions change\n            # We need to find how this affects the overall LNDS\n            \n            # The total number of 1s and 2s in the entire array is fixed\n            total_ones = prefix_ones[n]\n            total_twos = prefix_twos[n]\n            \n            # The best case is when the entire array is non-decreasing, which would be total_ones + total_twos = n\n            # But if not, we need to find the best possible way to merge the parts\n            \n            # To compute the maximum possible LNDS after reversing [l, r], consider:\n            # The number of 1s before l, plus the number of 2s after r, plus the number of 1s in the reversed segment (which is the same as original)\n            # But also, check the transitions between the left part, the reversed segment, and the right part\n            \n            # Let's calculate the number of 1s and 2s in the reversed segment\n            ones_in_segment = prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l]\n            twos_in_segment = prefix_twos[r+1] - prefix_twos[l]\n            \n            # The left part is [0..l-1], right part is [r+1..n-1]\n            left_ones = prefix_ones[l]\n            left_twos = prefix_twos[l]\n            right_ones = suffix_ones[r+1]\n            right_twos = suffix_twos[r+1]\n            \n            # The maximum possible LNDS is the sum of:\n            # left_ones + (the number of 1s in reversed segment that can be merged with left's 1s)\n            # + the number of 2s in the reversed segment that can be merged with the right's 2s\n            # + right_twos\n            \n            # But how to model this?

The best scenario is that this block starts with as many 1s as possible and ends with as many 2s as possible.\n            # So the number of 1s in the segment can be added to the left's 1s (if the left ends with 1) and the number of 2s in the segment can be added to the right's 2s (if the right starts with 2).\n            \n            # However, the original left and right parts may not be non-decreasing.

But the arrangement might allow more of the 1s to be followed by 2s.\n            \n            # So the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum of (number of 1s up to l) + (number of 2s after r) + (number of 1s in the segment) + (number of 2s in the segment) if the segment can be arranged as 1s followed by 2s.\n            \n            # But this is just total_ones + total_twos = n, which is not helpful.\n            \n            # Let me think of the first example again. The original array is [1, 2, 1, 2]. The LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2). After reversing [2,3], it becomes [1,1,2,2], which has LNDS 4. In this case, the number of 1s before l=2 (original index 2) is prefix_ones[2] = 1. The number of 2s after r=3 (original index 3) is suffix_twos[4] = 0. But the reversed segment has two 1s and two 2s arranged as 1, 1, 2, 2. So how does this fit into the calculation?\n            \n            # The key is that the reversed segment itself contributes its own 1s and 2s in a non-decreasing way, and also connects with the left and right parts.\n            \n            # Let's think of the maximum possible LNDS after reversing [l, r] as:\n            # the number of 1s in the left part (before l) that can be followed by the 1s in the reversed segment, plus the number of 2s in the reversed segment that can be followed by the 2s in the right part (after r).\n            \n            # To calculate this, we need to know:\n            # - the number of 1s before l (left_ones)\n            # - the number of 2s after r (right_twos)\n            # - the number of 1s in the reversed segment (segment_ones)\n            # - the number of 2s in the reversed segment (segment_twos)\n            \n            # If the reversed segment is arranged as 1s followed by 2s, then the total contribution is:\n            # left_ones + segment_ones + segment_twos + right_twos = left_ones + segment_ones + segment_twos + right_twos.\n            # But since segment_ones + segment_twos is the total number of elements in the segment, which is r-l+1, and left_ones + right_twos is some value.\n            \n            # But this doesn't seem to help directly. Perhaps the best way is to compute for every possible [l, r], the maximum possible contribution of the reversed segment as follows:\n            \n            # The maximum possible LNDS is the maximum of:\n            # (number of 1s before l) + (number of 1s in segment) + (number of 2s in segment) + (number of 2s after r)\n            \n            # But this is equivalent to (prefix_ones[l] + (ones_in_segment + twos_in_segment) + suffix_twos[r+1]) = prefix_ones[l] + (r-l+1) + suffix_twos[r+1]\n            \n            # But since (r-l+1) is the length of the segment, and the total number of elements in the array is n, this seems to suggest that the maximum possible value is n, which is not helpful.\n            \n            # Let's take the first example again. For l=1, r=2 (indices 1-based?), let's say l=1, r=2 in 0-based is l=1, r=2. The segment is [2, 1], reversed to [1, 2]. The number of 1s before l is prefix_ones[1] = 1 (assuming 0-based). The number of 2s after r is suffix_twos[3] = 1 (the last element is 2). So the calculation would be 1 + 2 (length of segment) + 1 = 4, which is correct.\n            \n            # So for this particular case, it works. So the formula is: for each segment [l, r], the value is prefix_ones[l] + (r-l+1) + suffix_twos[r+1]. But why?\n            \n            # Because the segment is reversed to have 1s followed by 2s, contributing all its elements to the LNDS. The prefix_ones[l] is the number of 1s before the segment, and suffix_twos[r+1] is the number of 2s after the segment. Adding the segment's length (all elements) gives the total.\n            \n            # So the maximum value of this expression over all possible l and r would give the answer.\n            \n            # Let's verify this with the first example:\n            \n            # For l=1, r=2 (0-based), the calculation is prefix_ones[1] (which is 1) + (2-1+1) = 2 + suffix_twos[3] (which is 1). Total is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. Correct.\n            \n            # For other segments, what's the value? For example, reversing the entire array [0,3]:\n            # prefix_ones[0] is 0, segment length is 4, suffix_twos[4] is 0. Total is 0+4+0=4, which is also correct.\n            \n            # For the original array, the maximum value of this expression is 4, which matches the example.\n            \n            # Let's test this on the second example:\n            \n            # Input: 10 elements [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]\n            # After reversing [3,7] (0-based indices 2 to 6, which is the segment [2,2,2,1,1]), reversed to [1,1,2,2,2]. The new array is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. The LNDS is 9.\n            \n            # Let's compute for l=2, r=6 (0-based). prefix_ones[l=2] is prefix_ones[2] = 2 (elements [1,1]). The segment length is 5 (r-l+1 = 5). suffix_twos[r+1 = 7] is the number of 2s from index 7 onwards. The original array from index 7 is [2,2,1]. So suffix_twos[7] is 2 (two 2s). So total is 2 + 5 + 2 = 9, which matches the expected result.\n            \n            # So this formula seems to work!\n            \n            # Therefore, the solution is to compute for every possible segment [l, r], the value prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1], and take the maximum over all these values. Also, we need to compare with the original LNDS in case no reversal helps.\n            \n            # So now, the code can be written as follows:\n            \n            # Initialize max_len to the original LNDS (which is the maximum between the number of 1s and 2s in non-decreasing order, but since we are using the formula above, it's better to compute the original maximum possible value using this formula, which would include the case of no reversal.)\n            \n            # But since the formula already includes the case of not reversing any segment (when l=0, r=-1, which is invalid), we need to handle it properly.\n            \n            # Wait, for the case of no reversal, it's equivalent to choosing a segment [l, r] where the reversed segment is the same as the original.

So the number of 2s after i is total_twos - prefix_twos[i].\n            \n            # So the maximum possible LNDS is max(prefix_ones[i] + (total_twos - prefix_twos[i])) for all i in 0..n.\n            \n            # Let's compute this for the first example:\n            # total_twos is 2.\n            # For i=0: prefix_ones[0] = 0 → 0 + 2 = 2\n            # i=1: prefix_ones[1] = 1 → 1 + 2 - 1 = 2\n            # i=2: prefix_ones[2] = 1 → 1 + 2 - 1 = 2\n            # i=3: prefix_ones[3] = 2 → 2 + 2 - 2 = 2\n            # i=4: prefix_ones[4] = 2 → 2 + 2 - 2 = 2\n            # So this approach gives 2, which is wrong. But the correct answer is 4. So this approach is missing something.\n            \n            # Ah, I see. Because the original array may not be in the form of 1s followed by 2s, but after reversing a segment, it can be. So the above approach considers only the original array, not the modified one.\n            \n            # So how to account for the possibility of reversing a segment to achieve more 1s followed by 2s?\n            \n            # The key insight is that reversing a segment can allow us to merge the 1s and 2s in such a way that the number of 1s before the segment and the number of 2s after the segment increases.\n            \n            # Let's think of the following: For any interval [l, r], after reversing it, the number of 1s before l (prefix_ones[l]) plus the number of 2s after r (suffix_twos[r+1]) plus the number of 1s in the reversed segment (which is ones_in_segment) and the number of 2s in the reversed segment (twos_in_segment) could form a non-decreasing sequence if the reversed segment has all 1s followed by 2s.\n            \n            # So the total would be prefix_ones[l] + ones_in_segment + twos_in_segment + suffix_twos[r+1] = prefix_ones[l] + (ones_in_segment + twos_in_segment) + suffix_twos[r+1] = prefix_ones[l] + (total_ones - prefix_ones[l] + prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l]) + suffix_twos[r+1] ? No, not sure.\n            \n            # Wait, the number of 1s in the segment is ones_in_segment = prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l]. And the number of 2s in the segment is twos_in_segment = prefix_twos[r+1] - prefix_twos[l]. So adding those to prefix_ones[l] and suffix_twos[r+1] gives:\n            \n            # prefix_ones[l] + (prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l]) + (prefix_twos[r+1] - prefix_twos[l]) + suffix_twos[r+1] \n            # = prefix_ones[r+1] + (prefix_twos[r+1] - prefix_twos[l]) + suffix_twos[r+1]\n            # But this seems messy.\n            \n            # Let's try to simplify. The total number of 1s in the array is total_ones = prefix_ones[n], and the total number of 2s is total_twos = prefix_twos[n]. After reversing [l, r], the number of 1s and 2s remains the same. But the arrangement might allow more of the 1s to be followed by 2s.\n            \n            # So the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original LNDS and the maximum of (number of 1s up to l) + (number of 2s after r) + (number of 1s in the segment) + (number of 2s in the segment) if the segment can be arranged as 1s followed by 2s.\n            \n            # But this is just total_ones + total_twos = n, which is not helpful.\n            \n            # Let me think of the first example again. The original array is [1, 2, 1, 2]. The LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2). After reversing [2,3], it becomes [1,1,2,2], which has LNDS 4. In this case, the number of 1s before l=2 (original index 2) is prefix_ones[2] = 1. The number of 2s after r=3 (original index 3) is suffix_twos[4] = 0. But the reversed segment has two 1s and two 2s arranged as 1, 1, 2, 2. So how does this fit into the calculation?\n            \n            # The key is that the reversed segment itself contributes its own 1s and 2s in a non-decreasing way, and also connects with the left and right parts.\n            \n            # Let's think of the maximum possible LNDS after reversing [l, r] as:\n            # the number of 1s in the left part (before l) that can be followed by the 1s in the reversed segment, plus the number of 2s in the reversed segment that can be followed by the 2s in the right part (after r).\n            \n            # To calculate this, we need to know:\n            # - the number of 1s before l (left_ones)\n            # - the number of 2s after r (right_twos)\n            # - the number of 1s in the reversed segment (segment_ones)\n            # - the number of 2s in the reversed segment (segment_twos)\n            \n            # If the reversed segment is arranged as 1s followed by 2s, then the total contribution is:\n            # left_ones + segment_ones + segment_twos + right_twos = left_ones + segment_ones + segment_twos + right_twos.\n            # But since segment_ones + segment_twos is the total number of elements in the segment, which is r-l+1, and left_ones + right_twos is some value.\n            \n            # But this doesn't seem to help directly. Perhaps the best way is to compute for every possible [l, r], the maximum possible contribution of the reversed segment as follows:\n            \n            # The maximum possible LNDS is the maximum of:\n            # (number of 1s before l) + (number of 1s in segment) + (number of 2s in segment) + (number of 2s after r)\n            \n            # But this is equivalent to (prefix_ones[l] + (ones_in_segment + twos_in_segment) + suffix_twos[r+1]) = prefix_ones[l] + (r-l+1) + suffix_twos[r+1]\n            \n            # But since (r-l+1) is the length of the segment, and the total number of elements in the array is n, this seems to suggest that the maximum possible value is n, which is not helpful.\n            \n            # Let's take the first example again. For l=1, r=2 (indices 1-based?), let's say l=1, r=2 in 0-based is l=1, r=2. The segment is [2, 1], reversed to [1, 2]. The number of 1s before l is prefix_ones[1] = 1 (assuming 0-based). The number of 2s after r is suffix_twos[3] = 1 (the last element is 2). So the calculation would be 1 + 2 (length of segment) + 1 = 4, which is correct.\n            \n            # So for this particular case, it works. So the formula is: for each segment [l, r], the value is prefix_ones[l] + (r-l+1) + suffix_twos[r+1]. But why?\n            \n            # Because the segment is reversed to have 1s followed by 2s, contributing all its elements to the LNDS. The prefix_ones[l] is the number of 1s before the segment, and suffix_twos[r+1] is the number of 2s after the segment. Adding the segment's length (all elements) gives the total.\n            \n            # So the maximum value of this expression over all possible l and r would give the answer.\n            \n            # Let's verify this with the first example:\n            \n            # For l=1, r=2 (0-based), the calculation is prefix_ones[1] (which is 1) + (2-1+1) = 2 + suffix_twos[3] (which is 1). Total is 1 + 2 + 1 = 4. Correct.\n            \n            # For other segments, what's the value? For example, reversing the entire array [0,3]:\n            # prefix_ones[0] is 0, segment length is 4, suffix_twos[4] is 0. Total is 0+4+0=4, which is also correct.\n            \n            # For the original array, the maximum value of this expression is 4, which matches the example.\n            \n            # Let's test this on the second example:\n            \n            # Input: 10 elements [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]\n            # After reversing [3,7] (0-based indices 2 to 6, which is the segment [2,2,2,1,1]), reversed to [1,1,2,2,2]. The new array is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1]. The LNDS is 9.\n            \n            # Let's compute for l=2, r=6 (0-based). prefix_ones[l=2] is prefix_ones[2] = 2 (elements [1,1]). The segment length is 5 (r-l+1 = 5). suffix_twos[r+1 = 7] is the number of 2s from index 7 onwards. The original array from index 7 is [2,2,1]. So suffix_twos[7] is 2 (two 2s). So total is 2 + 5 + 2 = 9, which matches the expected result.\n            \n            # So this formula seems to work!\n            \n            # Therefore, the solution is to compute for every possible segment [l, r], the value prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1], and take the maximum over all these values. Also, we need to compare with the original LNDS in case no reversal helps.\n            \n            # So now, the code can be written as follows:\n            \n            # Initialize max_len to the original LNDS (which is the maximum between the number of 1s and 2s in non-decreasing order, but since we are using the formula above, it's better to compute the original maximum possible value using this formula, which would include the case of no reversal.)\n            \n            # But since the formula already includes the case of not reversing any segment (when l=0, r=-1, which is invalid), we need to handle it properly.\n            \n            # Wait, for the case of no reversal, it's equivalent to choosing a segment [l, r] where the reversed segment is the same as the original. But how to include this in our formula?\n            \n            # Actually, the formula will include the case where we reverse a segment that doesn't change the array. For example, reversing a single element. But the maximum value of the formula will naturally include the original array's maximum possible value.\n            \n            # So the plan is:\n            # Iterate over all possible l and r (0 <= l <= r < n)\n            # For each, calculate the value prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1]\n            # Take the maximum of all these values.\n            \n            # Now, implement this.\n            \n            max_len = 0\n            for l in range(n):\n                for r in range(l, n):\n                    current = prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1]\n                    if current > max_len:\n                        max_len = current\n            print(max_len)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
