Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me think. In a regular polygon, each interior angle can be calculated. Wait, but here we're talking about angles formed by three vertices. For example, in a triangle (n=3), any three vertices form the triangle's angles. But for a square (n=4), if you pick three vertices, like 1,2,3, the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But if you pick vertices 1,2,4, then the angle at 2 would be 45 degrees? Or maybe not. Wait, how exactly does this work?\n\nLet me recall some geometry. In a regular polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. But when considering an inscribed angle, maybe there's a formula here. For example, if you have three points v1, v2, v3 on the polygon, with v2 being the vertex of the angle. Then the angle at v2 depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2.\n\nLet me think of the regular polygon as being inscribed in a circle. Then, the angle at v2 would be an inscribed angle. Let's suppose that between v2 and v1 there are k steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3 there are m steps counter-clockwise. Wait, but since the polygon is regular, maybe the angle depends on the number of sides between the points.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for a regular n-gon, the measure of the angle formed at a vertex v2 by two other vertices v1 and v3 depends on the number of edges between them. For example, if you take a square (n=4), and consider vertices 1, 2, 3: the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But if you take vertices 1, 2, 4, then the angle at 2 is 45 degrees. How?\n\nWait, maybe the formula for the angle at v2 is determined by the number of sides between v1 and v2 and between v3 and v2. Suppose that between v2 and v1, there are k edges in one direction, and between v2 and v3, there are m edges in the other direction. Since the polygon is regular, the total number of edges between v1 and v3 along the perimeter would be k + m. But since the polygon is convex, the angle at v2 would be determined by the arc between v1 and v3.\n\nWait, here's a thought. For a regular polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 2π/n radians. If I have two points v1 and v3 that are k steps apart along the perimeter (so the arc between them is k * (2π/n) radians), then the inscribed angle subtended by that arc at some point on the circumference would be half of that. But wait, that's only if the angle is subtended by the arc. So if the angle is formed by points v1, v2, v3, where v2 is on the circumference, then the angle at v2 would be half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Hmm, maybe that's the case.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 would depend on the number of vertices between v1 and v3. Let me try to find a formula.\n\nSuppose that between v1 and v3, there are k steps (edges) along the perimeter. Then the arc length between them is k * (2π/n) radians. The inscribed angle subtended by this arc at a point v2 that's not on that arc would be half the measure of the arc. Wait, but in our case, v2 is adjacent to both v1 and v3? No, not necessarily. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, for a regular polygon, the angle formed by three vertices v1, v2, v3 (with v2 as the vertex) can be calculated as follows. Let's assume that the polygon is inscribed in a unit circle. The central angles between consecutive vertices are 2π/n radians. Now, for the angle at v2, the points v1 and v3 are located at certain positions around the circle. The angle between the lines v2v1 and v2v3 is determined by the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Let me think of the regular polygon as a circle divided into n equal arcs.\n\nLet me take an example. For a square (n=4), the central angle between adjacent vertices is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular convex n-gon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently computing the closest possible angle.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular polygon inscribed in a circle, the central angle between adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{360^\\circ}{n} $. The angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the number of steps between these vertices along the perimeter.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For a regular n-gon, the angle formed at a vertex $ v_2 $ by vertices $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $ can be calculated based on the number of steps between $ v_1 $ and $ v_2 $, and $ v_3 $ and $ v_2 $. The formula for the angle is derived from the arc subtended by the points.\n3. **Optimal Angle Search**: We iterate through possible configurations of vertices to find the configuration where the angle is closest to the given value `a`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import math\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # For a regular n-gon, the angle at v2 when there are k steps between v1 and v3 (excluding v2)\n    # The formula for the angle at v2 is (k-1) * 180 / n degrees\n    # Wait, let's think again.\n    # The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees.\n    # If between v1 and v3 there are k edges (so k+1 vertices), then the arc is k*(360/n) degrees.\n    # The inscribed angle would be half the arc that does not contain v2.\n    # However, since the polygon is convex and regular, the angle at v2 depends on how many steps between v1 and v3.\n    # Let me think: For a regular polygon, if we pick v2 as the vertex, and v1 and v3 such that there are m steps from v2 to v1 clockwise and k steps from v2 to v3 counter-clockwise.\n    # Then the total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2 is m + k steps.\n    # The corresponding arc is (m + k) * (360 / n) degrees.\n    # The angle at v2 is half of the arc that is opposite to it, which would be (m + k - 1) * (180 / n) degrees.\n    # Wait, perhaps the correct formula is (k - 1) * (180 / n) degrees, where k is the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2.\n    # For example, in square (n=4), if we have vertices 1, 2, 4. Between 1 and 4, there are 3 edges along the arc that does not contain 2. So the arc is 3*(360/4) = 270 degrees. The inscribed angle is half of that, but wait, that would be 135 degrees. Which doesn't match with the sample input. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n    # Let me refer back to the sample input:\n    # For n=4 and a=67, the closest angle is 45 degrees. How is this achieved?\n    # For example, vertices 1, 2, 3: angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But vertices 1, 2, 4: angle at 2 is 45 degrees.\n    # How is that calculated? Let's see.\n    # In a square, the internal angle at each vertex is 90 degrees. But when you take three vertices that form a triangle, the angle at the vertex may vary.\n    # Another approach: For any regular n-gon, the angle formed at v2 by v1 and v3 is (k * 180)/(n), where k is the number of sides between v1 and v3 minus 1. For example, in the square, if there are 2 steps between v1 and v3 (like 1 and 3), then k = 1. So angle is 180/4 = 45 degrees. That matches the sample.\n    # So the formula seems to be angle = (k) * 180 / n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. And since the polygon is regular, the maximum possible k is n-2 (when v1 and v3 are adjacent to each other on the opposite side).\n    # Therefore, for each possible k (from 1 to n-2), the angle is (k) * 180 / n.\n    # Wait, for n=3, k can be 1 (since between v1 and v3, there are 1 step). Then the angle is 1*180/3 = 60 degrees, which matches the first sample.\n    # For n=4, k can be 1 or 2. For k=1, angle is 45 degrees, for k=2, 90 degrees. Which matches the second and third samples.\n    # So the problem reduces to finding the value of k (from 1 to n-2) such that the angle (k * 180)/n is closest to a. Once we find the best k, we can choose any triplet of vertices that corresponds to this k.\n\n    # So the plan is:\n    # 1. Compute all possible angles for k in 1 to n-2.\n    # 2. Find the k that gives the angle closest to a.\n    # 3. Once we have that k, construct a triplet of vertices that corresponds to this k.\n\n    # However, since n can be up to 1e5, we need an efficient way to find the optimal k without checking all possibilities.\n    # Let's compute the optimal k:\n    # The angle for a given k is angle_k = (k * 180) / n\n    # We want to find k such that |angle_k - a| is minimized.\n    # Solving for k: k = (a * n) / 180\n    # But k must be an integer between 1 and n-2.\n\n    # So compute the ideal k as (a * n) / 180, then check floor and ceiling values.\n\n    # Let's calculate the ideal k:\n    ideal_k = (a * n) / 180\n    # We need to find the integer k in [1, n-2] that is closest to ideal_k.\n\n    # Now, considering that k must be integer, we can try k_floor = floor(ideal_k), k_ceil = ceil(ideal_k)\n    # Also, check if k_floor or k_ceil are within the allowed range.\n\n    # Also, note that for k=1, angle is 180/n, for k=n-2, angle is (n-2)*180/n = 180 - 360/n.\n\n    # So let's compute the best k.\n\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n\n    # We can compute the k candidates around ideal_k\n    candidates = set()\n    for delta in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        candidate = int(ideal_k) + delta\n        if 1 <= candidate <= n-2:\n            candidates.add(candidate)\n    # Also add the floor and ceiling explicitly\n    candidates.add(int(math.floor(ideal_k)))\n    candidates.add(int(math.ceil(ideal_k)))\n\n    # Now check all candidate k's\n    for k in candidates:\n        angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Choose the smaller k? Or any, since the problem allows any valid triplet.\n            # Since the problem says any is acceptable, just keep the first found.\n            pass\n\n    # Now, once best_k is determined, we need to output a triplet of vertices that forms this angle.\n\n    # How to construct the triplet? For example, for best_k, we need to select v2, and then v1 and v3 such that there are best_k steps between them along the arc not containing v2.\n\n    # Let's pick v2 as 1. Then, v1 can be 2, and v3 can be (2 + best_k) mod n? Or need to think about the positions.\n\n    # Let's consider the polygon is numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. For a given best_k, we need to have two points that are best_k steps apart along the arc not containing v2.\n\n    # For example, if best_k is 1, then the angle is 180/n. For n=4, this is 45 degrees. For v2=2, v1=1, v3=3. But that would give the angle at v2 as 90 degrees. Wait, no. Maybe my previous understanding is incorrect.\n\n    # Alternatively, perhaps for a given k, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2 is k+1 steps. Or maybe I need to think differently.\n\n    # Let's take the example from the sample input: n=4, a=67. The best_k is 1, since 1*180/4 = 45 degrees. The sample output is \"2 1 3\", which is vertices 2, 1, 3. The angle at 1 is between 2 and 3. How many steps between 2 and 3 along the arc not containing 1? Well, the arc from 2 to 3 is 1 step. So k=1. Which gives angle 45 degrees.\n\n    # So the general approach is: pick v2, then v1 and v3 such that they are k+1 steps apart along the arc that does not contain v2. Wait, no. For the case above, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1 step. Then the angle is (1) * 180 / n = 45 degrees.\n\n    # So for a given k, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is k steps. Then the angle is (k) * 180 / n.\n\n    # To construct such a triplet, let's choose v2 as 1. Then, v1 is 2, and v3 is 2 + k. Because the arc between v1 and v3 (which is 2 and 2 + k) that does not contain v2 (1) would be k steps. However, if 2 + k exceeds n, we wrap around.\n\n    # Wait, but if we have n=4, k=1, then v1=2, v3=2+1=3. The arc between 2 and 3 not containing 1 is 1 step. Correct.\n\n    # Another example: n=4, k=2. Then v1=2, v3=2+2=4. The arc between 2 and 4 not containing 1 is 2 steps. The angle is 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct.\n\n    # So the triplet would be v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + k. But we have to make sure that 2 + k <= n. If not, then wrap around. Wait, for example, n=5, k=3. Then 2 + 3 = 5, which is okay. If k=4, then 2 + 4 = 6, which is more than n=5. So we need to adjust.\n\n    # Wait, but k ranges from 1 to n-2. So for k up to n-2, 2 + k would be at most 2 + n-2 = n. So it's safe. For example, if n=5, k=3, 2+3=5, which is okay.\n\n    # Therefore, the triplet can be constructed as v1 = 2, v2 = 1, v3 = 2 + k. This ensures that between v1 and v3, there are exactly k steps along the arc not containing v2.\n\n    # However, what if k is larger than n/2? For example, n=5, k=3. The arc between 2 and 5 (steps 2,3,4,5) not containing 1 would be 3 steps. But the arc that contains 1 would be 2 steps. But since we're taking the arc that does not contain v2 (which is 1), it's the longer arc. However, the formula still holds because the angle is based on the arc that does not contain v2.\n\n    # Thus, the construction works for any k in 1..n-2.\n\n    # So the triplet is 2, 1, 2 + k. However, the problem states that the vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. So for example, for n=4 and k=1, the triplet would be 2, 1, 3. Which matches the sample input's second case.\n\n    # Therefore, the code can generate the triplet as follows:\n\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n\n    # But need to ensure that v3 is within 1..n. Since best_k ranges from 1 to n-2, 2 + best_k ranges from 3 to n.\n\n    # However, there's a possibility that v3 could be greater than n. Wait, no. Because best_k is up to n-2. 2 + (n-2) = n. So yes, v3 is always between 3 and n.\n\n    # So the triplet is v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + best_k.\n\n    # However, the problem allows any valid triplet, so other triplets are also acceptable. For example, in the first sample input, any triplet is acceptable.\n\n    # Therefore, the code can output 2, 1, 2 + best_k. But need to check if this is correct.\n\n    # Let's test with the sample inputs.\n\n    # First sample input: n=3, a=15. The best_k is (15 * 3)/180 = 0.25. So the candidates would be 0 (but not in range), 1. So best_k is 1. Then the triplet is 2, 1, 3. Which is one of the possible outputs. But the sample output is \"1 2 3\". However, the problem allows any valid triplet, so both are correct.\n\n    # However, the code needs to output any valid triplet. So the approach is correct.\n\n    # So the code will output v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + best_k.\n\n    # But what if best_k is 0? Well, since best_k is in 1..n-2, it's not possible.\n\n    # Now, implement this.\n\n    # Edge case: when n=3, best_k is 1. Then v3 is 2+1=3. So the triplet is 2 1 3. Which is valid.\n\n    # So the code can proceed as follows.\n\n    # Now, implement the code.\n\n    # Calculate best_k as discussed.\n\n    # Now, handle the case when n=3. For example, a=15. The best_k is 1, and the triplet is 2 1 3. But the sample output is \"1 2 3\". So the code's output may differ, but it's acceptable.\n\n    # So the code can proceed with the triplet as 2, 1, 2 + best_k.\n\n    # However, there's another possibility. For example, in the first sample, the triplet could be 1, 2, 3. Which is also valid. How to generate such triplets?\n\n    # Alternative approach: pick v2 as 2, v1 as 1, v3 as 3. Which gives the same angle. So for the general case, we can choose v2 as 2, and v1 as 1, v3 as 1 + best_k + 1? Not sure.\n\n    # But the current approach of choosing v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as 2 + best_k is correct and simple.\n\n    # So proceed.\n\n    # Now, code:\n\n    # Compute best_k as explained.\n\n    # Now, code for best_k:\n\n    ideal_k = (a * n) / 180.0\n    candidates = set()\n    for delta in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        candidate = int(ideal_k) + delta\n        if 1 <= candidate <= n-2:\n            candidates.add(candidate)\n    # Also include floor and ceiling\n    candidates.add(int(math.floor(ideal_k)))\n    candidates.add(int(math.ceil(ideal_k)))\n\n    # Now find the best_k among the candidates\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    for k in candidates:\n        if k < 1 or k > n-2:\n            continue\n        angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # prefer smaller k?

Then the angle is 1*180/3 = 60 degrees, which matches the first sample.\n    # For n=4, k can be 1 or 2. For k=1, angle is 45 degrees, for k=2, 90 degrees. Which matches the second and third samples.\n    # So the problem reduces to finding the value of k (from 1 to n-2) such that the angle (k * 180)/n is closest to a. Once we find the best k, we can choose any triplet of vertices that corresponds to this k.\n\n    # So the plan is:\n    # 1. Compute all possible angles for k in 1 to n-2.\n    # 2. Find the k that gives the angle closest to a.\n    # 3. Once we have that k, construct a triplet of vertices that corresponds to this k.\n\n    # However, since n can be up to 1e5, we need an efficient way to find the optimal k without checking all possibilities.\n    # Let's compute the optimal k:\n    # The angle for a given k is angle_k = (k * 180) / n\n    # We want to find k such that |angle_k - a| is minimized.\n    # Solving for k: k = (a * n) / 180\n    # But k must be an integer between 1 and n-2.\n\n    # So compute the ideal k as (a * n) / 180, then check floor and ceiling values.\n\n    # Let's calculate the ideal k:\n    ideal_k = (a * n) / 180\n    # We need to find the integer k in [1, n-2] that is closest to ideal_k.\n\n    # Now, considering that k must be integer, we can try k_floor = floor(ideal_k), k_ceil = ceil(ideal_k)\n    # Also, check if k_floor or k_ceil are within the allowed range.\n\n    # Also, note that for k=1, angle is 180/n, for k=n-2, angle is (n-2)*180/n = 180 - 360/n.\n\n    # So let's compute the best k.\n\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n\n    # We can compute the k candidates around ideal_k\n    candidates = set()\n    for delta in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        candidate = int(ideal_k) + delta\n        if 1 <= candidate <= n-2:\n            candidates.add(candidate)\n    # Also add the floor and ceiling explicitly\n    candidates.add(int(math.floor(ideal_k)))\n    candidates.add(int(math.ceil(ideal_k)))\n\n    # Now check all candidate k's\n    for k in candidates:\n        angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Choose the smaller k? Or any, since the problem allows any valid triplet.\n            # Since the problem says any is acceptable, just keep the first found.\n            pass\n\n    # Now, once best_k is determined, we need to output a triplet of vertices that forms this angle.\n\n    # How to construct the triplet? For example, for best_k, we need to select v2, and then v1 and v3 such that there are best_k steps between them along the arc not containing v2.\n\n    # Let's pick v2 as 1. Then, v1 can be 2, and v3 can be (2 + best_k) mod n? Or need to think about the positions.\n\n    # Let's consider the polygon is numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. For a given best_k, we need to have two points that are best_k steps apart along the arc not containing v2.\n\n    # For example, if best_k is 1, then the angle is 180/n. For n=4, this is 45 degrees. For v2=2, v1=1, v3=3. But that would give the angle at v2 as 90 degrees. Wait, no. Maybe my previous understanding is incorrect.\n\n    # Alternatively, perhaps for a given k, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2 is k+1 steps. Or maybe I need to think differently.\n\n    # Let's take the example from the sample input: n=4, a=67. The best_k is 1, since 1*180/4 = 45 degrees. The sample output is \"2 1 3\", which is vertices 2, 1, 3. The angle at 1 is between 2 and 3. How many steps between 2 and 3 along the arc not containing 1? Well, the arc from 2 to 3 is 1 step. So k=1. Which gives angle 45 degrees.\n\n    # So the general approach is: pick v2, then v1 and v3 such that they are k+1 steps apart along the arc that does not contain v2. Wait, no. For the case above, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1 step. Then the angle is (1) * 180 / n = 45 degrees.\n\n    # So for a given k, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is k steps. Then the angle is (k) * 180 / n.\n\n    # To construct such a triplet, let's choose v2 as 1. Then, v1 is 2, and v3 is 2 + k. Because the arc between v1 and v3 (which is 2 and 2 + k) that does not contain v2 (1) would be k steps. However, if 2 + k exceeds n, we wrap around.\n\n    # Wait, but if we have n=4, k=1, then v1=2, v3=2+1=3. The arc between 2 and 3 not containing 1 is 1 step. Correct.\n\n    # Another example: n=4, k=2. Then v1=2, v3=2+2=4. The arc between 2 and 4 not containing 1 is 2 steps. The angle is 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct.\n\n    # So the triplet would be v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + k. But we have to make sure that 2 + k <= n. If not, then wrap around. Wait, for example, n=5, k=3. Then 2 + 3 = 5, which is okay. If k=4, then 2 + 4 = 6, which is more than n=5. So we need to adjust.\n\n    # Wait, but k ranges from 1 to n-2. So for k up to n-2, 2 + k would be at most 2 + n-2 = n. So it's safe. For example, if n=5, k=3, 2+3=5, which is okay.\n\n    # Therefore, the triplet can be constructed as v1 = 2, v2 = 1, v3 = 2 + k. This ensures that between v1 and v3, there are exactly k steps along the arc not containing v2.\n\n    # However, what if k is larger than n/2? For example, n=5, k=3. The arc between 2 and 5 (steps 2,3,4,5) not containing 1 would be 3 steps. But the arc that contains 1 would be 2 steps. But since we're taking the arc that does not contain v2 (which is 1), it's the longer arc. However, the formula still holds because the angle is based on the arc that does not contain v2.\n\n    # Thus, the construction works for any k in 1..n-2.\n\n    # So the triplet is 2, 1, 2 + k. However, the problem states that the vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order. So for example, for n=4 and k=1, the triplet would be 2, 1, 3. Which matches the sample input's second case.\n\n    # Therefore, the code can generate the triplet as follows:\n\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n\n    # But need to ensure that v3 is within 1..n. Since best_k ranges from 1 to n-2, 2 + best_k ranges from 3 to n.\n\n    # However, there's a possibility that v3 could be greater than n. Wait, no. Because best_k is up to n-2. 2 + (n-2) = n. So yes, v3 is always between 3 and n.\n\n    # So the triplet is v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + best_k.\n\n    # However, the problem allows any valid triplet, so other triplets are also acceptable. For example, in the first sample input, any triplet is acceptable.\n\n    # Therefore, the code can output 2, 1, 2 + best_k. But need to check if this is correct.\n\n    # Let's test with the sample inputs.\n\n    # First sample input: n=3, a=15. The best_k is (15 * 3)/180 = 0.25. So the candidates would be 0 (but not in range), 1. So best_k is 1. Then the triplet is 2, 1, 3. Which is one of the possible outputs. But the sample output is \"1 2 3\". However, the problem allows any valid triplet, so both are correct.\n\n    # However, the code needs to output any valid triplet. So the approach is correct.\n\n    # So the code will output v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 + best_k.\n\n    # But what if best_k is 0? Well, since best_k is in 1..n-2, it's not possible.\n\n    # Now, implement this.\n\n    # Edge case: when n=3, best_k is 1. Then v3 is 2+1=3. So the triplet is 2 1 3. Which is valid.\n\n    # So the code can proceed as follows.\n\n    # Now, implement the code.\n\n    # Calculate best_k as discussed.\n\n    # Now, handle the case when n=3. For example, a=15. The best_k is 1, and the triplet is 2 1 3. But the sample output is \"1 2 3\". So the code's output may differ, but it's acceptable.\n\n    # So the code can proceed with the triplet as 2, 1, 2 + best_k.\n\n    # However, there's another possibility. For example, in the first sample, the triplet could be 1, 2, 3. Which is also valid. How to generate such triplets?\n\n    # Alternative approach: pick v2 as 2, v1 as 1, v3 as 3. Which gives the same angle. So for the general case, we can choose v2 as 2, and v1 as 1, v3 as 1 + best_k + 1? Not sure.\n\n    # But the current approach of choosing v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as 2 + best_k is correct and simple.\n\n    # So proceed.\n\n    # Now, code:\n\n    # Compute best_k as explained.\n\n    # Now, code for best_k:\n\n    ideal_k = (a * n) / 180.0\n    candidates = set()\n    for delta in [-1, 0, 1]:\n        candidate = int(ideal_k) + delta\n        if 1 <= candidate <= n-2:\n            candidates.add(candidate)\n    # Also include floor and ceiling\n    candidates.add(int(math.floor(ideal_k)))\n    candidates.add(int(math.ceil(ideal_k)))\n\n    # Now find the best_k among the candidates\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 1\n    for k in candidates:\n        if k < 1 or k > n-2:\n            continue\n        angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # prefer smaller k? Or any\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n\n    # Now construct the triplet\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n\n    # Output v1, v2, v3\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
