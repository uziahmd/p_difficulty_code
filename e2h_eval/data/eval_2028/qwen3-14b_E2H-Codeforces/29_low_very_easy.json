Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where we have a string of digits and perform multiple substitution queries. Then compute the number modulo 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nThe challenge is handling the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. If I naively process each query by replacing all occurrences of di in the string, that could be O(n * m) where m is the length of the string, which might be too slow for large cases. Because for each query, replacing each occurrence would take O(k) time where k is the length of the string. But with n up to 1e5 and each replacement being O(1e5), that would be 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Let me think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But if we process the substitutions in reverse order, maybe we can track the value of each digit as a function of the substitutions. Wait, but the substitutions are applied in order. So for example, if first we replace 2 with 00, then replace 0 with something else, that would affect the original 2s. So the order matters.\n\nWait, but when processing the queries, each query replaces all instances of di with ti. So the substitutions are applied in sequence. So the first query is done first, then the next, etc. So if we process the queries in order, but track for each digit what it's currently substituted to.\n\nBut here's an idea: instead of modifying the string directly, we can model each digit as a value that represents what it would expand to. For example, initially, each digit d maps to itself. Then, when a query comes in like d -> t, we update the mapping for d to be t. However, when we process a substitution, we need to consider that any existing mappings that depend on d would need to be updated. Wait, no. Because if we have a substitution for d, then any future substitution for another digit that was previously mapped to something involving d would need to be recomputed. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can represent each digit as a value that represents the current expansion. For example, we can have a dictionary (let's say called mappings) where for each digit, we store what it expands to. Initially, mappings[d] = d for all digits. Then, when we process a query \"di -> ti\", we set mappings[di] to ti. However, when expanding, we need to recursively expand any digits in ti according to the current mappings. Wait, but that might not be possible because if ti contains digits that are themselves being replaced later. Oh, but the queries are processed in order. So when a query is processed, it's replacing di with ti, and any future substitutions will affect ti's digits. So if we process the substitutions in order, and for each substitution, we need to make sure that when we replace di with ti, the ti is already in its final form. No, that's not possible. Because ti could contain digits that are later replaced. So for example, if first we replace 2 with 3, then replace 3 with 4. Then the original 2s would be replaced with 3s, then those 3s would be replaced with 4s. So the order of processing is important.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think about building a tree of substitutions. But perhaps we can model each digit's expansion as a function that can be computed at the end. For example, for each digit, we can track what it expands to, considering all previous substitutions. However, when a substitution is made, we need to update the mappings in such a way that any future references to that digit will use the new expansion.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For each digit, we can track the expansion as a string. But when we perform a substitution, say, d → t, then we need to update the mapping for d to t. However, for other digits that may have had their expansion include d, we need to recompute their expansions. But that seems computationally expensive. For example, if a substitution is made for digit 2, then any digit that had a mapping that included 2 would need to be updated. But how do we track that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the expansion using dynamic programming. Let me think. Let's say that for each digit d, we have a value that represents the current expansion. When a substitution is made for d, we update that value. However, when we process a substitution, we need to make sure that any digits that are expanded after this substitution will use the new value. So for example, suppose we have a substitution for d, and then later a substitution for e that depends on d. But how do we track",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we can avoid directly modifying the string for each query by using a dynamic mapping approach. This allows us to track how each digit would expand based on the current set of substitutions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Initialization**: Initialize a dictionary where each digit (0-9) maps to itself initially.\n2. **Processing Queries**: For each query, update the mapping for the specified digit to the new substitution string.\n3. **Recursive Expansion**: When expanding a digit, recursively expand any digits within the substitution string using the current mappings to ensure all substitutions are applied in order.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since we need the result modulo $10^9 + 7$, we compute the value incrementally using modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if line:\n            queries.append(line)\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Initialize the mappings\n    mappings = {str(d): str(d) for d in range(10)}\n    \n    for query in queries:\n        parts = query.split('->')\n        di = parts[0].strip()\n        ti = parts[1].strip() if len(parts) > 1 else ''\n        mappings[di] = ti\n    \n    # Now, build the final string by expanding each character in the original s\n    # But since the string can be very long, we can't build it directly.\n    # Instead, we can compute the value mod MOD by processing each character and using the mappings.\n    \n    # To do this, we need to compute the expansion of each character in s, but since the expansions can be long,\n    # we need to compute their contribution to the number mod MOD.\n    \n    # We'll use a helper function to get the value of a digit's expansion as a string, then compute its numeric value mod MOD.\n    # However, since the expansions can be very long, we need to compute the numeric value mod MOD while expanding.\n    \n    # So, we can precompute for each digit, the value of its expansion as a number mod MOD.\n    # Let's create a memoization table for the value of each digit's expansion.\n    \n    # Memoization cache for the value of each digit's expansion\n    from functools import lru_cache\n    \n    # But since the mappings can change dynamically, we can't use a static cache.
