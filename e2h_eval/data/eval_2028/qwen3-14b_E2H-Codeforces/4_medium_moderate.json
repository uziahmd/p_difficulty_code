The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players over n rounds. Each player has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. For each round, we need to determine who wins and count the number of times each player gets pinched (i.e., loses a round). The challenge is to compute this efficiently given that n can be as large as 2e9, which is way too big for a straightforward simulation.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since directly simulating each of the n rounds is impossible due to time constraints, we need to find a pattern or cycle that can be computed once and then multiplied over the number of repetitions.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the moves are determined. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of his sequence. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of his sequence.\n\nThe key here is that the sequence of moves for both players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So, the pattern of moves between the two players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Therefore, if we can compute the number of wins for each player in one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, we can multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds and then add the results from the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period.\n2. For each round in 0 to period-1, compute the moves of A and B, determine who wins, and count the number of wins for each player in this period.\n3. Then, calculate how many full periods are in n rounds (full_cycles = n // period), and the remaining rounds (remainder = n % period).\n4. Multiply the counts from one period by full_cycles.\n5. Then, simulate the remaining 'remainder' rounds to add their counts.\n\nBut first, how do I compute LCM? Well, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python's math module has gcd, but for Python versions before 3.5, perhaps I need to implement it. However, assuming that the code will run in a Python environment that supports math.gcd (and note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's fine).\n\nWait, but for Python 3.5 and above, math.gcd exists. So, I can compute GCD and then LCM.\n\nNow, for the steps:\n\nFirst, compute m and k. Then compute LCM(m, k) as period.\n\nThen, for each round in 0 to period-1, determine the moves of A and B. For each such round, check who wins, and accumulate the counts for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nBut for each round in the period, we need to compute the moves. For example, for round i (starting from 0?), the move for A is A[i % m], and for B is B[i % k].\n\nOnce we have the counts per period, multiply by full_cycles. Then, for the remaining rounds, simulate them.\n\nBut what if the period is very large? For example, if m and k are both 1000, then LCM(m, k) could be up to 1e6. But 1e6 is manageable because even for 1e6 iterations, it's acceptable for Python to process in a loop. Because for each iteration, it's just checking two characters and incrementing counters.\n\nSo, the maximum possible period is 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1000). So even for 1e6 iterations, it's manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute the number of full periods and the remainder.\n\nNow, for each full period, we can compute the number of times Nikephoros loses (which adds to his red spots) and Polycarpus loses (adds to his red spots).\n\nOnce we have that, multiply by full_cycles. Then simulate the remainder rounds.\n\nSo, the code outline would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B sequences.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute the counts for one period: (nikephoros_losses, polycarpus_losses)\n\nfull_cycles = n // period\n\nremainder = n % period\n\ntotal_nike = full_cycles * nikephoros_losses\n\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * polycarpus_losses\n\nThen, simulate the first 'remainder' rounds, adding to the totals.\n\nBut how to simulate the first remainder rounds?\n\nFor each i in 0 to remainder-1:\n\nget A_move = A[i % m]\n\nget B_move = B[i % k]\n\ndetermine who wins, and increment the counts accordingly.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to computing the counts for the period and for the remainder.\n\nNow, the next part is to compute for each pair of moves, who wins.\n\nSo, the function to determine the outcome between two moves.\n\nLet's think about the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beats paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nIf same, it's a draw.\n\nSo, for a given a and b:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a, b) is (R, S) or (S, P) or (P, R): then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a loss (so Nikephoros's red spot count increases by 1?)\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser, so he gets a red spot. So Nikephoros's red spots count is incremented when he loses, and Polycarpus's count is incremented when he loses.\n\nWait, the output is two numbers: the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nSo, for each round:\n\nif Nikephoros wins: Polycarpus gets a red spot (so his count increases by 1).\n\nif Polycarpus wins: Nikephoros gets a red spot (so his count increases by 1).\n\nif draw: nothing.\n\nSo, for each pair (a, b):\n\nif a beats b: Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nif b beats a: Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nSo, how to code that.\n\nWe can create a helper function that takes a and b, returns (nikephoros_loss, polycarpus_loss) which is (0, 1) if Nikephoros wins, (1, 0) if Polycarpus wins, and (0, 0) otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, for each pair, check which case it is.\n\nAnother approach: create a dictionary or a lookup table for all possible pairs.\n\nFor example, for a and b:\n\nif a == b: (0, 0)\n\nelse:\n\nif (a, b) is in the set of winning combinations for Nikephoros, then (0, 1) else (1, 0).\n\nWhat are the winning combinations for Nikephoros?\n\nNikephoros wins when:\n\na is R and b is S.\n\na is S and b is P.\n\na is P and b is R.\n\nSo, for any (a, b) in { (R,S), (S,P), (P,R) }, Nikephoros wins.\n\nElse, if (a, b) is (S, R), (P, S), (R, P), then Polycarpus wins.\n\nSo, for each pair, we can check if a beats b.\n\nSo, perhaps code:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes.\n\nSo, with that helper function, for each round in the period, we can compute the increments.\n\nSo, now the plan is:\n\nCompute the period.\n\nCompute for each round in 0 to period-1, the moves and accumulate the counts.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nBut first, compute LCM(m, k). Let's code that.\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut note that for Python versions where math.gcd is available. Also, since m and k are positive integers, this is okay.\n\nOnce that is done, for the period.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, A is \"RPS\" (length 3), B is \"RSPP\" (length 4). LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo period is 12. Then, n=7 rounds. So full_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0, remainder is 7. So we need to simulate 7 rounds.\n\nWhich is what the sample does.\n\nSo, the code would process the 7 rounds, and compute the counts.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo, A is length 8, B is length 1. LCM(8, 1) is 8. n=5. So full_cycles is 0, remainder 5. So simulate 5 rounds. All rounds, A is R, B is R. So all draws. Hence 0 and 0.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, considering that for large n, say 2e9, but with m and k being 1000, the period is LCM(1000, 1000) = 1000. So for each period of 1000 rounds, we compute the counts once, multiply by 2e9 / 1000 = 2e6, which is manageable.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A string.\n\nRead B string.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for the period:\n\nInitialize for the period, nike_period = 0, poly_period = 0.\n\nFor i in 0 to period-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\ncompute the result (nike_loss, poly_loss) for this round.\n\nAdd to nike_period and poly_period.\n\nOnce that is done, compute full_cycles = n // period.\n\nremainder = n % period.\n\ntotal_nike = full_cycles * nike_period\n\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * poly_period\n\nThen simulate the remainder rounds:\n\nfor i in 0 to remainder-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\ncompute (nike_loss, poly_loss) and add to total_nike and total_poly.\n\nThen output total_nike and total_poly.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the problem is to code this correctly.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where m or k is 1.\n\nCase where n is smaller than the period, so full_cycles is zero.\n\nCase where n is exactly multiple of period.\n\nAnother edge case: when the period is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1, so LCM is at least 1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut for the period, for i in 0 to period-1, which can be up to 1e6 (if m and k are 1000 each, LCM is 1e6). So for 1e6 iterations, in Python, that's acceptable.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n from input. Then read A and B.\n\nWait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as three lines. For example, in the first example, the input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo in code, we can read n as int(input()), then A as input().strip(), then B as input().strip().\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nThen compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nNow, compute LCM(m, k).\n\nThen compute the period.\n\nNow, for the period, loop from 0 to period-1.\n\nBut for large periods (like 1e6), looping in Python is manageable.\n\nNow, code for the period.\n\nNow, the code for the helper function can be inline.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    period = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\n    # compute counts for one period\n\n    nike_period = 0\n\n    poly_period = 0\n\n    for i in range(period):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        # determine outcome\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot\n\n            poly_period += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n\n            nike_period += 1\n\n    full_cycles = n // period\n\n    remainder = n % period\n\n    total_nike = full_cycles * nike_period\n\n    total_poly = full_cycles * poly_period\n\n    # process remainder rounds\n\n    for i in range(remainder):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            total_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            total_nike += 1\n\n    print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first sample's output is 3 2.\n\nLet me test the code with the first sample.\n\nSample input:\n\nn=7\n\nA=RPS (m=3)\n\nB=RSPP (k=4)\n\nperiod is LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nSo for the period of 12 rounds, compute the counts.\n\nLet me simulate the first 7 rounds (since n=7, remainder is 7).\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros's move is P (second round?), wait let me check the sample.\n\nWait, the sample input says that the first round is R vs R. Let me think:\n\nThe first round is i=0 (assuming 0-based index).\n\nFor i=0:\n\nA[0%3] = A[0] = R.\n\nB[0%4] = B[0] = R → draw.\n\ni=1:\n\nA[1%3] = A[1] = P.\n\nB[1%4] = B[1] = S → P vs S. According to the rules, S beats P. So Polycarpus wins. So Nikephoros gets a spot. So in the code, the code would add 1 to total_nike.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, in the second round (probably i=1?), the sample says P vs S. Nikephoros loses. So that's Nikephoros's loss, so his count increases by 1.\n\nYes. So in the code, the code for that case would add 1 to total_nike.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the first sample's output is 3 and 2. So for the 7 rounds, Nikephoros has 3 losses and Polycarpus 2.\n\nBut according to the code, for the first 7 rounds (since period is 12, full_cycles is 0, remainder is 7), the code would process each of the 7 rounds.\n\nLet me simulate that:\n\nLet me list the rounds for i from 0 to 6 (7 rounds):\n\ni=0:\n\nA: 0%3=0 → R\n\nB: 0%4=0 → R → draw. No change.\n\ni=1:\n\nA: 1%3=1 → P\n\nB: 1%4=1 → S → P vs S. S beats P. So Polycarpus wins. Nikephoros gets a spot (total_nike +=1).\n\ni=2:\n\nA: 2%3=2 → S\n\nB: 2%4=2 → P → S vs P. S beats P. Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot (total_poly +=1).\n\ni=3:\n\nA: 3%3=0 → R\n\nB: 3%4=3 → P → R vs P. P beats R. Polycarpus wins. Nikephoros gets a spot (total_nike +=1).\n\ni=4:\n\nA: 4%3=1 → P\n\nB:4%4=0 → R → P vs R. P beats R. Nikephoros wins. Polycarpus gets a spot (total_poly +=1).\n\ni=5:\n\nA:5%3=2 → S\n\nB:5%4=1 → S → S vs S. Draw.\n\ni=6:\n\nA:6%3=0 → R\n\nB:6%4=2 → P → R vs P. P beats R. Polycarpus wins. Nikephoros gets a spot (total_nike +=1).\n\nSo after these 7 rounds, total_nike is 1 (i=1) + 1 (i=3) + 1 (i=6) = 3. total_poly is 1 (i=2) + 1 (i=4) = 2. Which matches the sample output. So the code would return 3 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nWhich is n=5, A is length 8, B is length 1. LCM(8, 1)=8. So full_cycles is 5//8=0. remainder is 5. For each of the 5 rounds:\n\nEach round, A's move is R (since i%8 is 0,1,2,3,4 for i from 0-4. All R. B's move is R. So all draws. So total_nike and total_poly are 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when the period is large, but n is large?\n\nFor example, if m=1000, k=1000, and n=2e9. Then the code computes the period as LCM(1000, 1000)=1000. Then for the period, it loops 1000 times. Then full_cycles is 2e9 // 1000 = 2e6. Then remainder is 0. So the code would multiply the counts from the period by 2e6. Which is manageable.\n\nNow, code seems correct. Now, code in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, for very large numbers, the code may take some time. But for the constraints given, m and k are up to 1000, so period is up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the modulo operations correctly. For example, in Python, the % operator returns a non-negative result, which is correct here.\n\nAnother thing: the code uses for i in range(period), which for period up to 1e6 is manageable.\n\nAnother possible optimization: precompute the moves for A and B for the period, but not necessary.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, the helper function compute_lcm is inside main. But that's okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor of the absolute values. Since m and k are positive, no problem.\n\nNow, code:\n\nTesting for the sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSample output: 3 2.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput: 0 0.\n\nSo code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, the variables are named correctly. Now, code:\n\nBut in the code, the variables are:\n\nnike_period and poly_period. Then, full_cycles * ... etc.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, the code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    # Wait, but the input is three lines. So maybe read via input() three times.\n    # However, sometimes when using online judges, the input may be read as split by lines. So perhaps better to read via:\n\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n\nBut in Python, if you use input() three times, but the input is given as three lines, that's okay. However, when reading from stdin in some cases, the input may be read as a single string. So perhaps better to read all lines at once.\n\nBut for the purposes of code submission, perhaps the code should read:\n\nBut in code submission, the code should read from standard input. So:\n\nThe code can be written as:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    period = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    nike_period = 0\n    poly_period = 0\n    \n    for i in range(period):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            poly_period += 1\n        else:\n            nike_period += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // period\n    remainder = n % period\n    \n    total_nike = full_cycles * nike_period\n    total_poly = full_cycles * poly_period\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_nike += 1\n    \n    print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first input line is 7, then the second line is RPS, third RSPP. So the code should read them correctly.\n\nBut when using input(), each call reads a line. So yes.\n\nBut what if the input is given with leading or trailing spaces? Probably not, since the problem says that the input is given as per the description.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nAnother test case: when n=1, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then Nikephoros wins. So output is 0 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A is 'S', B is 'R'. Then Polycarpus wins. Output is 1 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then for two rounds, each round is R vs S. Nikephoros wins. So total_poly is 2, total_nike is 0. Output is 0 2.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, considering that for large n, the code is efficient. For example, for n=2e9, and m=1000, k=1000, the code would compute the period as 1000, loop 1000 times once, then multiply by 2e9//1000 = 2e6. Then remainder is 0. So the code is O(1e6) time, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use a more efficient approach based on cycles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Nature**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. The sequence of moves repeats every LCM (Least Common Multiple) of the lengths of their respective sequences. This LCM value determines the period after which the move sequences repeat.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This period will help us determine how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds (n) and how many remaining rounds need to be processed separately.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: For one full period (LCM of the sequence lengths), simulate all rounds to count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Calculate Full Cycles and Remainder**: Multiply the counts from one period by the number of full cycles present in n rounds. Then, simulate the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    period = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    nike_period = 0\n    poly_period = 0\n    \n    for i in range(period):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            poly_period += 1\n        else:\n            nike_period += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // period\n    remainder = n % period\n    \n    total_nike = full_cycles * nike_period\n    total_poly = full_cycles * poly_period\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_nike += 1\n    \n    print(total_nike, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read, including the number of rounds (n) and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences determines the period after which the move sequences repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within the period, we determine the outcome of the game and count the losses for each player.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: The number of full cycles of the period in n rounds is calculated. The results from these full cycles are multiplied by the counts obtained from one period. The remaining rounds (after full cycles) are simulated separately to account for any leftover rounds.\n5. **Output**: The total number of losses (red spots) for both players is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles large values of n by leveraging the cyclic nature of the move sequences, ensuring that we avoid simulating each round individually.",
