            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and we have to find the minimum draws required.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible cases. For the given three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0. Otherwise, find the minimal number of tiles to add to get either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut how do I check for possible mentsu?\n\nLet me break it down into steps.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then figure out what's the minimal number of tiles needed to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor the given three tiles, check all possibilities for forming a triplet or sequence, and calculate the minimal required draws.\n\nBut how to check for possible sequences or triplets?\n\nLet's think about checking for a triplet first. For a triplet, all three tiles must be the same. So, if the three tiles are all same, then it's a triplet. Otherwise, maybe adding one or two tiles to make a triplet.\n\nWait, but the problem says that after drawing tiles, she can have a mentsu. So, for example, if she has two of the same tile, then she needs to draw one more to form a triplet. Or if she has one, then she needs two more.\n\nBut for the current problem, since she starts with three tiles, perhaps the possible ways to form a triplet are:\n\nCase 1: Already a triplet. Then 0 draws.\n\nCase 2: Two tiles same, and one different. Then need to draw one more same tile. So, 1 draw.\n\nCase 3: One tile same, others different. Then need to draw two more same tiles. So 2 draws.\n\nCase 4: All three different. Then need to draw three more same tiles. But wait, but maybe there's a better way via sequences.\n\nBut for the triplet possibility, the minimal draws would be based on how many of the same tiles she has.\n\nBut for the problem, the minimal draws could be achieved either by forming a triplet or a sequence. So we need to check both possibilities and take the minimum.\n\nNow for sequences. A sequence requires three consecutive numbers in the same suit. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. So, the three tiles must be in the same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence.\n\nBut the current three tiles may not form a sequence. So, how can we check if adding some tiles can form a sequence?\n\nLet me think: For example, if the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Then adding 3s would form a sequence. So that's 1 draw.\n\nOr if the three tiles are 1s, 3s, 5s. Then you need to add 2s and 4s (but that's two draws) to form a sequence. Wait, but maybe there's a way to form a sequence with just adding one tile. Like, maybe 1s, 2s, 3s. But if the original tiles are 1s, 3s, 4s. Then adding 2s would form a sequence. So that's one draw.\n\nSo, the idea is: for the given three tiles, check if they can be part of a sequence, and see how many tiles are missing.\n\nBut how to approach this?\n\nFirst, group the tiles by their suit. Because a sequence must be in the same suit.\n\nSo, for the three tiles, if they are all in the same suit, then check if they can form a sequence (either already, or with adding some tiles).\n\nIf they are not all in the same suit, then it's impossible to form a sequence (since sequences require same suit). So, for sequences, we need all three tiles to be in the same suit.\n\nSo, for the current three tiles, if they are not all same suit, then sequences are not possible. So, the only way to form a mentsu is via triplet.\n\nBut perhaps adding tiles can help. For example, if two tiles are same suit, and the third is different. Then maybe adding tiles to form a sequence. But that depends on the situation.\n\nWait, no. Because sequences require three consecutive numbers in same suit. So, if the three tiles are in different suits, then even after adding tiles, you can't form a sequence. Because you need three tiles in same suit. So, for example, if the initial three tiles are in different suits, then any added tiles would have to be in one of those suits",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the given three tiles already form a valid mentsu (triplet or sequence). If they do, the answer is 0.\n2. **Check for Triplet Potential**: If the three tiles do not form a valid mentsu, evaluate how many additional tiles are needed to form a triplet. This involves checking how many of the same tiles are present.\n3. **Check for Sequence Potential**: For sequences, ensure all tiles are of the same suit. If they are, check if they can form a sequence by examining their numerical values and determining how many tiles are needed to complete the sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    tiles = input.split()\n    \n    # Function to check if a list of tiles forms a triplet\n    def is_triplet(tiles_list):\n        return len(set(tiles_list)) == 1\n    \n    # Function to check if a list of tiles forms a sequence\n    def is_sequence(tiles_list):\n        if len(set(t[1] for t in tiles_list)) != 1:\n            return False\n        nums = sorted(int(t[0]) for t in tiles_list)\n        return nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[0] + 2\n    \n    # Check if current tiles already have a mentsu\n    if is_triplet(tiles) or is_sequence(tiles):\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    # If not, calculate the minimum draws required\n    # Count frequency of each tile\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    freq = defaultdict(int)\n    for t in tiles:\n        freq[t] += 1\n    \n    # Check for triplet possibility\n    min_draws_triplet = float('inf')\n    for t in set(tiles):\n        count = freq[t]\n        needed = 3 -
