При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an error. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap has to be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, and the overlapping part must be of positive length but less than the length of s. Also, the full overlap (where the entire message is overlapped) is not considered an error. Similarly, just appending without any overlap isn't considered an error.\n\nSo the task is: given t, check if there exists some s such that t is formed by overlapping two copies of s with some positive overlap (but not full overlap). If possible, output YES and one possible s. Otherwise, NO.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand what the merged string looks like. Suppose s is of length L. When two copies of s are merged with an overlap of k characters (k > 0, k < L), then the resulting string t would be of length L + (L - k) = 2L - k. So the length of t must be equal to 2L - k. Since k can vary between 1 and L-1, the possible lengths of t would be between L+1 (when k is L-1) and 2L-1 (when k is 1).\n\nBut since t is given, we need to find possible L and k such that:\n\nt's length = 2L - k.\n\nBut also, for the overlap to be valid, the last k characters of the first s must be equal to the first k characters of the second s. So, when we merge them, those k characters are overlapping, so the merged string is s concatenated with s[k:] (since the first s's last k chars are overlapping with the second s's first k chars).\n\nSo for example, if s is 'abcde', and k=2, then the merged string would be 'abcde' + 'cde' = 'abcdcde'? Wait no, wait. Wait, the first s is abcde. The second s is abcde. The overlapping is the last k characters of the first s (which is de) and the first k characters of the second s (which is ab?), no. Wait no, the overlap is such that the end of the first message overlaps with the beginning of the second. So for example, if the overlap is k characters, then the first s ends with some substring of length k, and the second s starts with the same substring. So when merged, the combined string is s concatenated with s[k:] (since the first s's last k characters are overlapping with the second's first k, so the total length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k).\n\nTherefore, for the merged string t, it must be that t is equal to s + s[k:], where k is between 1 and L-1.\n\nSo given t, we need to find possible s and k such that:\n\nt = s + s[k:], where len(s) = L, and 1 <= k < L.\n\nBut how can we find s?\n\nLet me think about the possible values of L. Since t is formed by two copies of s overlapping by k, then the length of t is 2L -k. Also, since k can be from 1 to L-1, the length of t can be written as 2L -k, which implies that for each possible L, there's a possible k such that t's length equals that.\n\nAlternatively, rearranging:\n\nt's length = 2L -k → k = 2L - len(t). But since k must be between 1 and L-1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2L - len(t) ≤ L-1.\n\nLet me rearrange these inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality:\n\n2L - len(t) ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ len(t) + 1 → L ≥ (len(t) + 1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality:\n\n2L - len(t) ≤ L-1 → 2L - len(t) ≤ L-1 → L ≤ len(t) -1.\n\nSo combining both, L must satisfy:\n\n(len(t)+1)/2 ≤ L ≤ len(t) -1.\n\nBut since L must be an integer, we can compute possible L values in this range.\n\nMoreover, since L is the length of s, and the original two messages are s and s, the merged string t must be of length 2L -k, where k is between 1 and L-1. But since k = 2L - len(t), substituting into the inequalities for k:\n\nk must be between 1 and L-1. So:\n\n1 ≤ 2L - len(t) ≤ L-1.\n\nWhich gives us the constraints on L as above.\n\nSo for each possible L in the range [(len(t)+1)/2, len(t)-1], we can check if there exists a k (computed as 2L - len(t)) that satisfies 1 ≤k ≤ L-1. Then, for each such L, check if the first L characters of t (the s) and the rest of the string can be formed by overlapping.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think.\n\nIf the merged string is s + s[k:], then the entire t should be equal to s concatenated with s[k:]. So the first L characters of t would be s. Then, the next part would be s[k:].\n\nBut the total length of t is L + (L -k) = 2L -k. Which is correct.\n\nSo for each possible L in the allowed range, we can compute k = 2L - len(t). Then, check if k is between 1 and L-1. If yes, then check if the first L characters of t (call it s_candidate) and the rest of the string (from position L onwards) is equal to s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut also, since the overlapping part is k characters, the last k characters of s_candidate must be equal to the first k characters of s_candidate. Because when you merge the two s's, the overlapping part is the last k of the first s and the first k of the second s. So for that to be possible, the last k characters of s_candidate must be equal to the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\nWait, because the second s is the same as the first. So the overlapping part is the last k of s_candidate (the first s) and the first k of the second s (which is same as the first s's first k). Therefore, the overlapping requires that the last k characters of s_candidate equal the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\nSo, for each candidate L, we can do the following steps:\n\n1. Compute k = 2L - len(t). Check if 1 ≤ k ≤ L-1. If not, skip this L.\n\n2. Take s_candidate as the first L characters of t.\n\n3. Check if the last k characters of s_candidate equal the first k characters of s_candidate. Because that's the condition for the overlap.\n\n4. Also, check that the rest of the string (from position L onwards) equals s_candidate[k:]. Because when you merge, the second s starts after the overlapping part. So the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo the entire t should be equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo for example, if t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (as in the first example), then len(t) is 19. Let's see possible L.\n\nFor example, the correct answer is s = 'abrakadabra' which is length 11. Let's check:\n\nlen(t) = 19.\n\nThen, for L=11, k = 2*11 -19 = 22-19=3. So k=3. Check if 1<=3 <=10 (yes). Then s_candidate is first 11 characters: 'abrakadabra'.\n\nCheck if the last 3 characters of s_candidate (which is 'bra') equals the first 3 of s_candidate (which is 'abr')? No. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, but in the example, the first sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the merged string. Let me check the actual example.\n\nWait in the first example, the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' and the output is 'abrakadabra'. Let's see:\n\nOriginal s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). Then, merging two copies with overlap. For example, in the example, the merged string could be 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is length 19. Let's compute len(t) = 19. Then for L=11, k = 2*11 -19 = 22-19=3. So k=3. Then the merged string would be s + s[3:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'akadabra' → 'abrakadabraakadabra'? Wait, but the actual input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is longer. Wait maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the first sample input. Let me count the letters. Let me think:\n\nOriginal s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). When merged with overlap of 1 character, the merged string would be s + s[1:] → length 11 + 10 = 21. But the sample input is length 19. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait the sample input says that for input 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', the output is 'abrakadabra' which is length 11. Let's compute len(t) for that input. Let me count the letters:\n\n\"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" → Let's see:\n\nabrakadabra (11) + brakadabra (10 letters?), but maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps the input is 19 characters. Let me count:\n\na b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a → that's 21 letters? Or maybe the sample input is different. Well, regardless, perhaps I should proceed with the algorithm.\n\nBut let's get back to the algorithm. So for each possible L, we compute k, check if it's valid, then check the conditions.\n\nSo for each possible L in the range [(len(t)+1)/2, len(t)-1], we can check.\n\nNow, how to find all possible L's?\n\nFor example, len(t) is N.\n\nSo L must satisfy:\n\nceil( (N + 1)/2 ) ≤ L ≤ N - 1.\n\nBecause (len(t)+1)/2 could be fractional. For example, if N is even, say N=4, then (4+1)/2 is 2.5, so L starts at 3. But if N is 5, then (5+1)/2 is 3, so L starts at 3.\n\nSo for each L in that range, we can check.\n\nOnce we find such L and k, then we check if the first L characters (s_candidate) has the last k characters equal to the first k characters of s_candidate, and that the rest of the string (from position L onwards) is equal to s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf all that is true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop through all possible L in the range [ceil((N+1)/2), N-1].\n\nFor each L:\n\nCompute k = 2L - N.\n\nCheck if 1 <=k <= L-1.\n\nIf not, skip.\n\nElse:\n\nTake s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\nCheck if the last k characters of s_candidate == first k characters of s_candidate.\n\nAlso, check that t[L:] == s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf both conditions are true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none of the L's work, then output NO.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nSample Input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (assuming len(t) is 19?)\n\nLet me check. Let's count the letters:\n\n\"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\nLet me split it:\n\nabrakadabra (11) + brakadabra (10 letters?) → total 21? Maybe the actual input is different. Well, regardless, the code will process it correctly.\n\nBut for the first sample, the correct answer is YES and s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). Let's see for N= len(t) = 19? Let's suppose that.\n\nThen for L=11, k= 2*11 -19 = 22-19=3. So k=3. Check if 1<=3 <=10 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 11 letters: 'abrakadabra'.\n\nCheck last 3 letters of s_candidate: 'bra'.\n\nCheck first 3 letters of s_candidate: 'abr'. Are they equal? No. So why is this sample correct?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Maybe the actual overlap is different. Wait, maybe the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 19 letters. Let me check:\n\nOriginal s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). Merging two copies with an overlap of 1 character. Then the merged string would be s + s[1:] → 11 + 10 = 21 letters. But the sample input is 19 letters. So perhaps the overlap is 3 characters. Let me think:\n\nIf the merged string is 2L -k = 19. For L=11, 2*11 -k =19 → k= 22-19=3. So k=3. Then the merged string would be s + s[3:] → length 11 + (11-3) = 19. So that's correct.\n\nNow, the merged string would be s concatenated with s[3:]. Let's see what s[3:] is. s is 'abrakadabra' → s[3:] is 'akadabra'.\n\nSo the merged string would be 'abrakadabra' + 'akadabra' → 'abrakadabraakadabra' → but that's 11 + 8 = 19 letters? Wait, 11 + (11-3) = 11 +8 = 19. Yes.\n\nBut the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which may be different. Let me check the actual sample input. Oh, the first sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the merged string. Let me check the letters:\n\nOriginal s is 'abrakadabra', then the merged string with k=3 would be s + s[3:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'akadabra' → which would be 'abrakadabraakadabra' ?\n\nBut the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which seems to have 'abrakadabra' followed by 'brakadabra' — perhaps the overlap is 1 character. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation here.\n\nWait, maybe the correct L is 12? Let's think again. Let's take the sample input as 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 19 letters.\n\nLet me check for L=12.\n\nThen, k = 2*12 -19 = 24-19=5. So k=5. Check if 1<=5 <=11 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 12 letters of t. Let's see, the first 12 letters of the sample input would be 'abrakadabra' (11 letters) plus the next letter, which is 'b' (assuming the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'). So the first 12 letters would be 'abrakadabra' + 'b' → 'abrakadabrab'.\n\nThen, check if the last 5 characters of s_candidate (which is 'abrab') equals the first 5 characters of s_candidate (which is 'abrab')? Let's see:\n\ns_candidate is 'abrakadabrab' (12 letters). The first 5 letters are 'abrab'. The last 5 letters are 'abrab' (positions 7-11: letters 7 is 'a', 8 'b', 9 'r', 10 'a', 11 'b' — assuming the first 12 letters are 'abrakadabrab').\n\nYes, then the overlap is possible. Then, the rest of the string (from position 12 onwards) should be s_candidate[5:] → 'kadabrabrakadabra'? Wait, the rest of the string is t[12:] which would be 'brakadabra' (assuming the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra').\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let's think about the sample input and the correct answer.\n\nIn the first example, the output is 'abrakadabra' which is length 11. So for that to be valid, the code must find that for L=11, the conditions are met.\n\nBut earlier calculation said that for L=11, k=3, and the last 3 letters of s_candidate (abrakadabra) is 'bra', and the first 3 letters is 'abr' which are not equal. So why is the sample output correct?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Maybe the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters. Let me count:\n\nabrakadabra (11) + brakadabra (10) → total 21 letters. Then len(t)=21.\n\nFor L=11, k = 2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. So k=1. Which is between 1 and 10. So yes.\n\nThen s_candidate is first 11 letters: 'abrakadabra'.\n\nCheck last 1 character of s_candidate is 'a', first 1 character is 'a' → same. Then check that t[L:] is s_candidate[k:] → s_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabra'.\n\nSo the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] → 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra' → 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the sample input. So this works. So in this case, the code would find L=11, k=1. So the code would output YES and s_candidate.\n\nAh, so my earlier mistake was thinking that the len(t) was 19, but in reality, the first sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters. So the code would process it correctly.\n\nSo the code logic is correct.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is 'acacacaca' with output 'acaca'.\n\nLet's see. len(t) is 9.\n\nPossible L values:\n\n(L must be between (9+1)/2 = 5, and 9-1=8. So L can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nCheck for each L:\n\nFor L=5: k=2*5 -9 = 10-9=1. Check 1<=1 <=4 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 letters: 'acaca'.\n\nCheck if last 1 character (a) equals first 1 (a) → yes.\n\nCheck t[5:] is 'caca' (since t is 'acacacaca', positions 5-8 are 'caca').\n\ns_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'caca'.\n\nSo yes, t[5:] is 'caca' which equals 'caca'. So this is valid. So the code would return 'acaca' as s.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: 'abcabc' → output is NO.\n\nlen(t) is 6. Possible L values are (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil(3.5) is 4. So L ranges from 4 to 5.\n\nCheck L=4:\n\nk=2*4 -6 = 8-6=2. Check 1<=2 <=3 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 4 letters: 'abca'.\n\nCheck last 2 letters of s_candidate: 'ca' vs first 2 letters 'ab' → no. So invalid.\n\nCheck L=5:\n\nk=2*5-6=10-6=4. Check 1<=4 <=4 → yes (since L-1=4). So k=4.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 letters: 'abcab'.\n\nCheck last 4 letters of s_candidate: 'bcab' vs first 4 letters 'abca' → no. So invalid.\n\nThus, no possible L. Hence output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: 'abababab' → output 'ababab'.\n\nLet's see. len(t) is 8.\n\nPossible L ranges from (8+1)/2=4.5 → ceil(4.5)=5. So L ranges from 5 to 7.\n\nCheck L=5: k= 2*5 -8 = 2. 1<=2 <=4 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 letters: 'ababa'.\n\nCheck last 2 letters: 'ba' vs first 2 letters 'ab' → no.\n\nCheck L=6: k= 2*6-8=4. Check 1<=4 <=5 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 6 letters: 'ababab'.\n\nCheck last 4 letters of s_candidate: 'abab' (positions 2-5?), wait:\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab' (length 6). Last 4 characters are 'baba'? Wait:\n\nIndices 0-5:\n\n0:a, 1:b, 2:a, 3:b, 4:a, 5:b.\n\nLast 4 characters are positions 2-5: a, b, a, b → 'abab'.\n\nFirst 4 characters are a, b, a, b → 'abab'. So yes, equal.\n\nThen check that t[6:] is s_candidate[4:] → s_candidate[4:] is 'ab'.\n\nt[6:] is the 8th character. Original t is 'abababab' → positions 0-7. t[6:] is 'ab'.\n\nYes, so the merged string would be s_candidate + s_candidate[4:] → 'ababab' + 'ab' → 'abababab' which matches. So this is valid. So the code returns YES and 'ababab'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string t.\n\nThen, compute N = len(t).\n\nIf N is less than 2, then it's impossible. Because two messages must be merged. For example, if N=1, then it's impossible. But according to the problem statement, the input is non-empty. So for N=1, output is NO.\n\nBut for N >= 2, proceed.\n\nThen, iterate L from ceil((N+1)/2) to N-1 inclusive.\n\nBut in Python, how to compute the starting L?\n\nFor example, (N+1)/2 could be a float. So for L_start, we can compute it as (N+1 +1)//2 ?\n\nWait, ceil((N+1)/2) can be calculated as (N+1 +1)//2 ?\n\nLet me think for N even and odd.\n\nFor example, N=5: (5+1)/2 = 3 → ceil(3) is 3. (5+1+1)//2 = 7//2=3.5 → no, but integer division would be 3.\n\nWait, in Python, (N + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait for N=5: (5+1)/2 = 3.0 → integer division is 3.\n\nFor N=4: (4+1)/2 = 2.5 → ceil is 3. (4+1 +1)//2 is (6)//2=3. So yes.\n\nSo the starting L is (N + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait for N=5, (N + 1) // 2 is (6)//2 = 3 → correct.\n\nFor N=4, (4+1)//2 = 5//2=2. But the required starting L is ceil( (4+1)/2 ) = ceil(2.5) = 3. So that approach would not work. Wait, this suggests that the initial calculation for L_start is incorrect.\n\nWait, original condition for L is (N+1)/2 ≤ L ≤ N-1.\n\nBut (N+1)/2 can be fractional. So for example, N=4, (N+1)/2 is 2.5. So L must be ≥ 2.5, meaning L starts at 3.\n\nBut (N + 1) // 2 for N=4 is (5)//2 = 2. So that's wrong. So perhaps the correct way is to compute L_start as math.ceil( (N + 1)/2 )\n\nIn Python, we can compute that with math.ceil((N+1)/2). But since N is an integer, perhaps we can compute it as (N + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nLet me think:\n\nFor N even:\n\nN = 4 → (N+1)/2 = 2.5 → ceil is 3. (N + 1 + 1) // 2 → (4+1+1)/2 = 6/2=3 → correct.\n\nFor N=5 → (5+1)/2=3.0 → ceil is 3. (5+1+1)/2=7/2=3.5 → integer division would be 3.5 → but in Python, using integer division with // would give 3. So perhaps the formula is (N + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, for N=5, the correct L_start is 3. (N+1)/2 is 3.0, so ceil is 3. So (N+1 + 1) // 2 is (5+1+1)/2=7/2=3.5 → integer division would be 3.5 → but in Python, 7//2 is 3.\n\nWait, but (N+1) is 6. So (N+1 + 1) is 7. So (N+1 +1) // 2 = 7//2 = 3. Which is correct for N=5.\n\nBut for N=4, (N+1) is 5, adding 1 gives 6, divided by 2 is 3. Correct.\n\nSo the formula for L_start is (N + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula for ceil(a/b) can be written as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nIn this case, a is N+1, and b is 2. So ceil( (N+1)/2 ) is equal to (N+1 + 2 -1) // 2 → (N+2) // 2.\n\nYes. So for example:\n\nN=4: (4+2) // 2 = 6//2=3 → correct.\n\nN=5: (5+2)//2 =7//2=3 → correct.\n\nSo the correct L_start is (N + 2) // 2.\n\nSo the code can loop L in range from L_start to N-1 inclusive.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport math\n\nt = input().strip()\n\nN = len(t)\n\nif N < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    for L in range( (N + 2) // 2, N ):\n        # L is in the possible range\n        k = 2 * L - N\n        if k < 1 or k >= L:\n            continue\n        # Now check if the first L characters can form s_candidate\n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n        # Check if the last k characters of s_candidate equals first k\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n            # Check if the rest of the string matches s_candidate[k:]\n            if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s_candidate)\n                found = True\n                break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but for L in range( (N + 2) // 2, N ), but in Python, range is exclusive of the upper bound. So for example, if N is 5, then N-1 is 4. So the range would be from (5+2)//2 = 3.5 floored? Wait, (N + 2) // 2 for N=5 is (5+2)//2 = 7//2=3. So the range would be from 3 to N (which is 5), but since the upper bound in range is exclusive, we need to have range( (N+2)//2, N ). Because N-1 is the upper limit. For example, for N=5, the upper limit is N-1=4. So the code should loop L in range( (N+2)//2, N ), which for N=5 is range(3,5) → 3,4.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input 'acacacaca' (len 9). For L=5:\n\nk=2*5-9=1. Check 1<=1 <5 → yes. s_candidate is first 5 letters 'acaca'. Check last 1 character is 'a' and first 1 is 'a' → yes. Then check t[5:] is 'caca', which is equal to s_candidate[1:] → 'caca' → yes. So code returns YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'tatbt' → output is NO.\n\nlen(t) is 5. So N=5.\n\nL_start is (5+2)//2 = 3.5 → 3.5 floored? Wait, (5+2) is 7, divided by 2 is 3.5 → in Python integer division 7//2 is 3. So range(3,5) → L=3,4.\n\nCheck for L=3:\n\nk= 2*3 -5 = 1. 1<=1 <=2 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 3 letters: 'tat'.\n\nCheck last 1 character is 't' and first 1 is 't' → yes.\n\nCheck t[3:] is 'bt' → s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] → 'at'.\n\nSo 'bt' vs 'at' → no. So invalid.\n\nNext L=4:\n\nk=2*4 -5= 8-5=3. Check 1<=3 <=3 (since L=4, L-1=3). So yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 4 letters: 'tatb'.\n\nCheck last 3 characters: 'atb' vs first 3: 'tat' → no. So invalid.\n\nThus, no solution → output NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase when N=2. For example, input 'aa'.\n\nN=2. L_start is (2+2)//2 = 2. So range(2,2) → no iteration. So code outputs NO. Because the possible L is 2, but N-1 is 1. So the loop doesn't run. So output is NO. Which is correct because the error is not considered if the two messages are fully overlapped. For example, 'aa' could be formed by two 'a's with full overlap (k=1, but since k must be less than L (L=1?), but L is 1. So for N=2, the possible L would be in the range [(2+2)//2=2, N-1=1]. Which is invalid, so no loop. So output is NO. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: N=3. Let's say input is 'aba'.\n\nPossible L is (3+2)//2 = 5//2=2. So L ranges from 2 to 2 (since N-1=2). So L=2.\n\nk=2*2 -3=1. Which is between 1 and 1 (since L-1=1). So yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 2 letters: 'ab'.\n\nCheck last 1 character 'b' vs first 1 'a' → no. So invalid. Thus output NO.\n\nAnother case: input is 'aaa' (N=3). L=2. k=1. s_candidate is 'aa'. Last 1 char is 'a', first 1 is 'a' → yes. Check t[2:] is 'a' which equals s_candidate[1:] → 'a'. So yes. Thus output YES and 'aa'.\n\nSo for input 'aaa', the code would output YES and 'aa'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the error is when two messages are merged with overlap. So the original two messages are 'aa' and 'aa'. Merged with overlap of 1 character. The merged string would be 'aa' + 'a' → 'aaa'. Which is correct. So the code would output YES.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother edge case: input is 'aaaaa' (N=5). Let's see.\n\nPossible L is (5+2)//2=3.5 → 3. So L ranges from 3 to 4.\n\nFor L=3:\n\nk= 2*3 -5 = 1. Check 1<=1 <=2 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 3 letters: 'aaa'.\n\nCheck last 1 char 'a' equals first 1 → yes.\n\nCheck t[3:] is 'aa' → s_candidate[1:] is 'aa' → yes. So output YES and 'aaa'.\n\nSo code returns YES.\n\nAnother possible L=4:\n\nk= 2*4 -5 = 3. Check 1<=3 <=3 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is first 4 letters: 'aaaa'.\n\nCheck last 3 letters 'aaa' vs first 3 'aaa' → yes.\n\nCheck t[4:] is 'a' → s_candidate[3:] is 'a' → yes. So code would return YES and 'aaaa' as well. So multiple possible answers, but code returns the first one found.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that for the case when N is 1, the code returns NO.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t from input. Then:\n\nimport sys\n\nt = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nN = len(t)\n\nif N < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    # Calculate L_start\n    L_start = (N + 2) // 2\n    for L in range(L_start, N):\n        k = 2 * L - N\n        if k < 1 or k >= L:\n            continue\n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n        # Check overlap condition\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n            # Check the rest of the string\n            if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s_candidate)\n                found = True\n                break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, for strings, s_candidate[-k:] when k is 0? But in our code, k is at least 1, so no problem.\n\nTesting this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → len is 21. L_start is (21 + 2)//2 = 23//2=11. So L ranges from 11 to 20 (but N is 21, so range is up to N-1=20). For L=11, k= 2*11 -21= 22-21=1. Check if 1<=1 <11 → yes. s_candidate is first 11 letters. Check if last 1 char is same as first 1. Then check t[L:] equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nWhich is correct. So code returns YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'acacacaca' → len 9. L_start is (9+2)//2 = 11//2=5. So L ranges from 5 to 8. For L=5, k=1. Which is valid. So code returns YES.\n\nSample Input 3: 'abcabc' → len 6. L_start is (6+2)//2 = 4. So L runs from 4 to 5.\n\nFor L=4, k= 8-6=2. Check if 2 <4 → yes. s_candidate is 'abca'. Check last 2 letters 'ca' vs first 2 'ab' → no. For L=5, k= 10-6=4. Check 4 <5 → yes. s_candidate is 'abcab'. last 4 letters: 'bcab' vs first 4 'abca' → no. So code returns NO.\n\nSample Input ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an error. The error occurs when two identical messages are merged such that they overlap partially (not fully or not at all). If such a scenario is possible, we need to identify one possible original message `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Overlap**: When two identical messages `s` are merged with an overlap of `k` characters (where `1 ≤ k < len(s)`), the resulting string `t` will have a length of `2 * len(s) - k`.\n2. **Range for Possible Lengths**: For a given string `t` of length `N`, the length of the original message `s` (denoted as `L`) must be in the range `(N + 1) / 2 ≤ L ≤ N - 1`. This is derived from the requirement that the merged string length `N` must satisfy `N = 2L - k` where `1 ≤ k < L`.\n3. **Check Validity**: For each possible length `L` within the calculated range, compute the overlap `k` and check if the first `L` characters of `t` can form a valid message `s` such that the overlap condition is satisfied.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    t = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    N = len(t)\n    if N < 2:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    found = False\n    L_start = (N + 2) // 2\n    for L in range(L_start, N):\n        k = 2 * L - N\n        if k < 1 or k >= L:\n            continue\n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n            if t[L:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s_candidate)\n                found = True\n                break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read from standard input.\n2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the length of `t` is less than 2, it's immediately determined that no valid message `s` can exist, so \"NO\" is printed.\n3. **Loop Through Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `L` of the original message `s`, calculate the overlap `k` and check if it falls within valid bounds.\n4. **Overlap Check**: For each candidate length `L`, check if the last `k` characters of the first `L` characters of `t` match the first `k` characters. This ensures that the overlap condition is satisfied.\n5. **Validation of Merged String**: Ensure that the remaining part of `t` after the first `L` characters matches the part of `s` starting from the `k`-th character, confirming the merged string structure.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid lengths and overlaps to determine if the given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages with a partial overlap.",
