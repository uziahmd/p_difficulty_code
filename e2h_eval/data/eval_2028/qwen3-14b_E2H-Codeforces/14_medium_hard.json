    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the trailing zero count is exactly m. However, there's a catch here. For example, when m is 5, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9) which all have exactly 5 trailing zeros. Wait, but why? Because when you calculate the trailing zeros for 5, it's 1 (from 5/5). Then 25 adds another 5, but for numbers between 25 and 30, the count increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, for n=5: floor(5/5) =1 → 1 zero. For n=25, floor(25/5)=5, floor(25/25)=1, total 6 zeros. So for numbers between 25 and 29, their trailing zeros would be 6. So when m is 6, there are multiple numbers.\n\nBut the key point is that for certain values of m, there might be zero n's. For example, if m is 5, then there's no n such that the trailing zeros are exactly 5. Wait, but according to the sample input, when m is 1, the output is 5 numbers. Wait the first example says input is 1, output is 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Let me check:\n\nWait for 5! = 120 → 1 zero. 6! is 720 → 1 zero. 7! is 5040 → 1. 8! is 40320 → 1. 9! is 362880 → 1. So all these numbers have exactly 1 trailing zero. So why does m=1 have 5 numbers?\n\nAh, right. So the problem is that when you have m as a certain value, there might be several consecutive n's that have the same count of trailing zeros. So the question is, for a given m, how many n's have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nThe approach I need to take is:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the trailing zero count is m. Then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count.\n\nBut how do I find that?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, no. Wait in the sample case, m=1, there are 5 numbers. But how?\n\nLet me think again. The number of trailing zeros increases as n increases. For example, when n increases from 5 to 6, the count remains same. But when n reaches 25, the count jumps by 2 (because 25 contributes two 5s). So for some m, there may be multiple n's. But for others, maybe none.\n\nSo the steps to solve this problem could be:\n\n- First, find the minimum n such that the number of trailing zeros is equal to m. Then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count.\n\nBut how to find that n?\n\nAlternatively, we can use binary search to find the possible n's. But since the count of trailing zeros is non-decreasing with n, for each m, there might be a range of n's that produce exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how do I find if such n exists?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFirst, for a given m, find the smallest n such that the number of trailing zeros in n! is >= m. Then check if that number is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the range of numbers where the count is exactly m.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think. Let's say I want to find all n such that count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nLet me first find the lower bound and upper bound of n for which count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the function count_zeros(n) as a non-decreasing function. For example, for n increasing, the count_zeros(n) can stay same or increase. So, for a given m, there can be a range of n's where count_zeros(n) = m. However, when the count_zeros(n) jumps by more than 1, then there are some m's that are skipped. For example, when n crosses 25, count_zeros increases by 2. So between 24 and 25, count_zeros(24) is 4 (since 24/5=4, 24/25=0 → 4). count_zeros(25) is 6. So m=5 is skipped. Therefore, for m=5, there are no n's.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor a given m, first check if there exists any n such that count_zeros(n) = m. If not, output 0. Otherwise, find all such n's.\n\nSo how to check if there exists such n?\n\nLet me think: The count_zeros(n) can be calculated for any n. Let's find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given m, the possible n's must lie in a certain interval. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nFind the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call it low. Then find the maximal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call it high. Then the numbers from low to high are the answers.\n\nBut how to find low and high?\n\nAlternatively, since the count_zeros(n) is non-decreasing, once we find the first n where count_zeros(n) = m, then the next numbers will have the same count until the count increases. So the maximum n where count_zeros(n) = m is the first n where count_zeros(n) = m+1 minus 1.\n\nBut how to find the first occurrence of m?\n\nBut perhaps the way to approach this is:\n\nUse binary search to find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Then check if that exists. Then find the largest n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) are the answers.\n\nBut how to find the first occurrence of m?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if count_zeros(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. Then find the maximal n where count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n for which count_zeros(n) = m is the first occurrence. Let's think of using binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m, and then check if count_zeros(n) is m. If not, then there is no solution. Otherwise, the minimal n is found.\n\nBut then, the maximal n where count_zeros(n) = m is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m+1 minus 1. So for example, if the first occurrence of m is at n_low, then the first occurrence of m+1 is at n_high. Then the numbers from n_low to n_high -1 have count_zeros equal to m. Thus, the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me take the sample input. For m=1, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1 is 5. Then count_zeros(5) is 1. So the first occurrence is 5. Then the first occurrence of m+1=2 is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (since 10-1=9) are the ones with count_zeros=1. That's 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9), which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's see. What is the count_zeros(24)? Let's compute it:\n\ncount_zeros(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25) is 25//5 + 25//25 =5+1=6. So there's no n where count_zeros(n)=5. Hence, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor a given m, find the first n where count_zeros(n) = m. Then find the first n where count_zeros(n) = m+1. The numbers between the first n and (first n of m+1 -1) are the valid numbers. The count is (first_n_m_plus_1 - first_n_m).\n\nBut how to find the first n where count_zeros(n) = m?\n\nWait, perhaps the way to find the first occurrence of m is to find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) = m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, let's find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this n_low. Then check if count_zeros(n_low) is equal to m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, the minimal n is n_low. Then find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call this n_high. Then the numbers from n_low to n_high -1 are all the numbers with exactly m trailing zeros. So the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to find n_low and n_high?\n\nThis seems manageable. So the steps would be:\n\n1. For a given m, compute the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call it n_low. Then check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n2. Compute the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Call it n_high. Then the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are all the n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. The count is (n_high - n_low).\n\nBut how to compute the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m?\n\nThat can be done with binary search. Because count_zeros(n) is non-decreasing.\n\nSo, the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nSimilarly for m+1.\n\nSo, for example, for m=1:\n\nbinary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1. Which is 5. Then check count_zeros(5) is 1. Then find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 2. Which is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (10-1=9) are the answers. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nImplement a function count_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nImplement a function find_min_n(target) that returns the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= target. This can be done with binary search.\n\nOnce we have that, for the given m:\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m: then there are zero solutions.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthe numbers are from n_low to n_high-1, inclusive.\n\nThe count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut wait, what if m is such that there are multiple numbers? Like for m=5, but there's no n with count_zeros(n) =5. So in that case, the code would return zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck if there exists any n with count_zeros(n) =m. How?\n\nOnce we find n_low as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m. Then if count_zeros(n_low) is not equal to m, then there are no solutions.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to find the n_high as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are the solutions.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this logic correctly.\n\nBut how to implement find_min_n(target)?\n\nThe binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nWhat's the possible range for n? Well, for a target m, the minimal n can be 0 (but since we need positive integers, maybe starting from 1?), but for the binary search, we need to find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nBut for the upper bound, for a given target, the maximum n needed is 5*m. Because for example, each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero. So for m, the maximum possible n is 5*m. Wait, but maybe that's not correct. Let me think.\n\nFor example, m=1, 5*1=5, which is correct. For m=5, the minimal n is 25, but 5*5=25. So that works. But for m=6, the minimal n is 25 (count_zeros(25) is 6). So 5*m is 30. So the upper bound can be 5*m. But perhaps even higher. Wait, but for larger m, the upper bound can be set as 5*m. Because for any m, the count_zeros(5*m) is at least m. Because for 5*m, the count_zeros(5*m) is (5m)/5 + (5m)/25 + ... which is m + m/5 + m/25 + ... which is more than m. So the upper bound can be 5*m. But perhaps for some cases, even 5*m is not enough. Wait, for example, if m=1, 5*1=5. Which is correct. For m=2, 5*2=10. count_zeros(10) is 2 (10/5 + 10/25= 2 + 0 = 2). So that works. So for the upper bound, 5*m is sufficient.\n\nBut perhaps for some m, the minimal n is less than 5*m. So during binary search, the upper bound can be set as 5*m. However, perhaps for some cases, even higher. Wait, but if m is 100000, 5*m is 500000, which is manageable for binary search.\n\nSo the binary search for find_min_n(target) can be done between low=0 and high=5*target.\n\nBut wait, for example, target=0. But in our problem, m starts from 1. So maybe we don't need to handle that.\n\nSo the binary search for find_min_n(target):\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = 5*target.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n      high = mid\n\n   else:\n\n      low = mid + 1\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nBut wait, what if the target is larger than the maximum possible count_zeros(n) for any n? Well, in our problem, since m is given as up to 1e5, but for the code, the binary search would proceed with high=5*m. But for example, if m is very large, but the code would still work.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nfind_min_n(1) would return 5. count_zeros(5) is 1, which is equal to m. Then find_min_n(2) returns 10. So the numbers are 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSample input 2: m=5.\n\nfind_min_n(5) would be looking for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is greater than 5. So in this case, the code would check if count_zeros(25) is equal to 5. It's not. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the code would return 0 for m=5.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. find_min_n(6) would return 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) would be 25? Or 25's count is 6, so need to find the first n with count >=7. Let's compute count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25+1=26? No. Let's compute count_zeros(29): 29//5=5, 29//25=1, total 6. count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 → 7. So the minimal n for target=7 is 25? No. Wait, the binary search for target=7 would look for the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=7. So the first n where that is true is 25? No. Because count_zeros(25) is 6. So the binary search would proceed to find 30. So for target=7, find_min_n returns 25? No. Wait, the binary search would have high=5*7=35. Let's simulate:\n\nlow=0, high=35.\n\nmid=(0+35)/2=17. count_zeros(17) is 3. less than 7. So low=18.\n\nmid=(18+35)/2=26.5 → 26. count_zeros(26) is 26//5=5 + 26//25=1 → 6 <7. So low=27.\n\nmid=(27+35)/2=31. count_zeros(31) is 31//5=6 + 31//25=1 → 7. So high=31. Now, low=27, high=31. mid is 29. count_zeros(29) is 5+1=6 <7. So low=30. mid=30+31//2=30.5 → 30. count_zeros(30) is 6+1=7. So high=30. Now low=30, high=30. Exit loop. So returns 30. So for target=7, find_min_n returns 30. So for m=6, the code would have n_low=25 (count_zeros(25)=6), n_high=30. So the numbers from 25 to 29 (30-1=29). So 5 numbers (25,26,27,28,29). So the answer would be 5 numbers.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen:\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m → output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthe numbers are from n_low to n_high -1.\n\nthe count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n >=5:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nImplement find_min_n(target):\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nBut for some target, like when target is 0, but in our problem m is at least 1.\n\nOnce we have this, the code can proceed.\n\nSo for the input m:\n\nWe first check if there exists any n with count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nSo:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nn_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthe numbers are from n_low to n_high -1.\n\nThe count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut what if m is very large, like 1e5?\n\nBut for Python, the binary search is efficient enough. Let's see:\n\nFor m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. The binary search would take log2(5e5) steps, which is around 20 steps. Each step involves count_zeros(n), which for 5e5 is O(log n) steps. So overall, the time is acceptable.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut what about edge cases?\n\nFor example, m=0. But according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: m=1, which returns 5 numbers.\n\nAnother case: m=6, which returns 5 numbers (25-29).\n\nAnother case: m=2. Let's see.\n\nfind_min_n(2) → minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=2. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. So n_low=10. count_zeros(10) is 2. Then find_min_n(3) is 15 (count_zeros(15) is 3). So numbers from 10 to 14. Which are 5 numbers (10,11,12,13,14). So output 5 numbers.\n\nAnother case: m=3. Let's see:\n\nn_low is 15 (count_zeros(15)=3). Then find_min_n(4) is 20. So numbers from 15-19. 5 numbers.\n\nBut wait, count_zeros(19) is 19//5=3 + 19//25=0 → 3. So yes.\n\nAnother case: m=5. As discussed, returns 0.\n\nAnother case: m=6, returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input. But the input is given as a list, perhaps? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single integer m. However, the example shows that the input is given as ['1', '5'] and the output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'] — but this seems to be for multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: the only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).\n\nBut the sample input shows something different. Wait, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. But looking back at the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. However, the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first input is m=1, and the second is m=5, and outputs are given accordingly.\n\nBut the original problem says:\n\nInput: the only line of input contains an integer m.\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m from stdin.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of strings, perhaps for multiple test cases. However, perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects a single test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. The output is first k, then the numbers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is '1' and the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', and for input '5' the output is '0'.\n\nSo perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first input is m=1, and the second input is m=5. But the code should read a single m from input.\n\nBut the original problem's sample input and output is presented as:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the code should read a single m per run.\n\nBut the user instruction says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps there's confusion here.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\nInput\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem statement's sample, or perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is incorrect, or perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input.\n\nBut given the note in the problem statement that says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. For example, in the first sample input, perhaps the input is two lines, each being a test case. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first test case is m=1 and the second is m=5, but the code is supposed to handle a single m per run.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is from a programming competition where multiple test cases are given. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. Therefore, I think that the sample input may have been written in a way that the first input is m=1, and the second input is m=5, and the code should process each input line as a separate test case. But the problem says that the input is a single integer. So perhaps the sample input is not accurate. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which is probably a list of test cases, and the output is given as two lines. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps this is a mistake in the problem statement. However, the user's instruction says that the code should read input from stdin. For example, in the sample input, the code would read the first line as '1', and output the first line, then read the second line as '5' and output the second line. So the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the code should process a single m. However, the user instruction says that the code should read input from stdin, and the sample shows that the input is a list of strings. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input, each being a separate m.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, given the sample input and output, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should read multiple test cases. For example, if the input is two lines, each containing a value of m. For example, the first line is 1, and the second line is 5. The output is two lines: the first line is 5 followed by the numbers, the second line is 0.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is incorrect. However, the user's instruction says that the code should read input from stdin and print the outputs. Given that, perhaps the code should read multiple lines of input. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is a mistake, and the code should read a single m. In that case, the sample input for m=1 would output 5 followed by the numbers, and for m=5, output 0.\n\nBut the problem's sample input shows that for input '1', the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', and for input '5', the output is '0'.\n\nSo perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. But the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. This is conflicting.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that the code should read input from stdin. So perhaps the code should read one line of input. For example, the first sample input is 1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. So the code should read a single line, process it, and output the result.\n\nBut then why does the sample input show ['1', '5'] as input? Maybe that's a mistake in the problem statement's formatting. Perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases, and the code should process each line as a separate m. But the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, given the problem's original statement, the code should read a single integer m. So the sample input may be a mistake, but the code should process a single m. So I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nThus, the code will read m from input, process it, and output the required numbers.\n\nNow, coding:\n\nRead m from stdin. For example, m = int(input().strip())\n\nThen, compute n_low = find_min_n(m). Check if count_zeros(n_low) is m. If not, output 0. Else compute n_high = find_min_n(m+1). Then the numbers are from n_low to n_high -1. The count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to handle cases where n_high is not found? For example, when m is very large. But since find_min_n is designed to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target, and since for any target, there exists such n (as count_zeros(n) approaches infinity as n increases), so it's safe.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the functions count_zeros and find_min_n.\n\nBut in Python, for large m, 5*m could be very big. For example, m=1e5, 5*1e5=5e5. Which is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >=5:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nThen, the main code:\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = n_high - n_low\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nWait, but the output requires that the numbers be printed in increasing order. The range(n_low, n_high) would generate numbers from n_low to n_high-1, inclusive. So that's correct.\n\nBut for example, when n_low=5 and n_high=10, range(5,10) is [5,6,7,8,9], which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, range(n_low, n_high) gives numbers from n_low to n_high-1.\n\nSo the code would generate the correct numbers.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So the code would print 5 followed by the numbers. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when k=0? Well, in that case, the code would print 0, and nothing else. But the code checks if count_zeros(n_low) != m, then prints 0. So that's handled.\n\nTesting the code for m=5:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(5). Let's compute:\n\nfind_min_n(5) would search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute for n=24: count_zeros(24) = 4 + 0 =4. n=25: count_zeros(25) is 6. So during binary search, the code would find low=25. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5 → output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. n_low is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then n_high is find_min_n(7) → which is 30. So the numbers are 25 to 29. So the output is 5 numbers.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when m=0? Well, the problem says m ≥1, so no need.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, the code would process it, but the problem says m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code for the output prints the numbers as space-separated. However, when k is zero, the code prints 0 and nothing else. But in the sample input for m=5, the output is '0'.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code for the output when k is non-zero:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint(' '.join(...))\n\nBut for example, when k is 5, the first line is 5, then the next line is the numbers. However, the sample output shows that for the first case, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. Which is two lines. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in Python, the print() function adds a newline. So the code would print the first line as k, then the second line as the numbers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\", which is two lines. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what if the numbers are empty? Well, when k=0, the code prints 0 and no other line.\n\nBut the problem says that the output should first print k, then print the numbers. So for k=0, the code prints 0, and no other line.\n\nBut in the sample input, for m=5, the output is '0'.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, when the code prints the numbers, it uses ' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))). However, when n_high -n_low is zero, but that case is already handled by the previous check.\n\nBut in the case where k is non-zero, the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for m=1, the code would generate range(5,10) → [5,6,7,8,9], which is correct.\n\nNow, the code is ready.\n\nBut let's think about possible errors.\n\nWhat if the find_min_n returns a value where count_zeros(n) is larger than m, but there are no numbers with exactly m zeros?\n\nLike for m=5, as discussed.\n\nBut the code checks if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible error is when the find_min_n returns a value that is not the first occurrence of m. But the binary search is designed to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target. So if the count_zeros(n_low) is exactly m, then it's the first occurrence.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, write the code in Python.\n\nBut the code should read from stdin. So:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nHandle the case where m is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nBut the code should handle m=0 as well, but according to the problem statement, it's not necessary.\n\nNow, the code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >=5:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in a factorial are formed and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n   \n2. **Counting Trailing Zeros**: For a given $ n $, the number of trailing zeros can be calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: To find the smallest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros is at least $ m $, we use binary search. This helps us efficiently narrow down the range of possible values for $ n $.\n\n4. **Determine Valid Range**: Once we find the smallest $ n $ (let's call it `n_low`) where the trailing zeros count is exactly $ m $, we then find the smallest $ n $ (let's call it `n_high`) where the count is $ m+1 $. The valid values of $ n $ lie between `n_low` and `n_high - 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input)\n    \n    n_low = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        k = n_high - n_low\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single integer $ m $ from standard input.\n2. **Finding Minimum $ n $**: Using binary search, we find the smallest $ n $ such that the trailing zeros count is at least $ m $.\n3. **Validation Check**: We check if this $ n $ actually results in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If not, we output 0.\n4. **Finding Upper Bound**: We then find the smallest $ n $ such that the trailing zeros count is $ m+1 $, which helps determine the upper bound of our valid range.\n5. **Output**: The valid range of $ n $ values is printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of $ n $ using binary search, ensuring the solution is optimal even for large values of $ m $.",
