He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Because 5! has one zero, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors but the count remains the same until 10! which adds another 5 (from 10).\n\nWait, but how do I find the possible n's for a given m?\n\nThe key idea here is that the number of trailing zeros increases as n increases, but sometimes multiple n's can give the same count. However, there's a catch. For example, when you have a number like 25, which contributes two 5s. So when you go from 24 to 25, the count of zeros jumps by two. So for some m values, there might be no n's that produce exactly that m. For instance, if m is 5, maybe there's no n such that the count is exactly 5. Wait, let me check. Let's compute the trailing zeros for numbers around 25.\n\nFor n=24: 24/5 = 4, 24/25=0. Total 4 zeros. For 25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Hence, for m=5, the answer would be zero.\n\nSo the problem requires checking for m whether there exists n's that produce exactly m zeros, and if so, list them all.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Find the possible n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nBut how to find them?\n\nAn approach could be:\n\n- For a given m, find the smallest n such that the count of trailing zeros is >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find all n's that have exactly m zeros.\n\nWait, but how to find the range of n's that produce exactly m zeros?\n\nAnother idea: The count of trailing zeros is a non-decreasing function as n increases. So for each m, there's a range of n's that produce exactly m zeros. However, sometimes there's no such n. For example, when m is between the count of some n and the next.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- Find the minimum n such that the count of zeros is m. Then check if there's a range of numbers that have the same count.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the lower and upper bounds of n that would produce exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nWe can perform a binary search to find the smallest n where f(n) = m. But wait, maybe not. Because for some m, there's no n that gives exactly m. So first, we need to check whether m is achievable.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about for a given m, find the smallest n such that f(n) = m, and the largest n such that f(n) = m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) would be the valid n's. But how to find these?\n\nBut how do we know if there are any n's with exactly m zeros?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call it low. Then check if f(low) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call it high. Then the numbers from low to high-1 would be the numbers that have exactly m zeros. So the count is high - low.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for example, in the sample input m=1:\n\nFind the minimal n where f(n) >=1. That is 5. Then check if f(5) is 1. Yes. Then find the minimal n where f(n) >=2. Which is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (high-1) are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's see. Let's find the minimal n where f(n)>=5. Let's compute:\n\nn=20: 20/5=4, 20/25=0. Total 4. Not enough. n=25: 6. So the minimal n where f(n)>=5 is 25? Wait, no. Let's check n=24: 24/5=4, 24/25=0. So 4. So the minimal n where f(n) >=5 is 25. But f(25) is 6. So that's higher than 5. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Hence, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For a given m, find the lower bound (the smallest n where f(n) >= m). Let's call this lower_n.\n\n- Check if f(lower_n) is equal to m. If not, return 0.\n\n- Else, find the upper bound, which is the smallest n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call it upper_n.\n\n- Then the numbers from lower_n to upper_n -1 are all the numbers that have exactly m zeros. The count is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Implement a function to compute the number of trailing zeros for a given n.\n\n2. Implement a binary search to find the lower_n (smallest n where f(n) >= m).\n\n3. Check if f(lower_n) is exactly m. If not, return 0.\n\n4. Else, find upper_n (smallest n where f(n) >= m+1). Then the numbers from lower_n to upper_n -1 are the valid ones.\n\nBut how to implement the binary search for lower_n?\n\nThe binary search for lower_n can be done between 0 and 5*m. Because for m trailing zeros, the minimal n is at least 5*m (since each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero). Wait, no. For example, m=1, the minimal n is 5. 5*1=5. So perhaps the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. But for m=5, the minimal n is 25, which is 5*5. So maybe 5*m is sufficient as an upper bound for binary search. Because for any n, the number of trailing zeros is at most n/5 + n/25 + ... which is less than n/4 (since 5 + 25 + 125 ... is a geometric series with ratio 1/5, sum is n/5/(1-1/5)) = n/4. So for m, the n needed is at least 4*m. So maybe setting the upper bound as 5*m is safe.\n\nBut perhaps for binary search, the upper bound can be set as 5*m. Let me think. For example, for m=1, 5*1=5. For m=2, 5*2=10. Let's see, for m=2, the minimal n is 10. So that works. For m=5, the minimal n is 25, which is 5*5. So yes, 5*m is a safe upper bound.\n\nSo for binary search, the lower bound can be 0 and upper bound 5*m.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, write the count_zeros(n) function.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen, for a given m, find the lower_n via binary search.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe binary search can be done as follows:\n\nlow = 0, high = 5*m.\n\nInitialize answer as something.\n\nWhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   current = count_zeros(mid)\n\n   if current >= m:\n\n       high = mid -1\n\n       possible answer is mid.\n\n   else:\n\n       low = mid +1\n\nAt the end, the answer is low? Or need to track it.\n\nWait, the standard way to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nLet me think. Let's say we want to find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = 5*m.\n\nresult = -1\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   cz = count_zeros(mid)\n\n   if cz >= m:\n\n       result = mid\n\n       high = mid -1\n\n   else:\n\n       low = mid +1\n\nAt the end, result is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nBut what if there is no such n? Well, since for 5*m, count_zeros(5*m) is at least m. Because 5*m /5 = m, and higher terms. So for example, 5*m is a multiple of 5, so count_zeros(5*m) is at least m. So the result will be found.\n\nOnce we have that, then check if count_zeros(result) == m. If not, then there is no solution. For example, m=5, the result would be 25, and count_zeros(25) is 6. So then, we return 0.\n\nElse, we need to find the upper_n, which is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the numbers between lower_n and upper_n-1 are the valid ones.\n\nSo for example, for m=1, lower_n is 5. upper_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=2. Which is 10. So the valid numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nOnce lower_n is found, check if count_zeros(lower_n) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, find upper_n as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nThen the numbers are from lower_n to upper_n -1, inclusive.\n\nThe count is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nSo the code for upper_n is similar to the code for lower_n, but with m+1.\n\nSo, putting this together.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nRead m from input.\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but according to the problem statement, m starts from 1. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nBut according to the input constraints, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nSo, proceed.\n\nImplement the binary search for lower_n.\n\nThen check if count_zeros(lower_n) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, find upper_n for m+1.\n\nThen the numbers are from lower_n to upper_n -1.\n\nSo the count is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nBut how to compute upper_n?\n\nSame as before, but with m+1.\n\nBut what if m+1 is zero? No, since m is at least 1, m+1 is at least 2.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input m=1:\n\nlower_n is 5. upper_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 2. Which is 10. So the numbers are 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nNow, for the code, the helper functions.\n\nBut how to code this in Python.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n >0:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * m\n\n    res = -1\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n\n        if cz >= m:\n\n            res = mid\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return res\n\nThen, for the given m:\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    upper_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    k = upper_n - lower_n\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print the numbers from lower_n to upper_n -1.\n\nBut wait, what if upper_n is not found? Well, since for m+1, the upper_n is found as find_min_n(m+1), which would be correct.\n\nBut for example, when m is very large, but for m+1, the upper_n is 5*(m+1), which is okay.\n\nBut let's test for m=5.\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(5). Let's compute.\n\nWhat is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5?\n\nLet's compute for n=24: count_zeros(24) is 4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0). For n=25, count_zeros is 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros >=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the code would return 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nlower_n is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then upper_n is find_min_n(7). What is that?\n\nFor m=7, find_min_n(7). Let's compute:\n\nLooking for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\nCheck 25: count is 6. 25+1=26: same as 25. 27, 28, 29: same. 30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1. Total 7. So minimal n is 25? No, 30?\n\nWait, let me compute count_zeros(25) is 6. So for m=7, the minimal n is 25? No. Because 25 gives 6, which is less than 7. So the code for find_min_n(7) would find the minimal n where count_zeros is >=7.\n\nSo for example, 25 gives 6, 26 gives 6, 27 gives 6, 28 gives 6, 29 gives 6, 30 gives 6 + 1 (30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7). So the minimal n is 25? No, 30.\n\nSo the code would find 30 as the minimal n for m=7.\n\nSo upper_n for m=6 is 30. Then the numbers from 25 to 29 (upper_n-1=29) would be the valid numbers. Let's check count_zeros(25) is 6, 26 is 6, 27 is 6, 28 is 6, 29 is 6. So there are 5 numbers (25-29). So the answer would be 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would return 5, and the list [25,26,27,28,29].\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle the case where m is such that there are no n's. For example, m=5.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute lower_n = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute upper_n = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthe numbers are from lower_n to upper_n -1.\n\nBut how to generate them?\n\nIn Python, for example, if lower_n is 5, upper_n is 10, then the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. So the list is range(lower_n, upper_n).\n\nBut in Python, range is exclusive of the end, so range(lower_n, upper_n) gives 5 to 9 inclusive.\n\nSo the code can generate the list as list(range(lower_n, upper_n)).\n\nBut what about when upper_n is 0? No, because m is at least 1, and upper_n is for m+1, which is at least 2. So upper_n will be >= some value.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first case is m=1, which outputs 5 numbers. Let's see:\n\nlower_n is 5. upper_n is find_min_n(2). Let's compute that.\n\nfind_min_n(2) is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=2. Let's see:\n\nn=5: count is 1. n=10: count is 2. So the minimal is 10. So upper_n is 10. So the list is from 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would generate that.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? According to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut the input is given as a single integer. For example, the first sample input is ['1', '5']? Wait, looking back at the example:\n\nThe example says input is ['1', '5'] and output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'].\n\nWait, perhaps the input is multiple test cases? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nBut the sample input shows two cases? Wait, perhaps the example is for multiple test cases. Wait, the example says:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. The sample shows that perhaps the input is given as a list of test cases, but perhaps the actual problem is that the user should read a single m. But the sample input shows two cases. Wait, perhaps the sample input is for two different test cases. For example, the first input is 1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second input is 5, output is 0. But the way the sample is written is confusing.\n\nBut the problem says: the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is for two separate test cases, but in the code, the user is to read one m per input.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of inputs. But perhaps that's part of the problem description. For example, the first sample input is m=1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second sample input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code should read one m from input, process it, and output the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], perhaps indicating that the code needs to read multiple test cases. But the problem says, \"the only line of input contains an integer m\".\n\nSo perhaps the sample input is written as a list of possible test cases, but the actual code should read one m from stdin.\n\nSo the code should read m from stdin as a single integer.\n\nBut in the example, the first input is '1', and the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', and the second input is '5' and output is '0'.\n\nSo the code should read m from input, and output the answer for that m.\n\nTherefore, in the code, the input is read as m = int(input()).\n\nBut perhaps in the sample, the input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code is to read one m.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen compute as per the steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement find_min_n.\n\nBut for the code, the find_min_n function can be implemented as a helper function.\n\nBut for code efficiency, since m can be up to 1e5, and for each binary search, the steps are O(log (5*m)), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, and binary search steps are log2(5e5) ~ 19 steps. Each step involves count_zeros, which is O(log n) steps. So overall, the code is efficient enough.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    res = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz >= target:\n            res = mid\n            high = mid -1\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return res\n\nm = int(input())\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    upper_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = upper_n - lower_n\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower_n, upper_n))))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So the first line is the k, then the numbers. So the code prints k, then the numbers.\n\nBut in the code above, the code for the else part:\n\nprint(k) then print the numbers. But the code for the numbers is using range(lower_n, upper_n). For example, lower_n=5, upper_n=10. range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, when you print the list, the code uses ' '.join(map(str, ...)), which is correct.\n\nBut what if k is zero? Well, in that case, the code would have printed 0 and not enter the else.\n\nBut for the case when m is 5, the code would print 0.\n\nTesting this code.\n\nTest case 1: m=1.\n\nlower_n is find_min_n(1). Let's see:\n\nbinary search for target=1.\n\nlow=0, high=5*1=5.\n\nInitially, low=0, high=5.\n\nmid=2. count_zeros(2) is 0 <1. So low becomes 3.\n\nmid=(3+5)//2=4. count_zeros(4)=0 <1. low becomes 5.\n\nmid=5. count_zeros(5)=1 >=1. res=5, high=4. loop ends. return 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\nupper_n is find_min_n(2). Let's compute that.\n\ntarget=2.\n\nhigh=5*2=10.\n\nlow=0, high=10.\n\nmid=5. count_zeros(5)=1 <2. low=6.\n\nmid= (6+10)/2=8. count_zeros(8)=1 <2. low=9.\n\nmid= (9+10)/2=9.5 → 9. count_zeros(9) is 1 <2. low=10.\n\nmid=10. count_zeros(10) is 2 >=2. res=10. high=9. loop ends. return 10.\n\nso upper_n=10. k=10-5=5. So print 5, then the numbers 5-9. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=5.\n\nlower_n is find_min_n(5). Let's see:\n\ntarget=5.\n\nhigh=5*5=25.\n\nbinary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet me think:\n\nAt mid=25, count_zeros(25) is 6 >=5. So high is adjusted down. Eventually, the minimal n would be 25?\n\nWait, but for n=24, count_zeros is 4. So the minimal n is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to m=5. So the code would check if count_zeros(25) ==5? No. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nlower_n is find_min_n(6). Let's see:\n\nLooking for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=6.\n\nn=25: count is 6. So lower_n=25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So proceed.\n\nupper_n is find_min_n(7). Let's compute that.\n\nLooking for minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7. Which is 30. So upper_n is 30. So the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29. So k=5. So output 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, what about m=0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no need to handle.\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, the code would proceed. For example, m=0. find_min_n(0) would be 0, since count_zeros(0) is 0. Then check count_zeros(0) ==0. Yes. Then upper_n is find_min_n(1) which is 5. So k=5-0=5. But the numbers would be 0,1,2,3,4. However, the problem says positive integers n. So n must be positive. So the code would output 0,1,2,3,4. But according to the problem statement, the code should output positive integers. So the code as written may have an error here.\n\nWait, but the problem says: \"number of positive integers n\".\n\nIn our code, for m=0, the code would generate numbers from 0 to 4. But 0 is not a positive integer. So in the code, when m is 0, the code would output 5 numbers, but they are 0,1,2,3,4. However, the problem states that m is between 1 and 1e5. So the code is correct for the given input constraints.\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, the problem says that m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input where m=5. The code returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. The code returns 5 numbers.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut in the code, when printing the numbers, for the case where k is 0, it's handled. Else, for the else case, the code prints k and then the numbers.\n\nBut in the code, when k is 0, the code prints 0. Else, the code prints k and the numbers.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input m=5 would print 0.\n\nBut what about when the upper_n is 0?\n\nNo, because m is at least 1, and upper_n is for m+1 which is at least 2. So the code is safe.\n\nAnother possible edge case: m=2.\n\nfind_min_n(2) is 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. upper_n is find_min_n(3). Let's compute that.\n\nLooking for minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=3. Let's see:\n\nn=15: count_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). So the minimal n is 15. So upper_n is 15. So the numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. So k=5 numbers.\n\nSo for m=2, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nAnother edge case: m=24. Let's see what happens.\n\nBut perhaps the code can handle that.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, when generating the list, for the numbers from lower_n to upper_n-1, the code uses range(lower_n, upper_n). Which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, the range is [start, end), so for example, range(5, 10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input m=1 would output 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5, output is 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut note that for m=0, the code may return 5 numbers (0-4), but since m is at least 1, it's not a problem.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut the code as written would have the following:\n\nWhen the user inputs m, the code runs.\n\nBut for m=1, the code outputs 5 followed by the numbers. However, the sample output for the first case is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut the code prints k, then the numbers. So the first line is k, then the second line is the numbers. However, in the sample output, it's written as '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' which is two lines. So the code is correct.\n\nBut when the code does print(k) and then print(' '.join(...)), that would output two lines, which is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output for the first case is:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code may have a problem when upper_n is 0, but that's not possible.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut the code for the else part prints the numbers as a space-separated string. However, when k is zero, the code prints 0, and nothing else. Which is correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut in the case where the numbers are zero, but the problem says positive integers. However, the code is correct because m is >=1, and for m=1, the lower_n is 5, which is positive.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut in Python, for the case where the list is empty (k=0), the code would print 0 and not print anything else. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s dictates the number of trailing zeros.\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: Given a target number of trailing zeros $ m $, we use binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ n! $ has at least $ m $ trailing zeros. This helps in narrowing down the possible values of $ n $.\n3. **Range Determination**: Once we find the smallest $ n $ with at least $ m $ trailing zeros, we check if it exactly matches $ m $. If it does, we then determine the range of $ n $ values that yield exactly $ m $ trailing zeros by finding the next value where the count of trailing zeros exceeds $ m $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    res = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        cz = count_zeros(mid)\n        if cz >= target:\n            res = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return res\n\nm = int(input())\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    upper_n = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = upper_n - lower_n\n    print(k)\n    if k > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower_n, upper_n))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the given target. The search range is between 0 and $ 5 \\times \\text{target} $, which is a safe upper bound based on the properties of trailing zeros.\n3. **Main Logic**: After determining the smallest $ n $ (lower_n) with at least $ m $ trailing zeros, we check if it exactly matches $ m $. If not, we output 0. Otherwise, we find the next value (upper_n) where the trailing zeros exceed $ m $ and compute the range of valid $ n $ values. These values are printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $ up to 100,000.",
