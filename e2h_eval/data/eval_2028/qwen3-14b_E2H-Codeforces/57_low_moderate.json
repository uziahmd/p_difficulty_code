His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on the given points from two tours. The problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But since the teacher has the points for each participant in each tour, but not their names, we need to consider all possible pairings of first and second tour scores for the participants. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tours, but they are just lists of points, not associated with names. So each participant has a first tour score and a second tour score. But the problem is that the teacher doesn't know which first tour score corresponds to which second tour score. Oh wait, no. Wait, the input is given as two lists: the first list is the first tour's points for all participants, the second list is the second tour's points for all participants. But each participant has one entry in each list. However, the problem states that the teacher has these lists, but doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to the same participant. Because the data is given in arbitrary order. So for example, the actual participants' total points would be a_i + b_j, but only if the same participant had a_i in first and b_j in second. However, the problem says that the teacher needs to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have. But since the teacher knows that there exists some pairing where Vasya's total is at least x (as per the problem statement), but how do we model this?\n\nWait, the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But the teacher has to find the best and worst possible positions he could have, considering all possible ways of pairing the a's and b's. Because the actual pairing is unknown. So for example, the best case for Vasya is when his total is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible. But how?\n\nSo, the approach is: For the best possible rank, we want to maximize Vasya's total (so that he's as high as possible) and minimize others' totals (so that as many as possible are below him). But since the pairing is arbitrary, how can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, the problem requires that there exists at least one pairing where Vasya's total is >=x. But since the problem says that it is guaranteed that such a pairing exists, we need to find for all possible pairings (which are valid, i.e., each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, and vice versa) the possible positions of Vasya's total.\n\nBut considering all possible pairings is computationally impossible for n up to 1e5. So there must be a smarter way.\n\nWait, but the problem is not about all possible pairings, but rather, the teacher wants to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have, given that there exists a pairing where his total is at least x. Wait, no. The teacher wants to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have, considering all possible pairings (since the actual pairing is unknown). But since the teacher knows that there exists at least one pairing where Vasya's total is at least x (as per the problem statement), then the answer is based on the possible pairings that are valid (i.e., each participant has exactly one a_i and one b_j).\n\nBut how can we model the best and worst possible positions?\n\nLet me think. For the best possible position, we want to choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others' totals are as low as possible. For the worst possible position, we want to choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still at least x) and others' totals are as high as possible.\n\nBut how to compute this? Because for the best case, we can choose the maximum possible total for Vasya. How? Well, Vasya's total is a_i + b_j. But since the pairing is a permutation, we can choose the maximum a_i + b_j possible. Wait, but for the best possible scenario, we can pair a_i with b_j such that the sum for Vasya is maximum. But how do we ensure that there's a pairing where Vasya's sum is maximum?\n\nWait, here's an idea. Since the pairing is arbitrary, for the best possible position, we can assume that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible (i.e., the maximum a_i + b_j possible). Then, the best possible rank is 1, because if he has the maximum sum, he can be first. But perhaps there are multiple people with the same sum. However, the problem says that the jury can assign places arbitrarily in case of ties. So in the best case, V",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his minimum total score from two tours. The solution involves considering all possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours to find the optimal scenarios for Vasya's rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To determine the best possible rank for Vasya, we need to maximize his total score. This can be achieved by pairing the highest score from the first tour with the highest score from the second tour. This gives Vasya the maximum possible score, ensuring he gets the best possible rank.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To determine the worst possible rank for Vasya, we need to minimize his total score while ensuring it meets the minimum threshold `x`. This involves considering the scenario where other participants have the highest possible scores, pushing Vasya's rank as low as possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    line1 = input[idx].split()\n    n, x = int(line1[0]), int(line1[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Sort the lists\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Best possible place: max possible sum for Vasya\n    # We take the max a + max b\n    max_vasya = a_sorted[-1] + b_sorted[-1]\n    # Now count how many people can have sum >= max_vasya\n    # To find the best place, it's 1 if there is no one else with the same sum\n    # But since the jury can assign places, the best possible is 1\n    best_place = 1\n    \n    # Worst possible place: min possible sum for Vasya that is >=x\n    # We need to find the minimal sum s >= x such that s is a_i + b_j\n    # Then count how many people can have sum >= s\n    # To find the worst place, we need to consider the minimal s >=x, then find the number of people that can have sum >=s\n    \n    # Find the minimal s >=x\n    # To find the minimal possible s (but >=x), we can take the minimal a_i + b_j >=x\n    # However, since we want the worst case, we need to choose the minimal s >=x such that there exists a pairing where Vasya has s\n    # For worst case, we want as many people as possible to have sum >= s\n    # So we need to find the minimal s >=x such that there exists a pairing where s is achievable, and then find the number of people that can have sum >=s\n    \n    # But how to find s?

But since we want s to be as small as possible (to maximize the number of people who can have higher sums), we can set s = x.\n    # However, this might not be achievable.

So we can proceed with s = x.\n    \n    # Wait, no. Because the minimal s that Vasya can have is the minimal possible sum that is >=x. But the worst case is when Vasya has the minimal possible s >=x.

Since b is sorted descending, we can use binary search.\n    \n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    \n    count = 0\n    j = 0\n    for ai in a_asc:\n        # Find the first b_j >= (x - ai)\n        # Since b is sorted descending, we can use bisect_left\n        target = x - ai\n        # Find the first index in b_desc where b_j >= target\n        # Since b_desc is sorted descending, we can use bisect_left on reversed list.\n        # Alternatively, use bisect_left on the list with key.\n        # Let's use bisect module\n        # For example, in a list sorted in descending order, to find the first element >= target, we can use:\n        # We can use bisect_left on the reversed list.\n        # But maybe it's easier to use a custom approach.\n        # Let's use bisect_left on the list, but with a negative sign.\n        # Alternatively, since b_desc is sorted in descending order, we can use bisect_left on the reversed list.\n        \n        # Let's try using bisect_left on the list, but with the negated values.\n        # Another approach: iterate through the list and find the first b_j >= target.\n        # However, for efficiency, we can use binary search.\n        # Since the list is sorted descending, we can use bisect_left with a custom comparator.\n        \n        # Let's use bisect_left on the list, but with the key being the negative of the elements.\n        # Or perhaps use bisect_left on a list sorted in ascending order.\n        # Let me think: the list is sorted in descending order. We want to find the first element >= target. So in a descending list, all elements before that index are >= target, and after are < target.\n        # So, the number of elements >= target is the index where the first element < target is found.\n        # To find this index, we can use bisect_left on the list, but with the target and considering the descending order.\n        \n        # For example, using bisect_left on the list, but with the target, and then adjusting the index.\n        # Here's a way to find the first index where b_desc[i] < target:\n        # We can use bisect_left on the list with the key being -b_desc[i], but perhaps that's complicated.\n        # Alternatively, use the bisect module's bisect_left function with a custom key.\n        # Since Python's bisect module doesn't support keys, we can use a trick.\n        # Let's create a list sorted in ascending order. For example, if we have b_desc sorted in descending order, then the list sorted in ascending order is -b_desc.\n        # So, for the original list b_desc, we can reverse it to get ascending order.\n        # Alternatively, use bisect_left on the list with the target, but adjust the comparison.\n        # Let's proceed with a binary search approach.\n        \n        low = j\n        high = len(b_desc)\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if b_desc[mid] >= target:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid\n        # After loop, low is the first index where b_desc[low] < target\n        # So the number of elements >= target is low\n        if low > 0:\n            count += 1\n            j = low  # next time, start from here to avoid reusing the same elements\n        else:\n            # No elements >= target\n            pass\n    # But this approach is incorrect because we need to pair each a_i with a unique b_j.\n    # The above approach assumes that we can reuse elements, which is not allowed.\n    # Therefore, the correct way is to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x, with each a_i and b_j used exactly once.\n    # This is equivalent to the maximum matching problem, which can be solved by sorting a in ascending and b in descending, then greedily matching.\n    # So the correct approach is to sort a in ascending order, b in descending order, then for each a_i, take the first available b_j that can be paired with it to reach x.\n    \n    # Let's implement this greedy approach.\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_desc = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    \n    count = 0\n    j = 0\n    for ai in a_asc:\n        while j < len(b_desc) and ai + b_desc[j] < x:\n            j += 1\n        if j < len(b_desc):\n            count += 1\n            j += 1\n    # So the maximum number of people with sum >=x is count. But since Vasya is one of them, the worst possible place is count.\n    # Because in the worst case, all these count people have sum >=x, and Vasya is placed last among them.\n    # However, the problem says that the teacher knows that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x.
