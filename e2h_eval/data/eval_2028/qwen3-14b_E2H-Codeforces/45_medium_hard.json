There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a balanced bracket. But here, the structure isn't fixed. We need to arrange the matches in such a way that the winner plays as many games as possible, following the rule.\n\nLet me look at the examples. For n=3, the output is 2. How does that work? The winner plays two games. Let's see: first, maybe player 1 plays against player 2. Then, the winner (player 1) plays against player 3. But wait, when player 1 plays against player 2, they each have 0 games before that. After that, player 1 has 1 game, and player 2 is out. Then, player 1 plays against player 3. Player 3 has 0 games, and player 1 has 1. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. So the maximum is 2 games. \n\nFor n=4, the output is 2. Wait, why not 3? Because in a normal bracket, the winner would play 3 games (since 4 players, log2(4)=2? Wait no, wait for 4 players, it's two rounds. First round: two matches, then final. So the winner plays two matches. Oh right. So the output is 2. But how can we get more? Well, perhaps the structure of the tournament is such that the winner can't play more than 2 games. So the problem is about finding the maximum possible given the constraints.\n\nSo the question is, given n players, what's the maximum number of games the winner can play, given that whenever two players play, their number of previous games differ by at most one.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose the winner plays k games. Each time he plays, he must have a new opponent. Let's think about how the opponents are arranged. \n\nEach time the winner plays a game, the opponent must have played either the same number of games as him, or one less. Let's say the winner has played m games so far. Then the next opponent must have played m-1 or m games. But since the opponent has to have won all their previous games, the number of games they have played is equal to the number of matches they've won so far.\n\nSo, for the winner to play as many games as possible, each time he plays, he needs to have an opponent that's as close as possible in the number of games played. \n\nThis seems similar to building a binary tree. For example, in order for the winner to play k games, each game requires that there's an opponent. Let's think about the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games. \n\nLet me model this. Let's say f(k) is the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games. Then, for each game the winner plays, he must have an opponent. Let's think recursively. \n\nThe first game: the winner has 0 games before. The opponent also has 0. So that's one game. Now, for the second game, the winner has played once. The opponent must have played either 0 or 1 games. But to maximize the number of games, perhaps the opponent has played 1 game. But how?\n\nWait, the opponent must have won all their previous games. So for the second game, the opponent must have a history of 1 game. That implies that the opponent had to have played one game before. So, to get such an opponent, we need to have another subtree where that opponent has played once. \n\nSo, for the winner to play k games, the structure would be such that each time he plays, he has an opponent that has played either the same number of games as him (so that they can meet), or one less. But to maximize the number of games, perhaps the opponent has played one less. \n\nThis seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let's think about it. Let me think of f(k) as the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games. \n\nTo play k games, the winner must play in the first game, then in the second, etc. Let's think for k=1: the minimal players is 2. For k=2: the winner plays two games. How? The first game is against someone. Then, for the second game, the opponent must have played 1 game. So that opponent must have had a previous game. So the minimal players would be 2 + 1 (the opponent's previous match). Wait, but the opponent in the second game must have a path of 1 game. So for the winner to play his second game, he needs to have an opponent that has already played once. That opponent would have needed to have a previous match. So the minimal players is 2 (for the first game) plus the minimal players needed for the opponent to have played once. Which is 2. But wait, that's overlapping. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as for the winner to play k games, he must have in each step an opponent. For the first game, the opponent is 1 player. For the second game, the opponent must have played once. So that requires that the opponent has a path of 1 game. So the minimal number of players for that is f(1) = 2. But the winner's first game is against someone. Then, the opponent for the second game must have come from a subtree where they had to play once. So the total number of players is 1 (the winner) + the players required for the first game (which is 1) + the players required for the opponent's path (which is f(1) = 2). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think recursively. To have the winner play k games, he must have played k-1 games before the last one. So, for the k-th game, he must face an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games. But to maximize the number of games, perhaps the opponent has played k-1 games. But how can that be?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because, for the winner to play his k-th game, he needs to have an opponent who has played k-1 games (so that the difference is 1). But how does that opponent get to have played k-1 games? That requires that the opponent's path requires f(k-1) players. However, the winner himself has already played k-1 games, which requires f(k-1) players. Wait, perhaps not. Maybe it's the sum of the two. \n\nWait, think of the case where the winner plays k games. For the first game, he plays against someone. Then, for the second game, he needs an opponent that has played once. So that opponent must have had a path of one game. So the total players required for the winner's path is 1 (himself) + the players needed for his first game (which is 1) + the players needed for the opponent's path (which is f(1)). But I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me look at some examples. For k=1, the minimal players is 2. For k=2, the minimal players is 3. Because the winner plays two games. How? First, he plays against player 2. Then, he plays against player 3. But for that to be allowed, player 3 must have played one game. So player 3 must have played against someone else. But that someone else would be player 1? No, because player 1 is the winner. Wait, maybe the structure is that the winner plays against player 2 (game 1), then player 3 (game 2). But player 3 must have played one game before. So player 3 must have played against someone else. But that someone else would have to be another player, but that would require another player. Wait, for example, in the case of n=3, the winner plays two games. The initial setup is that there are three players. So for the first game, the winner plays against player 2. Then, player 3 has to have played one game. But how? Unless there's another match. But in the tournament, the players are in a knockout bracket. So maybe the first match is between player 1 and 2, and the second match is between player 3 and someone else. But that someone else would have to be another player. But if there are three players, that's not possible. Wait, but in the case of n=3, the tournament is structured as follows: first, two players play (say, 1 vs 2), the winner (say 1) plays against 3. But in this case, player 3 hasn't played any games before. So the difference between the winner's games (1) and the opponent's (0) is 1, which is allowed. So in this case, the minimal players for k=2 is 3. So f(2)=3.\n\nThen for k=3, what's the minimal players? To play three games, the winner must have an opponent for the third game. For that, the opponent must have played either 2 or 1 games. Let's say the opponent has played 2 games. Then, the minimal players required for that opponent is f(2) = 3. And the winner's path up to two games requires f(2) = 3 players. So the total players would be 3 + 3 - 1 = 5? Because the winner is part of both. Wait, maybe f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Let's check:\n\nFor k=1, f(1) = 2.\n\nk=2: f(2) = f(1) + f(0). Wait, what's f(0)? Maybe f(0) is 1 (the winner hasn't played any games yet). So for k=2, f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3, which matches.\n\nk=3: f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 =5.\n\nk=4: f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 5+3=8.\n\nSo this looks like the Fibonacci sequence. Let me check with the sample input.\n\nSample input n=3: the maximum games is 2. Which is f(2)=3. So when n is 3, the answer is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: n=4. The maximum is 2. Because f(3) is 5, which is larger than 4. So the maximum possible is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: n=10. The output is 4. Let's see. Let's compute f(4) is 8, f(5)=f(4)+f(3)=8+5=13. So for n=10, the maximum k is 4, because f(4)=8 <=10, and f(5)=13>10. So the answer is 4. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes! So the problem reduces to finding the largest k such that f(k) ≤n, where f(k) is the k-th term in the Fibonacci sequence starting with f(0)=1, f(1)=2, f(2)=3, f(3)=5, etc. Wait, let's check:\n\nWait the initial terms:\n\nk=0: 1 (the winner hasn't played any games, but that's perhaps not relevant here)\n\nk=1: 2 players.\n\nk=2: 3 players.\n\nk=3: 5 players.\n\nk=4: 8 players.\n\nk=5: 13 players.\n\nSo the sequence is similar to Fibonacci numbers, but shifted. Let's see: the Fibonacci numbers are usually defined as F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, etc. But here, our f(k) is similar to F(k+2) where F is the standard Fibonacci sequence. Let me check:\n\nFor example, f(1)=2 = F(3) (if F(3)=2). Let's see:\n\nStandard Fibonacci numbers:\n\nF(0)=0\n\nF(1)=1\n\nF(2)=1\n\nF(3)=2\n\nF(4)=3\n\nF(5)=5\n\nF(6)=8\n\nF(7)=13\n\nSo for f(k) = F(k+2). For example, for k=1, F(3) is 2. For k=2, F(4)=3. For k=3, F(5)=5. Yes. So f(k) = F(k+2), where F is the standard Fibonacci sequence. \n\nSo the problem becomes, given n, find the maximum k such that F(k+2) ≤n. \n\nBut how do we compute this for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nWe can precompute the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed 1e18, then for each input n, perform a binary search on the list of Fibonacci numbers to find the maximum k where F(k+2) ≤n. \n\nLet me think. For example, for n=2, the maximum k is 1, since F(3)=2. For n=3, F(4)=3, so k=2. For n=4, F(5)=5 is larger than 4, so the maximum is k=2 (since F(4)=3 ≤4). \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the Fibonacci numbers until they exceed 1e18. \n\n- For a given n, find the maximum k where F(k+2) ≤n. \n\nBut how to handle the cases where n is not exactly a Fibonacci number. For example, n=4: the maximum k is 2 because F(4)=3 <=4 and F(5)=5>4.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem:\n\n1. Generate all Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18. Let's generate them in a list. \n\nLet's see:\n\nStart with F(0) = 0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13, F(8)=21, ... etc. \n\nBut for our purposes, the list we need is the F(k+2) for k starting from 0. For example, for k=0, F(2) = 1. But that would correspond to the minimal players needed for the winner to play 0 games. Which is 1, but since n starts from 2, perhaps we can ignore that. \n\nBut the key is to find the largest k where F(k+2) ≤n. \n\nSo for example, for n=2, the largest k is 1, because F(3) = 2. \n\nSo the list of F(k+2) is [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...]. \n\nSo let's generate this list. \n\nLet's generate the list of F numbers where each is the next Fibonacci number, starting from 1, 2, 3, 5, etc. \n\nLet me generate the list:\n\nStart with a = 1 (F(2) = 1?), then b=2 (F(3) = 2), then next is 3 (F(4) = 3), then 5 (F(5) = 5), etc. \n\nSo the list is:\n\nfib_list = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...]\n\nSo for each n, we need to find the maximum k such that fib_list[k] <=n. \n\nWait, for example, for the first element in the list (1), which is F(2) = 1. Then for k=0, the maximum number of games is 0? But that's not possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the list should be generated as follows:\n\nThe minimal number of players for the winner to play k games is F(k+2). \n\nSo for k=1, F(3) = 2. For k=2, F(4)=3. For k=3, F(5)=5. So the list for the minimal players is [F(2), F(3), F(4), F(5), ...], which is [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...]. \n\nBut for the problem, the answer for a given n is the maximum k such that F(k+2) <=n. \n\nSo for example, for n=2, the maximum k is 1 (since F(3)=2). For n=3, it's 2 (F(4)=3). For n=4, it's 2 (since F(4)=3 <=4, F(5)=5>4). \n\nSo the approach is to generate the list of F(k+2) values, which are the Fibonacci numbers starting from F(2) = 1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, etc. Then for a given n, find the maximum k where F(k+2) <=n. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Precompute the list of Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18. Let's generate them until the next number exceeds 1e18. \n\nOnce we have this list, for a given n, we can perform a binary search to find the maximum index i such that fib_list[i] <=n. Then the answer is i. \n\nWait, because the list is [F(2), F(3), F(4), ...], so for each entry in the list, the index i corresponds to k = i. \n\nWait, for example, fib_list[0] = F(2) = 1. This corresponds to k=0 (the winner can play 0 games, but that's only possible if n=1, which is not allowed here). But since the problem says n starts at 2, maybe the list starts from the first entry that is >=2. \n\nWait, for n=2, the answer is 1. Which corresponds to fib_list[1] = 2. So the index in the list is 1, which is the value of k. So the answer is the index. \n\nSo the list is generated as follows:\n\nWe generate the Fibonacci numbers starting from F(2) = 1, F(3) = 2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, etc. So the list is [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...]. \n\nFor n=2, the maximum k is 1. Because the value 2 is at index 1. \n\nFor n=3, the index is 2 (value 3). \n\nFor n=4, the maximum is 2 (value 3). \n\nSo the answer is the index of the largest element in the list that is <=n. \n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nGenerate the list of Fibonacci numbers (starting from F(2)=1, F(3)=2, etc.), then for a given n, find the maximum index i where fib_list[i] <=n. The answer is i. \n\nBut how to generate the list? Let's think:\n\nInitialize a list with the first two elements: 1, 2. Then each next element is the sum of the previous two. \n\nWait:\n\nfib_list = [1, 2]\n\nnext term is 1 + 2 =3 → add to list.\n\nnext term is 2 +3=5 → add.\n\nthen 3+5=8, etc. \n\nYes. So the list is generated as follows. \n\nOnce we have this list, for a given n, we can do a binary search to find the maximum i such that fib_list[i] <=n. \n\nNow, for example, for n=10, the list up to 13 is [1,2,3,5,8,13]. So 8 is at index 4. 13 is larger than 10. So the answer is 4. Which matches the sample input where n=10 gives output 4. \n\nYes! So the code can be written as follows:\n\nFirst, generate the list of Fibonacci numbers as described. Then, for the input n, perform a binary search on this list to find the maximum index where the value is <=n. \n\nBut what about when n is not in the list? For example, n=4. The list has 3 (index 2) and 5 (index 3). So the maximum is 3, which is 2. \n\nSo the code will need to find the largest element in the list that is <=n. \n\nNow, the problem is generating the list.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given the constraint that two players can only compete if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. The solution involves understanding the structure of the tournament and leveraging properties of Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The key insight is that the maximum number of games the winner can play follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each game the winner plays requires an opponent who has played a number of games that differs by at most one from the winner's previous games.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games corresponds to the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number. This is derived from the recursive nature of the problem where each game requires opponents with specific game histories.\n3. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: Generate Fibonacci numbers up to a value that exceeds the maximum possible input (10^18). This allows efficient lookup using binary search.\n4. **Binary Search for Maximum Games**: For a given number of players `n`, use binary search on the precomputed Fibonacci numbers to find the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18\n    fib_list = [1, 2]  # F(2) = 1, F(3) = 2\n    while True:\n        next_fib = fib_list[-1] + fib_list[-2]\n        if next_fib > 10**18:\n            break\n        fib_list.append(next_fib)\n    \n    # Binary search for the maximum k such that fib_list[k] <= n\n    left = 0\n    right = len(fib_list) - 1\n    result = 0\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if fib_list[mid] <= n:\n            result = mid\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate Fibonacci numbers starting from 1 and 2 (which correspond to F(2) and F(3) in the standard Fibonacci sequence). This continues until the generated number exceeds 10^18, ensuring coverage for all possible inputs.\n2. **Binary Search**: For a given input `n`, we perform a binary search on the precomputed list of Fibonacci numbers to find the largest index `i` such that the Fibonacci number at index `i` is less than or equal to `n`. This index directly gives the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and leverages mathematical insights to provide an optimal solution.",
