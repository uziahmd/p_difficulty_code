Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input: guest's name, host's name, and a pile of letters. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach is: combine the guest and host strings, count the frequency of each character. Then count the frequency of each character in the pile. If both counts are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nHow to implement this in Python?\n\nFirst, read the three lines. Then, concatenate the first two lines (guest + host), then compare the sorted concatenation with the sorted pile.\n\nWait, yes. Because if you sort all the letters of guest and host, and sort the pile, then if they are the same, then it's possible. Because the pile must have exactly the same letters as the combination of the two names.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\nGuest is SANTACLAUS, host is DEDMOROZ. Combined, their letters when sorted should be the same as the pile sorted.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Combine the first two into a single string.\n3. Sort this combined string.\n4. Sort the third line (the pile).\n5. Compare the two sorted strings. If equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the combined length of guest and host is different from the pile's length? For example, if the guest and host have total length 5, and the pile has length 6. Then obviously, it's impossible. So checking the lengths first could be a quick way to return NO.\n\nBut even if the lengths are same, the characters may not match. So the steps would be:\n\nCheck if the combined length of guest and host equals the length of the pile. If not, return NO. Else, check if the sorted combined string equals sorted pile.\n\nYes. So in code:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nThat's the core logic.\n\nLet me test this with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\nWait, the first input line is 'SANTACLAUS', second 'DEDMOROZ', third 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nCombined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' — let's count the letters. Let me think. The third line is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'. Let me check the lengths.\n\nLength of guest: len(\"SANTACLAUS\") is 10 letters. Host is \"DEDMOROZ\" which is 8 letters. Total 18. The pile is \"SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\" — let's see. Let me count letters:\n\nBut maybe the code will handle that. So sorted(combined) should be same as sorted(pile). So the code would return YES.\n\nIn the second example input:\n\nguest is 'PAPAINOEL', host is 'JOULUPUKKI', pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'.\n\nCombined length is len('PAPAINOEL') + len('JOULUPUKKI') = 9 + 10 = 19. The pile's length is len('JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI') — let me count. Let me see: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count letters. Well, perhaps the code would check that. But in the note, it says that there's a missing P and an extra L. So the code would catch that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nTest case where all letters are same. Like guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\" → YES.\n\nAnother case where guest and host have combined letters but pile has different letters. Like guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → YES. If pile is \"AC\" → NO.\n\nAnother case where the lengths differ. Like guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"ABBA\" → len is 2 vs 4 → output NO.\n\nSo the code handles these.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is three lines. So in Python, reading via input().strip()",
