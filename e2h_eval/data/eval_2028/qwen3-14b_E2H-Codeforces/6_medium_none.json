Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about Leha choosing two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x, and they don't overlap. And we have to find the minimal total cost of such a pair. If it's not possible, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. Each voucher has li (departure day), ri (return day), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. So for two vouchers i and j, their durations must sum to x. Also, they must not overlap. Which means either the first ends before the second starts, or vice versa.\n\nThe challenge is to find all pairs of vouchers that satisfy these conditions and find the minimum sum of their costs.\n\nConstraints are n up to 2e5, which is big. So O(n^2) approaches will not work. We need an efficient way, probably O(n log n) or O(n) with some preprocessing.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for each voucher, we can compute its duration. Then, for each voucher, we need to find another voucher whose duration is (x - duration_i), and that doesn't overlap with it.\n\nBut how to efficiently find those vouchers?\n\nLet me think: For each voucher i, with duration d, we need to find vouchers j with duration (x - d), and such that j is either entirely before i or entirely after i.\n\nSo, perhaps we can group vouchers by their duration. Then, for each voucher i with duration d, check if there exists vouchers with duration (x - d). Then, for those vouchers, find the minimum cost ones that don't overlap with i.\n\nBut even that seems challenging. Because for each voucher, checking all vouchers of the required duration might be expensive.\n\nAlternative idea: pre-process for each possible duration, the list of vouchers sorted by their start and end times, and also track the minimum cost for certain ranges.\n\nFor example, for each duration d, we can have two sorted lists: one sorted by their end time (so that for a voucher i that ends at some time, we can find vouchers that start after that), and another sorted by their start time (so that for a voucher i that starts at some time, we can find vouchers that end before that).\n\nWait, but how do we find the minimal cost voucher that ends before a certain time, or starts after a certain time?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a voucher i with duration d, and we need to find vouchers j with duration (x - d). Let's say that x - d is some value, say, target_d. So for each voucher i, we can check if there exists any vouchers of target_d duration.\n\nIf there are such vouchers, then for each such voucher j, we need to check whether they don't overlap with i. But checking all j's would be O(n) per i, which is too slow.\n\nSo, how can we find the minimal cost voucher j of target_d duration that ends before the start of i, or starts after the end of i?\n\nAh, here's an idea. For each duration d, we can keep two structures:\n\n- A list of vouchers with duration d, sorted by their end time. For each such voucher, we can also have a prefix minimum array. So for a given end time, we can find the minimal cost voucher that ends before a certain time.\n\nSimilarly, another list sorted by their start time, with a prefix minimum array. Wait, maybe not. Let's think again.\n\nFor a voucher i, which has start li and end ri. We want to find vouchers j with duration target_d, which end before li. That is, their ri_j < li. So for those vouchers, their end time is less than li. So if we have a list of vouchers of target_d duration sorted by their end time, then we can perform a binary search to find the largest end time that is less than li. Then, among all vouchers up to that point, what's the minimal cost?\n\nSimilarly, we need to find vouchers j of target_d duration that start after ri. So their li_j > ri. For those, we can sort the vouchers of target_d duration by their start time, and find the earliest start time that is larger than ri. Then, among all vouchers from that point on, find the minimal cost.\n\nBut how do we precompute the minimal cost for these ranges?\n\nFor example, if we have a list of vouchers sorted by end time, then we can create a prefix minimum array where for each position k in the sorted list, prefix_min[k] is the minimum cost among the first k vouchers. Then, when we find the largest end time <= li, we can take the prefix_min up to that index. Similarly, for the start time sorted list, we can have a suffix minimum array, so that for a given start time >= ri, we can find the earliest index in the sorted list where start time is > ri, and take the suffix min from that index onwards.\n\nThis seems feasible. Let me outline the steps.\n\nFirst, group all vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, we have a list of vouchers. Then, for each d, we process two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by end time (ri). For this list, we can create a prefix minimum array. So for each voucher in the sorted list, the prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], cost of voucher i).\n\n- Sorted by start time (li). For this list, we can create a suffix minimum array. So for each voucher in the sorted list, the suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], cost of voucher i).\n\nThen, for a voucher i with duration d, and target_d = x - d, we check if there are any vouchers in the target_d group. If yes, then:\n\n- Check for vouchers in target_d that end before li. For this, we look into the sorted end time list of target_d. Find the largest end time <= li-1 (since ri_j < li). Then, if such vouchers exist, take the prefix_min up to that index.\n\n- Check for vouchers in target_d that start after ri. For this, look into the sorted start time list of target_d. Find the smallest start time >= ri+1 (since lj_j > ri). Then, if such vouchers exist, take the suffix_min from that index onwards.\n\nThe minimal cost between these two possibilities (if any) is a candidate for the overall minimum.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers grouped by their duration. For each duration, store two sorted lists (sorted by end time and sorted by start time), along with their prefix and suffix minima.\n\n2. For each voucher i in the original list:\n\n   a. Compute its duration d = ri - li + 1.\n\n   b. Compute target_d = x - d. If target_d is negative, skip.\n\n   c. Check if there are any vouchers in the target_d group. If not, skip.\n\n   d. For the target_d group, perform the two checks:\n\n      i. Find vouchers ending before li. Use the end-sorted list and binary search.\n\n      ii. Find vouchers starting after ri. Use the start-sorted list and binary search.\n\n   e. For each of these two cases, get the minimal cost if available.\n\n   f. Add the current voucher's cost to these minimal costs (if any) and update the global answer.\n\n3. After checking all vouchers, return the minimal total cost found, or -1 if none.\n\nNow, the key steps are:\n\n- Grouping vouchers by duration. Since durations can be up to 2e5 (since ri can be up to 2e5, and li as low as 1, so duration can be up to 2e5).\n\n- For each duration, building the sorted lists and the prefix/suffix minima.\n\nBut how to handle the binary searches?\n\nFor example, for the end-sorted list of target_d vouchers, sorted by their end time. Let's say we have a list ends_sorted, which is sorted in increasing order. For a given li, we need to find the maximum end time in ends_sorted that is less than li. So we can perform a binary search to find the insertion point of li in ends_sorted, then subtract 1. If that index is >=0, then the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for the start-sorted list (sorted by li), we need to find the first start time that is greater than ri. For that, we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point of ri, and then all elements from that index onwards have start time > ri. Then, the suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to build the prefix and suffix arrays?\n\nFor the end-sorted list, which is sorted in increasing order of end time. For each index i in the list, prefix_min[i] is the minimum of the first i+1 elements (since the list is 0-based). So for example, if the list is [v1, v2, v3], sorted by end time, then prefix_min[0] = v1.cost, prefix_min[1] = min(v1.cost, v2.cost), etc.\n\nFor the start-sorted list, sorted in increasing order of start time. The suffix_min array is built such that suffix_min[i] is the minimum of the elements from i to the end. So for the list [v1, v2, v3], suffix_min[0] = min(v1.cost, v2.cost, v3.cost), suffix_min[1] = min(v2.cost, v3.cost), etc.\n\nOnce these arrays are built, during the binary search steps, we can quickly get the minima.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, grouping vouchers by duration. We can use a dictionary, say duration_dict, where keys are durations, and values are lists of vouchers.\n\nThen, for each duration d in duration_dict, we process the list of vouchers. For each such list, we create:\n\n- ends_sorted: list of vouchers sorted by their end time (ri). Then, create prefix_min array.\n\n- starts_sorted: list of vouchers sorted by their start time (li). Then, create suffix_min array.\n\nBut how to sort them? For ends_sorted, sort by ri. For starts_sorted, sort by li.\n\nOnce these are done, for each voucher i, we can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, for each voucher i, with duration d, target_d = x - d. So, if target_d is not present in duration_dict, then no possible pairs. Otherwise, we check the two possibilities.\n\nLet me think about an example. Take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration is 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nSo x is 5. For the first voucher (d=3), target_d is 5-3=2. So looking for vouchers with duration 2.\n\nIn the duration_dict for d=2, there are three vouchers. Let's process them.\n\nFor the ends_sorted list, sorted by ri. The vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 2: li=1, ri=2, cost 5\n\nvoucher 4: li=1, ri=2, cost 4\n\nvoucher 3: li=5, ri=6, cost 1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher 2: ri is 2.\n\nvoucher 4: ri is 2.\n\nvoucher 3: ri is 6. So sorted by ri, the ends_sorted list would be [voucher2, voucher4, voucher3]. Wait, but voucher2 and 4 have same ri. How to sort them? Well, the actual order may not matter as long as they are sorted by ri. So for ends_sorted, we can sort by ri, and if equal, any order.\n\nThe prefix_min array for ends_sorted would be [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4,1)=1].\n\nSo for voucher i (the first voucher with li=1, ri=3, duration 3). We need to find vouchers in target_d=2 that end before li=1. Since li is 1, vouchers must end before 1. The ends_sorted list has vouchers with ri=2, 2, 6. So none of them end before 1. So this case gives nothing.\n\nThen, check the other case: vouchers in target_d=2 that start after ri of voucher i. The voucher i's ri is 3. So we need vouchers with li > 3. Looking at the starts_sorted list for target_d=2. The starts_sorted list is sorted by li. The vouchers are voucher2 (li=1), voucher4 (li=1), voucher3 (li=5). So sorted by li, the list is [voucher2, voucher4, voucher3]. The suffix_min array would be [min(5,4,1)=1, min(4,1)=1, 1].\n\nWe need to find the first voucher in starts_sorted where li > 3. The ri of voucher i is 3. So looking for li_j > 3. The starts_sorted list is [1,1,5]. Using bisect_right for 3 in [1,1,5], the insertion point is 2. So from index 2 onwards, which is voucher3. The suffix_min from index 2 is 1. So the minimal cost is 1. Adding to voucher i's cost (4) gives 5, which is the correct answer.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing the grouping and pre-processing.\n\nBut first, for each voucher, compute duration. Then group by duration.\n\nThen, for each duration group, process the ends_sorted and starts_sorted lists, and compute prefix and suffix minima.\n\nNow, for the binary search part, in Python, we can use the bisect module.\n\nLet's think about how to implement the ends_sorted and starts_sorted.\n\nFor ends_sorted:\n\nEach entry is a voucher. But to sort by ri, we can sort the list of vouchers with key=lambda v: v.ri.\n\nSimilarly, starts_sorted is sorted by li.\n\nOnce sorted, for the ends_sorted list, we can create a list of ri's, and a prefix_min array. For example, for the ends_sorted list, we can have a list ends = [v.ri for v in ends_sorted], and prefix_min = [ ... ].\n\nWait, but for the binary search, we need to search in the ends list. So for the ends_sorted list, we can have a list of the end times, sorted. Then, when we want to find the latest end time <= li-1, we can do a bisect_right on ends list for li-1. The index gives the insertion point, so the number of elements <= li-1 is the index. So if the index is 0, there are no elements. Else, the prefix_min[index-1] is the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly for starts_sorted list. The start times are sorted, and we need to find the first start time > ri. So for the starts_sorted list, we can create a list starts = [v.li for v in starts_sorted]. Then, using bisect_right for ri, the insertion point gives the first element > ri. All elements from that index onwards have li_j > ri. Then, the suffix_min array for that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSo, the steps for each voucher i:\n\nCompute d = ri - li + 1.\n\ntarget_d = x - d.\n\nIf target_d < 0: skip.\n\nCheck if target_d is present in duration_dict. If not, skip.\n\nElse:\n\nFor the target_d group, get the ends_sorted list and starts_sorted list, along with their prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nCase 1: Find vouchers in target_d that end before li (i.e., ri_j < li). So, the end time must be <= li - 1.\n\nWe perform a bisect_right on the ends list of target_d's ends_sorted list for (li - 1). Let's call this index 'pos'. If pos > 0, then the minimal cost is prefix_min[pos - 1].\n\nCase 2: Find vouchers in target_d that start after ri (i.e., li_j > ri). So, perform a bisect_right on the starts list of target_d's starts_sorted list for ri. Let's call this 'pos'. If pos < len(starts), then the minimal cost is suffix_min[pos].\n\nSo for each of these cases, if there is a valid value, we add the current voucher's cost to it and consider it as a candidate for the overall minimum.\n\nNow, how to handle the prefix and suffix minima arrays.\n\nFor example, for ends_sorted list, which is sorted by ri, the prefix_min array is built as follows:\n\nprefix_min[0] = ends_sorted[0].cost.\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], ends_sorted[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for the starts_sorted list, the suffix_min array is built as follows:\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = starts_sorted[-1].cost.\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(starts_sorted[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1])\n\nSo, for the starts_sorted list, the suffix_min array is computed from the end to the beginning.\n\nOnce all these are preprocessed, for each voucher, we can perform these steps.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n vouchers. For each, compute duration.\n\nGroup the vouchers by duration. For example, using a defaultdict(list), where the key is the duration.\n\nThen, for each duration d in the groups, process:\n\nSort the list of vouchers for ends_sorted (sorted by ri), and create a list of end_times and prefix_min array.\n\nSimilarly, sort the list of vouchers for starts_sorted (sorted by li), and create a list of start_times and suffix_min array.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher in the original list, check for target_d.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nBut how to represent the vouchers? Maybe as tuples (li, ri, cost).\n\nBut during grouping, for each duration, we have a list of vouchers. Then, for each group, we process:\n\nends_sorted = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v[1]) # since ri is the second element.\n\nstarts_sorted = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v[0]) # li is first element.\n\nThen, for ends_sorted, create end_times = [v[1] for v in ends_sorted], and prefix_min array.\n\nSimilarly for starts_sorted, create start_times = [v[0] for v in starts_sorted], and suffix_min array.\n\nBut how to compute the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nFor example, for ends_sorted:\n\nprefix_min = [0] * len(ends_sorted)\n\nprefix_min[0] = ends_sorted[0][2]\n\nfor i in 1 to len(ends_sorted)-1:\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], ends_sorted[i][2])\n\nSimilarly for the suffix_min array for starts_sorted:\n\nsuffix_min = [0] * len(starts_sorted)\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = starts_sorted[-1][2]\n\nfor i in range(len(starts_sorted)-2, -1, -1):\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(starts_sorted[i][2], suffix_min[i+1])\n\nOnce that is done, during the processing of each voucher, we can perform the steps.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nWhat if x is zero? Well, according to the input constraints, x is at least 2. Wait, the input says x is between 2 and 2e5. Wait, the problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105)\n\nSo x is at least 2. So target_d can be zero? No, because for a voucher, duration is ri - li + 1, which is at least 1. So for x - d to be a valid duration, x must be at least 2, and d can be up to x-1. But if x is 2, then target_d can be 1 (if d is 1) or 1 (if d is 1 again). So that's okay.\n\nAnother edge case: when two vouchers have durations adding to x, but overlapping. So they are not considered.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut for handling the groups, perhaps for each duration, we can precompute the ends_sorted and starts_sorted lists, along with their prefix and suffix arrays.\n\nBut how to store them? For example, for each duration d, we can have:\n\n- ends_sorted_list: list of vouchers sorted by ri.\n\n- ends_prefix_min: list of minima.\n\nSimilarly for starts_sorted_list and starts_suffix_min.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nimport bisect\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nvouchers = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    l, r, cost = map(int, input().split())\n\n    duration = r - l + 1\n\n    vouchers.append( (l, r, cost, duration) )\n\nThen, group by duration.\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor l, r, cost, d in vouchers:\n\n    duration_dict[d].append( (l, r, cost) )\n\nThen, for each duration d in duration_dict, process:\n\nprecompute ends_sorted, ends_prefix_min, starts_sorted, starts_suffix_min.\n\nWe can store this in another dictionary, say preprocessed = {d: (ends_list, ends_prefix, starts_list, starts_suffix)}.\n\nBut for code efficiency, perhaps for each duration d, we can process and store these structures.\n\nOnce that is done, then for each voucher in the original list, process as follows:\n\nInitialize the answer as infinity.\n\nfor l_i, r_i, cost_i, d_i in vouchers:\n\n    target_d = x - d_i\n\n    if target_d < 1:\n\n        continue  # since duration can't be zero or negative.\n\n    if target_d not in duration_dict:\n\n        continue\n\n    # Now process the target_d group.\n\n    # Get the preprocessed data for target_d.\n\n    ends_list, ends_prefix, starts_list, starts_suffix = preprocessed[target_d]\n\n    # Case 1: find vouchers in target_d that end before l_i.\n\n    # ends_list is sorted by ri. So end_times is [v[1] for v in ends_list]\n\n    # So for the ends_list, we can have a list of end times.\n\n    # Wait, perhaps during preprocessing, we can store the end_times and start_times.\n\n    # Alternatively, during preprocessing, for each duration, we can store:\n\n    # ends_sorted: list of (r, cost), sorted by r?\n\n    # Maybe better to precompute the end_times and start_times.\n\n    # Let me adjust the preprocessing.\n\n    # For each duration d in duration_dict:\n\n    # process the list of vouchers for that duration.\n\n    # For ends_sorted:\n\n    # sort by ri (voucher[1])\n\n    # create end_times = [v[1] for v in ends_sorted]\n\n    # create prefix_min array.\n\n    # Similarly for starts_sorted.\n\nSo during preprocessing, for each duration d:\n\nvouchers_in_d = duration_dict[d]\n\nends_sorted = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda v: v[1])\n\nend_times = [v[1] for v in ends_sorted]\n\nprefix_min = [0]*len(ends_sorted)\n\nprefix_min[0] = ends_sorted[0][2]\n\nfor i in range(1, len(ends_sorted)):\n\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], ends_sorted[i][2])\n\nstarts_sorted = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda v: v[0])\n\nstart_times = [v[0] for v in starts_sorted]\n\nsuffix_min = [0]*len(starts_sorted)\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = starts_sorted[-1][2]\n\nfor i in range(len(starts_sorted)-2, -1, -1):\n\n    suffix_min[i] = min(starts_sorted[i][2], suffix_min[i+1])\n\nThen, store for duration d, the end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min.\n\nSo, during preprocessing, for each duration, we can store these four arrays.\n\nSo, the preprocessed data for each d is:\n\npreprocessed[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n\nBut how to store this?

So bisect_right returns the insertion point for r_i. All elements after that index have start_time > r_i. So the suffix_min[pos] is the minimal cost in that range.\n\nSo yes.\n\nNow, the code for this part.\n\nBut note that for the case where the target_d is the same as d_i. For example, if x is 4, and a voucher has duration 2, then target_d is 2. So when checking for vouchers j in target_d, we need to make sure that j is not the same voucher as i. Because the problem says i != j.\n\nBut wait, how is that handled? For example, if a voucher i is in the target_d group, and during processing, we find that there's a voucher j in the same group. But during the processing of voucher i, when looking for vouchers j in target_d group, including itself?\n\nBecause in the code above, when we process voucher i, we check for all vouchers in target_d group, including possibly voucher i itself. However, since the problem requires that i and j are different vouchers, we need to make sure that in such cases, the voucher j is not the same as i.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, suppose there is only one voucher in the target_d group, which is voucher i itself. Then, when processing voucher i, during case 1 or 2, the code would find that voucher i is in the group, but we can't select it as j.\n\nSo this is a problem. How to avoid selecting the same voucher twice?\n\nThis is a critical point. Because in the current code, when we have a voucher i and target_d is same as d_i, the code could select voucher i itself as j, which is invalid.\n\nSo how to handle this?\n\nHmm. Let me think. For example, suppose a voucher i has duration d, and target_d is also d. So when processing voucher i, we look into the target_d group (which includes voucher i). But when we find the minimal cost in that group, it could be voucher i itself. In that case, we need to make sure that there is another voucher in that group.\n\nSo, how to check for that?\n\nOne approach is, during the processing of voucher i, when looking for vouchers j in target_d group, we need to ensure that j is not the same voucher as i. However, this complicates the code, because during the binary search steps, we can't know whether the voucher found is the same as i.\n\nAn alternative approach is to allow the code to consider voucher i as a candidate, but then check if there are at least two vouchers in the target_d group. However, this is not sufficient. For example, if the target_d group has only one voucher, which is i itself, then even if the code finds it, it's invalid.\n\nSo the problem is that when the target_d group includes voucher i, during the processing of voucher i, the code may include voucher i as a possible j, but that's not allowed.\n\nSo how to handle this?\n\nOne possible solution is to, when processing voucher i, during the case where target_d == d_i, to check whether the voucher i is present in the group and ensure that there is another voucher in the group.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration group, we can store all vouchers, and during the binary search steps, when checking for vouchers in the target_d group, we need to exclude voucher i itself.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems complicated. For example, during the case where we are looking for vouchers that end before l_i, and the voucher i is in the target_d group, and it happens that it ends before l_i (but that's impossible, since voucher i's end is r_i, and l_i is the start of voucher i. So r_i >= l_i, so voucher i can't end before l_i. So in case 1, voucher i is not considered. Similarly, in case 2, voucher i's start is l_i. So for case 2, the code looks for vouchers starting after r_i. Voucher i's start is l_i, which is <= r_i, so voucher i is not in the case 2.\n\nWait, that's interesting. Because for case 1, the vouchers are those that end before l_i. Since voucher i's end is r_i >= l_i (since l_i <= r_i), voucher i cannot be in case 1. Similarly, for case 2, the vouchers are those that start after r_i. Voucher i's start is l_i, which is <= r_i, so voucher i cannot be in case 2.\n\nTherefore, during the processing of voucher i, when looking for vouchers j in target_d group, the j can't be the same as i. Because voucher i's end is r_i >= l_i, so it can't be in case 1. And voucher i's start is l_i <= r_i, so can't be in case 2. Therefore, the code is safe. Because during case 1 and 2, the vouchers j are not voucher i itself.\n\nTherefore, there's no need to worry about duplicate vouchers here. Because when processing voucher i, the case 1 and 2 will not include voucher i itself.\n\nThat's a relief. Because that means that during the processing of voucher i, when looking for vouchers j in target_d group, the code will not include voucher i itself. Because voucher i can't be in the case 1 or case 2. Therefore, the code is safe.\n\nSo no need to handle that case.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nNow, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=4, x=5.\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration 3.\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2.\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2.\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2.\n\nSo during processing the first voucher (d=3, target_d=5-3=2). The target_d is 2. The preprocessed data for target_d=2 is:\n\nends_sorted is vouchers with duration 2. Which are the second, third, fourth vouchers? Wait, the vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher 2: l=1, r=2 → duration 2.\n\nvoucher 3: l=5, r=6 → duration 2.\n\nvoucher 4: l=1, r=2 → duration 2.\n\nSo ends_sorted is sorted by r. All have r=2, 2, 6. So the end_times list is [2,2,6], and the prefix_min is [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4,1)=1].\n\nCase 1: for voucher i with l_i=1. We look for end_times <= l_i -1 = 0. The bisect_right returns 0, so no elements. So case1 is skipped.\n\nCase 2: for voucher i's r_i=3. Looking for start_times > 3. The start_times for target_d=2 are [1,1,5]. The bisect_right of 3 in [1,1,5] is 2. So pos=2. The suffix_min[pos] is suffix_min[2] = 1. So adding 4 + 1 =5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, what about the third voucher (l=5, r=6, cost=1, duration 2). target_d is x - 2 = 5-2=3. So looking for vouchers with duration 3. There is one voucher (the first one).\n\nProcessing that voucher. For case 1: find vouchers in target_d=3 that end before l_i=5. The voucher has duration 3, which is the first voucher: l=1, r=3. So end_times for target_d=3 is [3]. So bisect_right for 5-1=4. end_times is [3], bisect_right returns 1. pos>0, so prefix_min[0] is 4. So case1: 1 + 4 =5. Which is the same as before.\n\nSo the code would find this as well.\n\nSo the code will find both possibilities, and the minimal is 5.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, let's think about the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3 2\n\n4 6 3 → duration 3.\n\n2 4 1 → duration 3.\n\n3 5 4 → duration 3.\n\nx is 2. So for each voucher, duration is 3. target_d = 2 - 3 = -1. So all vouchers have target_d negative. Hence, no possible pairs. Output is -1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about a case where two vouchers have the same duration and can be paired?\n\nFor example, n=2, x=4. Each voucher has duration 2. So target_d is 2. For each voucher, during processing, case 1 and 2.\n\nLet's say voucher 1: l=1, r=2, cost 10. voucher 2: l=3, r=4, cost 20.\n\nFor voucher 1, target_d is 2. Check the target_d group (which contains both vouchers).\n\nCase 1: find vouchers ending before l_i=1. None. case2: find vouchers starting after r_i=2. The start_times are [1,3]. bisect_right for 2 returns 1. suffix_min[1] is 20. So total is 10 + 20 =30.\n\nFor voucher 2, case1: find vouchers ending before l_i=3. The end_times are [2,4]. bisect_right for 3-1=2. The end_times is [2,4]. bisect_right(2) returns 1. So prefix_min[0] is 10. So total is 20 + 10 =30. So the minimal is 30.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code would find that.\n\nAnother case where a voucher is in both cases. For example, if there are two vouchers with duration 2 and x=4. One voucher starts at 1 and ends at 2, another starts at 3 and ends at 4. So the code finds both possibilities.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling the preprocessed data correctly.\n\n- Handling the case where target_d is zero (but x is at least 2, and d_i is at least 1, so target_d can be zero only if x=1, which is not possible. So no.)\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nImplementing the code.\n\nBut first, note that in the original vouchers list, we stored (l, r, cost, duration). But during grouping, we stored (l, r, cost) in the duration_dict.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append( (l, r, cost, duration) )\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to help Leha choose two non-overlapping travel vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches his vacation length, and the total cost is minimized. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently checking pairs of vouchers whose durations sum up to the required vacation length.\n2. **Preprocess Data**: For each duration, preprocess the vouchers into two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by the end date (`ri`), used to find vouchers ending before a given start date.\n   - Another sorted by the start date (`li`), used to find vouchers starting after a given end date.\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: Use binary search on the preprocessed lists to quickly find the minimum cost of valid vouchers that meet the non-overlapping criteria.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost, duration))\n\n    # Group vouchers by their duration\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, cost, d in vouchers:\n        duration_dict[d].append((l, r, cost))\n\n    # Preprocess each duration's data\n    preprocessed = {}\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        vouchers_in_d = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process ends_sorted\n        ends_sorted = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda v: v[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in ends_sorted]\n        prefix_min = [0] * len(ends_sorted)\n        prefix_min[0] = ends_sorted[0][2]\n        for i in range(1, len(ends_sorted)):\n            prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], ends_sorted[i][2])\n        # Process starts_sorted\n        starts_sorted = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda v: v[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in starts_sorted]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(starts_sorted)\n        suffix_min[-1] = starts_sorted[-1][2]\n        for i in range(len(starts_sorted)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min[i] = min(starts_sorted[i][2], suffix_min[i+1])\n        # Save to preprocessed\n        preprocessed[d] = (end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min)\n\n    min_total = float('inf')\n\n    for l_i, r_i, cost_i, d_i in vouchers:\n        target_d = x - d_i\n        if target_d < 1:\n            continue\n        if target_d not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        end_times, prefix_min, start_times, suffix_min = preprocessed[target_d]\n        # Case 1: find vouchers ending before l_i\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, l_i - 1)\n        if pos > 0:\n            current_min = prefix_min[pos - 1]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost_i + current_min)\n        # Case 2: find vouchers starting after r_i\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(start_times, r_i)\n        if pos < len(start_times):\n            current_min = suffix_min[pos]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost_i + current_min)\n\n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each with its start date, end date, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary for efficient lookup.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end and start dates. Prefix and suffix minimum arrays are created to quickly determine the minimum cost of valid vouchers.\n4. **Binary Search for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with the complementary duration that does not overlap. Binary search is used to efficiently find these valid pairs and their minimum costs.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The minimum total cost of valid pairs is tracked and printed, or -1 if no valid pairs are found.",
