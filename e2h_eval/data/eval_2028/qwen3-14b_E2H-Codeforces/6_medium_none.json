Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers that don't overlap. The sum of their durations must be exactly x. And we need to find the minimal total cost of such a pair. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, understanding the voucher structure. Each voucher has li (departure day), ri (return day), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. So for two vouchers i and j, their durations must add up to x. Also, they must not overlap. That means either the first ends before the second starts, or vice versa.\n\nThe challenge is to find all possible pairs of vouchers that meet these conditions and find the minimum sum of their costs.\n\nConstraints: n can be up to 2e5, which is 200,000. So O(n^2) approaches are out of the question. We need an efficient solution, probably O(n log n) or O(n) with some preprocessing.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFor each voucher, let's compute its duration. Let's say the duration is d. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we need another voucher with duration (x - d). And these two vouchers must not overlap.\n\nSo, the idea is to split the problem into two parts: for each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with duration (x - d), and that they don't overlap. But how to do this efficiently?\n\nBut even then, for each voucher, checking all vouchers with the required duration would be O(n^2) in worst case. So we need a way to find the minimum cost of vouchers that have a certain duration and meet the non-overlapping condition.\n\nSo perhaps we can group vouchers by their duration. For example, create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we look for vouchers with duration (x - d), and check if there's a voucher in that group that doesn't overlap with it.\n\nBut even so, for each voucher, how do we find the minimal cost voucher in the other group that doesn't overlap with it?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a voucher A with duration d. We need a voucher B with duration (x - d). Let's say that d is such that x - d is positive. Also, x must be at least 2 (since each voucher has duration at least 1, but the problem says x can be as low as 2? Wait, the input constraints for x is 2 ≤ x ≤ 2e5. So yes, x is at least 2. So for each voucher, if its duration is d, then x -d must be ≥1. So for example, if x is 5, and a voucher has duration 3, then we need another voucher with duration 2.\n\nBut how to find for voucher A, a voucher B with duration (x -d) that doesn't overlap with A.\n\nBut for each voucher A, we need to find the minimal cost voucher B in the group of duration (x -d) that either ends before A starts, or starts after A ends.\n\nSo, for each voucher A, we can check two possibilities:\n\n1. Find a voucher B with duration (x -d) that ends before A's start (i.e., B.ri < A.li)\n2. Find a voucher B with duration (x -d) that starts after A's end (i.e., B.li > A.ri)\n\nFor each of these cases, we need the minimal cost of such B's.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each voucher A, find the minimal cost of vouchers in the (x -d) group that are before A, and the minimal cost of vouchers in the (x -d) group that are after A. Then take the minimum between those two (if they exist) and add to A's cost.\n\nBut how to efficiently find these minima?\n\nLet me think. For each duration, we can pre-process the vouchers in that duration group. For example, for a group of vouchers with duration t, we can sort them by their ri (end time) and also by their li (start time). Then, for a given voucher A, when looking for vouchers in the t group that end before A's start, we can perform a binary search on the sorted list of end times to find all vouchers with ri < A's li. Among those, we need the minimal cost. Similarly, for vouchers that start after A's end, we can sort them by li and find the minimal cost.\n\nWait, but how do we store the minimal cost for these ranges?\n\nAn alternative approach: For each duration t, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by end time (ri), and for each position in this list, we can keep track of the minimum cost up to that point. This way, when we want to find the minimum cost of vouchers with ri < some value, we can binary search to find the largest ri less than the target, and then get the min cost up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, another sorted list sorted by start time (li), and for each position, keep track of the minimum cost from that index onwards. Or perhaps for the second case, when looking for vouchers with li > A's ri, we can sort the vouchers by li, and then find the first li that is greater than A's ri, and then find the minimum cost in that suffix.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration t, we can precompute two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of (ri, cost) sorted by ri. And for this list, a prefix minimum array. So that for any query \"find the minimum cost of vouchers with ri < X\", we can binary search to find the rightmost ri < X, and then take the prefix min up to that index.\n\n- A sorted list of (li, cost) sorted by li. And for this list, a suffix minimum array. So that for any query \"find the minimum cost of vouchers with li > X\", we can binary search to find the first li > X, and then take the suffix min from that index onwards.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each duration t, we have two sorted lists:\n\n   a. Sorted by end time (ri), and a prefix min array of costs.\n\n   b. Sorted by start time (li), and a suffix min array of costs.\n\n   For example, for duration t, we can have:\n\n   - list_ri_sorted: sorted by ri, and prefix_min_ri where prefix_min_ri[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 elements.\n\n   - list_li_sorted: sorted by li, and suffix_min_li where suffix_min_li[i] is the minimum cost from i-th element to end.\n\n   These structures allow us to quickly find the minimum cost in the required ranges.\n\n2. For each voucher A with duration d, check if x - d is a valid duration (i.e., exists in our duration groups). Let's call the target duration as t = x - d.\n\n   If t is not present, then skip this voucher.\n\n   Else, for this t, we need to find:\n\n   a. The minimum cost of vouchers in t's group that end before A's li.\n\n      How? For the list_ri_sorted of t's group, find the largest ri that is < A's li. Then, the prefix_min_ri up to that index gives the minimum cost.\n\n   b. The minimum cost of vouchers in t's group that start after A's ri.\n\n      How? For the list_li_sorted of t's group, find the first li that is > A's ri. Then, the suffix_min_li from that index gives the minimum cost.\n\n   Then, for each of these two possibilities, if they exist, we can add the current voucher's cost to the found minimum and consider it as a candidate for the overall answer.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into duration groups.\n\n- For each voucher, compute d = ri - li + 1.\n\n- For each voucher, check if x - d is a valid duration. If yes, then check for the two cases (before and after).\n\n- For each case, find the minimum cost in the corresponding group and update the global minimum.\n\nNow, the key is to implement this efficiently.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nFor each duration t, we can have:\n\n- A list of vouchers with duration t. For each such list, we sort them by ri, and build a prefix min array.\n\n   For example, for the sorted list of vouchers by ri, the prefix min array would be:\n\n   prefix_min[0] = cost[0]\n\n   prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], cost[i])\n\nSimilarly, for the list sorted by li, we sort them by li, and build a suffix min array:\n\n   suffix_min[-1] = cost[-1]\n\n   suffix_min[i] = min(cost[i], suffix_min[i+1])\n\nOnce these are built, for any query, we can do a binary search.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, process all vouchers into groups by duration.\n\nThen, for each group, sort the vouchers by ri, and create a prefix min array. Also, sort the same group by li, and create a suffix min array.\n\nBut wait, for the same group, when sorted by ri, the list can be used for the first case (vouchers ending before A's li). And when sorted by li, the list can be used for the second case (vouchers starting after A's ri).\n\nNow, for each voucher A with duration d, and target t = x - d:\n\n   if t is not in the groups, skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      for the group t:\n\n         case 1: find the minimum cost of vouchers in group t with ri < A's li.\n\n         case 2: find the minimum cost of vouchers in group t with li > A's ri.\n\n         if case 1 has a value, then candidate is cost_A + case1_val.\n\n         if case 2 has a value, then candidate is cost_A + case2_val.\n\n         update the global minimum accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle the case where there are multiple vouchers in the group t?\n\nNow, for case 1:\n\nWe have the list_ri_sorted for group t. Each element in this list is a voucher with duration t, sorted by ri. We can perform a binary search on this list to find the largest ri that is less than A's li. Once we find that index, the prefix min array up to that index gives the minimal cost in that part.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2:\n\nWe have the list_li_sorted for group t. Each element is sorted by li. We can binary search for the first li that is greater than A's ri. Then, the suffix min array from that index gives the minimal cost in that part.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nFor case 1, the list_ri_sorted is sorted in increasing order. So, for a given value X (A's li), we can use bisect_left to find the insertion point, which gives us the number of elements less than X. So, the index is insertion_point - 1. If insertion_point is 0, then there are no elements less than X. Otherwise, the prefix min array up to insertion_point - 1 is the minimum.\n\nFor example, list_ri = [2,3,5,7]. X is 4. bisect_left returns 2 (since 4 would be inserted between 3 and 5). So the elements less than X are 0..1. The prefix min up to index 1 is the min of the first two elements.\n\nFor case 2, the list_li_sorted is sorted in increasing order. We need to find the first element in the list with li > A's ri. So, using bisect_right to find the insertion point of A's ri, and then all elements from that index onwards have li > A's ri. Then, the suffix min array from that index gives the min cost.\n\nFor example, list_li = [1,3,5,7]. A's ri is 4. bisect_right returns 2 (since 4 would be inserted after 3 and before 5). So elements from index 2 onwards are 5,7. The suffix min array from index 2 is the min of those elements.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing the groups:\n\nWe can have a dictionary, say, duration_dict, where the keys are the durations, and the values are tuples of (sorted_ri_list, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li_list, suffix_min_li).\n\nBut how to build these.\n\nFor each duration t in duration_dict:\n\n   collect all vouchers with that duration.\n\n   sort them by ri, and build prefix_min_ri.\n\n   sort them by li, and build suffix_min_li.\n\nSo, for each group:\n\nsorted_ri = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nprefix_min_ri is an array where prefix_min_ri[i] = min(prefix_min_ri[i-1], sorted_ri[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for sorted_li = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.li)\n\nsuffix_min_li is an array where suffix_min_li[i] = min(sorted_li[i].cost, suffix_min_li[i+1])\n\nBut how to represent this in code.\n\nIn Python, for each group, we can precompute these arrays.\n\nNow, considering that each voucher is stored as a tuple (li, ri, cost), perhaps.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n lines of li, ri, cost.\n\nCompute for each voucher, its duration d = ri - li + 1.\n\nWe need to process all vouchers into the duration_dict.\n\nOnce that's done, for each duration t in the duration_dict, we process the sorted lists and precompute the prefix and suffix mins.\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher A in the original list:\n\n   d = duration of A.\n\n   t = x - d.\n\n   if t < 1, skip (since vouchers have duration >=1, so x -d must be at least 1. But since x is >=2, and d can be 1, then t could be x -d = 1, etc.)\n\n   if t is not in the duration_dict, continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      group = duration_dict[t]\n\n      process case 1 and case 2.\n\nNow, for case 1:\n\nWe need to find in group's sorted_ri list, the maximum ri < A's li.\n\nSo, for the sorted_ri list, which is sorted by ri, we can extract the list of ri's and perform a binary search.\n\nWait, but in the group's sorted_ri list, each element is a voucher. So perhaps we can extract a list of the ri's for binary search.\n\nAlternatively, we can use the bisect module on the list of vouchers sorted by ri, using their ri as the key.\n\nBut in Python, the bisect module works on a list, and you can pass a key function. Wait, no. The bisect module functions take a list and a value, and assume that the list is sorted in ascending order. So for example, if we have a list of vouchers sorted by ri, then the ri values are in order. So to find the insertion point for A's li, we can create a list of the ri values, and perform bisect_left on that.\n\nBut perhaps, for efficiency, we can precompute a list of ri's for the sorted_ri list.\n\nBut for each group, during preprocessing, we can generate a list of ri's, and a list of the costs, and the prefix_min array.\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of case 1, we can create a list of the ri's of the sorted_ri list, and then perform bisect.\n\nBut for each group, during preprocessing, perhaps we can have:\n\nsorted_ri = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v[1])  # assuming vouchers are stored as (li, ri, cost)\n\nThen, the ri_values = [v[1] for v in sorted_ri]\n\nSimilarly, the prefix_min_ri is built as follows:\n\nprefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_ri)\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_ri[0][2]\n\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_ri)-1:\n\n   prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_ri[i][2])\n\nSame for the sorted_li list.\n\nSo, for case 1, for the group's sorted_ri and ri_values, we can do:\n\nX = A's li (the start of voucher A)\n\nusing bisect.bisect_left(ri_values, X) gives us the insertion point. Let's call it pos.\n\nif pos == 0: no elements are less than X.\n\nelse: the maximum index is pos-1. The prefix_min_ri[pos-1] is the minimal cost in the first pos elements.\n\nSo, if pos > 0, then the minimal cost is prefix_min_ri[pos-1].\n\nSimilarly, for case 2:\n\ngroup's sorted_li list is sorted by li. So for each voucher in the group, their li is in order.\n\nWe need to find the first li in this list that is > A's ri.\n\nSo, X = A's ri.\n\nWe can use bisect.bisect_right on the li_values of the sorted_li list. Let's say the li_values is a list of the li's of the sorted_li vouchers.\n\nbisect.bisect_right(li_values, X) gives us the insertion point. All elements after that index have li > X.\n\nIf the insertion point is k, then the elements from k to end have li > X. If k is equal to len(li_values), then there are none.\n\nSo, if k < len(li_values), then the suffix_min_li[k] is the minimal cost in that range.\n\nSo, for the group's suffix_min_li array, we can have:\n\nsuffix_min_li is built such that suffix_min_li[i] is the minimum cost from i to end.\n\nThus, for the case 2, if k is within the list, then the minimal cost is suffix_min_li[k].\n\nSo, putting this together.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nImplementing this requires for each group, storing sorted_ri, ri_values, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li, li_values, suffix_min_li.\n\nBut how to manage this in Python.\n\nLet me outline the code.\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen, read all the vouchers into a list.\n\nThen, create a dictionary, say, duration_dict, which maps durations to a structure containing:\n\n- sorted_ri (list of vouchers sorted by ri)\n\n- ri_values (list of their ri's)\n\n- prefix_min_ri (list of min costs up to index i)\n\n- sorted_li (list of vouchers sorted by li)\n\n- li_values (list of their li's)\n\n- suffix_min_li (list of min costs from index i onwards)\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher in the original list:\n\n   d = ri - li + 1\n\n   t = x - d\n\n   if t < 1: continue\n\n   if t not in duration_dict: continue\n\n   group = duration_dict[t]\n\n   process case 1 and case 2.\n\n   For case 1:\n\n      X = voucher's li (the start of voucher A)\n\n      in group's ri_values, find the insertion point using bisect_left.\n\n      pos = bisect.bisect_left(group.ri_values, X)\n\n      if pos > 0:\n\n          min_cost_case1 = group.prefix_min_ri[pos-1]\n\n          total = voucher's cost + min_cost_case1\n\n          update the global answer.\n\n   For case 2:\n\n      X = voucher's ri (the end of voucher A)\n\n      in group's li_values, find insertion point using bisect_right.\n\n      k = bisect.bisect_right(group.li_values, X)\n\n      if k < len(group.li_values):\n\n          min_cost_case2 = group.suffix_min_li[k]\n\n          total = voucher's cost + min_cost_case2\n\n          update the global answer.\n\nNow, the problem is that the same voucher can be considered twice (for example, voucher A and voucher B, where B is in the group of t, and when processing voucher B, A may be considered again). However, since we are considering all possible pairs, and for each voucher A, checking for possible B's in the group, it's okay. Because when we process voucher A, we check for B's in the group of t. But when we process voucher B, we check for A's in the group of x - t (which would be d again). However, since the code checks for both cases (case 1 and case 2), it will find both pairs (A,B) and (B,A) if applicable. However, since we are looking for the minimal sum, it's okay to process both, but we need to avoid considering the same voucher twice. Wait, but the problem says that i != j. So, when processing voucher A, if the group t includes voucher A itself (if x -d is equal to d, i.e., x=2d), then we need to ensure that the voucher B is not the same as A.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because, suppose that a voucher A has duration d, and x = 2d. Then, t = x -d = d. So, the group t is the same as the group of voucher A. So, when processing voucher A, looking for vouchers in group t (which includes itself), we need to make sure that the voucher B is not the same as A. But how?\n\nThis is a critical point. Because, in the case where voucher A is in the group t, and we are looking for vouchers in the same group, we need to make sure that when we find the minimal cost, it's not the same voucher.\n\nSo, for example, if there is only one voucher in the group, then it's not allowed. But if there are multiple vouchers, then when looking for the minimal cost, we need to exclude the current voucher.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nThis complicates the approach. Because when the group t is the same as the group of voucher A's duration (i.e., when t = x -d = d, meaning x = 2d), then when we are looking for vouchers in group t, we need to find those that are not the same as voucher A.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nThis seems tricky. Because, for example, in the group t, when we are looking for vouchers that end before A's li, we need to find vouchers that are not A itself. However, if there are multiple vouchers in the group, the minimal cost could be from another voucher.\n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nOne approach is to pre-process the group's sorted_ri and sorted_li lists, and during the binary search, exclude the current voucher A if it's in the group.\n\nBut that seems complicated. How can we know whether the current voucher is part of the group?\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of voucher A, when t is the same as d (i.e., x = 2d), then when looking for vouchers in group t, we need to find vouchers that are not A itself.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose voucher A is in the group t. When we are processing voucher A, and looking for vouchers in group t, which includes voucher A. For case 1, when looking for vouchers that end before A's li, if voucher A is in the group, but its ri is >= A's li (since it's the same voucher), then it would not be included in the case 1. Similarly for case 2.\n\nWait, voucher A's ri is the end of the voucher. So, for case 1, we are looking for vouchers in group t that end before A's li. Since voucher A's ri is (for the same voucher) ri = A's ri. But A's li is the start of voucher A. So, for the same voucher, ri >= li. So, if voucher A is in group t, then when we check for case 1, which is vouchers with ri < A's li, then voucher A's ri is >= A's li (since ri >= li for any voucher). So, voucher A would not be included in case 1. Similarly, for case 2, which looks for vouchers with li > A's ri. The voucher A's li is <= A's ri (since li <= ri). So, voucher A's li is not > A's ri. So, in case 2, voucher A is not considered either. Therefore, even if the group t includes voucher A, when we process case 1 and case 2, we are not including voucher A in the candidates. Thus, the code would automatically exclude the same voucher.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose voucher A is in group t. When we look for vouchers in group t that end before A's li. The voucher A's ri is >= A's li (since ri >= li for all vouchers). So, the voucher A's ri is not less than A's li. Therefore, when we process case 1, the voucher A is not included. Similarly, for case 2, we are looking for vouchers in group t with li > A's ri. The voucher A's li is <= A's ri. So, voucher A's li is not > A's ri. Hence, voucher A is not included in case 2. Therefore, even if the group t contains voucher A, the code would not select it as a candidate. Therefore, the code is safe in that case. Thus, even if the same voucher is in the group, it's not considered as a possible B for voucher A.\n\nTherefore, this scenario is handled automatically. So, we don't need to worry about the same voucher being selected. Because when voucher A is in the group t, and we are looking for vouchers in group t, the code will not include voucher A in the case 1 or case 2.\n\nSo, the code can proceed without worrying about this case. Thus, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to code this.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nImplementing the duration_dict.\n\nIn Python, for each duration t, we can have:\n\nsorted_ri = sorted list of vouchers (each is (li, ri, cost)) sorted by ri.\n\nri_values = [v[1] for v in sorted_ri]\n\nprefix_min_ri = [ ... ] as discussed.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_li and suffix_min_li.\n\nSo, for each group in duration_dict, we can store these four things.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = list of tuples (li, ri, cost).\n\nThen, create duration_dict as a defaultdict(list), where each entry is a list of vouchers with that duration.\n\nfor voucher in vouchers:\n\n    d = voucher[1] - voucher[0] + 1\n\n    add to duration_dict[d] the voucher.\n\nOnce that is done, for each duration t in duration_dict, process the group:\n\nfor t in duration_dict:\n\n    group_vouchers = duration_dict[t]\n\n    sorted_ri = sorted(group_vouchers, key=lambda v: v[1])\n\n    ri_values = [v[1] for v in sorted_ri]\n\n    # compute prefix_min_ri\n\n    prefix_min_ri = [0]*len(sorted_ri)\n\n    prefix_min_ri[0] = sorted_ri[0][2]\n\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_ri)):\n\n        prefix_min_ri[i] = min(prefix_min_ri[i-1], sorted_ri[i][2])\n\n    # sorted_li is sorted by li\n\n    sorted_li = sorted(group_vouchers, key=lambda v: v[0])\n\n    li_values = [v[0] for v in sorted_li]\n\n    # compute suffix_min_li\n\n    suffix_min_li = [0]*len(sorted_li)\n\n    suffix_min_li[-1] = sorted_li[-1][2]\n\n    for i in range(len(sorted_li)-2, -1, -1):\n\n        suffix_min_li[i] = min(sorted_li[i][2], suffix_min_li[i+1])\n\n    # Now, store all this in duration_dict[t] as a tuple or a custom object.\n\nBut since Python's dictionaries can't hold complex structures, perhaps we can store for each duration t, a tuple of (sorted_ri, ri_values, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li, li_values, suffix_min_li).\n\nBut in Python, it's easier to create a separate data structure. So perhaps, for each duration t, we can store a dictionary entry with these components.\n\nBut for code clarity, perhaps we can create a helper structure. However, for code, perhaps we can store for each duration t, a tuple (sorted_ri, ri_values, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li, li_values, suffix_min_li).\n\nOnce that is done, then for each voucher in the original list:\n\n   d = voucher's duration.\n\n   t = x -d.\n\n   if t <1: continue.\n\n   if t not in duration_dict: continue.\n\n   group_data = duration_dict[t]\n\n   sorted_ri, ri_values, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li, li_values, suffix_min_li = group_data.\n\n   process case 1 and case 2.\n\nSo, for case 1:\n\nX = voucher's li (the start of voucher A)\n\npos = bisect.bisect_left(ri_values, X)\n\nif pos >0:\n\n   current_min = prefix_min_ri[pos-1]\n\n   total = voucher's cost + current_min\n\n   update the global answer.\n\nFor case 2:\n\nX = voucher's ri (the end of voucher A)\n\nk = bisect.bisect_right(li_values, X)\n\nif k < len(li_values):\n\n   current_min = suffix_min_li[k]\n\n   total = voucher's cost + current_min\n\n   update the global answer.\n\nNow, the initial value for the answer is set to infinity. After processing all vouchers, if the answer remains infinity, output -1, else output the answer.\n\nBut there's a possibility that for some vouchers, case 1 or case 2 may not find any valid vouchers. So, during processing, we need to check if the case is valid and then proceed.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 --> duration 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 --> duration 2\n\n5 6 1 --> duration 2\n\n1 2 4 --> duration 2\n\nSo x is 5. So for each voucher, check if x -d is valid.\n\nFor the first voucher (d=3), t=5-3=2. Check if there are vouchers with duration 2. Yes, three vouchers.\n\nProcessing case 1: find vouchers with duration 2 and ri < A's li (A's li is 1). The vouchers with duration 2 have ri of 2, 6, 2. So sorted_ri for duration 2 would be sorted by ri. Let's see:\n\nOriginal vouchers with duration 2 are:\n\nvoucher 2: li=1, ri=2, cost 5\n\nvoucher 4: li=1, ri=2, cost 4\n\nvoucher 3: li=5, ri=6, cost 1.\n\nWhen sorted by ri, the sorted_ri would be [ (1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1) ] ?\n\nNo, because their ri's are 2, 2, 6. So sorted by ri, they are ordered as [ (1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1) ] ?\n\nWait, no. When sorted by ri, the first two have ri=2, and the third has 6. So when sorted, they would be ordered by ri, and for same ri, the order depends on the rest. But for the purpose of prefix min, the order of same ri's doesn't matter as long as the prefix min is computed correctly.\n\nIn this case, the ri_values for duration 2 would be [2, 2, 6].\n\nSo, for voucher A (duration 3, li=1), case 1 is looking for vouchers in duration 2 with ri < 1. But the ri_values are 2, 2, 6. So bisect_left(ri_values, 1) returns 0. pos is 0, which is not >0, so case 1 is skipped.\n\nCase 2: looking for vouchers in duration 2 with li > A's ri (A's ri is 3). So X=3.\n\nThe li_values of duration 2's sorted_li is sorted by li. The vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 2: li=1, cost 5\n\nvoucher 4: li=1, cost 4\n\nvoucher 3: li=5, cost 1.\n\nsorted by li, the li_values are [1,1,5].\n\nbisect_right([1,1,5], 3) returns 2. Because 3 is inserted after the 1s and before 5. So k=2. len(li_values) is 3. So 2 <3. suffix_min_li[2] is 1. So case 2 gives 4 + 1 =5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo this is captured.\n\nAnother example: voucher 3 (duration 2, li=5, ri=6, cost 1). x=5, so t=5-2=3. Check if there are vouchers with duration 3. Yes, the first voucher.\n\nProcessing case 1: looking for vouchers with duration 3 (t=3) and ri < 5 (voucher 3's li is 5). The voucher with duration 3 is (1,3,4). Its ri is 3 <5. So case 1 would find this voucher. The cost is 4. So total is 1+4=5. Which is the same as before.\n\nSo the code would capture this.\n\nNow, the code needs to process all vouchers and find these possibilities.\n\nNow, code-wise, the steps are:\n\nImplement the above logic.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut first, note that in Python, for the bisect module, we need to import bisect.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nduration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n    d = ri - li + 1\n    duration_dict[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\n# Preprocess each duration group\nprocessed = dict()  # key: duration, value: (sorted_ri, ri_values, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li, li_values, suffix_min_li)\n\nfor d in duration_dict:\n    group = duration_dict[d]\n    # Process sorted_ri and prefix_min_ri\n    sorted_ri = sorted(group, key=lambda v: v[1])\n    ri_values = [v[1] for v in sorted_ri]\n    prefix_min_ri = [0]*len(sorted_ri)\n    prefix_min_ri[0] = sorted_ri[0][2]\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_ri)):\n        prefix_min_ri[i] = min(prefix_min_ri[i-1], sorted_ri[i][2])\n    # Process sorted_li and suffix_min_li\n    sorted_li = sorted(group, key=lambda v: v[0])\n    li_values = [v[0] for v in sorted_li]\n    suffix_min_li = [0]*len(sorted_li)\n    suffix_min_li[-1] = sorted_li[-1][2]\n    for i in range(len(sorted_li)-2, -1, -1):\n        suffix_min_li[i] = min( sorted_li[i][2], suffix_min_li[i+1] )\n    # Store in processed\n    processed[d] = (sorted_ri, ri_values, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li, li_values, suffix_min_li)\n\nmin_total = float('inf')\n\nfor li_A, ri_A, cost_A in vouchers:\n    d = ri_A - li_A + 1\n    t = x - d\n    if t < 1:\n        continue\n    if t not in processed:\n        continue\n    # Get the group data for t\n    sorted_ri, ri_values, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li, li_values, suffix_min_li = processed[t]\n    # Case 1: find vouchers in t with ri < li_A\n    X = li_A\n    pos = bisect.bisect_left(ri_values, X)\n    if pos > 0:\n        current_min = prefix_min_ri[pos-1]\n        total = cost_A + current_min\n        if total < min_total:\n            min_total = total\n    # Case 2: find vouchers in t with li > ri_A\n    X = ri_A\n    k = bisect.bisect_right(li_values, X)\n    if k < len(li_values):\n        current_min = suffix_min_li[k]\n        total = cost_A + current_min\n        if total < min_total:\n            min_total = total\n\nif min_total == float('inf'):\n    print(-1)\nelse:\n    print(min_total)\n\nWait, but in the code above, the processed dictionary is built using the duration_dict, which is a defaultdict(list). But in the code, for each d in duration_dict, we process it. However, the 'processed' is a normal dict, and for each d in duration_dict, we store the processed data.\n\nBut what if a duration is not present in processed? Well, the code checks if t is in processed, which is built from duration_dict. So it should be okay.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4\n\n1 2 5\n\n5 6 1\n\n1 2 4\n\nThe vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 0: (1,3,4) duration 3.\n\nvoucher 1: (1,2,5) duration 2.\n\nvoucher 2: (5,6,1) duration 2.\n\nvoucher 3: (1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly x days and their total cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently checking each voucher against potential candidates in preprocessed groups of vouchers with specific durations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This allows us to quickly access vouchers with specific durations when needed.\n2. **Preprocess Groups**: For each duration group, we sort the vouchers by their end time (ri) and start time (li). We also compute prefix minimum cost arrays for the sorted end times and suffix minimum cost arrays for the sorted start times. This helps in efficiently finding the minimum cost of non-overlapping vouchers.\n3. **Check Each Voucher**: For each voucher, determine if there exists another voucher with a complementary duration (x - duration). Using the preprocessed data, check for non-overlapping vouchers that can be paired with the current voucher and calculate the minimum cost for valid pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ri = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        cost = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        duration_dict[d].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    processed = dict()\n    \n    for d in duration_dict:\n        group = duration_dict[d]\n        # Process sorted_ri and prefix_min_ri\n        sorted_ri = sorted(group, key=lambda v: v[1])\n        ri_values = [v[1] for v in sorted_ri]\n        prefix_min_ri = [0] * len(sorted_ri)\n        prefix_min_ri[0] = sorted_ri[0][2]\n        for i in range(1, len(sorted_ri)):\n            prefix_min_ri[i] = min(prefix_min_ri[i-1], sorted_ri[i][2])\n        # Process sorted_li and suffix_min_li\n        sorted_li = sorted(group, key=lambda v: v[0])\n        li_values = [v[0] for v in sorted_li]\n        suffix_min_li = [0] * len(sorted_li)\n        suffix_min_li[-1] = sorted_li[-1][2]\n        for i in range(len(sorted_li)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min_li[i] = min(sorted_li[i][2], suffix_min_li[i+1])\n        # Store in processed\n        processed[d] = (sorted_ri, ri_values, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li, li_values, suffix_min_li)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for li_A, ri_A, cost_A in vouchers:\n        d = ri_A - li_A + 1\n        t = x - d\n        if t < 1:\n            continue\n        if t not in processed:\n            continue\n        # Get the group data for t\n        sorted_ri, ri_values, prefix_min_ri, sorted_li, li_values, suffix_min_li = processed[t]\n        # Case 1: find vouchers in t with ri < li_A\n        X = li_A\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(ri_values, X)\n        if pos > 0:\n            current_min = prefix_min_ri[pos-1]\n            total = cost_A + current_min\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n        # Case 2: find vouchers in t with li > ri_A\n        X = ri_A\n        k = bisect.bisect_right(li_values, X)\n        if k < len(li_values):\n            current_min = suffix_min_li[k]\n            total = cost_A + current_min\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate quick lookup.\n- **Preprocessing**: For each duration group, vouchers are sorted by their end and start times.
