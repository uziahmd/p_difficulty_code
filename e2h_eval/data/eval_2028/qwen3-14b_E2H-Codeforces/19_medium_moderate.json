The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts to remove in increasing order.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The districts form a tree since there's exactly one path between every pair. When we remove k districts, the remaining n - k districts must be connected. So the question is to choose which k districts to remove so that the remaining ones are connected and their total fans (sum of 2^i) is as large as possible.\n\nThe key here is that the sum of 2^i is maximized by keeping the districts with the largest possible i values. However, we can't just remove the k smallest districts because their removal might disconnect the tree. So we need to find a way to remove districts in a way that allows us to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nWait, but since the sum is 2^i, the higher the i, the more significant the contribution. So ideally, we want to keep the highest possible districts. But how to ensure connectivity?\n\nLet me think: The optimal strategy would be to keep the districts with the largest numbers possible, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. So perhaps we can model this as choosing a subtree with n - k nodes, which includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to remove? Since the tree is connected, and we need to remove k nodes, but the remaining must be connected.\n\nAnother approach: Think of it as selecting a subtree with (n - k) nodes, and maximizing the sum of 2^i. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, the best way is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So the optimal solution would be to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, but only if they form a connected subtree. If not, then we need to remove some lower-numbered nodes to make the subtree connected.\n\nWait, but how to check if the largest (n -k) nodes form a connected subtree? Because if they do, then we can just remove the smallest k nodes. Otherwise, we need to find some way to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, possibly removing some lower ones that are blocking the connectivity.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to remove the k districts with the smallest numbers, but ensuring that the remaining districts are connected. However, that might not be possible. For example, if the tree is structured such that the highest-numbered node is isolated from the rest, but that's impossible because the tree is connected. Wait, no. The tree is connected, so all nodes are connected. So if we remove some nodes, but the remaining nodes must be connected.\n\nWait, but when you remove certain nodes, you could split the tree into multiple components. So the challenge is to select which k nodes to remove such that the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nSo, the idea is to find a subset of nodes S of size (n -k) that is connected, and has the maximum sum of 2^i. Since 2^i is strictly increasing with i, the maximum sum is achieved when S contains the largest possible nodes. However, the problem is that those nodes may not be connected. So we need to find the largest possible subset of nodes with the largest numbers that form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to find this subset?\n\nAn approach is to start with the largest node, then add the next largest nodes, ensuring that they are connected. But that seems vague.\n\nAnother way to think: The optimal set S must include the largest node, say node n. Then, we can build a subtree that includes node n and as many high-numbered nodes as possible. But how?\n\nThis sounds like a problem where we can use a priority queue (max-heap) approach. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to select which nodes to keep. Let's consider that we want to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So, the first step is to include node n. Then, for the next nodes, we need to include as many as possible, but connected to the existing set.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAnother thought: Since the tree is connected, and the sum is maximized by keeping the largest nodes, perhaps the optimal set is the subtree formed by the largest (n -k) nodes. However, this may not be connected. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of nodes to remove (from the lower-numbered ones) to connect the largest nodes.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, here's an idea: Let's imagine that we want to keep all nodes except the k smallest ones. But if that set is connected, then that's the answer. However, if not, then we need to find which nodes to remove from the lower-numbered ones to make the remaining nodes connected.\n\nBut how can we check if the set of nodes {n -k +1, ..., n} is connected? Well, maybe not. For example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\nn=6, k=3. So n -k = 3. The largest 3 nodes are 4,5,6. Are they connected? Let's see the tree structure.\n\nThe tree edges are:\n2-1\n2-6\n4-2\n5-6\n2-3\n\nSo the tree structure is:\n\nDistrict 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. District 6 is connected to 5. So the nodes 4,5,6: 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6. 6 is connected to 5. So 4,6,5 are connected through 2. But 4 is connected to 2, which is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So the set {4,5,6} is connected? No. Wait, 4 is connected to 2, but 2 is not in the set. So the set {4,5,6} is connected via 6-2-4? No, because 2 is not in the set. So the set {4,5,6} is not connected. 4 is connected to 2, but 2 is not in the set. So 4 is connected to 2, but 2 is not part of the set. Therefore, the nodes 4, 5, 6 are not connected. Because 4 is connected to 2, but 2 is not in the set. So the set {4,5,6} would have 4 connected to 2, but 2 is not in the set. So the nodes 4 and 6 are connected via 2, but 2 is not in the set. So the nodes 4 and 6 are not directly connected. So the set {4,5,6} is not connected. Hence, the sample solution removes districts 1,3,4. The remaining districts are 2,5,6. Which are connected via 2-6 and 2-5 (no, 5 is connected to 6). So 2 is connected to 6, which is connected to 5. So 2,5,6 are connected. So the sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100.\n\nSo in this case, the optimal solution is not the largest 3 nodes. So the initial idea of taking the largest nodes is not sufficient, because they may not be connected. Therefore, we need to find a way to select nodes that are connected, and as high as possible.\n\nHmm. So how to approach this?\n\nAlternative approach: We need to select a connected subtree of size (n -k), and maximize the sum of 2^i. Since 2^i is strictly increasing, this is equivalent to selecting the subset of (n -k) nodes with the highest possible values, while keeping them connected.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to selecting the subset of (n -k) nodes with the highest possible numbers, but connected. How can we find this subset?\n\nOne approach is to start with the largest node (node n), and then greedily add the next largest nodes that are connected to the current subset. But how to do this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as building a tree where we want to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible. For each node, we can decide whether to include it or not, based on whether it's connected to the existing set.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAnother idea: The optimal set will consist of the largest (n -k) nodes, but with some exceptions. For example, if some of these nodes are not connected, we need to remove some lower-numbered nodes that are acting as bridges between them.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to remove?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: We need to remove exactly k nodes. The optimal strategy is to remove the nodes with the smallest numbers, provided that the remaining nodes form a connected component. However, if removing the smallest nodes would disconnect the tree, we need to adjust.\n\nWait, but how to determine which nodes to remove?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding a connected subgraph with maximum sum, which can be approached using a priority queue. Here's an idea inspired by Krusky's algorithm:\n\nWe can model the problem as trying to select the nodes with the highest values, ensuring that the selected nodes form a connected subtree. To do this, we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the highest node, and include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to formalize this?\n\nAnother approach is to think of the problem as a graph where each node has a weight of 2^i, and we need to find a connected subtree of size (n -k) with maximum total weight. Since the weights are exponential, the optimal subtree must contain the highest possible nodes.\n\nSo, perhaps the way to do this is to perform a greedy selection of nodes, starting from the highest-numbered node, and then adding the next highest nodes that are connected to the current set.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Start with the highest-numbered node (n). This is our initial set S.\n\n2. We need to add (n -k -1) more nodes to S, ensuring that each added node is connected to the existing set.\n\n3. For each step, select the node with the highest possible value that is adjacent to the current set S. Add it to S, and repeat until S has (n -k) nodes.\n\nBut how to find which nodes are adjacent to the current set?\n\nThis seems like a BFS or Dijkstra-like approach. Since we want to add the highest possible nodes first, perhaps we can use a priority queue (max-heap) that stores the nodes not yet in S, but adjacent to S. At each step, we select the node with the highest value from the priority queue, add it to S, and then add its neighbors (not already in S or the queue) to the priority queue.\n\nWait, this sounds like Prim's algorithm for finding a minimum spanning tree, but instead of minimizing, we are maximizing the sum, and the selection is based on the highest possible nodes.\n\nLet me think again. The process would be:\n\n- Initially, S contains node n.\n\n- The priority queue contains all nodes adjacent to S (i.e., the neighbors of node n) that are not yet in S.\n\n- Then, we extract the maximum node from the priority queue, add it to S, and add its neighbors (not in S) to the queue.\n\n- Repeat until S has (n -k) nodes.\n\nThis way, we are greedily adding the highest possible nodes that are connected to the current set.\n\nThis approach should ensure that the selected nodes form a connected subtree and include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet's think about the data structures. We need to track which nodes are in the set S. For each node not in S, we need to know if it's adjacent to S. But since the tree is connected, once we add nodes to S, their neighbors can be considered for addition.\n\nThe priority queue can be a max-heap, which in Python can be implemented using a heap with negative values.\n\nBut since the tree is a graph, we need to process the nodes in such a way that we always select the highest possible node that is connected to the current set.\n\nYes, this seems promising.\n\nLet's take the first sample input:\n\nn=6, k=3. So we need to select 3 nodes.\n\nStart with S = {6}. The priority queue is the neighbors of 6: which are 2 and 5. The nodes are 2 and 5. The max is 5. Add 5 to S. Now S has {6,5}. The neighbors of 5 are 6 (already in S) and nothing else. Then, the neighbors of 6 (already in S) are 2, 4, etc. Now, the priority queue has the neighbors of 5 (none) and the neighbors of 6 (excluding those already in S). So the next candidates are 2 and 4 (since 6's neighbors are 2, 4, and 5 (but 5 is already in S). So the priority queue now includes 2 and 4. The max is 4. Add 4 to S. Now S has {6,5,4}, which is 3 nodes. So the nodes removed are 1, 2, 3. But according to the sample, the correct answer is to remove 1,3,4. Wait, but according to this approach, the selected nodes are 6,5,4. Which sum is 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 16+32+64= 112. But the sample says the maximum is 100. Wait, why is that?\n\nWait, the sample's output is removing districts 1,3,4, leaving districts 2,5,6. Their sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4+32+64= 100. But according to this approach, the selected nodes are 4,5,6, which sum to 16 +32 +64= 112. Which is larger. But why isn't this the correct answer?\n\nAh, this suggests that there's a mistake in my reasoning. Why does the sample output not match this?\n\nWait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nThe tree structure is:\n\nEdges are:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3\n\nSo the tree structure:\n\nDistrict 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3.\n\nDistrict 6 is connected to 2 and 5.\n\nSo when the algorithm starts with S = {6}, then adds 5 (max neighbor), then adds 4 (neighbor of 6). But is 4 connected to S?\n\nAt this point, S is {6,5}. Adding 4: 4 is connected to 2, which is not in S. So how is 4 connected to the current S?\n\nWait, the algorithm's logic is that the priority queue holds nodes that are adjacent to the current S. But when we add 4 to the queue, how is it adjacent to the current S?\n\nAh, here's the problem. The initial S is {6}. Its neighbors are 2 and 5. So the priority queue has 5 and 2. The next step is to take the max, which is 5. Add 5 to S. Now, the neighbors of 5 are 6 (already in S) and no others. Then, the next step is to look for nodes adjacent to S. The S is {6,5}. The neighbors of 5 are 6 (already in S). The neighbors of 6 are 2, 5 (in S), and 4. So the next nodes to add are 2 and 4. The priority queue now has 4 and 2. The max is 4. But 4 is connected to 2, which is not in S. How can 4 be adjacent to S? It's not. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAh, here's the mistake. The algorithm assumes that the nodes in the priority queue are adjacent to the current S. But in this case, 4 is not adjacent to S. Because S is {6,5}. The node 4 is connected to 2, which is not in S. So adding 4 to the priority queue is invalid. Because it's not adjacent to the current S.\n\nSo the algorithm's logic is wrong. How to correctly track which nodes are adjacent to the current S?\n\nThe correct approach is to maintain a set of nodes that are adjacent to the current S. When a node is added to S, its neighbors are added to the priority queue if they are not already in S or the queue.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is:\n\nWe can model this as a BFS where we start with the highest node, and then for each step, we select the highest available node that is adjacent to the current set. To track which nodes are adjacent, we can use a priority queue that contains nodes that are adjacent to the current set. Initially, the queue contains the neighbors of the starting node.\n\nEach time we add a node to the set S, we look at its neighbors. For any neighbor that is not in S, we add it to the priority queue if it hasn't been added before.\n\nSo, in the first example:\n\nStart with S = {6}. The priority queue has neighbors of 6: 2 and 5. Max is 5. Add 5 to S. Now, look at neighbors of 5: 6 (already in S). No new nodes added to the queue.\n\nNow, the queue has 2. Next, take 2 (the highest available). Add it to S. Now S is {6,5,2}. Now, the neighbors of 2 are 1, 6 (in S), 4, 3. These neighbors are 1,4,3. Add them to the priority queue.\n\nNow, the queue contains 1,4,3. The next highest is 4. Add 4 to S. Now, S has 4 nodes, which is more than n -k = 3. Wait, but n-k is 3, so we need to stop after adding 3 nodes. So the initial steps would be:\n\nStart with S size 1. Need to add 2 more nodes. First, add 5 (size 2). Then add 2 (size 3). So S is {6,5,2}. The sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100, which matches the sample. So the algorithm would select nodes 6,5,2. Therefore, the districts to remove are 1,3,4. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAh! So the problem was that the initial approach was adding 4 (which was not adjacent to the current S) but the correct approach is to add nodes that are adjacent to the current S. So the correct algorithm is:\n\nInitialize S with the highest node (n). The priority queue contains all the neighbors of this node. Then, while the size of S is less than (n -k), we extract the node with the highest value from the priority queue, add it to S, and add its neighbors (if not already in S or the queue) to the priority queue.\n\nThis way, each added node is adjacent to the current S, ensuring that the entire S remains connected.\n\nSo the algorithm works as follows:\n\n- The initial S is {n}.\n\n- The priority queue (max heap) is initialized with the neighbors of n.\n\n- For each step, we extract the maximum node from the priority queue, add it to S, and then add its neighbors (not in S) to the priority queue.\n\n- Repeat until S has (n -k) nodes.\n\nOnce we have S, the nodes to remove are all nodes not in S. Then, we sort them and output them.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nSo the steps for the code would be:\n\n1. Read the tree structure.\n\n2. Build an adjacency list.\n\n3. Initialize a priority queue (max heap) with the neighbors of node n.\n\n4. Keep track of visited nodes (those in S or in the priority queue).\n\nWait, but how to avoid adding the same node multiple times to the priority queue? Because if a node is already in the queue, adding it again would be redundant.\n\nBut since the priority queue is a max heap, and we want to process the highest nodes first, even if a node is added multiple times, the first occurrence (highest priority) will be processed first. However, to avoid processing the same node multiple times, we need to track whether a node is already in the priority queue or in S.\n\nSo, we need a visited array or set. When a node is added to the priority queue, we mark it as visited. Then, when processing, we check if it's already in S or not. Wait, no. The priority queue contains nodes that are adjacent to the current S. So, when we add a node to the priority queue, it's because it's adjacent to the current S. However, once it's added to the queue, we don't want to add it again.\n\nSo, the algorithm steps would be:\n\n- Create a boolean array 'in_set' to track if a node is in S.\n\n- Create a boolean array 'in_queue' to track if a node is in the priority queue.\n\n- Initialize in_set with False for all nodes, except the starting node (n) which is True.\n\n- Initialize the priority queue with the neighbors of n. For each neighbor, if not in_set, add to the queue and mark in_queue as True.\n\n- While the size of S is less than (n -k):\n\n   - Extract the max node from the priority queue.\n\n   - Add it to S (mark in_set as True).\n\n   - For each neighbor of this node:\n\n      - If not in_set and not in_queue:\n\n         - Add to the priority queue, mark in_queue as True.\n\nThis way, each node is added to the queue once. Because once it's added to the queue, it's marked as in_queue, and subsequent attempts to add it again are ignored.\n\nBut wait, the initial step is to add all neighbors of n to the queue. Then, when we add a node to S, we add their neighbors to the queue if not already in the queue or in S.\n\nThis ensures that the priority queue contains all nodes adjacent to the current S, and we process them in order of their value.\n\nIn the first sample, the process would be:\n\nStart with S = {6}, in_set[6] = True. The neighbors of 6 are 2 and 5. Add them to the priority queue. The queue has 5 and 2 (priority is max, so 5 is first).\n\nExtract 5, add to S. Now S has size 2. Check neighbors of 5 (6 is already in S, no others). No new nodes added to the queue.\n\nNext, the queue has 2. Extract 2, add to S. Now S has size 3, which is n -k (6-3=3). So we stop. The S is {6,5,2}. The nodes to remove are 1,3,4.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=4, k=1. So we need to select 3 nodes. Starting with node 4. Its neighbors are say 2 (assuming tree is 1-2-3-4). Then, the queue has 2. Extract 2, add to S. Now S has 4,2. Then, neighbors of 2 are 1 and 3. Add them to the queue. Next, extract 3 (higher than 1). Add to S. Now S has 4,2,3. So the nodes kept are 4,2,3. The removed is 1. Which is correct, as the sum is 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 = 4 +8 +16 = 28. If we had kept 4,3,1, but that would require 1 to be connected to 3. But in the tree, if it's 1-2-3-4, then 3 is connected to 2, and 1 is connected to 2. So if we remove 2, the remaining nodes 1,3,4 are disconnected. So the correct approach is to remove 1.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to work.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python efficiently.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 1e6, and for each node, we process it once. The priority queue operations are O(log n) per insertion and extraction. So overall, the time complexity is O(n log n), which is acceptable for n up to 1e6.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nFirst, read n and k.\n\nThen, read n-1 edges and build an adjacency list. Since the tree is undirected, each edge is added to both nodes' adjacency lists.\n\nThen, we need to perform the algorithm:\n\nInitialize in_set as a boolean array of size n+1 (since districts are numbered 1-based). in_set[i] is True if the node is in the selected set S.\n\nInitialize in_queue as a boolean array of size n+1.\n\nThe priority queue is a max-heap. In Python, the heapq module is a min-heap, so to simulate a max-heap, we can insert negative values.\n\nInitially, the starting node is n. Mark in_set[n] = True. Then, for all neighbors of n, if not in_set, add them to the priority queue, and mark in_queue as True.\n\nThen, while the size of S is less than (n -k):\n\n   Extract the max node from the priority queue (using heappop on the negative values).\n\n   Add it to S (mark in_set as True).\n\n   For each neighbor of this node:\n\n      if not in_set and not in_queue:\n\n         add to the priority queue (as negative value), and mark in_queue as True.\n\nOnce this is done, the nodes not in S are the ones to be removed. Collect them, sort them, and output.\n\nBut wait, what about the starting node? For example, in the first step, the starting node is n, which is in S. So the size of S starts at 1. We need to add (n -k -1) more nodes.\n\nBut in the code, the loop runs until len(S) reaches (n -k). So the loop condition is while len(S) < (n -k).\n\nNow, the problem is how to track the size of S. Since in_set is a boolean array, we can count the number of True entries. But for efficiency, perhaps we can track the count as we go.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ncount = 1 (starting with node n)\n\nwhile count < (n -k):\n\n   extract node u from heap.\n\n   add to S (mark in_set[u] = True)\n\n   count +=1\n\n   for each neighbor v of u:\n\n      if not in_set[v] and not in_queue[v]:\n\n         add to heap, mark in_queue[v] as True.\n\nThus, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, for the data structures:\n\nIn Python, for n up to 1e6, using lists for in_set and in_queue is feasible.\n\nImplementing the priority queue as a heap. Each time, we push the negative of the node's value, so that the smallest negative (i.e., largest node) is popped first.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor _ in range(n-1):\n\n   a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n   adj[a].append(b)\n\n   adj[b].append(a)\n\nInitialize in_set = [False]*(n+1)\n\nin_queue = [False]*(n+1)\n\nheap = []\n\nstart_node = n\n\nin_set[start_node] = True\n\ncount = 1\n\nfor neighbor in adj[start_node]:\n\n   if not in_set[neighbor] and not in_queue[neighbor]:\n\n      heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\n      in_queue[neighbor] = True\n\nThen, while count < (n -k):\n\n   if not heap:\n\n      break (but this shouldn't happen as the tree is connected)\n\n   current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n   in_set[current] = True\n\n   count +=1\n\n   for neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n      if not in_set[neighbor] and not in_queue[neighbor]:\n\n         heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\n         in_queue[neighbor] = True\n\nOnce this is done, collect all nodes not in in_set, sort them, and print them.\n\nBut wait, in the first step, when we add the neighbors of the start node, we need to check if they are already in the queue. But initially, the start node is in the set, and its neighbors are added to the queue if they are not in the set (which they aren't, since the start node is the only one in the set).\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting this code on the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=6, k=3. So n -k = 3.\n\nStart with node 6. in_set[6] = True. count =1.\n\nadj[6] is [2,5]. So for neighbor 2 and 5.\n\nCheck if they are in_set (no) and in_queue (no). Push -2 and -5 into the heap. in_queue[2] and in_queue[5] are True.\n\nHeap now contains [-5, -2], but heapq in Python is a min-heap. So the smallest negative (i.e., -5) is popped first. So the next step is to pop -5, which gives 5. Add to in_set. count becomes 2. Then check neighbors of 5. adj[5] is [6]. 6 is already in_set. So no new nodes added.\n\nHeap now has [-2].\n\nNext iteration: count is 2 < 3. Pop -2 (current is 2). Add to in_set. count is 3. Now, check neighbors of 2: 1, 6, 4, 3. For each neighbor:\n\nCheck if in_set and in_queue.\n\nFor 1: not in_set, not in_queue. Push -1 into heap. in_queue[1] = True.\n\nFor 6: in_set.\n\nFor 4: not in_set, not in_queue. Push -4. in_queue[4] = True.\n\nFor 3: not in_set, not in_queue. Push -3. in_queue[3] = True.\n\nNow, the heap contains -1, -3, -4. But the heap is a min-heap, so the next elements are ordered as per their values.\n\nBut since the loop stops here (count is 3, which is equal to n -k = 3), we exit.\n\nThe in_set array is True for 6,5,2.\n\nThe nodes not in in_set are 1,3,4. So sorted as 1 3 4. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is given:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n8 4\n\nEdges:\n\n2 6\n\n2 7\n\n7 8\n\n1 2\n\n3 1\n\n2 4\n\n7 5\n\nSample Output: 1 3 4 5.\n\nLet me see. n=8, k=4. So n -k =4.\n\nStart with node 8. adj[8] is [7]. So add 7 to the queue.\n\nProcessing:\n\ncount starts at 1 (node 8).\n\nHeap has -7.\n\nPop 7, add to set. count=2.\n\nCheck neighbors of 7: 2, 8 (in set), 5, etc. So for adj[7], which includes 2, 8, 5, and 7's other connections.\n\nWait, the edges for sample input 2 are:\n\nThe edges are:\n\n2 6\n\n2 7\n\n7 8\n\n1 2\n\n3 1\n\n2 4\n\n7 5\n\nSo the adjacency list for node 7 is [2,8,5, ... ? Let me recheck:\n\nThe edges:\n\nFor 7:\n\nIt's connected to 2, 8, 5, and possibly others?\n\nLooking at the input:\n\nThe edges are:\n\nFirst line: 2 6\n\nSecond: 2 7\n\nThird: 7 8\n\nFourth: 1 2\n\nFifth: 3 1\n\nSixth: 2 4\n\nSeventh: 7 5.\n\nSo for node 7, the edges are 2, 8, 5.\n\nSo adj[7] is [2,8,5].\n\nSo when node 7 is added to the set (count=2), its neighbors are 2, 8 (already in set?), 5.\n\nWait, when we added node 7 to the set, the previous step was:\n\nInitially, node 8 is in the set. Its neighbors are 7. So the queue starts with 7. Pop 7, add to set. Now, neighbors of 7 are 2, 8 (in set), 5. So for 2: not in set, not in queue. So add to queue. For 5: same.\n\nSo after adding 7, the queue has 2 and 5. Which are pushed into the heap as -2 and -5. The heap will have -5 and -2 (since heapq is min-heap, so the smallest is -5, which is 5). Next, the count is 2. Need to reach 4.\n\nNext, pop the max (5). Add to set. count=3. Now, neighbors of 5 are 7 (in set). So no new nodes.\n\nHeap now has -2.\n\nNext, pop 2. Add to set. count=4. Now, the neighbors of 2 are 6,7 (in set), 1,4, etc. So check each neighbor:\n\nFor 6: not in set, not in queue. Add to heap.\n\nFor 1: same. Add to heap.\n\nFor 4: same. Add to heap.\n\nSo the heap now contains -6, -1, -4. The next step is to stop since count is 4.\n\nThe set is {8,7,5,2}.\n\nThe nodes not in the set are 1,3,4,6. Wait, but the sample output is 1 3 4 5. Wait, no. Wait the sample output is for the second input, which is:\n\nInput:\n\n8 4\n\nedges as above.\n\nSample Output is 1 3 4 5.\n\nWait, according to our algorithm, the nodes kept are 8,7,5,2. So the nodes removed are 1,3,4,6. But the sample output is 1 3 4 5. So there's a discrepancy here. What's wrong?\n\nHmm, this suggests that there's a mistake in the algorithm. Let me re-examine the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=8, k=4. So we need to select 4 nodes.\n\nSample Output is 1 3 4 5. Which means the kept nodes are 2,6,7,8. Because the removed are 1,3,4,5. Let's compute their sum: 2^2 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 = 4 + 64 + 128 + 256 = 452.\n\nBut according to our algorithm, the kept nodes are 8,7,5,2. Their sum is 2^8 + 2^7 + 2^5 + 2^2 = 256 + 128 + 32 +4 = 420, which is less than 452. So why is the sample output different?\n\nThis indicates that the algorithm is not correct. There's a flaw in the approach.\n\nSo what's wrong here?\n\nThe sample output for the second input is [1,3,4,5], meaning the kept nodes are 2,6,7,8. Let's see if those are connected. The tree structure:\n\nEdges:\n\n2-6, 2-7, 7-8, 1-2, 3-1, 2-4, 7-5.\n\nSo the nodes 2,6,7,8 are connected. 2 is connected to 6, 7. 7 is connected to 8. So yes, they are connected. The sum is 2^2 + 2^6 + 2^7 + 2^8 = 4 + 64 + 128 + 256 = 452.\n\nBut according to the algorithm, the kept nodes are 8,7,5,2. Which sum to 256 + 128 + 32 +4 = 420. Which is worse. So why is the algorithm not selecting the better option?\n\nBecause the algorithm starts with node 8. Let's walk through the algorithm for this case.\n\nInitial step: S = {8}, count =1.\n\nadj[8] is [7]. So add 7 to the queue.\n\nLoop: count is 1 < 4.\n\nPop 7 (max in queue). Add to S. count=2.\n\nNow, process neighbors of 7: 2, 8 (in S), 5. So add 2 and 5 to the queue.\n\nQueue now has -5 and -2.\n\nNext step: count=2 <4. Pop max, which is 5. Add to S. count=3. Process neighbors of 5: 7 (in S). Nothing added.\n\nQueue now has -2.\n\nNext step: count=3 <4.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and maximize the total number of fans.
