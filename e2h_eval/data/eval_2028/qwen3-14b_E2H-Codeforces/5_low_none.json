Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. Each boot can be part of at most one pair. The colors can be lowercase letters or question marks. The question marks can match any color. I need to find the maximum number of such pairs and output them.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to approach this. The main idea is to pair as many boots as possible. Let's think of different cases.\n\nFirst, for each left boot and right boot, we can check if they are compatible. But with n up to 150,000, a brute-force approach checking all pairs would be O(n²), which is way too slow. So I need an efficient method.\n\nLet me think about grouping the boots by their colors. For example, for left boots, count how many of each color (including ?) there are, and similarly for right boots. Then, try to match them optimally.\n\nBut since ? can match any color, perhaps we should first match the specific colors (non-?) where possible, then use the ?s to cover the remaining.\n\nWait, but how do we handle the ?s? For example, suppose there are some left boots with 'a' and right boots with 'a', we can pair them. Then, any left '?' can be paired with any right that's not already paired, and vice versa.\n\nBut here's the thing: the ? can be used as wildcards. However, we need to maximize the total pairs.\n\nLet me outline a possible strategy:\n\nStep 1: Pair left and right boots with specific colors (non-?) where they match. For example, for each color c (not ?), pair as many left c's with right c's as possible.\n\nBut how to do that? Let's think of using a frequency map. For each color c (excluding ?), take the minimum between the number of left c's and right c's, and pair them. Then subtract those counts from the respective totals.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way. For example, if there are multiple colors, but overlapping, but I think the first step is to process non-? colors first.\n\nOnce that's done, we have some left ?s and right ?s, and possibly some leftover non-? boots that couldn't be matched. Then, we can use the ?s to pair with the remaining non-? boots and each other.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again. Let's break it down into steps.\n\nFirst, process all non-? colors. For each color c (from a-z), the number of left boots with c is L[c], and the number of right boots with c is R[c]. The maximum number of pairs here is min(L[c], R[c]). So we can pair them, and then subtract those from L[c] and R[c].\n\nBut then, after that, we have leftover L[c] and R[c] for each color, but those are for non-? colors. Also, we have some left and right ?s.\n\nNow, the next step is to pair the ?s with the remaining non-? boots. For example, if there are left ?s and right boots with color 'd' that weren't matched before, then each left ? can be paired with a right 'd'.\n\nSimilarly, right ?s can be paired with left non-? boots.\n\nBut how to handle this optimally?\n\nLet me think. Suppose after step 1, we have:\n\nleft_non_question = sum over all colors c (non-?) of L[c] (but these are the leftovers after step 1)\nright_non_question = same for R[c]\n\nBut actually, after step 1, for each color c (non-?), L[c] is the number of left boots that are c and not yet paired. Similarly for R[c].\n\nBut the left ?s and right ?s can be used to pair with these remaining non-? boots.\n\nSo for example, the left ?s can be paired with right non-? boots that are not yet paired. Similarly, the right ?s can be paired with left non-? boots that are not yet paired.\n\nBut how to do that optimally? Because pairing a left ? with a right non-? (say, color d) would use up one left ?, one right d. Similarly for the other way.\n\nBut perhaps we can process the remaining non-? boots in the following way:\n\nFor each color c (non-?), we have some left_c (number of left boots not yet paired with color c) and right_c (same for right). Let's say that after step 1, left_c and right_c are the numbers that couldn't be paired with their own color.\n\nThen, for the left ?s, they can be used to pair with any right non-? boots. Similarly, right",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) based on their colors. Each boot can be part of at most one pair, and a question mark ('?') can be paired with any color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Frequencies**: First, count the frequencies of each color (including '?') for both left and right boots.\n2. **Direct Pairing**: Pair boots with the same specific color (non-?) where possible. This is done by taking the minimum of the counts of each color from left and right boots.\n3. **Handle Wildcards**: After handling direct pairs, use the remaining '?' characters from both left and right boots to pair with the leftover non-? boots. This involves:\n   - Pairing left '?' with remaining right non-? boots.\n   - Pairing right '?' with remaining left non-? boots.\n   - Finally, pairing remaining '?' from both sides with each other.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # For each color, count the number of left and right boots\n    left_count = defaultdict(int)\n    right_count = defaultdict(int)\n    left_indices = defaultdict(list)\n    right_indices = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        c = l[i]\n        left_count[c] += 1\n        left_indices[c].append(i + 1)  # 1-based index\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        c = r[i]\n        right_count[c] += 1\n        right_indices[c].append(i + 1)\n    \n    # Step 1: Pair same color (non-?)\n    pairs = []\n    used_left = defaultdict(set)\n    used_right = defaultdict(set)\n    \n    # Create copies of the counts\n    left_temp = dict(left_count)\n    right_temp = dict(right_count)\n    \n    # Process non-? colors\n    for c in left_temp:\n        if c == '?':\n            continue\n        if c in right_temp:\n            min_val = min(left_temp[c], right_temp[c])\n            if min_val > 0:\n                # Take min_val pairs\n                for _ in range(min_val):\n                    # Get the first available indices\n                    l_idx = left_indices[c].pop(0)\n                    r_idx = right_indices[c].pop(0)\n                    pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n                    used_left[c].add(l_idx)\n                    used_right[c].add(r_idx)\n                left_temp[c] -= min_val\n                right_temp[c] -= min_val\n    \n    # Now, process remaining non-? in left with ? in right\n    for c in left_temp:\n        if c == '?':\n            continue\n        if left_temp[c] > 0 and '?' in right_temp:\n            num_pairs = min(left_temp[c], right_temp['?'])\n            if num_pairs > 0:\n                for _ in range(num_pairs):\n                    l_idx = left_indices[c].pop(0)\n                    r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop(0)\n                    pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n                    used_left[c].add(l_idx)\n                    used_right['?'].add(r_idx)\n                left_temp[c] -= num_pairs\n                right_temp['?'] -= num_pairs\n    \n    # Process remaining non-? in right with ? in left\n    for c in right_temp:\n        if c == '?':\n            continue\n        if right_temp[c] > 0 and '?' in left_temp:\n            num_pairs = min(right_temp[c], left_temp['?'])\n            if num_pairs > 0:\n                for _ in range(num_pairs):\n                    l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop(0)\n                    r_idx = right_indices[c].pop(0)\n                    pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n                    used_left['?'].add(l_idx)\n                    used_right[c].add(r_idx)\n                left_temp['?'] -= num_pairs\n                right_temp[c] -= num_pairs\n    \n    # Finally, pair remaining ? with ?\n    if '?' in left_temp and '?' in right_temp:\n        num_pairs = min(left_temp['?'], right_temp['?'])\n        for _ in range(num_pairs):\n            l_idx = left_indices['?'].pop(0)\n            r_idx = right_indices['?'].pop(0)\n            pairs.append((l_idx, r_idx))\n            used_left['?'].add(l_idx)\n            used_right['?'].add(r_idx)\n    \n    print(len(pairs))\n    for a, b in pairs:\n        print(f\"{a} {b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of boots and their respective color strings.\n2. **Counting Frequencies**: We use dictionaries to count the occurrences of each color for both left and right boots.\n3. **Direct Pairing**: We first pair boots with the same specific color (excluding '?').\n4. **Wildcard Pairing**: After handling direct pairs, we use the remaining '?' characters to pair with leftover non-? boots and then pair the remaining '?' characters with each other.\n5. **Output**: The results are printed, including the number of pairs and the indices of the paired boots.",
