He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n such that the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that produce exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, no, the sample input was m=1? Wait the first example input is '1' and the output is 5 numbers. Wait the first sample input is m=1, and the output is 5 numbers. But according to the note, 5! has one trailing zero. Then 6! is 720, which also has one. Wait, no, wait 5! is 120 (one zero), 6! is 720 (one zero?), but 7! is 5040 (one zero?), 8! is 40320 (one zero?), 9! is 362880 (one zero). Oh right, so all those numbers have exactly one trailing zero. So why does m=1 have 5 numbers? Because for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9. So that's five numbers.\n\nBut how do I find that for a given m?\n\nThe key idea here is that for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, no. Wait, maybe there's a range of numbers that give the same count. For example, when you have m=5, let's see. Let's compute the trailing zeros for numbers:\n\nFor n=24: 24/5 = 4, 24/25=0. Total is 4. For n=25, it's 25/5 + 25/25 = 5 + 1 = 6. So between 25 and 24, there's a jump. So for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Because when you go from 24 (4) to 25 (6). So there's a jump of two. So for m=5, there are zero possible n's. Hence the second example input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given m, the possible n's. The approach would be:\n\nFirst, find the minimum n such that the count of trailing zeros is m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have the same count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the lower and upper bounds of n that would result in exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThis function is non-decreasing as n increases. Because adding more numbers to the product can't decrease the count of 5s.\n\nSo for example, when n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. So for a given m, there could be a range of n's where f(n) = m. However, sometimes there's a jump. For example, when n crosses a multiple of 5, like 25, which adds two 5s (since 25 is 5^2).\n\nSo for m, the possible n's are in a contiguous range. But how to find that?\n\nThe idea is to find the smallest n where f(n) = m, and then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, why 5? Because when you have a number that's not a multiple of 5, adding 1, 2, 3, 4 to it may not change the count. For example, in the case of m=1, the numbers 5,6,7,8,9 all have exactly 1 trailing zero. So that's 5 numbers. But why?\n\nBecause",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in a factorial are formed and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight:\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This can be computed using the formula:\n$$\nf(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n$$\nThis function is **non-decreasing** as $ n $ increases. Therefore, for a given $ m $, the values of $ n $ that satisfy $ f(n) = m $ will form a contiguous range (or none at all).\n\n---\n\n### Algorithm Overview:\n\n1. **Binary Search for Bounds**:\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ f(n) = m $.\n   - Then, check if there are any other $ n $ values where $ f(n) = m $.\n\n2. **Check for Valid Range**:\n   - If there exists an $ n $ such that $ f(n) = m $, then the next few numbers may also yield the same count due to the nature of trailing zeros.\n   - However, if $ f(n) $ jumps by more than one when increasing $ n $, then there may be no such $ n $, or only a limited number of them.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - For certain values of $ m $, there may be **no** $ n $ that satisfies the condition (e.g., when $ m = 5 $).\n   - In some cases, there may be **exactly one** or **multiple** such $ n $ values.\n\n---\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m  # Upper bound estimate\n\n    # Find the smallest n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) >= m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    min_n = low\n\n    # Check if the count is exactly m\n    if count_trailing_zeros(min_n) != m:\n        return []\n\n    # Now find the maximum n such that count_trailing_zeros(n) == m\n    max_n = min_n\n    while count_trailing_zeros(max_n + 1) == m:\n        max_n += 1\n\n    return list(range(min_n, max_n + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    try:\n        m = int(input_line)\n    except:\n        print(\"0\")\n        return\n\n    result = find_n_values(m)\n    print(len(result))\n    if result:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **`count_trailing_zeros(n)`**: Computes the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $.\n- **`find_n_values(m)`**: Uses binary search to find the minimum $ n $ such that the count is $ m $, and then expands to find the full range of $ n $ values with that count.\n- **`main()`**: Handles input/output and ensures proper formatting of output.\n\n---\n\n### Example:\n\nFor input `1`, the output will be:\n```\n5\n5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\nFor input `5`, the output will be:\n```\n0\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the code is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.",
