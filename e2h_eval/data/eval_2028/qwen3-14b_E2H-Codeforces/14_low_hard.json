He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Because 5! has one zero, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors but the count remains the same until 10! which adds another 5 (from 10).\n\nWait, but how do I find the possible n's for a given m?\n\nThe key idea here is that the number of trailing zeros increases as n increases, but sometimes multiple n's can give the same count. However, there's a catch. For example, when you have a number like 25, which contributes two 5s. So when you go from 24 to 25, the count of zeros jumps by two. So for some m values, there might be no n's that produce exactly that m. For instance, if m is 5, maybe there's no n such that the count is exactly 5. Wait, let me check. Let's compute the trailing zeros for numbers around 25.\n\nFor example:\n\nn=24: floor(24/5) =4, floor(24/25)=0. Total 4 zeros.\n\nn=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6 zeros. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. Therefore, for m=5, the answer would be zero.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where the count of zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n such that the count of zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are other numbers after that which also have the same count.\n\nBut how to find that n?\n\nAlternatively, we can think of it as a binary search problem. For example, the count of zeros increases with n, but not strictly. So for a given m, we can find the lower and upper bounds of n where the count is m.\n\nBut first, we need to find the possible n's. Let's think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nWe can find the minimum n where f(n) = m. Then check if there are consecutive numbers after that which also have the same count. However, since when n increases by 1, the count can increase by 0 or 1 (or more?), but how?\n\nWait, when you add a new number, say n+1, the count of zeros can increase by the number of 5s in n+1. For example, if n+1 is 25, then adding it adds two 5s. So the count increases by two. So for example, if m is 5, then there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Because between 24 (count 4) and 25 (count 6), the count jumps by two. So for m=5, no solution.\n\nTherefore, for a given m, the possible n's would be in a range. But how to find that range?\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- Find the smallest n such that f(n) = m. Let's call this low.\n\n- Then find the largest n such that f(n) = m. Let's call this high.\n\nIf there is no such n (i.e., no n exists with f(n) = m), then output 0.\n\nOtherwise, the numbers from low to high inclusive are all the possible n's. The count would be high - low + 1.\n\nBut how to find low and high?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the lower bound and upper bound where the count is exactly m.\n\nBut how to find these bounds?\n\nLet me think of using binary search to find the first",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many positive integers $ n $ exist such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. Additionally, we must list these integers in increasing order.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because each pair of factors 2 and 5 contributes to one trailing zero, and there are usually more 2s than 5s in a factorial.\n\nThe formula to compute the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is:\n$$\n\\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n$$\nThis sum continues until the division result becomes zero.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Since the function `count_zeros(n)` is non-decreasing, we can use binary search to find the smallest and largest values of $ n $ for which `count_zeros(n) == m`.\n\n2. **Check Existence**: If no such $ n $ exists (i.e., the count never reaches $ m $), then the answer is 0.\n\n3. **Generate Results**: If such $ n $ exists, all values between the smallest and largest such $ n $ will also have exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n- Define a helper function `count_zeros(n)` to calculate the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $.\n- Use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds of $ n $ such that `count_zeros(n) == m`.\n- If such bounds exist, output the range of values.
