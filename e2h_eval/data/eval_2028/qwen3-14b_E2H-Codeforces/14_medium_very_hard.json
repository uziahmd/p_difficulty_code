    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the trailing zero count is exactly m. However, there's a catch here. For example, when m is 5, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9) which all have exactly 5 trailing zeros. Wait, but why?\n\nBecause for n=5, the count is 1 (from 5/5). Then for n=25, the count is 6 (5/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). So between certain ranges, the count increases by 1 each time. But sometimes, when there's a multiple of higher powers of 5, like 25, 50, etc., the count jumps by more than 1. For example, when you go from 24 to 25, the count goes from 4 (floor(24/5)=4 + floor(24/25)=0) to 6 (floor(25/5)=5 + floor(25/25)=1). So between 25 and 24, the count increases by 2. That means that there's a gap where there are no numbers with exactly 5 trailing zeros. Wait, but that's not possible. Let me check.\n\nWait, for example, let's take m=5. The numbers that have exactly 5 trailing zeros would be the numbers where the count is 5. Let's see:\n\nFor n=24: count is 4 + 0 = 4. For n=25: count is 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. Therefore, there are no n's where the count is 5. But that contradicts the sample input where m=1, the answer is 5,6,7,8,9. So how does that work?\n\nAh, right. For example, when m is 5, maybe there are no n's. But in the sample input, when m is 1, there are 5 numbers. So the problem is that for some m, there may be zero possible n's. So the first thing is to find if there exists any n such that the count is m. If there is, then find all such n's.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the count of trailing zeros is m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have the same count.\n\nBut how to find that? Well, the key is that for a given m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, no. Wait, the count increases as n increases. So for each n, the count is non-decreasing. So for example, if there's an n where the count is m, then there could be a range of consecutive numbers where the count is m. But when there's a jump in the count, like when you hit a multiple of 5, then the count increases by 1. But when you hit a multiple of 25, it increases by 2, etc.\n\nSo, for example, if the count for n is m, then the next number (n+1) will have the same count unless n+1 is a multiple of 5. So, for example, if n is 5, then the count is 1. For n=6, it's still 1. For n=9, it's still 1. Then for n=10, the count becomes 2. So the numbers 5,6,7,8,9 all have count 1. So the number of possible n's is 5.\n\nSo the idea is that for a given m, if there exists an n such that the count is m, then the number of such n's is either 0, 1, or 5. Wait, but why 5? Because when you have a normal increase (count increases by 1), then the numbers between the previous multiple of 5 and the next multiple of 5 would have the same count. For example, when m is 1, the numbers 5,6,7,8,9 have count 1. So that's 5 numbers. But if the count increases by more than 1, then there's a gap. For example, when m is 5, perhaps there's no n's.\n\nSo how do we find for a given m, whether there exists such n's, and how many?\n\nThe plan is:\n\n- First, find the minimal n such that the count of trailing zeros is >= m. Then check if the count is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, check how many numbers have that count.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal n that gives exactly m trailing zeros. Alternatively, perhaps we can find the lower and upper bounds for n such that the count is exactly m.\n\nAlternatively, think about binary search. For example, for a given m, find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have count_zeros equal to m.\n\nBut how to find the possible numbers?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 possible n's. Wait, no. For example, when m is 24, let's see:\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(99) = 99//5 + 99//25 + 99//125 = 19 + 3 + 0 = 22. Then 100//5 is 20, 100//25 is 4, 100//125 is 0. Total is 24. So for n=100, count is 24. Then n=101, 102, 103, 104 will have same count. Then n=105 will have count_zeros(105) = 21 (105/5=21, 105/25=4, 105/125=0. Total 25? Wait 21+4=25? So wait, 100 has 24, 101-104 have 24, then 105 has 25. So for m=24, the numbers are 100, 101, 102, 103, 104. So that's 5 numbers. So again 5 numbers. So perhaps the number of n's is either 0, 1, or 5?\n\nWait, what about when m is 5? Let's see. Let's find the count for n=24: 24//5=4, 24//25=0. Total 4. For n=25, count is 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. So for m=5, the answer is zero.\n\nAnother example: m=6. Let's see. The count for 25 is 6. Then for n=25, 26, 27, 28, 29, the count is 6. Because for 25, count is 6. For 26, same. Up to 29. Then for 30, count is 7 (30/5=6, 30/25=1. Total 7). So for m=6, the numbers are 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. So 5 numbers. So again 5.\n\nBut what about when m is 25?\n\nLet me think. Let's find n where count_zeros(n) = 25. Let's see:\n\nLet me find the value of n where count_zeros(n) = 25.\n\nWe can try to find the lower bound. Let's think of binary search.\n\nBut maybe I should think of the count function. For example, for n=100, count is 24. For n=105, count is 25 + 2? Wait, let's calculate:\n\ncount_zeros(105) = 105//5 = 21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Sum is 25. So yes. So for n=105, count is 25. Then for n=105, 106, 107, 108, 109, the count remains 25. Then n=110: 110//5 is 22, 110//25 is 4, 110//125 is 0. Sum 26. So for m=25, the numbers are 105-109, which is 5 numbers. So again 5.\n\nSo seems that when there is at least one n with count m, then there are exactly 5 numbers. Unless the count jumps by 1. Wait, but when?\n\nWait, what if m is 3? Let's see:\n\nn=15: count_zeros(15) = 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). So for n=15, 16, 17, 18, 19: count is 3. Then n=20: count is 4 (20/5=4, 20/25=0). So for m=3, the answer is 5 numbers. So again 5.\n\nSo the pattern seems that when there exists an n with count m, then there are exactly 5 numbers. But why?\n\nBecause when you have a number n that is a multiple of 5, but not of higher powers. For example, n=5, 10, 15, etc. When you reach n=5, the count increases by 1. Then the next numbers (up to next multiple of 5) will have same count. So the numbers from n to n+4 (assuming next multiple is n+5) will have the same count. So that's 5 numbers.\n\nBut what about when the count increases by more than 1? Like when n=25. For example, for m=5, there's no solution. But for m=6, there are 5 numbers (25, 26, 27, 28, 29).\n\nSo the key is that if there exists an n such that count_zeros(n) = m, then the numbers from n to n+4 will have the same count. But how can I confirm that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that for some n, count_zeros(n) = m. Then, the next number (n+1) will have count_zeros(n+1) = count_zeros(n) + 1 if (n+1) is divisible by 5, else same as count_zeros(n). So if n is not divisible by 5, then count_zeros(n+1) = count_zeros(n). So for n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, the count_zeros remains same. But if n is divisible by 5, then count_zeros(n+1) is same as count_zeros(n) only if n+1 is not divisible by 5. But since n is divisible by 5, then n+1 is not. So for example, for n=25, count_zeros(25) = 6. Then count_zeros(26) is same as count_zeros(25) (because 26 is not divisible by 5). So the numbers 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 have count 6. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo, if there's at least one n where count_zeros(n) = m, then there are exactly 5 numbers. Except when the count_zeros(n) jumps by more than 1. But how can that happen?\n\nWell, suppose that m is such that there's a jump. For example, when m is 5. Let's say, for some n, count_zeros(n) is 5. But how?\n\nLet me find for which n count_zeros(n) is 5. Let's see:\n\nFor n=24: count_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 = 4. For n=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1. Total 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there is no n with count_zeros(n) =5. Hence, for m=5, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the conclusion is that for a given m, there are either 0 or 5 possible values of n. But wait, what if there's a case where there's exactly one n?\n\nWait, what if m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m starts from 1. So that's not considered.\n\nWait, what if m is such that there is exactly one n. Let's think. Let's take m=1. For n=5, count is 1. Then n=6,7,8,9 also have count 1. So that's five numbers. So no, there's no case where there is exactly one n. Unless the count increases by 1, but the next number is also part of the same count. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, maybe for m=24, the numbers are 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104? No, earlier calculation said that for n=100, count is 24. Let me check again.\n\nWait for n=99:\n\ncount_zeros(99) = 99//5 = 19, 99//25 = 3, 99//125=0. Total 22. Oh, so that's 22. Then for n=100: 100//5 is 20, 100//25 is 4, 100//125 is 0. Total 24. So the count increases by 2. So between n=99 and n=100, the count jumps from 22 to 24. So for m=23, there's no solution. For m=24, the count starts at 100, and then for 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, the count is 24. Because for n=105, the count is 25. So for m=24, there are 5 numbers. So again 5.\n\nSo the only possibilities are 0 or 5. But how about if the count increases by 1, but there's a case where the count is exactly m for only one n?\n\nLet me think of another scenario. Suppose that m is 2. For example, the count_zeros(10) is 2 (10/5=2, 10/25=0). Then for n=10, 11, 12, 13, 14, the count is 2. So that's 5 numbers. So again 5.\n\nHmm. So the only case when the answer is 0 is when there's a jump over m. So how can I check for that?\n\nThe plan is:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Then check if there are numbers. If there is, then the answer is 5 numbers. But how to find if there exists such n?\n\nBut how to find if there exists an n with exactly m trailing zeros?\n\nThe approach is to use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds. Let me think:\n\nThe count_zeros(n) is a non-decreasing function. So for a given m, there can be a range of n's where the count is m. But how to find if such n exists.\n\nLet me think of using binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if count_zeros(n) == m. Also, check if there's a possible n.\n\nBut for example, let's say for m=5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25, but count_zeros(25) is 6. So there's no n with count_zeros(n) =5. Hence, answer is zero.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. How?\n\nWell, perhaps we can find the lower bound and upper bound for n. For example, find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >=m. Let's call that low_n. Then check if count_zeros(low_n) == m. If not, then there is no solution. Else, the numbers are low_n, low_n+1, ..., low_n+4. But wait, how do I know that these numbers all have count_zeros equal to m?\n\nBecause when you have count_zeros(low_n) = m, then for low_n+1, the count_zeros can be m or m+1. But since low_n was the minimal n with count >=m, then for low_n-1, count_zeros is less than m. So if count_zeros(low_n) is m, then adding 1 to n (low_n) would only increase the count if n+1 is a multiple of 5. But for example, if low_n is 5, then count_zeros(5) is 1. Then 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. For 5, count is 1. For 6, same. Up to 9. For 10, count increases by 1 again. So the numbers 5-9 have count 1. So that's 5 numbers.\n\nSo, once we find that there exists at least one n (say, low_n) where count_zeros(n) = m, then the answer is 5 numbers: low_n, low_n+1, low_n+2, low_n+3, low_n+4.\n\nBut how to confirm that all of these numbers have count_zeros equal to m?\n\nBecause, for each of these numbers, the count_zeros is m. Because the next number (low_n+5) would be the next multiple of 5. So, for example, if low_n is 5, then low_n+5 is 10. The count_zeros(10) is 2. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Hence, the 5 numbers.\n\nSo the idea is that if there exists an n where count_zeros(n) = m, then there are exactly 5 numbers. So the steps are:\n\n- For given m, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\n- Check if count_zeros(n) is exactly m. If not, output 0.\n\n- Else, check if the next numbers (n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4) also have count_zeros equal to m. But according to our previous reasoning, they will. So the answer is 5 numbers: n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4.\n\nBut how do I find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m? That can be done via binary search.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement a function count_zeros(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen perform binary search to find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this n_min.\n\nOnce found, check if count_zeros(n_min) is exactly m. If not, output 0. Else, output the 5 numbers starting from n_min.\n\nBut wait, what if there are more than 5 numbers? For example, if the count_zeros(n) increases by 1 at some point. For example, if the count_zeros(n) is m for n from a to b, where b -a +1 is more than 5? But according to previous reasoning, that's not possible.\n\nBecause the count_zeros(n) increases by 1 when n is a multiple of 5, but not of higher powers. So for example, when n is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, the count is same. Then when n is 10, it increases by 1. So the maximum number of consecutive numbers with same count_zeros is 5. So the answer is either 0 or 5 numbers.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 25. Let's say m=6. Then n_min is 25. Then the numbers 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 have count 6. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nIf count_zeros(n) != m, then output 0.\n\nElse, output 5 numbers: n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m?\n\nThe binary search approach for that is:\n\nThe lower bound for n is 0, upper bound can be 5*m. Because for example, for m=1, the minimal n is 5. For m=2, 10. So for m, the minimal n is around 5*m. Because each multiple of 5 contributes at least one zero. So the upper bound can be set as 5*m. Or even higher, but 5*m is sufficient.\n\nWait, but for m=100000, 5*m is 500000. But for that, the count_zeros(500000) is 500000//5 + 500000//25 + ... which is way larger than m. So the upper bound can be adjusted. But for binary search, we can set the upper bound as 5*m.\n\nBut perhaps a better upper bound is needed. For example, the maximum possible n for a given m is 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m (since each 5 contributes one). So for example, for n=5*m, the count_zeros is at least m. So binary search between 0 and 5*m.\n\nSo the binary search steps:\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = 5*m.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n    if count_zeros(mid) < m:\n\n        low = mid + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        high = mid\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce that is found, check if count_zeros(low) == m. If yes, then output the 5 numbers. Else, output 0.\n\nBut wait, what if there is no n for which count_zeros(n) is exactly m?\n\nLike for m=5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is greater than m. So output 0.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nFirst, implement count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nThen, for the binary search.\n\nBut for m=0, but according to the problem statement, m starts from 1.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nIf m is 0, handle accordingly. But according to input constraints, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nNow, perform the binary search.\n\nBut for some cases, like m=5, the binary search finds low as 25, but count_zeros(25) is 6>5. So output 0.\n\nElse, if count_zeros(low) == m, then output 5 numbers: low, low+1, ..., low+4.\n\nBut wait, how do I know that all these numbers have exactly m trailing zeros?\n\nBecause for the next number, low+1, the count_zeros is same as low, unless low+1 is divisible by 5. But since low is the minimal n where count_zeros is >=m, and count_zeros(low) is exactly m, then for low+1, the count_zeros can be m or m+1.\n\nBut how to ensure that for low+1, it's still m?\n\nWait, for example, if low is 5, which is divisible by 5. Then count_zeros(5) is 1. For 6, it's 1. So for low=5, the numbers 5,6,7,8,9 are valid.\n\nBut if low is 25, which is divisible by 5. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then for 26, it's 6. So the same logic applies.\n\nSo the code can proceed to output the 5 numbers. But how to make sure that there are exactly 5 numbers?\n\nBecause, when low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m, then the next number (low+1) will have count_zeros equal to m, unless low+1 is divisible by 5. But since low is the minimal n with count_zeros >= m, and count_zeros(low) is m, then for low+1, the count_zeros is m or m+1.\n\nBut if low is the minimal n where count_zeros is m, then for low+1, the count_zeros can't be less than m. So it can be m or m+1.\n\nBut how to know whether there are 5 numbers.\n\nBut according to our previous examples, the numbers from low to low+4 will have count_zeros equal to m. Because the next multiple of 5 is low + (5 - (low %5 )) ?\n\nWait, for example, if low is 5, then the next multiple of 5 is 10. So numbers 5,6,7,8,9 are 5 numbers. Similarly, if low is 25, then next multiple is 30. So numbers 25-29 (5 numbers) have count_zeros(m).\n\nSo the code can safely assume that if count_zeros(low) is m, then the next four numbers (low+1, etc.) also have m.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause the count_zeros increases only when n crosses a multiple of 5. So for numbers between low and low +4, none of them is a multiple of 5 (since low is a multiple of 5?), no. Wait, no. For example, if low is 6, which is not a multiple of 5. Then count_zeros(6) is same as count_zeros(5), which is 1. So for low=6, the numbers from 6 to 10-1=9. So that's 4 numbers (6,7,8,9). Wait, but that's 4 numbers, not 5. So why?\n\nAh, here's a problem. Let's take m=1. The minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1 is 5. So low=5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So the numbers 5,6,7,8,9 (5 numbers). So that's correct.\n\nBut suppose that m is 2. The minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=2 is 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. Then the numbers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. That's 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the minimal n is not a multiple of 5? For example, let's imagine m=2. Let's say that there's a number n=10, which is a multiple of 5. So the minimal n is 10. So the numbers 10-14.\n\nBut suppose that m is 3. The minimal n is 15. Which is a multiple of 5. So numbers 15-19.\n\nBut what if the minimal n is not a multiple of 5?\n\nLet me think of a case where the minimal n is not a multiple of 5.\n\nWait, for example, m=2. Let's say n=10 is the minimal n where count_zeros is 2. So for n=10, which is a multiple of 5.\n\nBut suppose m is 3. Let's say that the minimal n is 15. Which is a multiple of 5.\n\nBut what if m is 4?\n\ncount_zeros(20) = 20/5 + 20/25 = 4 + 0 =4. So the minimal n is 20. So the numbers 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo in all these cases, the minimal n is a multiple of 5. So why?\n\nBecause the count_zeros(n) increases when n is a multiple of 5. So for example, when you reach a multiple of 5, the count increases. So if the minimal n for which the count is m is not a multiple of 5, then that would imply that the count_zeros(n) is m, but the previous number (n-1) has count_zeros(n-1) < m. But since n is not a multiple of 5, then count_zeros(n) = count_zeros(n-1). So that would imply that count_zeros(n-1) = m, which contradicts the assumption that n is the minimal. So the minimal n must be a multiple of 5.\n\nTherefore, the minimal n for which count_zeros(n) =m must be a multiple of 5. Thus, the numbers from n to n+4 will have count_zeros(n) = m, since none of them are multiples of 5 except n itself. Wait, n is a multiple of 5. So n+5 is the next multiple. So for n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4, none of them except n is a multiple of 5. Thus, their count_zeros is same as count_zeros(n). So that's 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute low via binary search.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(low) == m.\n\nIf yes, output 5 numbers: low, low+1, ..., low+4.\n\nElse, output 0.\n\nBut wait, let's test for m=5.\n\nbinary search for the minimal n with count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nWhat is the minimal n?\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(24) is 4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: sample input 1.\n\nSample input is m=1. Output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nbinary search finds low=5. count_zeros(5)=1. So output 5 numbers.\n\nAnother sample input: m=5. Output is 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6. The low is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So output 25-29.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what about when m is very large, like 1e5?\n\nWe need to compute the binary search for 5*m. But for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nBut let's think about the binary search's upper bound.\n\nIs 5*m sufficient?\n\nLet me think. For example, for m=1, 5*1=5. Which is the minimal n.\n\nFor m=2, 5*2=10. Which is the minimal n.\n\nFor m=6, 5*6=30. But the minimal n is 25. So 30 is higher than needed. So binary search will find the correct n.\n\nThus, the upper bound of 5*m is acceptable.\n\nSo, code:\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead m from input.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen perform binary search.\n\nBut for the binary search, the initial low is 0, high is 5*m.\n\nBut for m=1, 5*m is 5, which is correct.\n\nBut for m=0, but the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count =0\n\n    while n>0:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n(m):\n\n    low =0\n\n    high =5*m\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) < m:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid\n\n    return low\n\nThen, after finding low, check if count_zeros(low) ==m.\n\nIf yes, then output 5 numbers: low, low+1,...low+4.\n\nElse, output 0.\n\nBut what if there are more than 5 numbers? For example, if m is 24, and the low is 100, which is 24. Then numbers 100, 101, 102, 103, 104. So 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the low is 105, and count_zeros(105) is 25. So for m=25, the code would output 105-109.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what if there are multiple numbers beyond 5?\n\nNo, because the next multiple of 5 is 5 steps away. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m.\n\nif m is 0, but according to problem statement, m is >=1.\n\nSo:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nlow = find_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(low) == m:\n\n    print(5)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, [low, low+1, low+2, low+3, low+4])))\n\nelse:\n\n    print(0)\n\nWait, but what if the numbers low, low+1, ..., low+4 are not all valid? For example, if low is 25, and m=6, then count_zeros(25) is 6. Then count_zeros(26) is same as 25, since 26 is not divisible by 5. So yes.\n\nBut what if low is 25 and m=6, but for low+5=30, count_zeros(30) is 7. So for numbers 25-29, count_zeros is 6.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nfind_n(1) returns 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So output 5 numbers 5-9.\n\nSample input 2: m=5. find_n(5) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. The code returns 25, and outputs 25-29.\n\nAnother test case: m=24. find_n(24) would return 100. count_zeros(100) is 24. So output 100-104.\n\nBut let's compute count_zeros(100):\n\n100//5 = 20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0. Total 24. Correct.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nBut what about cases where m is such that there are multiple numbers but not 5? Like, for example, m=0. But according to problem statement, m starts at 1.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what if the code returns low as 5*m, but count_zeros(5*m) is less than m?\n\nNo, because the binary search is set to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m. Since 5*m is an upper bound, the count_zeros(5*m) is at least m.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause count_zeros(5*m) is sum_{i=1}^∞ (5*m // 5^i).\n\nWhich is equal to m + (5m//25) + (5m//125) + ... which is at least m.\n\nSo the binary search will find a correct low.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut note that in Python, for large m (like 1e5), 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nNow, code",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n2. **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least $ m $, we use binary search. This helps narrow down the possible values of $ n $ quickly.\n3. **Validation Check**: Once we find the smallest $ n $ using binary search, we check if the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is exactly $ m $. If not, there are no valid $ n $ values. If yes, the valid values are $ n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4 $, as these consecutive numbers will all have exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input)\n    low = find_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(low) == m:\n        print(5)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, [low, low+1, low+2, low+3, low+4])))\n    else:\n        print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least $ m $. The upper bound for the binary search is set to $ 5 \\times m $, which is a safe estimate based on the properties of trailing zeros.\n3. **main Function**: Reads the input value $ m $, uses the `find_n` function to determine the smallest $ n $, checks if this $ n $ results in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, and prints the appropriate result. If valid, it prints the five consecutive integers starting from $ n $; otherwise, it prints 0.\n\nThis approach ensures efficiency and correctness by leveraging mathematical properties and binary search to handle large input values effectively.",
