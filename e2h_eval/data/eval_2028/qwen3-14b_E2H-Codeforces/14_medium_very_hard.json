He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the trailing zero count is exactly m. However, there's a catch here. For example, when m is 5, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9) which all have exactly 5 trailing zeros. Wait, but why?\n\nBecause the count of trailing zeros increases as n increases. For example, when n crosses a multiple of 5, the count increases. But for numbers between 5 and 9, the count is 1 (from 5), then 1 again for 6, etc., until 10, which adds another 5 (so count becomes 2). Wait no, wait. Let me recheck:\n\nWait for n=5: count is 1 (5/5=1). For n=6, same as 5, since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1. So for numbers 5,6,7,8,9, the count is 1. Then at 10, it's 2 (10/5=2, plus 10/25=0, so total 2). So for m=1, the possible n's are 5-9, which is 5 numbers. That's the first sample input.\n\nBut how to find for a general m?\n\nThe approach I think is:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the trailing zero count is m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have the same count. But how?\n\nBut wait, the count of trailing zeros is non-decreasing as n increases. So for each m, there could be a range of n's that produce exactly m trailing zeros. However, sometimes there might be no such n. For example, if m is 5, maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros? Or wait, let me think. Let's see:\n\nFor example, let's compute the trailing zeros for some numbers. Let's take m=5.\n\nWhat's the count for n=24: 24//5 = 4, 24//25=0 → total 4. For n=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1, total 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. So for m=5, the answer would be 0. Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's calculate the trailing zeros for numbers around 25. For example, n=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1 → total 6. What about n=24: 24/5 is 4.8 → floor is 4. 24/25 is 0. So total 4. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. Therefore, there is no n where the count is 5. So for m=5, the answer is 0. Which is the second example in the input, where the input is 5 and output is 0. Wait, but the first example input was m=1, output is 5 numbers. So the sample input shows that for m=5, the output is 0. So that's the case.\n\nSo, the problem is that for some m, there are no n's. So the steps I need to take are:\n\n- For a given m, find all n's such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. If there are none, output 0. Otherwise, output the count and the numbers.\n\nSo, how to find these n's?\n\nFirst, find the minimal n such that the count is >= m. Then check if the count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the range of n's that have exactly m.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count is m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds for n that give exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nLet me think. The function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n! is non-decreasing. So for a given m, there may be a range of n's where f(n) = m. However, because of the way f(n) increases (for example, when n is a multiple of 5, it jumps by more than 1), there might be cases where there is no n with f(n) = m. For example, when m=5, as discussed.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For a given m, find the smallest n where f(n) = m. Then check if there are any numbers after that where f(n) remains m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, find the smallest n where f(n) = m. Then find the largest n where f(n) = m. Then the numbers from the smallest to largest are the possible n's. But how to find those?\n\nBut how to find if such n exists?\n\nLet me think. For example, if m is 5, then there's no n such that f(n) = 5. Because the count jumps from 4 to 6. So, the idea is to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m, and check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the minimal n where f(n) = m, and the maximal n where f(n) = m. The numbers between them would be the possible answers.\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where f(n) = m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given m, the possible n's are in a range [a, b], where a is the first n where f(n) = m, and b is the last n where f(n) = m. Then, the count is b - a + 1.\n\nBut how to find a and b?\n\nLet me think. Let's find the lower bound and upper bound for n where f(n) = m.\n\nFirst, find the lower bound: the minimal n such that f(n) = m. How?\n\nWe can use binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this value low. Then check if f(low) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Else, find the upper bound, which is the minimal n where f(n) > m. Then subtract 1 to get the upper bound for the range. Then the numbers from low to upper_bound are the possible n's.\n\nWait, that makes sense. For example, in the first sample where m=1:\n\nFind the minimal n where f(n) >=1. That's 5. Then check if f(5)=1. Yes. Then find the minimal n where f(n) >1. That's 10. So the upper bound is 10-1=9. So the range is 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example, m=5. Find the minimal n where f(n) >=5. Let's see. Let's compute f(24) is 4, f(25) is 6. So the minimal n where f(n)>=5 is 25. But f(25) is 6, which is larger than 5. So there's no solution. Hence output 0.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n_low where f(n_low) >= m. Then check if f(n_low) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n2. Then find the minimal n_high where f(n_high) > m. Then the upper bound is n_high -1. The numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are all the n's that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nSo the count is (n_high -1 - n_low +1) = n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to compute n_low and n_high?\n\nWe can perform binary search for both.\n\nBut first, how to compute f(n)?\n\nImplementing the function f(n) is straightforward: sum n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ... until the division is zero.\n\nNow, the binary search for n_low and n_high.\n\nBut what is the possible range for binary search?\n\nFor the lower bound, the minimal n is 1. The upper bound can be 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the number of trailing zeros is at least m. Because for example, 5*m /5 = m, and higher terms are 0. So the count is m. But maybe there are cases where it's more. But for binary search, we can set the upper limit as 5*m. However, in some cases, like m=5, the required n is 25, which is 5*5. So 5*m is acceptable as an upper bound.\n\nBut wait, for m=1, 5*m is 5. Which is the correct n_low. For m=5, the upper bound is 5*5=25. Which is correct.\n\nBut maybe for some m, the required n_low is higher than 5*m? Let me think. Suppose m=25. Let's compute for 5*25=125. The number of trailing zeros in 125! is 125/5 + 125/25 + 125/125 = 25 +5+1=31. Which is larger than 25. So the minimal n_low for m=25 would be less than 125. So 5*m is a safe upper bound for binary search.\n\nBut perhaps using a higher upper bound, like 5*m, or even m*5, but perhaps even m*5 is sufficient.\n\nSo for binary search, the upper bound can be set as 5*m.\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nSo, the steps for solving the problem:\n\nGiven m:\n\n1. Find the minimal n_low where f(n_low) >=m. Let's call this value.\n\n2. Check if f(n_low) is equal to m. If not, output 0.\n\n3. Else, find the minimal n_high where f(n_high) > m. Then the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are the possible n's.\n\nThe count is (n_high-1 - n_low +1) = n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to find n_low and n_high via binary search?\n\nLet me think about the binary search for n_low (the minimal n with f(n) >=m).\n\nThe binary search for n_low:\n\nInitialize low=0, high=5*m. While low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   if f(mid) >= m: high = mid\n\n   else: low = mid +1\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where f(n) >=m.\n\nSimilarly for finding n_high, which is the minimal n where f(n) >m. So the same approach, but with the condition checking for f(mid) >m.\n\nOnce we have n_low and n_high, then the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are the ones that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut then, the count is (n_high -1 - n_low +1) = n_high - n_low.\n\nBut wait, let's test with the first sample. m=1.\n\nn_low is 5. n_high is the minimal n where f(n) >1. Let's see:\n\nf(5)=1, f(6)=1, ..., f(9)=1, f(10)=2. So the minimal n_high is 10. So the numbers are from 5 to 9. Which is 5 numbers. So n_high - n_low = 10-5=5. Which matches.\n\nAnother example, m=5. n_low is 25, but f(25)=6>5. So the check fails, so output 0.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nFirst, implement the function to count trailing zeros:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n >0:\n\n        n = n//5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen, for a given m, perform the binary search steps.\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nNow, code steps for a given m:\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n_ge(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m: output 0\n\nelse:\n\n   compute n_high = find_min_n_gt(m)\n\n   the numbers are from n_low to n_high -1.\n\n   the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to find find_min_n_ge(m) and find_min_n_gt(m)?\n\nImplementing the binary search for find_min_n_ge(m):\n\ndef find_min_n_ge(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * m\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nSimilarly for find_min_n_gt(m):\n\ndef find_min_n_gt(m):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * m\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) > m:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but for the find_min_n_gt(m), the condition is that we want the minimal n where count_zeros(n) > m.\n\nOnce we have n_low and n_high, then the answer is the list of numbers from n_low to n_high-1 inclusive.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nfor a given m:\n\nn_low = find_min_n_ge(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    n_high = find_min_n_gt(m)\n\n    numbers = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nBut wait, the range from n_low to n_high-1 is inclusive. So, the list is [n_low, n_low+1, ..., n_high-1]. So in Python, range(n_low, n_high) gives that.\n\nBut what if n_high is n_low? Then the list is empty. But that can't happen. Because if count_zeros(n_low) is m, then the next number is n_low +1. But for example, if n_low is such that count_zeros(n_low) = m, and count_zeros(n_low+1) is m. So n_high would be the first n where count_zeros is >m. So, the numbers between n_low and n_high-1 would be all numbers that have exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to handle when n_high is not found? Well, the code for find_min_n_gt(m) will return the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >m. So, for example, if m is 1, then find_min_n_gt(1) returns 10, which is correct.\n\nBut what if m is very large? For example, m=1e5. Then 5*m could be 5e5. But for binary search, that's manageable.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nfind_min_n_ge(1) is 5. count_zeros(5)=1. So proceed.\n\nfind_min_n_gt(1) is 10. So numbers from 5 to 9. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: m=5.\n\nfind_min_n_ge(5) is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So 6 !=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=6. What's the numbers?\n\nn_low is 25, since count_zeros(25)=6. Then find_min_n_gt(6) is the first n where count_zeros is >6. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) = 6, count_zeros(26) is same as 25. So for 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, the count is 6. At 30, count_zeros(30) is 30//5 + 30//25 = 6 + 1 =7. So find_min_n_gt(6) is 30. So the numbers are from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers. So output is 5, followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nSo the code would generate that correctly.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase where m=0. But according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: m=2. Let's see.\n\nWhat's the numbers?\n\nFor n=10: count_zeros is 2. Then 11, 12, 13, 14. At 15, count_zeros(15) is 3. So the numbers are 10-14. So 5 numbers. So for m=2, the answer is 5 numbers: 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.\n\nBut let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(10) = 2. count_zeros(14) is 14//5 + 14//25 = 2 + 0 = 2. count_zeros(15) is 3. So yes.\n\nSo code would work.\n\nAnother edge case: m=3. Let's see.\n\nn_low is 15 (count_zeros(15)=3). Then find_min_n_gt(3) is 20? Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(15) = 3, 16, 17, 18, 19: same. 20: 20//5=4, 20//25=0. Total 4. So find_min_n_gt(3) is 20. So the numbers are 15-19. 5 numbers. So output is 5.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother case where m=24. Let's say.\n\nWhat's the count_zeros(99)? 99//5=19, 99//25=3, 99//125=0. Total 22. Hmm. 99: 22. 100: 24 (100/5=20, 100/25=4, 100/125=0. Total 24). So for m=24, the n_low is 100. count_zeros(100) is 24. Then find_min_n_gt(24) would be 101? Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(100) =24. For 101, same as 100. For 104, same. For 105: 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Total 25. So find_min_n_gt(24) is 105. So numbers from 100 to 104. Which is 5 numbers. So output is 5, 100 101 102 103 104.\n\nBut wait, what about 100's count? Let me recalculate:\n\nFor 100, count_zeros is 100//5=20, 100//25=4, 100//125=0. Sum is 24. So yes. So the code would return 5 numbers.\n\nSo code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut first, the code needs to read m from input. But in the example given, the input is ['1', '5'], which probably refers to multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. But the sample input shows two cases, perhaps because the problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are given? Wait, no, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nOutput: First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\nBut the example shows:\n\nInput: ['1', '5']\n\nOutput: ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the input is multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the original problem is from a programming competition where the input is multiple test cases, but the problem description here is ambiguous. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the sample input is given as ['1', '5'] which perhaps represents two test cases. However, the original problem statement may have different input format. Wait, the problem says that the input is a single integer m. However, the sample input shows two lines, but perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], which is probably a mistake. Because the problem says that the input is a single integer m. For example, in the first sample, input is 1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. In the second sample, input is 5, output is 0.\n\nBut the user provided sample input is ['1', '5'], which may be a way of representing two test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. Therefore, perhaps the original problem is to read a single m, but the sample shows two test cases. But the problem's note says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first input is 1, and the second is 5. So the code should read one line of input, which is m.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the output is given as two lines. So perhaps the original problem is to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. Therefore, I need to check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo, the input is a single integer m. The sample input shows two cases, perhaps because the problem is presented as a multi-test case scenario. But the code should read a single m. So, the sample input is perhaps a way to show that for m=1, the output is the first line, and for m=5, the output is the second line. But in the actual code, the program should read a single m from input.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read from standard input. So, in the code, we need to read a single integer m.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is given as two lines, but perhaps that's a mistake. Because the problem says that the input is a single integer. So the code should read m from stdin.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute the answer for m.\n\nPrint k followed by the numbers.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead m as integer.\n\nImplement the functions as discussed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut let's code the functions.\n\nFirst, the count_zeros function.\n\nThen, binary search functions.\n\nBut for the binary search, the upper bound is 5*m. However, for m=100000, 5*m is 500000. Which is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n_ge(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\ndef find_min_n_gt(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) > m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nThen, the main code:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n_ge(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n_gt(m)\n    numbers = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n    print(len(numbers))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input, m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So the code would print len(numbers) which is 5, then the numbers. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple numbers, but the code returns the list?\n\nBut for example, when m=5, the code returns 0.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's only one n? Like, for example, m=24. Suppose there's only one n. Wait, no. Because for m=24, the numbers are 100, 101, 102, 103, 104. Which is 5 numbers. So the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if there's a case where there is only one number? For example, when m is such that the count increases by more than 1. For example, m=24, but suppose that the count jumps from 24 to 26. Then, there is no n with count 25, but for m=24, there are 5 numbers. But for m=25, there's no solution.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, testing for m=5.\n\nn_low is find_min_n_ge(5). Let's see:\n\nbinary search for m=5.\n\nlow starts at 0, high is 25.\n\nLet me simulate the binary search for find_min_n_ge(5):\n\nInitially, low=0, high=25.\n\nmid = (0+25)/2 = 12. count_zeros(12) is 2 (12//5=2, 12//25=0). 2 <5 → set low=13.\n\nNext iteration: low=13, high=25. mid=19. count_zeros(19) is 3 (19//5=3). Still <5. low=20.\n\nlow=20, high=25. mid=22. count_zeros(22)=4. Still <5. low=23.\n\nmid=(23+25)/2=24. count_zeros(24)=4. low=25.\n\nNow, low=25, high=25. Exit loop. Return 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25)=6 !=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. n_low=25. count_zeros(25)=6. Then find_min_n_gt(6) is 30. So numbers are 25-29, which is 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code in Python. But for very large m, say m=1e5, the code must run efficiently. Let's think about the time complexity.\n\nThe count_zeros function runs in O(log n) time, since each step divides by 5. For binary search, each step is O(log (5m)) steps. So for each binary search, O(log (5m)) steps, each with O(log n) steps. So overall, O( (log m)^2 ) time, which is acceptable for m up to 1e5.\n\nBut for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. The binary search for find_min_n_ge would take log2(5e5) steps, which is around 19 steps. Each step calls count_zeros which takes log5(5e5) steps. Which is about 6 steps. So total steps are acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin and write to stdout. Also, for cases where the numbers list is empty (but that's handled by the check if count_zeros(n_low) != m).\n\nBut what about when the numbers list is empty? For example, when m=5, the code returns 0.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1.\n\nCode outputs 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSample Input 2: m=5. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=24. The code would return 5 numbers: 100-104.\n\nBut let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(100) = 24.\n\ncount_zeros(104) = 104//5=20, 104//25=4, 104//125=0. Sum 24. So yes.\n\ncount_zeros(105) = 21 + 4 =25. So n_high is 105. So numbers from 100 to 104. Correct.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut in Python, for m=0, but the problem says m is at least 1, so no need to handle.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list, but in reality, the code should read from stdin. For example, in the first sample input, the user inputs 1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code must read from stdin. So:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n_ge(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\ndef find_min_n_gt(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) > m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n_ge(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n_gt(m)\n    numbers = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n    print(len(numbers))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. The code prints len(numbers) which is 5, then the numbers. So the code would output:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct. However, the sample output shows the first line as '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is the same as the code's output.\n\nBut in Python, when you print(len(numbers)), then print the list, it will print the len on one line, and the numbers on the next line. Which is correct.\n\nBut the sample output shows for the first input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is exactly what the code does.\n\nBut the sample shows that for input 5, output is '0' — which is correct.\n\nBut for cases where the list is empty, the code prints 0.\n\nBut what if the list is empty? For example, when m=5, the code outputs 0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, the problem says m is at least 1, so no need to handle.\n\nAnother test case: m=2. The code should output 5 numbers: 10-14.\n\nAnother test case: m=3, output 5 numbers 15-19.\n\nAnother test case: m=4. Let's see.\n\ncount_zeros(20) is 20//5 + 20//25 = 4 + 0 =4. count_zeros(24) is 4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So for m=4, the numbers are 20-24. So 5 numbers. So code would output 5 and the numbers.\n\nThus, code works.\n\nNow, the code is ready.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of values for $ n $ that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of 5s dictates the number of trailing zeros.\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: We use binary search to find the smallest number $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros is at least $ m $ (denoted as `n_low`). Then, we find the smallest number $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros exceeds $ m $ (denoted as `n_high`). The range of valid $ n $ values lies between `n_low` and `n_high - 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n_ge(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef find_min_n_gt(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) > m:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\nn_low = find_min_n_ge(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n_gt(m)\n    numbers = list(range(n_low, n_high))\n    print(len(numbers))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5, 25, 125, etc., and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n_ge Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least $ m $.\n3. **find_min_n_gt Function**: This function similarly uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ exceeds $ m $.\n4. **Main Logic**: After determining the valid range of $ n $ values using the above functions, we check if the count of trailing zeros at `n_low` is exactly $ m $. If not, we output 0. Otherwise, we generate the list of valid $ n $ values and print them.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation using binary search, making it suitable even for large values of $ m $ up to 100,000.",
