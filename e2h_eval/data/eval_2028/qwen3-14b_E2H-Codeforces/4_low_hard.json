The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Nikephoros and Polycarpus play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Their moves are determined by their respective sequences A and B, which repeat cyclically. I have to find out how many times each of them gets pinched (i.e., loses a round).\n\nThe input is n, then the two sequences A and B. The output is two numbers: the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to model their moves. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what move each player makes. For Nikephoros, his move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nBut since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round one by one is impossible. That would take O(n) time, which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key is to find patterns or cycles that repeat, so that we can compute the number of losses in each cycle and multiply by the number of cycles, then add the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think: The sequences A and B repeat every m and k rounds respectively. So the combined pattern of their moves repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so their moves will start repeating.\n\nSo, the idea is:\n\n- Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period. Then, for each period, we can compute how many times each player loses in that period. Then, multiply by the number of full periods in n rounds, and then add the result from the remaining rounds (n % period).\n\nBut first, we need to compute for each possible round in the period (from 0 to period-1), what the outcome is. Then, for each full period, we can accumulate the counts.\n\nBut how to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but that returns positive integers, and for Python 3.5+ it's in math. But since m and k are positive, that's okay.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that for n up to 2e9, and m and k up to 1000, the LCM could be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000=1e6). So even if the LCM is 1e6, then for each period, we can precompute the number of losses for each player. Then, total number of full periods is total = n // period, and the remainder is rem = n % period. So total * (losses per period) plus the losses in rem rounds.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\n1. Compute m = len(A), k = len(B). Compute period = LCM(m, k).\n\n2. Precompute for each of the period rounds (from 0 to period-1) what the outcome is. For each round i in 0..period-1:\n\n   a. Get A_move = A[i % m]\n\n   b. Get B_move = B[i % k]\n\n   c. Determine who wins, if anyone.\n\n   d. Count how many times Nikephoros loses (so that's Polycarpus's win) and vice versa.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full periods is full = n // period. The remaining rounds are rem = n % period.\n\n4. The total losses for Nikephoros is full * (number of losses in one period for him) + the number of losses in the first rem rounds of the period.\n\nSame for Polycarpus.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing for each of the period rounds, the count of losses for each player, and then multiply by full and add the rem part.\n\nNow, how to compute the outcome between two moves?\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes two characters (a and b) and returns who wins. For example:\n\nIf a beats b, then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot. If b beats a, then Nikephoros loses, so he gets a spot. If it's a draw, nothing.\n\nSo the helper function can return:\n\n- 0 if draw\n\n- 1 if Nikephoros wins (so Polycarpus gets a spot)\n\n- -1 if Nikephoros loses (so Nikephoros gets a spot)\n\nWait, no. Let's think: For each round, if Nikephoros's move beats Polycarpus's move, then Polycarp",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player (Nikephoros and Polycarpus) loses in a series of rock-paper-scissors rounds, given their respective cyclic move sequences. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results for a potentially very large number of rounds (up to 2 billion) without simulating each round individually.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cycles**: Each player's moves repeat cyclically based on their respective sequences. The combined cycle of both players' moves repeats every Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences.\n2. **Precompute Outcomes**: Calculate the outcomes for each round within one full cycle (LCM of the sequence lengths). This allows us to determine how many times each player loses in one full cycle.\n3. **Scale Up Using Full Cycles**: Use the precomputed results from one full cycle to quickly determine the number of losses over multiple full cycles.\n4. **Handle Remaining Rounds**: After accounting for all full cycles, handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n        return (0, 1)\n    else:\n        # Nikephoros loses, he gets a spot\n        return (1, 0)\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    period = (m * k) // gcd_val\n    \n    # Precompute for each round in the period\n    nikephoros_loss = 0\n    polycarpus_loss = 0\n    for i in range(period):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        res = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n        nikephoros_loss += res[0]\n        polycarpus_loss += res[1]\n    \n    full = n // period\n    rem = n % period\n    \n    total_nike = full * nikephoros_loss\n    total_poly = full * polycarpus_loss\n    \n    # Compute the remaining rounds\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        res = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n        total_nike += res[0]\n        total_poly += res[1]\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nike} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences is calculated to determine the period after which the combined moves of both players repeat.\n3. **Precompute Outcomes**: For each round within one full cycle, the result of the round is determined, and the number of losses for each player is counted.\n4. **Full Cycles Handling**: The number of full cycles within the total number of rounds is calculated, and the losses from these cycles are scaled up using the precomputed values.\n5. **Remaining Rounds Handling**: Any remaining rounds after the full cycles are processed individually to account for the final partial cycle.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the results even for very large numbers of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the players' move sequences.",
