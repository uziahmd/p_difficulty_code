After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters. Each character is a digit from 1-9. So, for example, if the input is '223', that's the marks for the first student in each subject.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. For each subject (columns), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if there's at least one subject where their mark equals the maximum for that subject.\n3. Count how many students meet this condition.\n\nWait, right. So the steps would be:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the next n lines as a list of strings. Each string represents a student's marks.\n- For each column (subject), find the maximum value. For example, for the first sample input, the first subject (first column) has 2, 2, 1. The max is 2. So any student with 2 in that column is considered best for that subject. But wait, the first student has 2 in first subject, second student also has 2. So both are best in that subject. But the first sample says student 1 is best in subjects 1 and 3, student 2 in 1 and 2. Let me check the first sample input again.\n\nSample input 1:\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nSo the students' marks are:\n\nStudent 1: [2,2,3]\nStudent 2: [2,3,2]\nStudent 3: [1,1,2]\n\nFor each subject:\n\nSubject 1 (column 0): 2,2,1 → max is 2. So students 1 and 2 are best here.\nSubject 2 (column 1): 2,3,1 → max is 3. Only student 2 has this.\nSubject 3 (column 2): 3,2,2 → max is 3. Only student 1 has this.\n\nSo student 1 is best in subject 3, student 2 in subject 2 and 1. Wait, but the note says student 1 is best in subjects 1 and 3. Wait why? Because for subject 1, student 1 has 2, which is the maximum. So student 1 is best in subject 1. Student 2 also has 2 in subject 1, so they are also best in that subject. So for the first sample, student 1 is best in subject 1 and 3. Student 2 is best in subject 1 and 2. Student 3 isn't best in any. So the total successful students is 2 (student 1 and 2). Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the way to approach this is:\n\nFor each subject (each column), find the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if in any of the columns, their mark in that column is equal to the maximum of that column. If yes, then they are successful.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nFirst, process the input into a 2D array. Let's think about the data structure. For example, for the first sample, the data would be:\n\nstudents = [\n    [2,2,3],\n    [2,3,2],\n    [1,1,2]\n]\n\nThen, for each column j (from 0 to m-1), compute the max value. Let's create a list called max_per_subject, where max_per_subject[j] is the maximum value for subject j.\n\nOnce we have that, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max_per_subject for that column. If at least one exists, count them.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. Convert each string into a list of integers. So for each line, we can process it as a list of digits. For example, '223' becomes [2,2,3].\n\nOnce we have the 2D list, then for each column j, compute the max.\n\nThen, for each student in the list, check for each column j if their value is equal to max_per_subject[j]. If any of them is true, then the student is successful.\n\nNow, how to compute the max per subject?\n\nFor each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_val = max( students[i][j] for i in 0..n-1 )\n\nSo for each j, loop through all students and get their j-th mark, then take max.\n\nOnce we have that, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max for that column.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nLet's think about code structure.\n\nRead n and m:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen read n lines:\n\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nThen compute max_per_subject:\n\nmax_per_subject = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grades[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = grades[i][j]\n    max_per_subject.append(max_val)\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\nYes, that's possible.\n\nOnce we have that, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the max_per_subject for that column.\n\nSo for each student in grades:\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nThen print(count)\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, m=3\n\ngrades:\nstudent 0: [2,2,3]\nstudent 1: [2,3,2]\nstudent 2: [1,1,2]\n\nmax_per_subject:\n\nfor j=0: max(2,2,1) = 2\nj=1: max(2,3,1) =3\nj=2: max(3,2,2) =3\n\nso max_per_subject = [2,3,3]\n\nCheck each student:\n\nstudent 0: check each column:\n\nj=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: j=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: check columns:\n\nj=0: 1 <2 → no. j=1: 1 <3 → no. j=2: 2 <3 → no. So no. So not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2 → correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=3, m=5\n\ngrades:\n\nstudent 0: 9,1,7,2,8 → [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudent 1: 1,1,8,2,8 → [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent 2: 1,1,1,1,1 → [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_per_subject for each column:\n\nj=0: max(9,1,1) →9\n\nj=1: max(1,1,1) →1\n\nj=2: max(7,8,1) →8\n\nj=3: max(2,2,1) →2\n\nj=4: max(8,8,1) →8\n\nso max_per_subject is [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nCheck each student:\n\nstudent 0:\n\ncheck each column:\n\nj=0: 9 ==9 → yes. So counted.\n\nstudent 1:\n\ncheck columns:\n\nj=0: 1 <9 → no. j=1: 1 ==1 → yes. So counted.\n\nstudent 2:\n\ncheck columns:\n\nj=0: 1 <9 → no. j=1: 1 ==1 → yes. So counted.\n\nThus total 3 → correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, m=1. Then the student is successful.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, m=1. Both have same marks. Then both are successful.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. All marks are 5. So all students are successful.\n\nAnother case: all students have same marks. Then each student is successful, since for each subject, they have the maximum (since all are same).\n\nSo code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a list of strings. For example, the first input is given as:\n\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given via standard input. So the code must read from stdin. However, in the example, the input is given as a list of strings, but perhaps that's just for the test cases. The actual code should read from stdin.\n\nSo the code will read from stdin, for example, the first line is n and m, then n lines of m digits.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of m digits.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. For each line, convert into a list of integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but for the code, the max_per_subject is computed as for each column j, the max of all students' j-th marks.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the first sample:\n\nSample input:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\ngrades is [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_per_subject for j=0: max(2,2,1) =2. j=1: max(2,3,1)=3. j=2: max(3,2,2)=3.\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0: 2,2,3 → check j=0: 2 ==2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: 2,3,2 → j=0: 2 ==2 → yes. count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: 1,1,2 → none of the columns match. So no.\n\nTotal 2 → correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\n3 5\n\n91728 → [9,1,7,2,8]\n\n11828 → [1,1,8,2,8]\n\n11111 → [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_per_subject is for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9,1,1 →9.\n\ncolumn 1: 1,1,1 →1.\n\ncolumn 2: 7,8,1 →8.\n\ncolumn 3: 2,2,1 →2.\n\ncolumn 4: 8,8,1 →8.\n\nSo for each student:\n\nstudent 0: 9 in column 0 → yes. counted.\n\nstudent 1: column 1 is 1 (max is 1) → yes. counted.\n\nstudent 2: column 1 is 1 → yes. counted.\n\nTotal 3 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1. Input is 1 1 followed by 5. Then the code returns 1.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1. Input is 2 1, then 5 and 5. Then the max_per_subject is 5. Both students have 5, so both are counted. Output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. All marks are 5. Then for each column, max is 5. Each student has 5 in all columns. So each student is counted once. So total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, code-wise, what about when m is 0? Well, according to the constraints, m is at least 1. Because the input says 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100. So no problem.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their performance in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input:** First, read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then, read the gradebook which consists of n lines, each containing m digits representing the marks of students in different subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject:** For each subject (column in the gradebook), compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n3. **Identify Successful Students:** For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in at least one subject. If they do, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngrades = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    grades.append(row)\n\nmax_per_subject = [max(grades[i][j] for i in range(n)) for j in range(m)]\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in grades:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_per_subject[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read and converted into a 2D list where each sublist represents the marks of a student across all subjects.\n2. **Maximum Marks Calculation:** For each subject (column), the maximum mark is determined. This helps in identifying the best student(s) for each subject.\n3. **Checking Successful Students:** Each student is checked against the maximum marks of each subject. If a student's mark in any subject matches the maximum for that subject, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum values for each subject, resulting in an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).",
