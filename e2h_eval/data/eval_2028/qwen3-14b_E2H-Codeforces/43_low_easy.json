He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps.\n\nSo the process is: A starts with some number of 'a's. Then B adds some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C adds 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. And the final string is what we're checking.\n\nSo the steps for validation would be:\n\nFirst, check the order of characters. Because the original string must have all 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because A adds a's, then B adds b's, then C adds c's. So the string must be in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's. If there's any 'a' after 'b's or 'c's, that's invalid. Similarly for 'b's after 'c's.\n\nSo first, I need to check that the string is in the form of a group of a's, then b's, then c's. Like, the characters should not be out of order. For example, 'abba' would be invalid because after the initial 'a's and 'b's, there's another 'a'.\n\nSo how to check that? Well, the string should be a sequence where all a's come before any b's, and all b's come before any c's. So the string can be divided into three parts: a's, then b's, then c's. So, for example, the string can have only a's (but then there's no b's, which would be invalid since B added some b's). Or only a's and b's (but then C added some c's, so the string must have at least some c's? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. But the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. So the final string must have at least one 'c'? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says that when B appends the 'b's, he ensures that there's at least one 'a' and 'b' in the string. Then C appends some 'c's. So the final string must have at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'? Wait, no. Because the original string after B's step has at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C adds some 'c's. So the final string will have at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c's. Because C adds some number of 'c's. But the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. So \"some number\" implies that it's at least one? Or could it be zero?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" The word \"some\" here might imply that it's at least one. But looking at the note for the third example, 'aabc' is considered valid. Let's see: in that example, the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'b's. Let's count. The string is 'aabc', which has two a's, one b, and one c. So the number of c's is 1, which equals the number of b's (1). So that's allowed. So in this case, the number of c's is 1. So C added one 'c'.\n\nBut what if C added zero? Let's think. Suppose the original string after B's step is 'ab' (with one a and one b). Then C appends zero 'c's. Then the final string would be 'ab', which has no 'c's. However, according to the problem statement, the final string must have 'c's. Because the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. But maybe the problem allows zero? Wait, the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. The problem says \"some number\", but in programming terms, that could be zero or more. But wait, the problem says that C is a good friend and the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's. So if the number of 'c's is zero, then that would require that the number of 'a's or 'b's is zero. But since after B's step, the string has at least one 'a' and one 'b', then the number of 'a's and 'b's are both at least 1. So C can't append zero 'c's. Because that would require that the number of 'c's is zero, which must be equal to the number of 'a's or 'b",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in a defined order. The string must be composed of some number of 'a's followed by some number of 'b's and then some number of 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must match either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order of Characters**: The string must be composed of all 'a's followed by all 'b's followed by all 'c's. Any deviation from this order makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure that the count of 'c's is equal to either the count of 'a's or 'b's. Additionally, ensure that there is at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c' in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check the order of characters: all a's first, then b's, then c's\n    # We can iterate through the string and ensure that once we see a 'b', no 'a' comes after,\n    # and once we see a 'c', no 'a' or 'b' comes after.\n    # Also, check that there is at least one 'a', 'b', and 'c'\n    \n    has_a = has_b = has_c = False\n    for char in s:\n        if char == 'a':\n            if has_b or has_c:\n                return False\n            has_a = True\n        elif char == 'b':\n            if has_c:\n                return False\n            has_b = True\n        elif char == 'c':\n            has_c = True\n    \n    if not (has_a and has_b and has_c):\n        return False\n    \n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    return count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    s = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    if is_valid_string(s):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The function `is_valid_string` first checks if the characters are in the correct order. It ensures that once a 'b' or 'c' is encountered, no 'a' follows, and once a 'c' is encountered, no 'b' follows.\n2. **Presence Check**: It verifies that the string contains at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'.\n3. **Count Validation**: It counts the occurrences of each character and checks if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's.\n\nThis approach ensures that the string meets all the constraints specified in the problem, efficiently checking both the structure and the counts of characters.",
