    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0s and 2s directly. Hmm.\n\nSo, what's allowed? Let me think. The swaps allowed are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). So, for example, 0s can move past 1s, but not past 2s. Similarly, 2s can move past 1s but not past 0s. Wait, but how does that affect the ordering?\n\nLet me think about the relative order of the characters. Since 0 can be swapped with 1, but not with 2. So, 0s can move past 1s, but not past 2s. Similarly, 2s can move past 1s but not past 0s. So, the 0s can be arranged among themselves and with 1s, but 2s can be arranged among themselves and with 1s. However, 0s and 2s can't be swapped. So, the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string must remain the same? Or maybe not exactly, but they can't cross each other.\n\nWait, for example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, we can't swap them. So, the 0 will stay before the 2. Similarly, if there's a 2 followed by a 0, they can't be swapped. So the relative positions of 0s and 2s in the original string are fixed. Because you can't swap them. So the 0s and 2s can't cross each other. So the original positions of 0s and 2s determine their order in the final string. But the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but how? For example, suppose the original string is \"02\". We can't swap them. So the final string remains \"02\". If it's \"20\", same thing. But if the string is \"012\", then the 0 can move past the 1, and the 2 can move past the 1. So the 1 can be moved between 0 and 2. So, for example, the original string is \"012\" can be transformed into \"021\" (by swapping 1 and 2) or \"102\" (by swapping 0 and 1), etc. But the 0 and 2 can't cross each other. So the 0s and 2s' relative positions are fixed. So, the 0s and 2s in the original string can't be reordered. But the 1s can be moved around between them.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: arrange the 0s and 2s in their original order, but arrange the 1s in between them as much as possible to make the lex smallest string.\n\nWait, but how to arrange the 1s. Since the 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. So, for example, all the 1s can be grouped together. But where?\n\nLet me think. Let's take an example. Suppose the original string is '100210'. The output is '001120'. Let me see. The original string is 1,0,0,2,1,0. The output is 0,0,1,1,2,0. So the 0s are first, then the 1s, then the 2, then the 0. But the original positions of 0s and 2s are such that the 0s are before the 2. So in the output, the 0s are first, then the 1s, then the 2, then the 0. So the 0s and 2s are in their original order. Wait, but the original string has two 0s, then a 2, then a 1, then a 0. So the 0s and 2s in the original string are in positions 0,1,3,5. Wait, the original string is 1,0,0,2,1,0. So the 0s are at positions 1, 2, 5. The 2 is at position 3. So the 0s and 2s in the original string are ordered as 0,0,2,0. So in the output, the 0s are first, then the 1s, then the 2, then the 0. Which preserves the order of the 0s and 2s. So the 0s and 2s can't be reordered, but the 1s can be placed between them.\n\nSo the idea is that the 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order. But the 1s can be placed anywhere between them. So, how can we arrange the 1s to make the lex smallest string?\n\nThe lex smallest string would have as many 0s as possible at the beginning, then 1s, then 2s. But considering that the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So the problem is similar to grouping all 1s between the 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- The 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So, the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string must be preserved. So, for example, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, that 0 must come before that 2. Similarly for any other 0 and 2.\n\nBut the 1s can be moved freely between the 0s and 2s. So, for example, all 1s can be placed between the 0s and 2s. But how to arrange them optimally.\n\nSo the strategy would be to arrange the 1s in between the 0s and 2s. But since the 1s are smaller than 2s and larger than 0s, perhaps the best way is to place all the 1s between the 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, but how to model this.\n\nLet me think of the 0s and 2s as fixed in their order, and the 1s can be inserted between them. So for example, the original string is a sequence of 0s, 2s, and 1s. But the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So the final string would consist of the 0s and 2s in their original order, but with 1s inserted between them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the 0s and 2s as fixed in their order. So, for example, the original string can be viewed as a sequence of blocks of 0s and 2s, with 1s in between. But perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: since 0s can be moved past 1s, and 2s can be moved past 1s, but 0s and 2s cannot pass each other, the 1s can be moved anywhere between 0s and 2s. So, the 1s can be placed in any positions between the 0s and 2s.\n\nSo, the minimal lex string would be to arrange the 1s as early as possible. But how?\n\nWait, for example, suppose there's a 0 followed by a 2. Then, the 0 comes before the 2. But between them, we can insert 1s. But since 1 is larger than 0 and smaller than 2, putting 1s between them would be better than leaving them as 0 followed by 2. Wait, no. Because 0 followed by 1 followed by 2 is lex smaller than 0 followed by 2. So inserting 1s between 0 and 2 would make the string lex smaller.\n\nBut how can we arrange the 1s in between the 0s and 2s.\n\nSo, the overall idea is: the 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s. So, the minimal string is obtained by grouping all 1s together, and placing them in the earliest possible position where they can be placed. But how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the 0s and 2s as fixed in their order, and the 1s can be placed between them. So, the final string would be the 0s and 2s in their original order, but with all the 1s inserted between them. However, the 1s can be placed in between any of the 0s and 2s. So, the minimal lex string would be to arrange the 1s in between the 0s and 2s in a way that they are as left as possible.\n\nWait, but how to arrange that. Let's think of the 0s and 2s as fixed. For example, the original string is \"0 2\", then the 1s can be inserted between them. So the minimal string would be \"012\".\n\nBut if the original string is \"2 0\", then the 1s can't be inserted between them because the 2 is before the 0, and since they can't be swapped, so the 2 is before the 0. Then, the 1s can be inserted before the 2, or between 2 and 0, but inserting before the 2 would be better.\n\nWait, but the 1 can be moved to the left of the 2, since 1 can be swapped with 2. So, for example, if the original string is \"20\", then the 1s can't be inserted between them, but the 1s can be moved to the left of the 2, but how? Well, if there are 1s in the original string. For example, if the original string is \"210\", then the 1 can be moved left past the 2, but the 0 can't be moved past the 2. So, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 2, making the string \"120\".\n\nBut in the case of the original string being \"20\", there are no 1s. So the final string is \"20\".\n\nSo, the key idea is that the 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. So, the 1s can be placed anywhere in the string, except that they can't cross 0s and 2s. Wait, no. Wait, the 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. So, for example, a 1 can be moved to the left of a 0 (since 0 and 1 can be swapped), or to the right of a 0. Similarly, a 1 can be moved to the left of a 2 (since 1 and 2 can be swapped), or to the right of a 2.\n\nSo the 1s can be moved anywhere in the string, but the 0s and 2s can't cross each other. So, the 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s. Therefore, the optimal way is to arrange the 1s in between the 0s and 2s in such a way that the entire string is as small as possible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- All the 1s can be moved to the positions between the 0s and 2s. However, the 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order.\n\nTherefore, the minimal string is constructed by:\n\n- Collecting all the 0s and 2s in their original order, but inserting all the 1s in between them. However, the 1s can be placed in between any of the 0s and 2s. But where?\n\nWait, for example, consider the original string is '0 2 1 0 2 1 0 1 2'. Then, the 0s and 2s in the original order are 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2. The 1s can be inserted between them. So the minimal string would be 0 followed by all 1s, then 2, then all 1s, then 0, then all 1s, then 2, then 0, then 2. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, the 1s can be placed in between any of the 0s and 2s. But the best way to minimize the string is to have as many 1s as possible to the left of the 2s and to the right of the 0s.\n\nWait, but since 1 is larger than 0 and smaller than 2, inserting 1s between 0 and 2 is better than having 0 followed by 2. For example, 0 followed by 1 followed by 2 is better than 0 followed by 2.\n\nBut if we have multiple 0s and 2s, how to arrange the 1s?\n\nLet me think of the 0s and 2s as fixed in their order. Let's say the original string has some 0s and 2s, which we can think of as a sequence like [c_1, c_2, ..., c_k], where each c_i is either 0 or 2, and their order is fixed. Then, between these elements, we can insert the 1s. Also, before the first element and after the last element.\n\nBut how to insert the 1s optimally.\n\nThe minimal string would be achieved by inserting all the 1s in the earliest possible positions. Because 1 is larger than 0, but smaller than 2. So inserting 1s before a 2 would be better than inserting them after the 2. For example, if there's a 2 in the sequence, inserting the 1s before it would allow the 1s to be as left as possible, but since the 1s are after 0s and before 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal way is to group all the 1s between the 0s and 2s. For example, between any 0 and 2, the 1s can be placed. But how to arrange them to get the lex smallest.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal lex string would have all the 1s placed as left as possible. So, the 1s should be placed before any 2s. But also after 0s.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the 1s can be placed between any 0 and 2, but to get the lex smallest string, we want as many 1s as possible to be placed between 0s and 2s, but also arrange the 1s in such a way that they are as left as possible.\n\nBut how to model this. Let me think of the 0s and 2s as fixed in their order. For example, the sequence of 0s and 2s is S = [s_0, s_1, ..., s_m], where each s_i is 0 or 2. Now, between each pair of consecutive elements in S, we can insert some 1s. Also, before s_0 and after s_m.\n\nNow, to make the lex smallest string, we should insert all the 1s in the earliest possible positions. For example, between the 0s and 2s, inserting the 1s as early as possible.\n\nWait, but inserting 1s before the first element (which could be 0 or 2) may not be optimal. For example, if the first element is 0, inserting 1s before it would make the string start with 1s, which is worse than starting with 0s. So, the 1s should be inserted in positions where they don't come before 0s.\n\nSo, the optimal way is to insert all the 1s between the 0s and 2s. Let's think about the positions between the 0s and 2s.\n\nFor example, the sequence S is [0, 2, 0, 2]. The possible insertion points for the 1s are:\n\n- Before the first element (S[0] = 0)\n- Between S[0] and S[1] (between 0 and 2)\n- Between S[1] and S[2] (between 2 and 0)\n- Between S[2] and S[3] (between 0 and 2)\n- After S[3] (the last element is 2)\n\nBut inserting the 1s in the earliest possible positions where they are not before a 0.\n\nSo, for example, inserting the 1s between the 0 and 2 (position 1) would be better than inserting them after the 2 (position 4). Because inserting them between 0 and 2 makes the 1s appear earlier in the string, which is better.\n\nBut inserting the 1s between 2 and 0 (position 2) would lead to the 1s being after the 2, which is worse than inserting them before the 2.\n\nSo, the idea is: for each gap between the elements of S, decide where to insert the 1s. The gaps are:\n\n- Before the first element.\n- Between elements i and i+1 (for i from 0 to m-1).\n- After the last element.\n\nNow, for each of these gaps, we can insert some number of 1s. But the question is, which gaps should we choose to insert the 1s to get the lex smallest string.\n\nThe key observation is that inserting 1s in a gap that is between a 0 and a 2 (i.e., a 0 followed by a 2) is better than inserting them in a gap that is between a 2 and a 0. Also, inserting them in a gap that is before a 0 is worse than inserting them after the 0 (but before a 2).\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal strategy is to insert all the 1s in the earliest possible positions where they can be placed without being before a 0. Let's think about the following:\n\nThe 1s can be placed in any of the gaps, but the earliest possible positions where they are placed after 0s and before 2s.\n\nSo, for example, if the first element of S is a 0, then inserting the 1s between the first 0 and the next element (if it's a 2) is better than inserting them after the 2.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAnother approach: the 1s can be placed in any positions, but the lex smallest string is achieved when the 1s are placed as far to the left as possible, but not before any 0s. Because inserting 1s after 0s and before 2s gives a better result than inserting them after 2s.\n\nSo, the 1s should be placed in the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not cause them to be before any 0s. For example, if the first element of S is 0, then inserting the 1s between the 0 and the next element (if it's a 2) is better than inserting them after the 2.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Split the original string into two parts: the 0s and 2s, which are kept in their original order, and the 1s which can be inserted between them.\n\n2. Then, for the 1s, insert them in the earliest possible gaps between the 0s and 2s, where inserting them would not cause them to be before any 0s.\n\nBut how to determine where to insert them.\n\nLet me think of the 0s and 2s as a list. For example, if the original string is '100210', then the 0s and 2s are [0,0,2,0]. The 1s are [1,1].\n\nNow, the gaps are:\n\ngap 0: before the first 0.\n\ngap 1: between first 0 and second 0.\n\ngap 2: between second 0 and 2.\n\ngap 3: between 2 and 0.\n\ngap 4: after the 0.\n\nWe need to insert the 1s into these gaps. But inserting into gap 0 would put the 1s before the first 0, which is worse than inserting them after the 0. So, we should avoid inserting into gap 0 unless there's no other option. Similarly, inserting into gap 1 (between two 0s) would be better than inserting into gap 2 (between 0 and 2) only if the 1s are placed between the 0s, but since 1 is larger than 0, inserting between two 0s would make the string have 0s followed by 1s followed by 0s. Which is better than inserting between 0 and 2.\n\nWait, but inserting between two 0s would not affect the lex order as much. For example, if the original part is 0,0, and inserting 1s between them would create 0,1,0. But the original part is 0,0. The lex order of 0,1,0 is worse than 0,0,1. Wait, but the 1s can be inserted in between the two 0s. However, since the 0s are in their original order, inserting 1s between them would allow the 1s to be placed in between. But why would that help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to insert all the 1s in the earliest possible position where inserting them doesn't cause them to be before any 0s. That earliest possible position is the first gap that is between a 0 and a 2, or after a 0 but before a 2.\n\nSo, for example, in the list of 0s and 2s, the first occurrence of a 0 followed by a 2. Insert the 1s there.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 0s and 2s as a sequence. The 1s can be inserted in any of the gaps between them. However, to make the lex smallest string, the 1s should be placed as left as possible, but not before any 0s. So, the earliest possible gap where inserting the 1s would not be before any 0s is the first gap that is either between a 0 and a 2, or between a 0 and something else (but since the 0s and 2s are fixed, the only possibilities are between 0 and 2, 2 and 0, 0 and 0, or 2 and 2).\n\nWait, the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So, for example, if the sequence is [0,0,2,0], the gaps are between the elements. The first gap is before the first 0. The second is between the two 0s. Third is between 0 and 2. Fourth between 2 and 0. Fifth after the 0.\n\nNow, inserting the 1s into the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not be before any 0s. So, inserting them into the first gap that is after a 0. So, the first gap that is after the first 0 is between the first 0 and second 0. But inserting there would be between two 0s. Which is allowed. However, inserting the 1s there would make the string have 0, 1, 0, ... which is worse than inserting them between the 0 and 2. Because inserting between 0 and 2 would have 0, 1, 2, ... which is better than 0, 0, 1, 2, ... ?\n\nWait, no. For example, if the original sequence is [0, 2], and the 1s are inserted between them, the string becomes 0,1,2. Which is better than inserting them after the 2 (which would be 0,2,1). So inserting between 0 and 2 is better.\n\nBut inserting between two 0s would be 0,1,0, ... which is worse than inserting them between the 0 and 2.\n\nSo the optimal approach is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible positions that are between a 0 and a 2. If there are no such positions, then insert them between 0s or after 0s (but before 2s).\n\nAlternatively, the 1s should be inserted in the earliest possible gaps that are between a 0 and a 2. If there are none, then insert them in the earliest possible gaps that are after a 0 (like between two 0s, or after the last 0).\n\nWait, but how to find those gaps.\n\nAnother idea: the 1s can be placed in any gaps except those that are before any 0s. Because inserting before a 0 would make the 1s appear before the 0s, which would make the string lex larger than if the 0s were first.\n\nSo, the earliest possible gaps where inserting the 1s is allowed are the first gap that is after the first 0. For example, the first gap that is not before any 0s.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nLet me think of the list of 0s and 2s. The first element can be 0 or 2.\n\nCase 1: the first element is 0. Then, the earliest possible gap to insert the 1s is the first gap (before the first element) is not allowed. So the earliest allowed gap is between the first 0 and the next element. However, the next element could be 0 or 2.\n\nIf the next element is 0, then inserting between them would be allowed. But inserting between two 0s would create 0,1,0. Which is worse than inserting between a 0 and a 2. So perhaps the optimal is to insert the 1s in the earliest possible gaps that are between a 0 and a 2.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\nCollect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Then, collect all the 1s.\n\nThen, insert all the 1s into the earliest possible positions between the 0s and 2s. Specifically, between any 0 and 2 (i.e., where the current element is 0 and the next is 2). If there are multiple such positions, insert all the 1s into the earliest one. If there are no such positions, insert them into the earliest possible positions where inserting them won't put them before a 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the example where the 0s and 2s are [0,0,2,0]. The 1s are [1,1].\n\nThe earliest 0 followed by 2 is between index 1 and 2 (elements 0 and 2). So inserting the 1s there would give 0,0,1,1,2,0. Which is better than inserting them elsewhere. So that's the case.\n\nAnother example: if the 0s and 2s are [2, 0], then inserting the 1s between them would be between 2 and 0. But inserting the 1s there would give 2,1,0. But since 1 is less than 2, but greater than 0. However, the 2 is before the 0 in the original string, and can't be moved. So inserting the 1s between them would be better than inserting them after the 0. Because inserting between 2 and 0 would make the string 2,1,0. Whereas inserting after the 0 would make 2,0,1. Which is worse (since 2 is first, then 0, then 1. But 2 is higher than 2 in both cases. So comparing 2,1,0 vs 2,0,1. Which is lex smaller? The first character is 2 in both. Second character is 1 vs 0. 0 is smaller. So 2,0,1 is better. Therefore, inserting the 1s after the 0 is better than inserting between 2 and 0.\n\nSo this suggests that my previous idea is not correct.\n\nSo, what's the right way to decide where to insert the 1s.\n\nHmm. The problem is that inserting 1s between 2 and 0 would be worse than inserting them after the 0.\n\nSo, how to find the optimal positions to insert the 1s.\n\nPerhaps the optimal way is to insert all the 1s as early as possible, but considering that inserting them between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting them between a 2 and a 0, and inserting them after 0s is better than inserting them before 2s.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 1s as being able to be inserted in any of the gaps, but the best way to insert them is to have them as early as possible, but considering that the lex order depends on the characters around them.\n\nSo, for each gap, inserting the 1s into that gap would create a certain string. We need to choose the gaps to insert the 1s such that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\nBut since there are multiple gaps and multiple 1s, how to decide where to insert them.\n\nBut since the 1s are all the same, inserting them into the earliest possible gap that allows the lex smallest string.\n\nLet me think of the gaps in terms of their position in the string. For example, inserting the 1s into the earliest possible gap that is between a 0 and a 2, or between a 0 and something else (but not before a 0). \n\nAlternatively, the optimal insertion points are the positions where inserting the 1s would not cause them to be before any 0s, and the earliest possible such position.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nLet me think of the 0s and 2s as a list. For example, list S.\n\nWe can iterate through the list and find the first occurrence where the current element is 0 and the next is 2. Insert all the 1s there. If there is no such occurrence, then look for the first occurrence where the current element is 0 and the next is 0. Insert the 1s there. If there is no such occurrence, then look for the first occurrence where the current element is 2 and the next is 0. Insert the 1s there. Or maybe not?\n\nAlternatively, think of the 1s as being inserted into the earliest possible gap that is not before any 0s. The earliest such gap is the first gap that is not before any 0s.\n\nFor example, the first gap that is not before any 0s is the first gap after the first 0. If the first element of S is 0, then the first gap that is not before any 0s is the first gap (before the first element) is before the first 0, which is not allowed. The next gaps are between elements. For example, the first gap between elements (gap 1) is between the first 0 and the second element. If the second element is 0, then inserting there would be allowed. If it's 2, then inserting there is better.\n\nSo, the earliest possible gap to insert the 1s is the first gap that is after the first 0. So, the earliest gap after the first 0.\n\nOnce we find that, we insert all the 1s there.\n\nLet me test this with some examples.\n\nExample 1: S is [0, 0, 2, 0]. The first gap after the first 0 is between the first 0 and the second 0 (gap 1). Inserting the 1s there would give 0, 1s, 0, 2, 0. But inserting between 0 and 2 (gap 2) would give 0,0, 1s, 2, 0. Which is better? Let's compare:\n\nOriginal S is [0, 0, 2, 0]. Inserting 1s in gap 1 gives [0, 1s, 0, 2, 0]. Inserting in gap 2 gives [0, 0, 1s, 2, 0]. Which is better? The first string starts with 0, then 1s. The second starts with 0, 0. So the second is better. Because 0 is smaller than 1. So inserting the 1s later is better. So my previous idea of inserting into the earliest gap after the first 0 is incorrect.\n\nAh! So this shows that inserting the 1s as early as possible is not the right approach. Because inserting them between the two 0s would make the string start with 0, 1, which is worse than inserting them after the two 0s.\n\nWait, but the 1s are larger than 0. So inserting them after the 0s would be better. So, the earlier the 1s are inserted, the more they are before other characters. But since they are larger than 0, inserting them after the 0s would be better.\n\nSo the correct approach is to insert the 1s as late as possible, but not after any 2s. Because inserting them after 0s but before 2s would be better than inserting them after 2s.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Let me think again.\n\nThe goal is to have the lex smallest string. For the 1s, inserting them after 0s and before 2s is better than inserting them after the 2s. Also, inserting them after the 0s but before 2s is better than inserting them between 0s. Because inserting between 0s would create a 0, 1, 0, which is worse than 0, 0, 1, 2, 0.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal way is to insert all the 1s in the earliest possible position between a 0 and a 2. And if there is no such position, then insert them after all the 0s and before the 2s. Or insert them after the 0s and before the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, think of the 1s as being able to be placed in between the 0s and 2s. So, for example, if there is a 0 followed by a 2, insert all the 1s there. Otherwise, if there is a 0 followed by a 0, insert the 1s between the 0s. But that would be worse than inserting them after the 0s.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Maybe I should think of the problem differently.\n\nSince the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order, and the 1s can be placed anywhere between them, the minimal string is formed by placing all the 1s in between the 0s and 2s in a way that the 1s are as far to the left as possible, but not before any 0s.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nLet me think of the 0s and 2s as a sequence. For each 0 in this sequence, we can have some 1s after it, but before any 2 that comes after it.\n\nFor example, consider the sequence of 0s and 2s as [0, 0, 2, 0, 2]. The 1s should be placed after the first 0 and before the 2, and also after the third 0 and before the 2. This would give the minimal string.\n\nSo the idea is to insert the 1s between the 0s and the 2s that follow them. So, for every occurrence of 0 followed by 2 in the 0/2 sequence, insert the 1s between them.\n\nIf there are multiple such positions, insert all the 1s in the earliest one.\n\nBut if there are no such positions, then insert the 1s in the earliest possible gap that is after a 0 and before a 2.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal way is to insert all the 1s between the 0s and the 2s, and if there are no such positions, then insert them after all the 0s and before the 2s.\n\nWait, but how to determine this.\n\nLet me think of the 0s and 2s as a list. Let's imagine that we have a list of 0s and 2s. For example, let's say the list is S = [s_0, s_1, ..., s_n]. Now, we need to insert the 1s in such a way that the overall string is minimized.\n\nThe key observation is that 1s are larger than 0s and smaller than 2s. So, inserting a 1 between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting it after the 2. Also, inserting a 1 between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting it between two 0s. Because inserting between two 0s would make the string have 0,1,0, which is worse than 0,0,1,2.\n\nSo, the optimal way is to find the earliest occurrence of a 0 followed by a 2 in the S list, and insert all the 1s there. If there are no such occurrences, then insert the 1s after the last 0 and before the first 2, if any. Or if there are no 2s, insert them after all the 0s. If there are no 0s, insert them before the first 2.\n\nBut how to handle cases where there are",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing allowed swaps on a ternary string consisting of '0', '1', and '2'. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1' or between adjacent '1' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: \n   - '0' can be swapped with '1', but not with '2'.\n   - '1' can be swapped with '2', but not with '0'.\n   - '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly.\n   \n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - The relative order of '0's and '2's in the original string must remain unchanged because they cannot be swapped directly.\n   - '1's can be moved freely between '0's and '2's. Thus, we can strategically place all '1's in positions that minimize the lexicographical order.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Extract all '0's and '2's from the input string while preserving their order.\n   - Collect all '1's from the input string.\n   - Insert all '1's into the earliest possible position between a '0' and a '2' in the sequence of '0's and '2's. If no such position exists, insert them at the end of the sequence of '0's and '2's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimum_ternary_string(s):\n    zeros_and_twos = []\n    ones = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '1':\n            ones.append('1')\n        else:\n            zeros_and_twos.append(char)\n    \n    # Find the first occurrence where a '0' is followed by a '2'\n    insert_pos = -1\n    for i in range(len(zeros_and_twos) - 1):\n        if zeros_and_twos[i] == '0' and zeros_and_twos[i+1] == '2':\n            insert_pos = i + 1\n            break\n    \n    # If there's no such position, insert after the last '0' (if any)\n    if insert_pos == -1:\n        # Check if there are any '0's\n        has_zero = False\n        for c in zeros_and_twos:\n            if c == '0':\n                has_zero = True\n                break\n        if has_zero:\n            # Insert after the last '0'\n            for i in range(len(zeros_and_twos)-1, -1, -1):\n                if zeros_and_twos[i] == '0':\n                    insert_pos = i + 1\n                    break\n        else:\n            # All are '2's, insert at the beginning\n            insert_pos = 0\n    \n    # Now, insert the ones\n    result = zeros_and_twos[:insert_pos] + ones + zeros_and_twos[insert_pos:]\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input and process each test case\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    test_cases = input_str.split()\n    for case in test_cases:\n        print(minimum_ternary_string(case))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Extracting Characters**: We separate the input string into two parts: one containing only '0's and '2's (preserving their order) and another containing all '1's.\n- **Finding Insertion Point**: We look for the first occurrence of a '0' followed by a '2' in the sequence of '0's and '2's.
