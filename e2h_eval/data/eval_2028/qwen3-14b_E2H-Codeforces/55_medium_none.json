    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0 and 2 directly. Hmm.\n\nSo the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1, and between 1 and 2. That means that 0s can move past 1s, and 1s can move past 2s. But 0s can't move past 2s. Wait, but maybe through some chain of swaps? Like if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, maybe the 0 can move past the 1 and then the 1 can move past the 2, but that would allow the 0 to end up after the 2? No, wait. Because the 0 can only swap with 1s. So if there's a 0 and a 2 separated by some 1s, perhaps the 0 can move past the 1s and then the 1s can move past the 2s. Wait, but the 0 can't directly swap with the 2. So maybe the 0 can move to the left of the 1s, and the 1s can move to the right of the 2s. So the 0 can be moved to the left of the 2s, but only if there are 1s in between?\n\nWait, for example, if the string is 0 2, you can't swap them. But if it's 0 1 2, then the 0 can swap with the 1 (so 1 0 2), then the 1 can swap with the 2 (so 1 2 0). Then the 0 is after the 2. But how does that help? So in this case, the 0 can end up after the 2. But in that scenario, the 0 is moving past the 1 and then the 1 moves past the 2. So the 0 can effectively move past the 2 via the 1. So maybe the order of 0s and 2s can be adjusted as long as there are 1s between them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that 0s can be moved past 1s, and 1s can be moved past 2s. Therefore, the relative order between 0s and 2s can't be changed. Wait, no. Because if there's a 0 and a 2, but they are separated by some 1s, then maybe the 0 can move to the right of the 1s, and the 1s can move to the left of the 2s. So the 0 can end up after the 2. But if there's no 1s between them, then they can't be swapped. So the 0s and 2s can be reordered only if there are 1s between them. But how does that affect the overall arrangement?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the problem again. The allowed swaps are:\n\n- Swap adjacent 0 and 1 (so 0 can move left or right through 1s)\n- Swap adjacent 1 and 2 (so 1 can move left or right through 2s)\n\nBut 0 and 2 cannot be swapped directly. However, if there's a sequence like 0 1 2, then we can swap 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2, then swap 1 and 2 to get 1 2 0. So the 0 can end up after the 2. But that would mean that 0 can be moved past 2 via the 1. But what if there's a 0 followed by a 2 with no 1s in between? Then they can't be swapped. So the relative positions of 0s and 2s can't be changed unless there are 1s between them.\n\nWait, but if there's a 0 followed by a 2, but there's a 1 somewhere else in the string. For example, 0 2 1. Then the 1 can move to the left of the 2, but then the 0 can't move past the 2. Or maybe not. Let's think. The 0 is at position 0, 2 at 1, 1 at 2. We can't swap the 0 and 2. But the 1 can be swapped with the 2 (since they are adjacent). So we can make it 0 1 2. Then the 0 can swap with the 1, making it 1 0 2. Then the 1 and 2 can be swapped again. So 1 2 0. Then the 0 is after the 2. So in this case, even though the original 0 and 2 were adjacent, but with the presence of a 1 elsewhere, we can arrange for the 0 to end up after the 2. So the original 0 and 2 can be reordered if there's a way to have 1s in between. \n\nBut this seems complicated. How can we model the allowed permutations of the characters?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that 0s can be moved past 1s, and 1s can be moved past 2s. Therefore, the relative order between 0s and 2s can be adjusted if there's a path of 1s. Wait, but if there's a 0 followed by a 2, but there are no 1s in between, then they can't be swapped. So the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. But if there are 1s in between, then perhaps the 0 can be moved to the right of the 2. So in the end, the 0s can be arranged in any order relative to the 2s, as long as there's a way to have 1s in between. But that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the order of 0s and 2s can be rearranged in any way, as long as the 1s are allowed to move between them. But I'm not sure. Let's think of an example. Suppose the string is \"02\". Since they can't be swapped, the minimal string is \"02\". But if the string is \"012\", then we can arrange to get \"012\" → \"021\" (by swapping 1 and 2) → \"021\" → then can we swap the 0 and 1? Well, in \"021\", the 0 is next to 2, which can't be swapped. But the 1 and 2 can be swapped again. So maybe the minimal string would be \"012\" → \"021\" → \"021\" can't be changed further. But maybe there's a better way. Wait, but the minimal lex string would be \"012\", since 0 is first, then 1, then 2. So that's already minimal. So the example shows that in some cases, you can't change the order of 0 and 2 if they are adjacent. But if there's a 1 between them, you can rearrange them. \n\nSo perhaps the conclusion is that the relative order between 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because 0 can't pass through 2. So if there's a 0 before a 2, then in the minimal string, that 0 must remain before the 2. But that's not true. Because in the example of 0 1 2, the 0 can be moved past the 1 and then the 1 can be moved past the 2. So the 0 can end up after the 2. Wait, but in that case, the 0 is after the 2. So the original order of 0 before 2 can be reversed. But how?\n\nLet me take that example. Original string is \"012\".\n\nWe can swap the 0 and 1 to get \"102\". Then swap the 1 and 2 to get \"120\". Then swap the 0 and 2? No, because they are not adjacent. But in this case, the 0 is at the end. So the final string is \"120\". But that's not helpful. However, the minimal lex string would be \"012\" which is already the original. So perhaps the minimal string is achieved by arranging the 0s and 1s as much as possible, and the 1s and 2s as much as possible, but keeping the 0s before the 2s? Or not?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of the allowed swaps in terms of grouping.\n\nSince 0s can be moved past 1s, but not past 2s. Similarly, 1s can be moved past 2s but not past 0s. So, for example, all 0s can be moved to the left of any 1s, and all 1s can be moved to the left of any 2s. However, the 0s can't be moved past 2s. Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. So for example, if in the original string, there's a 0 before a 2, then in the final string, that 0 must remain before the 2. But if there's a 2 before a 0, then they can't be swapped, so the 2 remains before the 0. \n\nWait, but earlier example where the original string is 0 1 2. Then the 0 can be moved past the 1 to get 1 0 2, then the 1 can be moved past the 2 to get 1 2 0. So now, the 0 is after the 2. Which was originally before the 0. So this contradicts the previous idea. So that suggests that the relative order of 0s and 2s can be changed if there are 1s between them. So how is that possible?\n\nAh, because the 0 can move to the right of the 1, and the 1 can move to the left of the 2. So in this case, the 0 ends up after the 2. So the original 0 was before the 2, but after some swaps, it's after. So this suggests that the relative order of 0s and 2s can be changed if there are 1s between them. So that complicates things.\n\nSo perhaps the key is that the 0s can be ordered among themselves, and the 2s can be ordered among themselves, but the 1s can be moved between the 0s and 2s. So the 1s can be placed anywhere between 0s and 2s. But the 0s and 2s can be reordered as long as there are 1s in between. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of groups. Since 0s can be swapped with 1s, and 1s can be swapped with 2s, the 0s and 2s can be considered as being in different groups. But the 1s can be moved between the groups. Wait, perhaps the 0s can be arranged in any order relative to each other, the 2s can be arranged in any order relative to each other, and the 1s can be arranged in any order relative to each other. But the relative order between 0s and 2s can be adjusted if there are 1s in between. \n\nBut how can we find the minimal string? Let's think of the problem as trying to arrange the characters in such a way that:\n\n- All 0s come before 1s, and 1s come before 2s. But that's not possible if there are 1s that can be moved between 0s and 2s. But perhaps the minimal string would be to arrange all 0s first, then 1s, then 2s. But that's not always possible because of the constraints. Wait, but if you can arrange the 0s and 1s, and 1s and 2s, then perhaps you can arrange the entire string as 0s, then 1s, then 2s. Because:\n\n- For the 0s and 1s: you can arrange them in any order. So you can move all 0s to the front, then 1s, then 2s. Because the 0s can be moved past the 1s, and the 1s can be moved past the 2s. But how about the 0s and 2s? If you have a 0 and a 2, but there are 1s in between, then you can move the 0s to the left of the 1s, and the 1s to the left of the 2s. So the 0s would be before the 1s, which are before the 2s. So the 0s are before the 2s. So that would make the minimal string. But in the example where the original string is 0 1 2, the minimal string is already 012, which is sorted. But in the case where the original string is 2 0 1, then can we arrange it to be 0 1 2? Let's see. The original string is 2 0 1. The 0 and 1 can be swapped. So 2 0 1 → 2 1 0. Then, can we swap the 1 and 0? No, because they are 1 and 0, which are not allowed. Wait, the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), so yes. So 2 1 0 can be swapped to 2 0 1 again. So maybe I'm confused here.\n\nWait, the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent) and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). So in the case of 2 0 1, the 0 and 1 can be swapped. So the 0 and 1 can be moved past each other. But the 2 and 0 can't be swapped. So in this example, the 2 is fixed in place, and the 0 and 1 can be swapped. So the minimal string would be 0 1 2. But how?\n\nOriginal string is 2 0 1. How can we get to 0 1 2? Let's see. The 0 and 1 can be swapped to get 2 1 0. Then, the 1 and 2 can be swapped (they are adjacent) to get 1 2 0. Then the 0 and 2 can't be swapped, but the 2 and 0 can't be swapped. However, the 1 and 2 are adjacent. Wait, in 1 2 0, the 2 and 0 can't be swapped. But the 1 and 2 can be swapped again. So we can get back to 2 1 0. So it seems that the 0 can't be moved past the 2. So the minimal string for this case would be 0 1 2? But how can we get there?\n\nWait, maybe there's another approach. The original string is 2 0 1. The 0 can be moved to the left of the 2. But how? Because the 0 is adjacent to 2? No, in the original string, the 0 is after the 2. So the 0 is at position 1, 2 is at position 0. To move the 0 to the left, it would need to swap with the 2, which is not allowed. So the 0 can't move past the 2. Therefore, the 0 can't be moved to the left of the 2. So the minimal string is 0 1 2, but that's not possible. So the minimal string would be 0 1 2 if possible. Otherwise, the best we can do is 0 1 2? But how?\n\nWait, the original string is 2 0 1. How can we arrange the 0 to be before the 2? It seems impossible. Because the 0 is adjacent to the 1, but the 2 is before the 0. So the 0 can't move left past the 2. Therefore, the minimal string would be 0 1 2 if possible, but in this case, it's not. So the minimal string is 0 1 2? Or is it 0 1 2? Wait, no. The original string is 2 0 1. The 0 can be moved to the left of the 1, but the 2 is before it. So the minimal possible string would be 0 1 2? No, because the 2 can't be moved to the right of the 0. So the minimal string is 0 1 2? No, because the 2 is first. So the minimal possible is 0 1 2? How?\n\nWait, the original string is \"201\". The minimal possible string is \"012\"? How? Because the 0 is after the 2. So the first character is 2, but we can't move it. Because the 0 can't move past the 2. So the minimal possible string would be 0 1 2? But how? It seems impossible. So the answer would be \"012\" if we can arrange it. But how?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's think again. The original string is \"201\". The 0 is at position 1, and the 1 is at position 2. So we can swap the 0 and 1 (since they are adjacent) to get \"210\". Then, the 1 and 2 can be swapped (they are adjacent) to get \"120\". Now, the string is \"120\". The 0 is after the 2. But can we do anything else? The 0 is adjacent to the 2. But we can't swap them. So the string is \"120\", which is better than the original. But how to get \"012\"?\n\nIt's not possible. So the minimal possible string for \"201\" is \"012\"? No. Because the 2 can't be moved past the 0. So the minimal possible is \"012\" if possible, but in this case, it's not. So the minimal is \"012\"? No, the actual minimal possible is \"012\" if we can arrange it. But how?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that the 0 can't move past the 2. Let's think of another example. Suppose the string is \"201\". Let's try to move the 0 to the left of the 2. How?\n\nThe 0 is at position 1. The 2 is at position 0. To move the 0 left, it would need to swap with the 2. But that's not allowed. So no. Therefore, the 0 can't move left. Therefore, the minimal string would be the one where the 0 is as far left as possible, given the constraints.\n\nIn this case, the 0 is at position 1. Can it be moved to the left? Only if there's a 1 between the 2 and the 0. But there isn't. So no. Therefore, the minimal string is \"012\" if possible. But since it's not possible, the best we can do is \"012\"? Or not. Wait, the original string is \"201\", and the minimal possible is \"012\" if possible. But it's not possible. So what is the minimal possible?\n\nLet me think of all possible permutations that can be achieved. Starting with \"201\".\n\nPossible steps:\n\nSwap 0 and 1: \"210\".\n\nThen swap 1 and 2: \"120\".\n\nNow, can we do anything else? The 1 and 2 can be swapped again, but that would take us back to \"210\". Also, the 0 can't be moved further left. So the minimal possible is \"012\"? No, because we can't get there. So the minimal possible is \"012\" or \"021\" or something else?\n\nWait, the current string is \"120\". The lex order is \"120\", which is better than \"201\" but worse than \"012\". But how to get to \"012\"?\n\nIt's not possible. Therefore, the minimal possible string is \"012\" if we can arrange it, but in this case, we can't. So the minimal string is \"012\" is not possible, but the minimal achievable is \"012\" or something else?\n\nWait, what's the minimal string possible for \"201\"? Let's see:\n\nThe options are:\n\n- \"012\": not possible.\n\n- \"021\": not possible.\n\n- \"102\": can we get there?\n\nOriginal string: \"201\" → \"210\" → \"120\" → can't get to \"102\".\n\nAlternatively, is there a way to get the 0 to the left of the 2? Not that I can see.\n\nSo the minimal possible string would be \"012\" if possible, but since it's not, the next best is \"012\" is not possible, so the minimal is \"012\" or not. Wait, I'm confused. Let's think of the lex order of the possible strings.\n\nThe possible strings that can be achieved from \"201\" are:\n\n- \"201\" (original)\n\n- \"210\"\n\n- \"120\"\n\n- \"102\" ?\n\nWait, how can we get \"102\"?\n\nFrom \"201\", can we swap the 0 and 1 to get \"210\". Then swap the 1 and 2 to get \"120\". From there, can we swap the 0 and 1? The 0 is at position 2, and the 1 is at position 0. They are not adjacent. So no. So the possible strings are \"201\", \"210\", \"120\".\n\nWhich of these is the lex smallest? \"120\" is lex smaller than \"201\" and \"210\". So the answer for input \"201\" would be \"120\".\n\nBut according to the example given in the problem statement, when the input is \"20\", the output is \"20\". So that's correct. So in this case, the minimal string is \"120\".\n\nBut how does that fit into the overall strategy?\n\nSo the key seems to be that the 0s can be moved freely among themselves and past 1s, and the 1s can be moved freely among themselves and past 2s. However, the 0s cannot be moved past 2s. Therefore, the 2s can't be moved past 0s either. So the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string is preserved. Wait, but in the earlier example of \"012\", we could move the 0 to the right of the 2. So that contradicts that idea. So what's going on?\n\nAh, perhaps the relative order of 0s and 2s can be changed if there's a 1 between them. For example, the original string is \"0 1 2\". The 0 is before the 2, but with a 1 in between. So the 0 can move to the right of the 1, and the 1 can move to the right of the 2. So the 0 ends up after the 2. Thus, the relative order of the 0 and 2 is reversed. So the original order of 0 before 2 can be changed. So the initial assumption that the relative order between 0s and 2s is preserved is incorrect.\n\nThis complicates things. How can we model this?\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to think of the allowed swaps as allowing the following:\n\n- 0s can be reordered with each other, as long as they can move through 1s.\n\n- 2s can be reordered with each other, as long as they can move through 1s.\n\n- 1s can be reordered with each other, and also with 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, no. The 1s can be swapped with 0s and 2s. So the 1s can be moved around freely. But the 0s can't be moved past 2s, but can be moved past 1s, and 2s can be moved past 1s. So the 1s act as a bridge between 0s and 2s. So the 0s and 2s can be arranged in any order relative to each other as long as there are enough 1s between them. \n\nBut how to find the minimal string in this case?\n\nMaybe the minimal string is obtained by arranging all the 0s as far left as possible, followed by the 1s, followed by the 2s. But that may not be possible if there are 2s before some 0s. However, if there are 1s between them, then it's possible to move the 0s to the left of the 2s. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: since the 1s can be moved between 0s and 2s, the minimal string would be to arrange all 0s first, then 1s, then 2s. Because that's the lex smallest possible. But how to ensure that this arrangement is possible given the constraints?\n\nWait, but if the original string has a 2 before some 0s, but there are 1s between them, then it's possible to move those 0s to the left of the 2s. For example, \"2 1 0\" can be transformed into \"0 1 2\" by moving the 0 left through the 1, and the 1 left through the 2. \n\nBut how?\n\nLet's take the string \"2 1 0\". The 0 can be moved left by swapping with the 1. So \"2 0 1\". Then the 0 can't move left past the 2. So the string becomes \"2 0 1\". Then the 1 can be moved left by swapping with the 2. So \"1 2 0\". Now, the 0 is at the end. So the minimal string is \"0 1 2\"? Not sure. \n\nBut how to achieve that? It seems that the 0 is stuck behind the 2. So the minimal string would be \"0 1 2\" if possible, but in this case, it's not. \n\nThis suggests that there's a contradiction in my understanding. \n\nMaybe the key is that the relative order between 0s and 2s can be changed if there are 1s between them. But how to model this in code?\n\nAlternative approach: think of the allowed swaps as allowing the following:\n\n- Any number of swaps between 0 and 1, which allows the 0s and 1s to be reordered freely among themselves. Similarly, the 1s and 2s can be reordered freely. However, the 0s and 2s can't be reordered directly, but if there are 1s between them, they can be rearranged.\n\nWait, but if you can reorder the 0s and 1s, and the 1s and 2s, then you can arrange all the 0s to the left of the 1s, and all the 1s to the left of the 2s. Because the 1s can be moved between 0s and 2s. So the overall arrangement would be 0s, then 1s, then 2s. Which is the lex smallest possible.\n\nBut how to verify this?\n\nTake the example of the string \"201\". The desired minimal string would be \"012\". But how to achieve that. \n\nIn this case, the original string is '2', '0', '1'.\n\nWe can swap the 0 and 1 to get '2', '1', '0'. Then swap the 1 and 2 to get '1', '2', '0'. Now, the 0 is at the end. But how to get the 0 to the left of the 2? It seems impossible. So the minimal string is '012' is not possible. But according to the theory, it should be possible. So what's wrong here?\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the 0s can be moved past the 1s, and the 1s can be moved past the 2s. So, in the string '2', '0', '1', the 0 can be moved to the left of the 1. Then the 1 can be moved to the left of the 2. So the 0 would be to the left of the 1, which is to the left of the 2. But how?\n\nLet me try:\n\nOriginal: 2 0 1\n\nStep 1: swap 0 and 1 → 2 1 0.\n\nStep 2: swap 1 and 2 → 1 2 0.\n\nNow, the 0 is at the end. But how to move it further left? It can't swap with the 2. But what about the 1 and 2? Can they be swapped again? Yes. So swap 1 and 2 again → 2 1 0. Back to where we were. \n\nNo progress. So it seems that the 0 can't be moved past the 2. Hence, the minimal string is \"120\" which is better than the original.\n\nSo why is this happening? Because there's no 1 between the 2 and the 0. So the 0 can't move past the 2. Hence, the theory that the minimal string is 0s, then 1s, then 2s is not always possible. \n\nSo how to proceed? What's the correct way to model the allowed swaps?\n\nAnother idea: since 0s can be swapped with 1s, and 1s can be swapped with 2s, the 0s and 2s can be rearranged in any order as long as there are 1s between them. But if there are no 1s between them, their order is fixed.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to grouping the characters into blocks where the 0s and 2s are separated by 1s. For example, any 0 and 2 that are separated by one or more 1s can be reordered. But those that are not separated by 1s can't be reordered.\n\nBut how to model this in code?\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to treat the 0s and 2s as being able to be reordered if there's at least one 1 between them. But this seems complex.\n\nAlternative approach: think of the allowed swaps as allowing the 0s to be moved freely among each other and past 1s, and the 2s to be moved freely among each other and past 1s. However, 0s and 2s cannot be moved past each other. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is determined by their original positions, but only if there are no 1s between them. \n\nWait, but this is not correct. For example, in the case of 0 1 2, the 0 can be moved past the 1, and the 1 can be moved past the 2. This allows the 0 to be after the 2. So the original order of 0 before 2 can be changed. Hence, the relative order between 0 and 2 is not fixed.\n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps I should look for an algorithm or a way to model the problem.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of allowed movements. Since 0s can be moved past 1s, and 1s can be moved past 2s, this implies that any 0 can be moved to the left of any 1, and any 1 can be moved to the left of any 2. But the 0s can't be moved past 2s. So, the 0s can be arranged in any order relative to each other, and the 2s can be arranged in any order relative to each other. But the 0s and 2s can be arranged in any order if there are 1s between them. \n\nBut how to determine the minimal string?\n\nMaybe the minimal string is obtained by greedily placing as many 0s as possible to the left, then as many 1s as possible, then 2s. But ensuring that the 0s and 2s are ordered in a way that allows this. \n\nWait, for example, if there are 1s between 0s and 2s, then the 0s can be moved to the left of the 2s. So the minimal string is to have all 0s first, then 1s, then 2s. But if there are no 1s between a 0 and a 2, then the 0 and 2's order is preserved.\n\nBut how to model this in code?\n\nPerhaps the solution is to process the string and group the characters into runs of 0s, 1s, and 2s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: think of the 0s and 2s as being able to be reordered only if there are 1s between them. So, for the entire string, the minimal string would be to arrange all 0s first, then all 1s, then all 2s. But this is possible only if the original string allows it. \n\nBut how to check if that is possible? Well, since the 1s can be moved between the 0s and 2s, it's possible to arrange the 0s and 2s in any order relative to each other. For example, even if there are no 1s between a 0 and a 2, but there are other 1s elsewhere, we can move the 1s between them.\n\nWait, for example, consider the string \"20\". There are no 1s between the 2 and 0, so they can't be swapped. So the minimal string is \"20\".\n\nBut if the string is \"201\", then there is a 1 between the 2 and 0. So we can move the 0 to the left of the 2. How?\n\nLet's take the string \"201\" again. We want to arrange it as \"012\".\n\nSteps:\n\nOriginal: 2 0 1.\n\nSwap 0 and 1 → 2 1 0.\n\nSwap 1 and 2 → 1 2 0.\n\nNow, the string is 1 2 0. Can we move the 0 to the left of the 2? No, because they're not adjacent. But the 0 is at the end. The 2 is at position 1. So the 0 can't move left past the 2. So it seems that it's not possible to get 0 before the 2 in this case.\n\nBut this contradicts the idea that the 0 and 2 can be reordered if there are 1s between them. So what's the issue here?\n\nAh, perhaps the presence of a single 1 between the 2 and 0 is not sufficient. Because after moving the 0 to the right of the 1, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 2, but then the 0 is still to the right of the 2. \n\nSo in this case, the 0 is after the 2, and there's no way to move it further left. So the minimal string is \"012\" is not possible, and the minimal achievable is \"012\" or \"021\" or \"102\"?\n\nWait, but how can we get \"012\" from \"201\"?\n\nIt seems impossible. So the minimal string for \"201\" is \"012\" if possible, but it's not. So what is the correct minimal string?\n\nLet's list all possible permutations that can be achieved from \"201\".\n\nThe possible permutations are:\n\n- 201 → original.\n\n- 210 → swap 0 and 1.\n\n- 120 → swap 1 and 2 in 210.\n\n- 102 → can we get this? Let's see.\n\nFrom 210, can we swap 1 and 0? They are adjacent. Yes. So 210 → 201 (back to original). No. Or wait, the 1 is at position 1 and 0 at position 2. Swap them: 201 → original. So no.\n\nFrom 120, can we swap 1 and 2? Yes, back to 210. Or swap 2 and 0? No.\n\nSo the possible strings are \"201\", \"210\", \"120\". The lex smallest is \"120\".\n\nSo the minimal string for \"201\" is \"120\", which is not the ideal \"012\". So this suggests that the initial idea of arranging all 0s, then 1s, then 2s is not always possible. \n\nSo what is the correct approach here?\n\nPerhaps the correct way is to treat the 0s and 2s as being in separate groups, and the 1s",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing specific adjacent swaps on a ternary string consisting of characters '0', '1', and '2'. The allowed swaps are between adjacent '0' and '1', and between adjacent '1' and '2'.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that:\n- '0's can be freely moved past '1's.\n- '1's can be freely moved past '2's.\n- However, '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped.\n\nGiven these constraints, the optimal approach is to rearrange the string such that all '0's come first, followed by '1's, and then '2's. This is because '0's can move left through '1's and '1's can move left through '2's, allowing us to arrange the string in the desired order if there are enough '1's to act as intermediaries.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    # We can treat the problem as grouping all 0s, then 1s, then 2s\n    # Because 0s can move through 1s, and 1s can move through 2s.\n    # So the minimal string is all 0s, followed by 1s, followed by 2s.\n    # But how to handle cases where there are no 1s between 0 and 2?\n    # Actually, the allowed swaps allow us to arrange the 0s and 2s in any order\n    # as long as there are 1s between them.

By counting the occurrences of each character ('0', '1', '2') and constructing a new string with all '0's first, followed by '1's, and then '2's, we ensure the lexicographically smallest arrangement.
