The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Nikephoros and Polycarpus play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Their moves are determined by their respective sequences A and B, which repeat cyclically. I have to find out how many times each of them gets pinched (i.e., loses a round).\n\nFirst, let me understand the input. The input gives n, then the sequence A, then sequence B. The sequences can be up to 1000 characters long. But n can be as big as 2e9, which is a huge number. So iterating through each round one by one is impossible. We need an efficient approach here.\n\nSo the challenge is to compute the number of losses for each player without simulating all n rounds. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nLet me think about the cycles. Since both players' moves repeat cyclically, the pattern of their moves will repeat after the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences. Let me explain: For example, if A has length m and B has length k, then after LCM(m, k) rounds, the combination of their moves will start repeating. So, for each possible pair of moves (a_i, b_j), the same situation will happen every LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\nSo the idea is to compute the number of losses in one full cycle (of length LCM(m, k)), then multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the result from the remaining rounds.\n\nBut first, let's calculate how many full cycles there are and how many remaining rounds. Let me denote the total number of rounds as n. Let's compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length. Then, the number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_length, and the remaining rounds is remainder = n % cycle_length.\n\nBut wait, what if the cycle_length is larger than n? Then total_cycles is zero, and we just process the remainder.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length.\n2. For each round in the cycle (from 0 to cycle_length - 1), determine which player wins (if any) and accumulate the counts.\n3. Multiply the counts by the number of full cycles (total_cycles).\n4. Then, process the remaining rounds (remainder) by checking each round in the cycle up to remainder steps.\n5. Sum all these counts to get the total number of losses for each player.\n\nBut how do I compute the LCM? Well, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need to compute the GCD first. For that, I can use Euclidean algorithm.\n\nNow, the next step is to simulate one full cycle. But since m and k can be up to 1000, their LCM can be up to 1000*1000 = 1e6. Which is manageable because even for 1e6 steps, it's acceptable for a loop. Because 1e6 is manageable even for large n.\n\nSo for each round in the cycle, we need to find the move of Nikephoros and Polycarpus. How?\n\nFor a given round i (starting from 0?), the move of Nikephoros is A[i % m], and Polycarpus is B[i % k]. So for each i in 0 to cycle_length-1, we can compute the moves and check who wins.\n\nSo, for each such i, we can compute the moves, check if there's a winner, and count the number of times Nikephoros loses (which adds to his red spots) and Polycarpus loses (adds to his).\n\nOnce we have the counts per cycle, multiply by total_cycles, then add the counts from the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the number of full cycles and remainder.\n\nCompute for each full cycle:\n\ncount_nikephoros_losses_per_cycle and count_polycarpus_losses_per_cycle.\n\nThen, total_nikephoros = total_cycles * count_nikephoros_losses_per_cycle + count_in_remainder.\n\nSame for Polycarpus.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the counts for the cycle, and for the remainder.\n\nNow, how to compute the counts for the cycle?\n\nLet me think. For each i in 0 to cycle_length-1:\n\nget a_move = A[i % m]\n\nget b_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen determine who wins.\n\nSo for each of these pairs, we can check the outcome.\n\nSo, for each pair (a, b), the outcome is:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nelse:\n\nif a beats b: Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a loss (so add 1 to his",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player (Nikephoros and Polycarpus) loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over `n` rounds. Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves, and we need an efficient approach given the potentially large value of `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Cycle Detection**: Since both players use cyclic sequences, their move patterns will repeat after the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences. This LCM determines the length of one full cycle of their combined moves.\n2. **Simulation of One Cycle**: Calculate the number of losses for each player within one full cycle of their combined sequences.\n3. **Scaling Up**: Multiply the losses per cycle by the number of full cycles that fit into `n` rounds.\n4. **Remaining Rounds**: Handle any remaining rounds after accounting for the full cycles by simulating those additional rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // compute_gcd(a, b)\n\ndef count_losses_in_cycle(a_seq, b_seq, cycle_length):\n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    nikephoros_loss = 0\n    polycarpus_loss = 0\n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Determine the winner\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n           (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n           (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            polycarpus_loss += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            nikephoros_loss += 1\n    return nikephoros_loss, polycarpus_loss\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a_seq = input[1]\n    b_seq = input[2]\n    \n    m = len(a_seq)\n    k = len(b_seq)\n    \n    lcm = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    # Compute losses in one full cycle\n    cycle_nike, cycle_poly = count_losses_in_cycle(a_seq, b_seq, lcm)\n    \n    total_cycles = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    total_nike = total_cycles * cycle_nike\n    total_poly = total_cycles * cycle_poly\n    \n    # Compute losses in the remainder rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_move = a_seq[i % m]\n        b_move = b_seq[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n           (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n           (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_nike += 1\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nike} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Cycle Detection**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is calculated to determine the length of one full cycle of combined moves.\n2. **Loss Counting in a Cycle**: For each round within one cycle, we determine the moves of both players and count the losses for each player.\n3. **Scaling Up**: The number of full cycles is determined by dividing `n` by the cycle length.
