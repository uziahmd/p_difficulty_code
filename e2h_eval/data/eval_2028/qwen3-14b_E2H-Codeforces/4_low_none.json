The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players over n rounds. Each player has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. For each round, we need to determine who wins and count the number of times each player gets pinched (i.e., loses a round). The challenge is to compute this efficiently given that n can be as large as 2e9, which is way too big for a straightforward simulation.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since directly simulating each round for n up to 2e9 is impossible, we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so that we can calculate the number of wins in each cycle and multiply by the number of cycles, then add the remainder rounds.\n\nFirst, let's think about the sequences. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where m and k are the lengths of their sequences. So the moves repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because LCM(m, k) is the least common multiple of m and k. So after LCM(m, k) rounds, the pattern of moves between the two players repeats.\n\nSo, the idea is:\n\n1. Find the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period_length. Because after that many rounds, the same pair of moves will occur again.\n2. For each round in the period (from 0 to period_length - 1), determine who wins, and count the total number of wins for each player in this period.\n3. Then, compute how many full periods are there in n rounds, and multiply the counts by that number. Then, process the remaining rounds (n mod period_length) separately.\n\nBut how do I compute the LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but that returns the absolute value, and since m and k are positive, that's okay. But note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the correct value for positive integers.\n\nSo first, compute the period_length as LCM(m, k).\n\nBut wait, m and k can be up to 1000 each, so their LCM could be up to 1e6. Which is manageable. Because even if m and k are both 1000, their LCM is 1e6. So for each period of 1e6 rounds, we can precompute the number of wins for each player. Then, for n up to 2e9, the number of full periods is n // period_length, and the remainder is n % period_length. So the total number of wins would be (full_periods * wins_in_period) + wins_in_remainder.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute m = len(A), k = len(B)\n- Compute period_length = LCM(m, k)\n- Precompute for each round in 0..period_length-1, what the moves are for A and B, determine who wins, and count the total for each player in the period.\n- Then, total_full_periods = n // period_length\n- total_remaining_rounds = n % period_length\n- For the remaining rounds, simulate each round (up to period_length rounds, which is 1e6 at worst) and count the wins.\n\nBut wait, even for 1e6 rounds, processing each round is O(1) per round, so that's acceptable.\n\nSo, the main problem is to compute for each round in the period, how many times each player wins.\n\nNow, how to compute the moves for each round in the period. For each i in 0 to period_length-1:\n\nA_move = A[i % m]\n\nB_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen, determine the outcome between A_move and B_move.\n\nSo, for each such pair, we can check who wins. Let's create a helper function to determine the winner between two moves.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf A's move is 'R' and B's is 'S', A wins. If B is 'P', B wins. If same, draw.\n\nSo, the possible outcomes can be determined with a lookup table or some logic.\n\nLet me think about how to code that. For two moves a and b:\n\nif a == b: draw.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a beats b) then A wins, else B wins.\n\nSo, for example, 'R' beats 'S', 'S' beats 'P', 'P' beats 'R'.\n\nSo, perhaps a helper function:\n\ndef get_winner(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0  # draw\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to simulate a game of rock-paper-scissors between two players, Nikephoros and Polycarpus, who each use cyclic sequences of moves. The challenge is to efficiently determine the number of times each player loses (and thus gets pinched) over a large number of rounds, up to 2 billion.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Nature**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. This means their move sequences repeat after a certain number of rounds. The key insight is that the combined sequence of moves from both players will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their individual sequences.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This gives the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: For each round within one period, determine the winner and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Periods and Remainder**: Calculate the number of full periods within the total number of rounds and the remaining rounds after these full periods. Use the precomputed results from one period to quickly compute the total losses for all full periods, then simulate the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef get_winner(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return 0  # draw\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return 1  # A wins\n    else:\n        return -1  # B wins\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    period_length = (m * k) // gcd_val\n    \n    # Precompute the number of wins in one period\n    a_wins_period = 0\n    b_wins_period = 0\n    for i in range(period_length):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a_move = A[a_idx]\n        b_move = B[b_idx]\n        res = get_winner(a_move, b_move)\n        if res == 1:\n            a_wins_period += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            b_wins_period += 1\n    \n    # Calculate full periods and remainder\n    full_periods = n // period_length\n    remainder = n % period_length\n    \n    total_a = full_periods * a_wins_period\n    total_b = full_periods * b_wins_period\n    \n    # Process the remainder rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a_move = A[a_idx]\n        b_move = B[b_idx]\n        res = get_winner(a_move, b_move)\n        if res == 1:\n            total_a += 1\n        elif res == -1:\n            total_b += 1\n    \n    print(f\"{total_a} {total_b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of sequences `A` and `B` is computed to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within one period, the moves of both players are determined, and the winner is checked. The counts of wins for each player in one period are stored.\n4. **Full Periods and Remainder Handling**: The total number of full periods and the remaining rounds are calculated. The results from the full periods are scaled up using the precomputed values, and the remaining rounds are simulated individually to get the final counts of losses for each player.\n\nThis approach ensures that even for very large values of `n`, the solution remains efficient by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences.",
