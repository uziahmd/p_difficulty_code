They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement. If the answer is \"YES\", print on the following line n numbers which are the numbers of mushrooms on the corresponding lawns.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 0', '2 1\\n1 2 1 3', '3 2\\n3 2 1 2\\n3 1 1 10', '2 1\\n1 2 3 7']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\n1', 'YES\\n1 3', 'YES\\n5 1 2', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about restoring the number of mushrooms on each lawn (vertex) based on the GCD and LCM values provided on the edges. Each edge between two lawns has the GCD and LCM of the mushrooms on those two lawns. Our task is to determine if such a configuration exists and output one possible solution if it does.\n\nFirst, let's understand the constraints. For each edge between u and v, we have that:\n\ngcd(a_u, a_v) = g, and lcm(a_u, a_v) = l.\n\nWe know that for any two numbers, the product of their GCD and LCM equals the product of the numbers themselves. So, a_u * a_v = g * l. Also, since the GCD divides both a_u and a_v, each of them must be a multiple of g. Let's denote a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y. Then, the GCD of a_u and a_v is g * gcd(x, y), but according to the problem, the GCD is given as g. Therefore, gcd(x, y) must be 1. Also, the LCM of a_u and a_v is g * x * y / gcd(x, y) = g * x * y. But since the LCM is given as l, then we have that g * x * y = l. Therefore, x * y = l / g. Since x and y are coprime, this implies that x and y are divisors of l/g and their product is exactly l/g. Also, since x and y are coprime, they must be factors of l/g that are coprime. \n\nSo for each edge, the product of x and y is l/g, and they are coprime. Therefore, for each edge, the possible pairs (x, y) are coprime pairs whose product is l/g. But how do we assign these values to the nodes?\n\nThis seems like a graph problem where each node's value is determined by constraints from the edges. The challenge is to assign values to each node such that all edges' constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. For each edge between u and v, we have that a_u and a_v must be multiples of the GCD g, and their product is g*l. Also, since a_u and a_v are multiples of g, we can represent them as a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, with x and y coprime, and x*y = l/g.\n\nBut how do we find x and y for each edge? Well, for each edge, the product x*y must be l/g. Also, since x and y are coprime, the only way for their product to be l/g is that x and y are coprime divisors of l/g. However, given that l/g must be an integer, otherwise there's no solution. Wait, the problem says that the input gives GCD and LCM values. But since GCD divides LCM, because for any two numbers, GCD divides LCM. Wait, no. Wait, for two numbers a and b, GCD(a,b) divides LCM(a,b). Because LCM(a,b) is a multiple of both a and b, hence of their GCD. So for each edge, the given GCD and LCM must satisfy that GCD divides LCM. Otherwise, there's no solution. So first, for each edge, check if g divides l. If not, output NO.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given with the GCD and LCM. So if the input has a GCD and LCM where the GCD does not divide the LCM, then that's impossible, so the answer is NO. So that's a first check.\n\nSo for each edge, first check that l % g == 0. If not, output NO.\n\nThen, for each edge, the product x*y must be l/g. Also, since x and y are coprime, the pair (x,y) can be determined as follows: since x and y are coprime and their product is k = l/g, then x and y must be a pair of coprime factors of k. However, there are multiple possibilities here. For example, if k is 6, then possible pairs are (1,6), (6,1), (2,3), (3,2). But since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can choose one of these pairs, but how do we ensure consistency across the entire graph?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a graph where each node has a value, and each edge imposes a constraint between two nodes. But how do we model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem",
    "response": "To solve the \"Mushroom Strife\" problem, we need to determine if it's possible to restore the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the given GCD and LCM values on the edges between lawns. The approach involves checking constraints and using graph traversal techniques to assign valid mushroom counts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Validity of Input**: For each edge, verify that the LCM is divisible by the GCD. If not, the configuration is impossible.\n2. **Graph Representation**: Represent the lawns and roads as a graph where each node represents a lawn and each edge contains the GCD and LCM values.\n3. **Graph Traversal with Constraints**: Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to assign mushroom counts while ensuring that for each edge, the GCD and LCM constraints are satisfied.\n4. **Consistency Check**: During DFS traversal, ensure that the assigned mushroom counts are consistent across all connected components of the graph.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n\n    edges = []\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(input[idx]) - 1\n        idx += 1\n        v = int(input[idx]) - 1\n        idx += 1\n        g = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        l = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        edges.append((u, v, g, l))\n        graph[u].append((v, g, l))\n        graph[v].append((u, g, l))\n\n    result = [None] * n\n    visited = [False] * n\n\n    def dfs(node, value):\n        visited[node] = True\n        result[node] = value\n        for neighbor, g, l in graph[node]:\n            if result[neighbor] is None:\n                k = l // g\n                if k % 1 != 0:\n                    return False\n                # Find x and y such that x * y = k and gcd(x, y) = 1\n                # We can choose x as value / g, but check if it divides k\n                # Since a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, and x * y = k\n                # So x = a_u / g, y = a_v / g\n                # For current node's value, which is a_u, then x = value / g\n                # Then y = k / x\n                # But since x must be an integer, value must be divisible by g\n                # Also, x must divide k\n                if value % g != 0:\n                    return False\n                x = value // g\n                if k % x != 0:\n                    return False\n                y = k // x\n                if gcd(x, y) != 1:\n                    return False\n                if not dfs(neighbor, g * y):\n                    return False\n            else:\n                # Check consistency\n                a = result[node]\n                b = result[neighbor]\n                if gcd(a, b) != g or (a * b) // gcd(a, b) != l:\n                    return False\n        return True\n\n    def gcd(a, b):\n        while b:\n            a, b = b, a % b\n        return a\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            # Try to assign a value starting from this node\n            # We can assume any value for the first node, but need to satisfy constraints\n            # Let's try to find possible values for the first node\n            # However, since the first node's value is part of some edges, we need to find compatible values\n            # But how?
