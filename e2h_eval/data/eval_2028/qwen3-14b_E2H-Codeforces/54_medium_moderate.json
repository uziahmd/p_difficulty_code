Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the task is to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle 'a'. And we need to output any of the optimal triplets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me recall some geometry here. In a regular n-gon, each interior angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. But wait, that's the angle between two adjacent sides. However, the problem here is about choosing three vertices such that the angle at v2 is formed by two lines from v2 to v1 and v3. So maybe I need to think about the central angles or something else.\n\nWait, for any regular polygon, the central angles (the angle subtended at the center by one side) are 360/n degrees. But when you pick three points, the angle at the vertex depends on how many steps apart the other points are.\n\nLet me think about a regular polygon. Suppose I have a regular n-gon. Let's consider a vertex v2. Let's say there are k steps between v2 and v1 in one direction, and m steps in the other direction. Wait, but since it's a regular polygon, the positions are symmetric. Maybe for the angle at v2, the number of edges between v1 and v2 and between v3 and v2 determines the angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle can be determined by the number of sides between the points. For example, if you fix v2, then the angle depends on how many vertices are between v1 and v2, and between v3 and v2. Wait, but since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 would be determined by the arcs between the points.\n\nLet me think of a triangle (n=3). The angle at any vertex is 60 degrees. For a square (n=4), the angle at a vertex when you take adjacent points (like 1-2-3) is 90 degrees. But if you take points like 1-2-4, then the angle at 2 is 45 degrees? Or maybe not. Wait, in a square, the angle between two diagonals... Hmm, maybe I need to find a formula for the angle.\n\nI remember that in a regular polygon, the measure of an angle formed by three vertices can be calculated based on the number of sides between them. For example, if you have a regular polygon with n sides, and you select three vertices v1, v2, v3 such that there are k steps from v2 to v1 clockwise and m steps from v2 to v3 clockwise. Wait, but since the polygon is regular, the positions are symmetric. So maybe the angle depends on the number of edges between v1 and v2, and between v3 and v2. But since the polygon is convex, the angle must be less than 180 degrees.\n\nAlternatively, here's a way to think about it: For a regular n-gon, each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. So the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. Now, suppose we fix v2 as a vertex. Let's imagine that v1 is k steps away from v2 in the clockwise direction, and v3 is l steps away in the counter-clockwise direction. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 (passing through v2) would be k + l steps. But since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 would be determined by the arc opposite to it.\n\nWait, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended at the circumference is half the central angle. But how does that apply here?\n\nLet me think of the triangle formed by v1, v2, v3. The angle at v2 is the angle between the two chords v2v1 and v2v3. The central angles for those chords would be determined by the number of steps between the points.\n\nSuppose between v2 and v1, there are k steps. Then the central angle between v2 and v1 is k * (360/n) degrees. Similarly for v2 and v3, but maybe the other direction. However, since the polygon is regular, if there are k steps between v2 and v1 in one direction, then there are (n - k) steps in the other direction. But the angle at v2 depends on how the points are arranged.\n\nWait, here's a better approach. Let's assume that between v1 and v3, there are exactly m edges along the perimeter. Then, the angle at v2 would depend on m. For example, in the case where v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2 (so m=2), the angle is the internal angle of the polygon. For example, in a square, that's 90 degrees. If v1 and v3 are two steps apart (like in a square, v1 is 1, v2 is 2, v3 is 4), then the angle at v2 is 45 degrees. How?\n\nLet me think about the general formula. Let me look up the formula for the angle formed by three vertices in a regular polygon.\n\nAfter some research (but since I can't actually look things up, I need to derive it), here's an idea:\n\nIn a regular polygon, the angle at vertex v2 formed by v1 and v3 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3. Suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k vertices (i.e., the arc between v1 and v3 has length k+1 steps). Wait, maybe the formula is:\n\nThe angle at v2 is equal to ( (k) * 180 / n ), where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 minus 1? Not sure. Alternatively, considering that the central angle between v1 and v3 is (m * 360/n) degrees, where m is the number of steps between them. Then, the angle at v2 would be half of that? No, because the angle at v2 is an inscribed angle. Wait, no. If the central angle is θ, then the inscribed angle would be θ/2. But in this case, the angle at v2 is not necessarily an inscribed angle. Wait, perhaps the angle at v2 is determined by the arc opposite to it. Let me think.\n\nImagine that in the regular polygon, the three points v1, v2, v3 are on the circumference of a circle. The angle at v2 is formed by the chords v2v1 and v2v3. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the arc that corresponds to the angle at v2. The measure of the angle at v2 is half the measure of that arc.\n\nSo for example, if the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is x degrees, then the angle at v2 is x/2 degrees.\n\nSo, how to compute that arc? Well, the total circumference is 360 degrees. The arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (m * 360/n) degrees, where m is the number of steps between v1 and v3 through v2. Then, the arc that doesn't contain v2 is 360 - m*(360/n) degrees. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since the polygon is regular, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter (in either direction) can be considered. Let's say that between v1 and v3, there are k steps in one direction. Then, the arc length is k*(360/n) degrees. The other arc is (n - k) * (360/n) degrees. The angle at v2 depends on which arc is being considered.\n\nBut how does that relate to the angle at v2? Let me think. The angle at v2 is formed by two chords. The arc opposite to that angle is the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. So, the measure of that arc is (number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc) * (360/n). Let's call that number of steps 's'. Then, the angle at v2 is (s * 360/n) / 2 = s * 180 / n degrees.\n\nBut how do we find s?\n\nWell, since v2 is a vertex, and v1 and v3 are other vertices, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be s steps. Let me think of an example. Take the square (n=4). If v1 is 1, v2 is 2, v3 is 4. The arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is 2 steps (from 1 to 4 via 3, which is two steps). So s is 2. Then the angle at v2 is 2 * 180 / 4 = 90 degrees? But earlier thought was that in that case the angle is 45 degrees. Hmm, that contradicts. So my reasoning must be wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me re-examine the example. In the square, when v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 4. The angle at v2 is between the lines 2-1 and 2-4. What is that angle?\n\nIn a square, the coordinates can be considered as (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,-1), (-1,1) for example. Let's say the square is centered at the origin. Then, point 1 is (1,1), point 2 is (1,-1), point 4 is (-1,1). The vectors from v2 (point 2) to v1 (point 1) is (0, 2). The vector from v2 to v3 (point 4) is (-2, 2). The angle between these two vectors can be computed using the dot product.\n\nThe dot product of (0,2) and (-2,2) is 0*(-2) + 2*2 = 4. The magnitude of the first vector is 2, the second is sqrt(4 + 4) = sqrt(8). The cosine of the angle is 4/(2 * sqrt(8)) ) = 4/(2*2*sqrt(2)) ) = 1/sqrt(2), so the angle is 45 degrees. Which matches the example given in the note. So the angle is 45 degrees. But according to the previous formula, s was 2 steps. 2 * 180 /4 = 90 degrees. Which is wrong. So my formula is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So what's the correct formula here?\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the regular polygon as being inscribed in a unit circle. Let's model the points as complex numbers on the unit circle. Then, the angle at v2 can be calculated using the positions of v1, v2, and v3.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the polygon. Let's assume that the polygon is centered at the origin, and the vertices are placed at angles θ_k = 2π(k-1)/n radians, where k ranges from 1 to n. For example, vertex 1 is at angle 0 radians, vertex 2 at 2π/n radians, etc.\n\nNow, for three points v1, v2, v3, with positions A, B, C on the circle, the angle at B is the angle between vectors BA and BC.\n\nTo compute this angle, we can use vector math. The angle between BA and BC can be found using the cross product and dot product. But perhaps there's a simpler formula here.\n\nAlternatively, since all points lie on a circle, the angle at B is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B. Wait, that's the inscribed angle theorem. So if the arc AC that does not contain B is x degrees, then the angle at B is x/2 degrees.\n\nIn the square example, when B is vertex 2, and A is vertex 1, C is vertex 4. The arc AC that does not contain B is from A (vertex 1) to C (vertex 4) going through vertex 3. That's 2 steps (from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4? No, wait, in a square, the arc from 1 to 4 that doesn't contain B (vertex 2) is the arc going through vertex 3. How many steps is that? Between 1 and 4, there are two edges (1-2-3-4 is three steps, but if you go the other way, it's 1-4, which is one step. Wait, no. Wait, in the square, the arc between 1 and 4 that does not contain B (vertex 2) is the arc that goes from 1 to 4 directly (since the other arc would pass through 2). So that's one step. So the arc length is 1 * (360/4) = 90 degrees. Therefore, the angle at B is 90/2 = 45 degrees. Which matches the example. So that formula seems correct.\n\nSo the formula for the angle at v2 is (arc length AC that does not contain v2) / 2 degrees.\n\nNow, how to compute that arc length. Let's say that between A and C, the arc that does not contain B is s steps. Each step corresponds to 360/n degrees. So the arc length is s * (360/n) degrees. The angle at B is then (s * 360 / n ) / 2 = s * 180 / n degrees.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding three points A, B, C such that the arc AC not containing B is s steps, and the angle is s*180/n degrees. Our goal is to find s such that this angle is as close as possible to a given a.\n\nBut how do we find s for a given n and a?\n\nLet me think. For a given n and a, we want to find s such that s * 180 / n is as close as possible to a. However, there are constraints on s.\n\nWhat are the possible values of s? Since the polygon is convex and we need to have distinct points A, B, C, the arc AC not containing B must be at least 1 step (so that A and C are distinct from B and each other). Also, since the arc AC cannot contain B, the arc AC that does not contain B must be less than n-1 steps. Because if it were n-1 steps, then the arc that contains B is 1 step. But the arc that does not contain B would be n-1 steps, which would imply that the arc containing B is 1 step. However, for the arc AC that does not contain B, the maximum number of steps is n-2. Because if you have s steps, then the arc containing B would be n - s steps. Since the arc containing B must be at least 1 step (since B is between A and C along that arc), then s can be from 1 to n-2.\n\nWait, let's think again. The arc AC that does not contain B can be from 1 to n-2 steps. Because if s is n-1 steps, then the arc containing B would be 1 step. But that would mean that B is adjacent to A and C. But then, the arc AC that does not contain B would be n-1 steps. However, in that case, the angle at B would be (n-1)*180/n degrees. But for example, in a square (n=4), that would be 3*180/4 = 135 degrees. However, in reality, if A and C are adjacent to B, then the angle at B is the internal angle of the polygon. For a square, that's 90 degrees. So this suggests that my reasoning is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I have the relationship between s and the arc length wrong. Let me re-examine.\n\nThe arc AC that does not contain B is s steps. The arc AC that contains B is (n - s) steps. But for B to be on the arc AC that contains B, the arc must be at least 2 steps. Because if the arc AC that contains B is 1 step, then A and C are adjacent, and B is not on that arc. So perhaps my mistake is in how I'm defining s.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose that the arc AC that does not contain B is s steps. Then the arc AC that contains B is (n - s) steps. But since B is a vertex on the arc AC that contains B, then that arc must have at least 1 step. Wait, no. For example, if A and C are adjacent, then the arc AC that contains B would be (n - s) steps. Let me think of a concrete example.\n\nTake n=4 (square). Let A and C be adjacent (say, A is 1, C is 2). Then the arc AC that does not contain B (assuming B is 3) would be 1 step (from 1 to 2). The arc that contains B is 3 steps (from 1 to 2 via 3 and 4). So s is 1, and the angle at B is (1 * 180)/4 = 45 degrees. But in this case, if B is 3, then the angle at B between A=1 and C=2 would be the angle between vectors BA and BC. Let's see. Coordinates:\n\nPoint 1: (1,1)\nPoint 2: (1,-1)\nPoint 3: (-1,-1)\nPoint 4: (-1,1)\n\nIf B is 3, A is 1, C is 2. Then BA is from 3 to 1: (2, 2). BC is from 3 to 2: (2, 0). The angle between these vectors. The dot product is (2)(2) + (2)(0) = 4. The magnitude of BA is sqrt(8), magnitude of BC is 2. So cos(theta) = 4/(sqrt(8)*2) = 4/(2*2*sqrt(2)/sqrt(2)) ? Wait, sqrt(8) is 2*sqrt(2). So 4/(2*sqrt(2)*2) ) = 4/(4*sqrt(2)) = 1/sqrt(2). So theta is 45 degrees. Which matches the formula. So yes, the formula works here.\n\nBut in this case, the arc AC that does not contain B is 1 step (from A to C directly), and the angle is 45 degrees.\n\nSo in this case, the arc AC that does not contain B is 1 step, which gives us the angle. So for a general case, the possible values of s (the number of steps in the arc AC that does not contain B) can be from 1 to n-2 steps. Because if s is n-2 steps, then the arc containing B is 2 steps. Which would mean that B is between A and C in that arc, so the arc AC that contains B is 2 steps (so A and C are two steps apart through B).\n\nSo for any valid triplet (A,B,C), the value of s can range from 1 to n-2. Thus, our problem reduces to finding the s that makes s * 180 / n as close as possible to a. Once we find that s, we can construct a triplet of vertices.\n\nBut how to find the optimal s?\n\nLet me think. For each possible s in 1..n-2, compute the angle theta = s * 180 / n. Find the s that minimizes |theta - a|. Once we find that s, we can choose any triplet that corresponds to that s.\n\nBut how to find s?\n\nLet me think of solving for s in the equation theta = a. So s = a * n / 180. But since s must be an integer between 1 and n-2, we can compute the closest integer to that value.\n\nFor example, in the sample input 4 67:\n\nn=4, a=67. The possible s values are 1 and 2 (since n-2 is 2).\n\ns=1: theta is 1 * 180 /4 = 45. Difference is 22.\n\ns=2: theta is 2*180/4=90. Difference is 23. So the best is s=1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is 4 68. Then, a=68. The same s options. s=1 gives 45 (difference 23), s=2 gives 90 (difference 22). So the best is s=2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is: compute the ideal s as (a * n)/180, then check the floor and ceiling of that value to find the closest s. But since s must be between 1 and n-2, we need to clamp it to that range.\n\nOnce we find the optimal s, we can construct any triplet of vertices that corresponds to that s.\n\nNow, the next question is: how to choose the triplet (v1, v2, v3) once we have s.\n\nLet me think. For a given s, the arc AC that does not contain B has s steps. So, the arc from A to C that does not contain B is s steps. That implies that between A and C, there are s steps, and B is located on the other arc (the one that has n-s steps). So, for example, if we choose B as any vertex, then A and C are located s steps apart in the arc that does not contain B.\n\nBut how to choose the actual vertices? Let's think of a simple way to generate a triplet.\n\nLet me pick v2 as vertex 1. Then, I need to find two vertices v1 and v3 such that the arc between them (not containing v2) is s steps. How?\n\nWait, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is s steps. So, if v2 is fixed, then v1 and v3 should be s steps apart in the arc that does not contain v2. So, for example, if v2 is vertex 1, then the arc that does not contain v2 would be the arc from v1 to v3 that goes through vertices 2, 3, ..., n. Wait, no. If v2 is vertex 1, then the arc that does not contain v2 would be the arc that goes from v1 to v3 without passing through v2. So, for example, if v1 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex (2 + s) mod n, but not passing through v2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the easiest way is to choose v2 as vertex 1, and then set v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex (2 + s) mod n. Wait, but how to ensure that the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is s steps.\n\nAlternatively, for a given s, the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) is s steps. So, if we fix v2 as vertex 1, then v1 can be vertex 2, and v3 can be vertex 2 + s steps away from v1 in the direction that does not include v2. Wait, perhaps it's easier to think that between v1 and v3, there are s steps in the arc that does not contain v2.\n\nLet me think of a concrete example. Let's take n=4, s=1. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1 step. So, for example, if v2 is vertex 2, then v1 and v3 could be vertices 1 and 3. The arc between 1 and 3 that does not contain 2 is 1 step (since the other arc is 2 steps through 2). Wait, but between 1 and 3, the arc that does not contain 2 is the arc from 1 to 3 through 4, which is 2 steps (1 to 4, 4 to 3). So that's 2 steps. Which would correspond to s=2, giving angle 2*180/4=90 degrees. But earlier example with v2=2, v1=1, v3=4 gives s=2 steps (arc 1-4 through 3?), no. Wait, I'm getting confused again.\n\nMaybe I need a better way to generate the triplet once s is known.\n\nLet me think. For a given s, the angle is s * 180 / n. To create such an angle, we can select v2 as any vertex, and then select v1 and v3 such that they are s+1 steps apart along the perimeter, but with v2 lying on the arc between them. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is s steps. Therefore, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n - s) steps. Since v2 lies on that arc, the number of steps between v1 and v2 plus the steps between v2 and v3 equals (n - s) steps.\n\nBut how to choose v1 and v3. Let's pick v2 as vertex 1. Then, we need to choose v1 and v3 such that the arc between them that does not contain v2 is s steps. That would imply that the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n - s) steps. So, if we choose v1 as vertex 2, then v3 is vertex 2 + (n - s) steps. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for v2 being vertex 1, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n - s) steps. So, the distance between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n - s) steps. So, if we choose v1 to be vertex 2, then v3 would be vertex 2 + (n - s) steps. But since the polygon is cyclic, we have to take modulo n into account.\n\nWait, perhaps for a given s, the simplest way is to select v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as (2 + (n - s)) mod n. But need to make sure that the steps between v1 and v3 along the arc containing v2 is (n - s) steps. Let me think.\n\nLet me take the example where n=4, s=1. Then (n - s) = 3 steps. So v1 is 2, v3 is 2 + 3 steps. Starting from 2, adding 3 steps: 2 → 3 → 4 → 1. So v3 is 1. But then, the arc between v1 (2) and v3 (1) that contains v2 (1) is 3 steps (from 2 →3→4→1). The arc that does not contain v2 (1) is from 2 to 1 through 2 → ...? No, because the arc that does not contain v2 (1) would be from 2 to 1 directly, which is one step. Which is s=1. So that's correct. So the triplet would be v1=2, v2=1, v3=1? No, but v3 can't be 1 because v2 is 1. Oh right, the triplet must have distinct vertices. So in this case, v3 is 1, which is same as v2. That's invalid. So this approach isn't working.\n\nHmm. So what's wrong here? Let me re-express.\n\nWhen v2 is 1, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n - s) steps. So, for example, in this case, n - s = 3 steps. So the arc from v1 to v3 that contains v2 (1) is 3 steps. How to choose v1 and v3 such that they are 3 steps apart along that arc. For example, if v1 is 2, then v3 is 2 + 3 steps along the arc containing v2. Since the arc containing v2 is the one that goes through 1. So from 2, moving 3 steps through the arc that includes 1: 2 →3 →4 →1. So v3 is 1. But then v3 is same as v2. Not allowed.\n\nSo perhaps I need to choose v1 and v3 such that the arc between them that contains v2 is (n - s) steps. Which would require that the distance between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n - s) steps, and that v2 is somewhere in between. For example, if I choose v1 as 2, then v3 is 2 + (n - s -1) steps? Or perhaps another approach.\n\nLet me think of another way. For a given s, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is s steps. So, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n - s) steps. Therefore, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n - s) steps. Which means that the number of vertices between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n - s - 1) steps. So, for example, if v1 is vertex 2, then v3 can be vertex 2 + (n - s) steps. But again, this may include v2.\n\nWait, let me think again. For the arc that contains v2, the length is (n - s) steps. So, between v1 and v3, there are (n - s) steps along that arc. So, the number of vertices between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n - s - 1). So, for example, if n=4, s=1, then n-s is 3 steps. So between v1 and v3 along that arc, there are 3 steps. So, for example, if v1 is vertex 2, then moving 3 steps along the arc that contains v2 (which is 1) would take us to vertex 2 →3 →4 →1. So v3 is 1, which is v2. Not allowed.\n\nSo perhaps I need to choose v1 and v3 such that they are (n - s - 1) steps apart along the arc containing v2. So that the arc between v1 and v3 is exactly (n - s) steps. So, for example, if I choose v2 as vertex 1, then v1 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex (2 + (n - s - 1)) mod n. Let's see.\n\nIn the case of n=4, s=1, n-s-1 = 4-1-1=2. So v3 is 2+2=4. So the triplet would be v1=2, v2=1, v3=4. Which is the example from earlier. Which gives the angle of 45 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nYes! So the formula for choosing v1 and v3 is:\n\nOnce we have chosen v2, then v1 is v2 + 1, and v3 is v2 + 1 + (n - s - 1) steps. Or more precisely, for v2 as vertex 1, v1 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex 2 + (n - s - 1) steps. But since the polygon is cyclic, we need to take modulo n into account. However, since the steps are (n - s - 1) steps from v1, adding that to v1's position.\n\nWait, but for example, in the case of n=4, s=1, (n - s - 1) = 2. So from v1=2, adding 2 steps: 2 →3 →4. So v3 is 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4, s=2. Then n-s-1 = 4-2-1=1. So from v1=2, adding 1 step: 3. So triplet is 2, 1, 3. The angle at v2=1 is between 2 and 3. Which is the internal angle of the square, 90 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems to work. So the general approach is:\n\nOnce we have determined the optimal s, we can choose v2 as any vertex (for simplicity, let's choose vertex 1). Then, v1 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex (v1 + (n - s - 1)) mod n. But since the numbering is from 1 to n, we need to adjust for that.\n\nWait, for example, if v1 is 2, and we add (n - s - 1) steps, then the position of v3 would be 2 + (n - s - 1). But since the vertices are numbered from 1 to n, we need to take care of modulo. However, since the steps are (n - s - 1), which for valid s (between 1 and n-2) is between 1 and n-2-1 = n-3. So adding that to v1 (which is 2) will not exceed n? Not necessarily. For example, if n=5, s=1, then n-s-1 = 5-1-1=3. v1 is 2, adding 3 steps: 2+3=5. Which is okay. If n=5, s=2, n-s-1=5-2-1=2. v1=2, adding 2 steps: 4. Which is okay.\n\nBut what if v1 is 2, and adding (n-s-1) steps leads to exceeding n? Like if n=5, s=1, v1=2, steps=3. 2+3=5, which is okay. If n=5, s=3 (which is allowed since n-2=3), then steps = 5-3-1=1. So v1=2, adding 1 step gives 3. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the formula for v3 is: v1 + (n - s - 1) steps. But since v1 is 2, and the steps are added in the clockwise direction (assuming the numbering is clockwise), then the actual position is (v1 + (n - s - 1)) mod n? Or perhaps just adding, but since the vertices are numbered from 1 to n, we need to make sure that it wraps around correctly. Wait, for example, if v1 is n, and adding steps would take it to n + steps. But since the polygon is cyclic, we can compute it as (v1 + steps - 1) % n + 1. Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of modular arithmetic.\n\nAlternatively, since the vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order, the next vertex after n is 1. So, for example, if v1 is 2, and we move k steps clockwise, the new position is (v1 + k - 1) % n + 1.\n\nBut in our case, we want to move (n - s - 1) steps from v1. So for v1 = 2, the new position is (2 + (n - s - 1) - 1) % n + 1 = (n - s + 2 - 1 - 1) % n + 1? No, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me think of moving k steps from v1. The formula for the new vertex is (v1 + k - 1) % n + 1. For example, if v1 is 2, and k is 1 step, then (2 + 1 -1) %n +1 = 2%n +1 = 2+1=3. Which is correct.\n\nIn our case, k is (n - s - 1) steps. So the formula for v3 is:\n\nv3 = (v1 + (n - s - 1) - 1) % n + 1 = (v1 + (n - s - 2)) %n +1 ?\n\nWait, maybe I should just compute it as (v1 + (n - s - 1)) if it's within 1..n. Otherwise, wrap around.\n\nAlternatively, since the initial v1 is 2, and we are adding (n - s - 1) steps clockwise. So the new position is 2 + (n - s - 1) steps. But since the vertices are numbered 1..n, the position is (2 + (n - s - 1) - 1) %n + 1 ?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's take the example where v1 is 2, and we need to move k steps clockwise. The result is (v1 + k) if it's <=n, else (v1 +k -n). But since k is (n - s -1), which for s >=1 and n >=3, is (n - s -1) steps. Let's compute for the case where v1=2 and k = n - s -1.\n\nFor example, in the case of n=4, s=1, k = 4-1-1=",
