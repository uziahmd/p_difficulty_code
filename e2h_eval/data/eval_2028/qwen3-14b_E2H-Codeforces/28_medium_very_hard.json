String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to count the number of beautiful strings based on given n, m, and g. The beautiful string has exactly n zeros and m ones. But there's a catch: we can modify the string through some operations, and the final string must be obtainable by these operations from some original string. Wait, no—the problem says that the string s itself must be such that we can get character g from it via some modifications. Or wait, maybe I need to re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly zero) number of modifications.\" So the string s must be such that after performing some number of modifications, the resulting string ends up with exactly one character, which is g. But how does that work? Let me think about the modification process.\n\nEach modification operation takes the last two characters of the string and replaces them with one character. For example, if the last two are 00, replace with 1. If they are 01 or 10 or 11, then replace with 0? Wait, the problem says: \"we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" Oh right. So the replacement is 1 if the two are both 0, else 0. So for any pair that's not two zeros, you replace with 0. So for example, replacing 01 becomes 0, 10 becomes 0, 11 becomes 0, and 00 becomes 1.\n\nSo each modification reduces the length of the string by 1. Starting with a string of length L, after k modifications, the length is L - k. The process continues until the string has length 1. So for the string s to be able to be modified into a single character g, the process must end with that character.\n\nBut how do we determine whether a given s can be transformed into g via these operations? Because the order of operations might matter? Or perhaps not. Wait, the problem says that the modifications can be done in any way, as long as each operation is applied to the last two characters. However, since each operation reduces the length by one, the process is deterministic once you know the sequence of operations. But perhaps the final character depends only on the initial string's structure, not the order of operations. Wait, maybe not. Let's think of an example.\n\nTake the example given: \"01010\" becomes \"0100\" after one modification. Then, applying another modification on the last two (00) gives \"011\". Then another modification on the last two (11) gives \"01\", then again on \"01\" gives \"0\". Alternatively, if during the first step, you modify different parts? No, because the operation always acts on the last two characters. So the order of operations is forced. Each step must take the last two characters and replace them. Therefore, the final result is uniquely determined by the initial string. Because the process is deterministic. Therefore, for a given string s, the final character after all possible modifications is fixed. So the question is, for the given s (which has exactly n zeros and m ones), what is the final character after all possible modifications?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the string s is considered beautiful if it can be modified (through some number of operations) to reach g. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the string s is beautiful if we can obtain the character g from it with some (possibly zero) number of modifications. But how? Because the process of modifying until it's length 1 is mandatory? Or can we stop earlier? Because the problem says that the modifications can be done with some number of steps. So perhaps the string s can be modified to have a single character g. But how? Because the process can't be stopped until the string is of length 1. Wait, the problem says that the modifications can be done with some number of steps. So the final string after those modifications must be of length 1, and that character must be g. So the string s is considered beautiful if when you perform the modifications until it's length 1, the result is g. Because otherwise, if you stop earlier, you have a longer string. But the problem says that the character g is obtained from s via some number of modifications. So I think that implies that the final result after all possible modifications (until length 1) must be g.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of strings s with exactly n zeros and m ones, such that the final result of applying all possible modifications (until length 1) is equal to g.\n\nSo the key is to find for a string s with n zeros and m ones, what is the final character after applying all possible modifications. Then, count all such s where this final character is g.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model this final character. How can we compute it for a given string s?\n\nLet me think about the process of applying the modifications. Since each operation replaces the last two characters with a new one, the process is similar to a binary tree of operations. However, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a string s. The final character depends on the entire string, but perhaps it's equivalent to some function of the count of zeros and ones.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as a series of operations that reduce the string. Let's consider the parity of the number of zeros and ones. Wait, but each operation reduces the length by 1. The initial length is n + m. After k operations, the length is (n + m) - k. The process stops when the length is 1, so k = (n + m) - 1 operations. So the number of operations is fixed. Therefore, the final character is determined by the entire sequence of operations, which depends on the order in which pairs are replaced. However, earlier analysis suggests that the order is forced, since each operation is applied to the last two characters. Therefore, the process is deterministic. So regardless of the order of operations (but since the operations are forced to act on the last two characters, the order is fixed). Therefore, for any string s, the final character is uniquely determined.\n\nBut how can we compute that final character based on the counts of 0s and 1s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character depends on the parity of the number of 0s. Let's think of some examples.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input: n=1, m=1. The possible strings are \"01\" and \"10\".\n\nLet's take \"01\". The initial length is 2. Apply one operation: replace the last two characters (which are 0 and 1) with 0. So the final character is 0. Which matches the sample's first input where g is 0. So this string is counted. Similarly for \"10\": same process, replace with 0. So both strings are valid, hence the answer is 2.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is n=2, m=2, g=0. The answer is 4. Let's take one of the strings, say \"0011\". Let's simulate the process:\n\nOriginal string: 0 0 1 1 (length 4). Apply operations until length 1.\n\nFirst operation: last two are 1 and 1. Replace with 0. Now string is 0 0 0 (length 3).\n\nSecond operation: last two are 0 and 0. Replace with 1. Now string is 0 1 (length 2).\n\nThird operation: last two are 0 and 1. Replace with 0. Final character is 0. Which matches g=0. So this string is counted.\n\nAnother example: \"0011\" is valid. What about \"0101\"?\n\nOriginal string: 0 1 0 1. First operation: last two are 0 and 1 → replace with 0. String becomes 0 1 0. Next operation: last two are 1 and 0 → replace with 0. String becomes 0 0. Next operation: replace with 1. Final character is 1. Which would not match g=0. So this string is not counted. Hence, the sample's answer is 4, meaning that only certain permutations of 2 zeros and 2 ones are valid.\n\nSo how to model this process for arbitrary n and m?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's think about the process as a function f(s) that returns the final character after all operations. Let's see:\n\nFor a string of length 1, f(s) is the character itself.\n\nFor a string of length l ≥ 2, the first operation is to take the last two characters and replace them with a new character. Then apply the function recursively on the new string.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive for large n and m. However, perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's think about the parity of the number of 0s.\n\nLet me think about the process as follows: each operation reduces the string's length by 1. Each operation replaces two characters with a new one. Let's track the number of 0s and 1s during the process.\n\nLet me think about the effect of each operation. Suppose we have two characters at the end. Let's say they are a and b. The replacement is 1 if a and b are both 0; else 0.\n\nSo, for example, replacing two 0s with a 1: the number of 0s decreases by 2, and the number of 1s increases by 1. Replacing any other pair (like 0 and 1, 1 and 0, 1 and 1) with 0: the number of 0s increases by 1, and the number of 1s decreases by 1 (if the pair was two 1s, then 1s decrease by 2 and 0s increase by 1. If the pair was 0 and 1, then 1s decrease by 1 and 0s decrease by 1, and then adding 1 0. So net change is 0s: -1 +1 = 0, 1s: -1. Hmm, this seems complex.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model the final result based on the initial counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet me think of the entire process as a series of operations that eventually reduce the string to a single character. Let's think about the parity of the number of 0s. Let's think about the total number of operations, which is (n + m) - 1. Let me think about the final character.\n\nLet me think of the process as a binary tree. Each operation combines two characters into one. The final character is determined by the entire sequence of operations. However, perhaps the final character depends on the parity of the number of 0s. Let me try some examples.\n\nCase 1: All operations are combining two 0s. For example, suppose we have 3 zeros. The process would be:\n\nOriginal string: 000.\n\nFirst operation: combine last two 0s → 1. New string is 01.\n\nSecond operation: combine 0 and 1 → 0. Final character is 0.\n\nSo for three zeros, the final character is 0.\n\nAnother example: four zeros.\n\nOriginal: 0000.\n\nFirst operation: combine last two → 1. New string: 001.\n\nSecond operation: combine last two (0 and 1) → 0. New string: 00.\n\nThird operation: combine two 0s → 1. Final character is 1.\n\nHmm. So for four zeros, the final character is 1. For three zeros, it's 0. For two zeros, combining them gives 1. For one zero, it's 0.\n\nSo the final character for a string consisting of all zeros depends on the number of zeros mod 3? Or maybe something else. Let's see:\n\nNumber of zeros | Final character\n1 → 0\n2 → 1\n3 → 0\n4 → 1\n5 → 0\n6 → 1\nSo it's 0 when the count is odd, 1 when even? Wait 2 is even and gives 1, 4 even gives 1. 3 is odd gives 0. 5 is odd gives 0. So yes. So for a string of all zeros, the final character is 0 if the count is odd, 1 if even. Interesting.\n\nBut what if the string has a mix of 0s and 1s?\n\nLet me take the first sample: n=1, m=1. The final character is 0. Which is the case for both possible strings. Let's see: the total number of zeros is 1, which is odd. But according to the previous example, when there's 1 zero, the final is 0. But when there are 2 zeros, the final is 1. But in this case, there's also a 1. How does that affect the outcome?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final character depends on the parity of the number of 0s. Let's think: in the first sample, the total number of zeros is 1 (odd), and the final character is 0. In the case of two zeros and two ones, the sample's answer is 4, which implies that the final character is 0. Let's think of the total number of zeros as 2 (even), but the final character is 0. That contradicts the previous idea. So that hypothesis is invalid.\n\nHmm. So that approach is incorrect. Need to think differently.\n\nAlternative approach: think of the entire process as a function that depends on the number of zeros modulo something. Let me think recursively. Suppose we have a string S. Let's denote the final character as f(S).\n\nIf the string is of length 1, f(S) is S.\n\nElse, the first operation is to replace the last two characters with a new character. Let's call this new string S'. Then f(S) = f(S').\n\nBut how to model this for a general string. Let's think of the process as follows: the final character depends on the entire sequence of operations, which is equivalent to evaluating the string as a binary expression tree, where each operation combines the last two elements.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this as a function of the counts of 0s and 1s. Let's think of the following: each operation reduces the string by one character. The final character is determined by the entire sequence of operations, which depends on the order in which pairs are merged. However, since the merging is always done on the last two characters, the order is fixed. Therefore, the final character is determined by the entire sequence of merges.\n\nBut how can we find a formula for this?\n\nLet me think about the parity of the number of 0s. Let's consider the following: each time two 0s are merged, they produce a 1. Each time two 1s are merged, they produce a 0. Any other pair (0 and 1) produces a 0.\n\nLet me think about the total number of 0s and 1s in the entire process. Let me think of the process as a series of operations. Each operation reduces the total number of characters by one. The final character is determined by the entire process.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a binary tree where each node represents a merge operation. The leaves are the original characters. The root is the final character. However, since the merges are always done on the last two characters, the tree structure is a left-associative merge. For example, for a string of four characters a, b, c, d, the merges would be:\n\nFirst merge c and d → x.\n\nThen merge b and x → y.\n\nThen merge a and y → z.\n\nSo the order is (((a b) c) d) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the string is a b c d. The first merge is the last two, c and d. The new string is a b x. Then the next merge is the last two, b and x. New string is a y. Then merge a and y → z. So the structure is ((a (b (c d))) ? Not sure. But regardless, the order of merging is determined by the string's structure.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model the final result based on the number of 0s and the parity of the total number of operations. Let me think of the following:\n\nLet me think of the entire process as a series of operations where each operation reduces the number of 0s and 1s. Let me think of the total number of 0s and 1s, and how they change during the process.\n\nLet me think of the process as follows. Let’s denote the current number of 0s as c0 and 1s as c1. Initially, c0 = n, c1 = m.\n\nEach operation takes two characters and replaces them with a new one. Depending on what those two characters are, the counts change.\n\nBut since the operation is applied to the last two characters, the actual choice of which two characters to merge depends on the string's arrangement. However, since the problem requires us to count all possible strings with n zeros and m ones that result in a final character g, perhaps we can find a way to model the final character based on the counts and some other parameters, regardless of the order of merges. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as equivalent to evaluating the string as a binary expression with certain rules. For example, each pair of characters is merged according to the rules, and the final result depends on the entire sequence of merges. However, this seems too vague.\n\nAnother idea: since the merging is always done on the last two characters, the final result can be determined by considering the string as a sequence of operations that depend on the order of the characters. However, since the order of the characters affects the merging steps, this seems difficult. However, perhaps the final result depends only on the parity of the number of 0s and the total number of operations.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Suppose we have a string s. The final character is determined by the last two characters and the rest of the string. Let me think of the process as follows: the final character is the result of merging the last two characters (say, x and y) into z, and then merging the rest of the string (s') with z. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the entire string as s = s' + x + y. The first operation merges x and y into z. Then the new string is s' + z. Then the process continues. The final character is f(s' + z). But this seems recursive.\n\nBut for the purpose of counting, perhaps we can find that the final character depends on the parity of the number of 0s. Let me think again with some examples.\n\nLet’s take the first sample where n=1, m=1. The final character is 0. The number of 0s is 1 (odd). For the second sample, n=2, m=2. The final character is 0. The number of 0s is 2 (even). So that doesn't fit the previous hypothesis. So the parity of the number of 0s isn't directly the answer.\n\nAnother example: consider the string \"00\". It has 2 zeros. Merging gives 1. So the final character is 1. Which is even number of zeros. But the final character is 1. Another example: \"000\" (3 zeros) gives 0. So for even count, the final character can be 1 or 0 depending on other factors. So that approach isn't sufficient.\n\nAlternative approach: think of the process as a binary operation. Let's imagine that the entire string is evaluated by combining the characters from right to left, using the merge rule. For example, for the string a_1 a_2 ... a_k, the final value is computed by combining a_{k-1} and a_k into b, then combining a_{k-2} and b into c, etc., until one character remains. So the evaluation is left-associative, but starting from the right.\n\nLet me think of this as a function f(a_1, a_2, ..., a_k) where f is defined recursively:\n\nf(a_1) = a_1\n\nf(a_1, a_2, ..., a_k) = f( f(a_1, ..., a_{k-1}), a_k )\n\nWait no, that's not correct. Because the merge is applied to the last two characters. So for the string a_1 a_2 a_3 a_4, the first merge is a_3 and a_4 → b, then merge a_2 and b → c, then merge a_1 and c → d. So the function is f(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) = f(f(f(a_1, a_2), a_3), a_4) ?\n\nNo, that's not right. Because the first merge is between a_3 and a_4. Then the new string is a_1 a_2 b. Then the next merge is between a_2 and b. Then the new string is a_1 c. Then merge a_1 and c. So the evaluation is (((a_1 a_2) a_3) a_4) ? No. It's (a_1 ( (a_2 (a_3 a_4)) )) ?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps there's a way to model this as a function that depends on the count of 0s and the parity of some value.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a binary tree where each node is the result of merging two children. The root is the final character. The leaves are the original characters. The merging rule is: if both children are 0, then parent is 1; else, parent is 0.\n\nLet’s think of this as a binary tree. For example, the string \"00\" is merged into 1. The tree has two leaves, and their parent is 1. The string \"000\" is merged as follows: first merge last two 0s to 1, then merge the first 0 and the 1 to 0. The tree has a root of 0.\n\nNow, the question is, for a given number of 0s and 1s, what is the value of the root of this binary tree? But how can this be determined without knowing the exact arrangement of the characters?\n\nIt seems impossible unless there's some invariant or property that holds regardless of the arrangement. Let's try to find that.\n\nLet me think about the following: the final character depends on the number of 0s modulo 3. Or some other modulus. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: consider that each time you merge two 0s, you're effectively replacing them with a 1. This reduces the number of 0s by 2 and increases the number of 1s by 1. Merging two 1s replaces them with a 0, reducing the number of 1s by 2 and increasing the number of 0s by 1. Merging a 0 and a 1 (in any order) replaces them with a 0, reducing the count of 0s by 1 and 1s by 1, and adding one 0. So net change: 0s: -1 + 1 = 0, 1s: -1.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let me think of the entire process as a series of operations that change the counts of 0s and 1s. However, since the process is deterministic based on the string's arrangement, it's unclear how to model this for all possible arrangements.\n\nAlternative approach: think of the problem as a dynamic programming problem, where we need to find the number of strings with n zeros and m ones that evaluate to g. However, for large n and m (up to 1e5), a DP solution with O(nm) time complexity would be too slow.\n\nWait, but what if we can find a formula for the required condition? Let me think again about the merging process.\n\nSuppose the entire process reduces the string to a single character. Let me think of the following: the final character is 0 if and only if the number of 0s is congruent to some value modulo something. Or perhaps it depends on the parity of the total number of operations and the number of times two zeros were merged.\n\nBut this seems difficult. Let me think of the following: every time two zeros are merged, they contribute a 1. Every time two ones are merged, they contribute a 0. Every time a 0 and 1 are merged, they contribute a 0. \n\nLet me think of the entire process as a series of merges. Let's define the following variables:\n\nLet’s say during the entire process, there are x merges of two zeros (producing a 1), y merges of two ones (producing a 0), and z merges of a zero and one (producing a 0). \n\nThe total number of merges is (n + m) - 1 = total_ops.\n\nEach merge reduces the count of characters by 1.\n\nBut the initial number of zeros is n, and the initial number of ones is m.\n\nLet me think of the net change in the number of zeros and ones during the process.\n\nFor each merge of two zeros:\n- zeros decrease by 2\n- ones increase by 1\n\nFor each merge of two ones:\n- ones decrease by 2\n- zeros increase by 1\n\nFor each merge of a zero and one:\n- zeros decrease by 1\n- ones decrease by 1\n- zeros increase by 1 (since the merged character is 0)\nNet change: zeros: -1 + 1 = 0; ones: -1.\n\nSo the net change for this type of merge is that the number of ones decreases by 1, and zeros remain the same.\n\nAt the end of all merges, there is one character left. Let's say it's g. So:\n\nFinal count of zeros is 0 if g is 1, and 1 if g is 0. Similarly for ones.\n\nLet me write equations based on the initial and final counts.\n\nLet me define:\n\nInitial zeros: n\nInitial ones: m\n\nAfter all merges, final zeros: if g is 0 → 1, else 0.\nFinal ones: if g is 1 → 1, else 0.\n\nLet me think about the changes caused by the merges.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet’s say during the entire process, there are x merges of two zeros, y merges of two ones, and z merges of a zero and one. Note that x + y + z = total_ops = (n + m) - 1.\n\nNow, the net change in zeros is:\n\nFrom x merges of two zeros: -2x + x (because each such merge adds 1 one, which doesn't contribute to zeros directly. Wait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nEach merge of two zeros reduces the number of zeros by 2 and increases the number of ones by 1.\n\nEach merge of two ones reduces the number of ones by 2 and increases the number of zeros by 1.\n\nEach merge of a zero and one reduces the number of zeros by 1, reduces the number of ones by 1, and increases the number of zeros by 1 (because the merged character is 0). So net change for zeros is 0, and for ones is -1.\n\nSo the overall change in zeros is:\n\nInitial zeros: n\n\nFinal zeros: n - 2x + y + 0*z = ?\n\nWait:\n\nEach merge of two zeros contributes -2 to zeros.\n\nEach merge of two ones contributes +1 to zeros.\n\nEach merge of a 0 and 1 contributes 0 to zeros.\n\nSo the total change in zeros is:\n\nΔzeros = (-2x) + (+1y) + 0*z.\n\nSimilarly, the change in ones is:\n\nΔones = (+1x) + (-2y) + (-1z).\n\nBut the final zeros and ones are:\n\nfinal_zeros = n + Δzeros = n - 2x + y\n\nfinal_ones = m + Δones = m + x - 2y - z.\n\nBut since after all merges, there is one character left, which is either 0 or 1. So:\n\nIf the final character is 0, then final_zeros = 1 and final_ones = 0.\n\nIf it is 1, then final_zeros = 0 and final_ones = 1.\n\nSo we have two cases.\n\nCase 1: g = 0.\n\nThen:\n\nn - 2x + y = 1\n\nm + x - 2y - z = 0\n\nAnd x + y + z = (n + m) - 1.\n\nBut also, the variables x, y, z are non-negative integers.\n\nSimilarly for case 2: g = 1.\n\nBut solving this system of equations may be challenging. Let's try to find relations between these variables.\n\nLet me substitute z from the third equation. Since z = total_ops - x - y = (n + m - 1) - x - y.\n\nSubstituting into the second equation:\n\nm + x - 2y - [(n + m - 1) - x - y] = 0\n\nSimplify:\n\nm + x - 2y - n - m + 1 + x + y = 0\n\nCombine terms:\n\n(m - m) + (x + x) + (-2y + y) + (-n) + 1 = 0\n\nWhich is:\n\n2x - y -n + 1 = 0 → 2x - y = n - 1 → y = 2x - (n - 1)\n\nNow, substituting this into the first equation (for case 1):\n\nn - 2x + y = 1 → n - 2x + [2x - (n - 1)] = 1 → n - 2x + 2x - n + 1 = 1 → 1 = 1. Which is always true. So this equation is redundant. So in case 1, the only condition is that y = 2x - (n - 1).\n\nBut we also have that y must be non-negative, and z must be non-negative.\n\nLet me think about the variables x and y.\n\nFrom y = 2x - (n - 1), and since y ≥ 0 → 2x ≥ n - 1 → x ≥ ceil( (n-1)/2 ). Also, since z = (n + m - 1) - x - y = (n + m - 1) - x - (2x - (n - 1)) ) = n + m - 1 - x - 2x + n - 1 = 2n + m - 2 - 3x.\n\nBut z must be ≥ 0 → 2n + m - 2 - 3x ≥ 0 → 3x ≤ 2n + m - 2 → x ≤ (2n + m - 2)/3.\n\nSo x must satisfy:\n\nceil( (n - 1)/2 ) ≤ x ≤ floor( (2n + m - 2)/3 )\n\nAdditionally, since x must be a non-negative integer, and y must be non-negative.\n\nBut how does this help us? We need to find the number of strings that satisfy these conditions. However, this seems to be leading us to a condition on x, but how to relate this to the number of valid strings?\n\nThis seems quite abstract. Perhaps there's another way. Let me think about the equations again.\n\nIn case 1 (g=0), the equations reduce to:\n\ny = 2x - (n - 1)\n\nand z = 2n + m - 2 - 3x.\n\nBut since z must be ≥ 0, we have:\n\n2n + m - 2 - 3x ≥ 0 → x ≤ (2n + m - 2)/3.\n\nAlso, since y = 2x - (n - 1) ≥ 0 → 2x ≥ n - 1 → x ≥ ceil( (n-1)/2 )\n\nBut how does this relate to the number of valid strings? Well, the variables x and y represent the number of times certain merges happen. However, the actual number of strings depends on how the merges are performed, which depends on the arrangement of 0s and 1s. This seems too indirect.\n\nPerhaps there's another way to look at this. Let me recall that the final character is determined by the entire merging process. For the case of g=0, the final character is 0. Let me think about the parity of the number of times two zeros are merged.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a way to compute the XOR of the number of 0s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: think of the entire process as a function that depends on the parity of the number of 0s and the parity of the total number of operations.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me consider that each merge of two zeros contributes +1 to the number of 1s. Each merge of two ones contributes +1 to the number of 0s. And merges of 0 and 1 contribute nothing to the count of 0s or 1s except for the ones' decrease.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nLet me think about the final character being determined by the number of 0s and the total number of operations. For example, the total number of operations is T = n + m - 1.\n\nLet me think about the following: the final character is 0 if and only if the number of 0s minus the number of 1s is congruent to something modulo 2. Or some other relation.\n\nLet me try some examples.\n\nExample 1: n=1, m=1 → T=1. Final character is 0. The difference between zeros and ones is 0. 0 mod 2 is 0.\n\nExample 2: n=2, m=2 → T=3. Final character is 0. Difference is 0. 0 mod 2 is 0.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=0. T=1. The string is 00. Merge to 1. Final character is 1. Difference between zeros and ones is 2 - 0 = 2 → 0 mod 2. But final character is 1. So this hypothesis is invalid.\n\nHmm. Another approach: think of the entire process as a way to compute the parity of the number of 0s.\n\nLet me think of the following: each time two zeros are merged, they produce a 1. This reduces the number of zeros by 2 and increases the number of 1s by 1. Each time two 1s are merged, it produces a 0, reducing the number of 1s by 2 and increasing zeros by 1. Each time a 0 and 1 are merged, it produces a 0, reducing the number of 1s by 1 and leaving zeros unchanged.\n\nLet me think about the parity of the number of zeros. Let's denote the initial number of zeros as n. Let me see how the parity changes with each operation.\n\nFor a merge of two zeros: zeros decrease by 2 → parity remains the same.\n\nFor a merge of two ones: zeros increase by 1 → parity flips.\n\nFor a merge of 0 and 1: zeros remain the same → parity remains the same.\n\nSo the parity of the number of zeros changes only when a merge of two ones occurs.\n\nLet me denote the number of such merges as y. Each such merge flips the parity of zeros.\n\nInitially, the parity is n mod 2.\n\nAfter y merges of two ones, the parity becomes (n + y) mod 2.\n\nAt the end, the number of zeros is 1 (if g=0) or 0 (if g=1). So:\n\nIf g=0: final zeros is 1 → (n + y) mod 2 = 1 mod 2 → n + y is odd → y is (1 - n) mod 2.\n\nIf g=1: final zeros is 0 → (n + y) mod 2 = 0 → y is n mod 2.\n\nBut how does this help us? We need to find the number of strings where the number of merges of two ones (y) satisfies this condition.\n\nBut how to relate y to the other variables?\n\nEarlier, we had for case g=0:\n\ny = 2x - (n - 1).\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed from here.\n\nLet me try to think of the final condition for g=0. From the parity analysis:\n\ny ≡ 1 - n mod 2.\n\nBut from earlier, for g=0, y = 2x - (n-1).\n\nSubstituting into the parity condition:\n\n2x - (n-1) ≡ 1 - n mod 2.\n\nSimplify:\n\n2x is 0 mod 2, so:\n\n- (n-1) ≡ 1 - n mod 2 → -n + 1 ≡ 1 - n mod 2 → which is always true. So this condition is automatically satisfied. Hence, the parity condition is already captured by the earlier equations.\n\nThis suggests that the earlier equations are sufficient, but how to use them to count the number of valid strings?\n\nMaybe there's a way to express the number of valid strings in terms of the number of ways to arrange the 0s and 1s such that during the merging process, the number of merges of two ones is y = 2x - (n-1), and other constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut this seems very abstract.\n\nAnother observation: the final character depends on the number of times two 1s are merged (y) and the number of times two 0s are merged (x). But how?\n\nLet me think about the final character being 0. From earlier, for g=0, we have:\n\ny = 2x - (n - 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of beautiful strings that can be transformed into a given character `g` through a series of specified operations.
