He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives me a and b (or R), and then a number c in base a. My task is to convert c to base b, handling Roman numerals when needed.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps required.\n\nStep 1: Read the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. Then the next line is the number c in base a.\n\nStep 2: Convert the input number c (which is in base a) to a decimal integer. Because regardless of what base b is, we need to first convert c to decimal.\n\nWait, but how? For example, if c is '1111001' in base 2, that's 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + ... etc. So, for that, I need to parse the string as a base-a number and convert it to decimal.\n\nBut wait, the input for c can have letters? Like in the example where input is '12 13\\nA', which is base 12. So A represents 10 in base 12. So the digits can be 0-9 and letters A-Z (for bases larger than 10). So for example, in base 16, the digits go up to F (15). So when parsing the input, I need to handle letters as digits beyond 9.\n\nSo step 2: parse the input string c (base a) into a decimal integer. How?\n\nI need a helper function that takes a string and a base, and converts it to a decimal number. For example, 'A' in base 12 is 10 in decimal.\n\nSo, for each character in the string, I need to convert it to its value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So for each digit in the string, we can check if it's a digit (0-9) or a letter (A-Z), then map it to its corresponding value. Then compute the decimal value by multiplying by base each time.\n\nBut wait, the input c may have leading zeros. However, since the problem says that when Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But for other cases, the number can be zero? Wait, the note says that if Roman numerals are included, the number is <= 3000 and not zero. But for other cases, the number can be up to 1e15. But the input c is given as a non-negative integer in base a. So for example, if c is '0', then converting to decimal is 0, and then when converting to base b (if not R), output is 0. But the problem says that in the case of Roman numerals, the number is not zero. So perhaps the input c is zero only when the output is not Roman.\n\nBut during the conversion process, I need to handle zero correctly.\n\nSo first, the code needs to convert c from base a to decimal. Let's think about that.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then we need to convert it to base b. But if b is R, then convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as a string, using letters for digits >=10.\n\nSo step 3: convert the decimal number to base b, unless b is R, then convert to Roman.\n\nNow, the problem is how to do these conversions.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, converting c (base a) to decimal:\n\nFunction to convert a string in base a to decimal. For example, '5' in base 10 is 5. 'A' in base 12 is 10.\n\nBut how to handle letters? For example, in base 16, 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, etc. So for each character in the string, we need to get its value. So for a character c in the string, if it's a digit, then value is int(c). If it's a letter, then value is 10 + (ord(c) - ord('A')).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input c may contain letters? For example, in the sample input, the third case is '5 R\\n4' which is base 5. The input c is 4, which is valid in base 5. But another example is '12 13\\nA', which is base 12. The input c is 'A' which is 10 in base 12. So yes, letters are allowed in the input c.\n\nSo, the code needs to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base or to Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from its original base to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this decimal integer to the target base or Roman numerals as required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a`. We first convert this number to a decimal integer. This involves handling digits from '0' to '9' and letters 'A' to 'Z' for bases greater than 10.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: If the target base `b` is not 'R', we convert the decimal number to base `b`, using letters for digits greater than 9.\n3. **Convert Decimal to Roman Numerals**: If the target base `b` is 'R', we convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using the standard Roman numeral rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for c in s:\n        if c.isdigit():\n            digit = int(c)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(c.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, r) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += r\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        parts = line.split()\n        a_part = parts[0]\n        b_part = parts[1]\n        c_str = parts[2]\n        \n        a = int(a_part)\n        if b_part == 'R':\n            target = 'R'\n        else:\n            target = int(b_part)\n        \n        # Convert c_str from base a to decimal\n        if c_str == '0':\n            decimal = 0\n        else:\n            decimal = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        \n        # Now convert decimal to target\n        if target == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            result = decimal_to_base(decimal, target)\n            # Remove leading zeros\n            if len(result) == 0:\n                print('0')\n            else:\n                print(result.lstrip('0') or '0')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, and each line is split into components to extract the base `a`, target base `b`, and the number `c`.\n2. **Decimal Conversion**: The function `to_decimal` converts the input number from base `a` to a decimal integer. It handles both digits and letters for bases greater than 10.\n3. **Base Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts a decimal number to the target base, using letters for digits greater than 9.\n4. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts a decimal number to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, ensuring correct application of subtractive notation.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases, including leading zeros and special Roman numeral requirements, ensuring accurate conversion as specified.",
