Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and I have to output the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the answer is 3 because 'aba' appears twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4). So overlapping is allowed here.\n\nHmm. How do I check all possible substrings and track their occurrences?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. One straightforward way is to generate all possible substrings for all possible lengths, then check if they appear at least twice. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, this might be feasible.\n\nBut how to efficiently check for duplicates?\n\nLet me consider the steps:\n\nFor each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's any substring of length L that occurs at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer. Because we want the maximum possible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate possible lengths from min(len(s), max possible) down to 1.\n- For each length L, generate all substrings of length L, track their occurrences using a dictionary or a set.\n- If any substring occurs more than once, return L as the answer.\n- If no such substring found for any L, return 0.\n\nBut how to generate all substrings of a given length L?\n\nFor example, for a string of length N, substrings of length L can be generated by taking s[i:i+L] for i in range(0, N - L + 1).\n\nSo for each L, starting from the maximum possible (which is len(s) // 2?), but wait, for example, the maximum possible L where a substring can occur twice is floor(len(s)/2). Because if the substring is longer than half the length of the string, there's no way to have two non-overlapping occurrences. Wait, but overlapping is allowed. For example, in 'aaaaa', the substring of length 4 'aaaa' occurs twice (positions 0-3 and 1-4). So the maximum possible L is len(s) - 1. For example, in a string of length 5, len(s)-1 is 4. So for the maximum possible L, we can check from len(s)-1 down to 1.\n\nWait, but for a string of length N, the maximum possible L where a substring can appear twice is N-1. Because for example, if the string is 'aa', then L=1, and the substring 'a' appears twice. For N=3, the maximum possible L is 2. For example, 'aba' has substring 'ab' and 'ba', but they don't repeat. But if the string is 'aaa', then substring of length 2 'aa' occurs twice (positions 0-1 and 1-2). So yes, for L up to N-1, it's possible.\n\nSo for the algorithm, the maximum possible L to check is len(s)-1. So for each possible L starting from len(s)-1 down to 1, check if there's any substring of length L that occurs at least twice. Once found, return that L. If none found after checking all possibilities, return 0.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut considering that the maximum length of the string is 100, even a brute-force approach would be acceptable. Let's see:\n\nThe number of possible L values is up to 100. For each L, the number of substrings is O(N) (for each L, N-L+1 substrings). For each substring, we can store them in a dictionary, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nBut for each L, we can generate all substrings and track their counts. For example, for L=5, generate all substrings of length 5, and check if any of them appears more than once.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nCompute N = len(s).\n\nFor L in range(N, 0, -1):\n\n   create a set or a dictionary to track substrings.\n\n   for i in 0 to N-L:\n\n      substring = s[i:i+L]\n\n      if substring is already in the set, then return L as the answer.\n\n      else add to the set.\n\n   after checking all substrings for this L, if any duplicates found, return L.\n\nIf after checking all L down to 1, no duplicates found, return 0.\n\nWait, but for each L, we need to check if any substring occurs at least twice. So for each L, we can collect all substrings and check for duplicates.\n\nBut how to check for duplicates?",
