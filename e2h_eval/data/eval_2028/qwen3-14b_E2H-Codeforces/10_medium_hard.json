Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) — the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem called \"Feed the Golorp.\" Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that a golorp's name defines its daily diet. The name is a string that represents some kind of program, and we need to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values (digits 0-9) that can be fed through its jaws. If it's impossible, output 'false'.\n\nThe examples given have inputs that are strings like '?(...) : ...' and outputs are sequences of digits or 'false'. So I need to parse the input string into some structure that tells me what constraints there are on the variables.\n\nHmm. The key here is to figure out how the golorp's name translates into constraints on the variables. The description mentions that variables can take values from 0 to 9. Also, each golorp chooses the lex smallest valid sequence. \n\nLooking at the sample input and output might help. For example, the first input is ['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', ...] and the output is '0010'. Let's think about what that might represent.\n\nThe name seems to be structured in a way similar to Befunge, which is a 2D esoteric programming language. But maybe the problem is inspired by Befunge's instruction pointer movement and operations. However, since the problem statement says that the name is valid, perhaps the structure is more abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the name is a representation of a certain pattern that determines the constraints on the variables. Let's look for patterns in the input.\n\nIn the first example, the input string starts with '?(...):...'. Maybe the part inside the parentheses defines some operations, and the colon-separated parts define the direction or other parameters. \n\nWait, the problem mentions that variables get into the stomach via the jaws, and the number of variables is determined by the shape of the jaws. So the jaws' shape determines how many variables are needed. For instance, if the jaws require three variables, then the output must be a sequence of three digits.\n\nBut how do I determine the number of variables required from the input string?\n\nAnother clue: the sample outputs have varying lengths. For example, the first output is 4 digits, which could correspond to the number of variables required based on the jaws' structure.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the input strings. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n'?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nBreaking this down, maybe the part after '?' and before the colon is the jaws' structure. Let's see: the part inside the parentheses is '_-_/___*__'. The colon is followed by '___>__.'.\n\nPerhaps the jaws' structure is represented by the characters inside the parentheses. Let's think about the characters as representing operations or steps that require variables. For instance, each '_' might represent a variable, and the operators like '-', '+', '*' etc. might represent operations between variables.\n\nBut how does that translate into constraints?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is related to the Befunge interpreter's instruction pointer movement. In Befunge, the IP moves in directions (like >, <, ^, v), and the program is a grid of characters. However, the input strings here don't look like standard Befunge programs. But maybe the problem is using a similar metaphor.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the sample inputs and outputs.\n\nFirst sample input: ?(...):-___>__.\n\nThe output is 0010. Let's think about how this might relate. Suppose the jaws require four variables (since the output has four digits). The colon part might be something like directions. For example, '___>__.' could indicate movement steps. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the colon-separated parts might be the directions that the jaws take. For example, the part after the colon could be a path that the jaws follow, and each step requires a variable. For instance, each '_' might be a step that requires a variable, and the '>' and '<' might change direction. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire string represents a path that the jaws take, and each segment between certain characters represents a variable. For example, the number of underscores or other symbols determines the number of variables required. But how?\n\nLet me think about the first sample input:\n\nThe input is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nBreaking down the parts:\n\nThe part inside the parentheses is \"_-_/___*__\". Let's count the number of underscores here. Let's see:\n\nIn \"_-_/___*__\", the underscores are:\n\nFirst part: '_', then '-', then '/', then '_' (three times?), then '*' and '_' (twice). Wait:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe string is \"-_/___*__\". Wait, original part is \"_-_/___*__\".\n\nSo the underscores are:\n\nFirst character is '_', then '-', then '/', then three underscores, then '*', then two underscores. So total underscores: 1 + 3 + 2 = 6? Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nBut perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the jaws part. However, the output for the first sample is 4 digits. That doesn't match with that idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of certain characters in the jaws part. For example, each operator (like -, +, *, /) may require a certain number of variables. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in the first sample output, the answer is 0010, which is four digits. Let's look at the part after the colon in the first input: ':-___>__.' The part after colon is '___>__.' which has three underscores, then '>', then two underscores and '.'.\n\nIf the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in this part, then 3+2=5, but the output is 4 digits. Hmm, not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the jaws part. Let's see: the jaws part is \"_-_/___*__\" which has 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 underscores. But the output is 4 digits. Not matching.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think differently.\n\nThe problem says that the name is valid. So perhaps the name is structured in a way that the variables are determined by the number of certain characters in the string. For example, the number of variables required is equal to the number of underscores in the entire string, or in some specific part.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the sample outputs:\n\nFirst sample output is 0010 (4 digits). Let's check the input string:\n\nThe first input is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nThe part inside the parentheses is \"_-_/___*__\" which has 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 underscores. The part after colon is '___>__.' which has 3 underscores and 2 underscores. So total underscores in the entire string would be 6 + 3 + 2 = 11? That doesn't match 4.\n\nAnother thought: the problem mentions that variables are consumed by the golorp. Each variable is a digit. The sequence of variables is determined by the jaws' shape. So perhaps the jaws are represented by some pattern that requires a certain number of variables. For example, the jaws may be represented by the number of underscores in the part after the colon. Let's look at the first sample's part after colon: '___>__.' — the underscores here are 3 and 2, which sum to 5. But the output is 4 digits. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the jaws part (the part inside the parentheses). Let's take the first sample's jaws part: \"_-_/___*__\" — underscores are 1 (before -), then 3 (after /), then 2 (after *). Total 1+3+2=6. But output is 4 digits. No match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of operators in the jaws part. For example, the number of operators (like -, +, *, /) in the jaws part. In the first sample's jaws part, the operators are '-', '/', '*', '-'. Wait, the string is \"_-_/___*__\". So the characters are:\n\n_ - / _ _ _ * _ _ \n\nSo the operators are '-', '/', '*'. Three operators. But output is 4 digits. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of characters in the jaws part minus the number of operators. For example, if there are 3 operators, and the total length of the jaws part is 8 (assuming the string is \"_-_/___*__\" — let's count the characters:\n\nLet me count the characters in \"_-_/___*__\":\n\nCharacters are: _, -, /, _, _, _, *, _, _ → that's 9 characters. So 9 characters. Subtract the number of operators (3) gives 6 variables. Again, not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the jaws part. Which was 6. But output is 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis approach isn't working. Let's think of another angle.\n\nThe problem says that the golorp's name is similar to the samples. Looking at the samples:\n\nSample Input 1: '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nSample Output: '0010'\n\nSample Input 2: '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.' → Output: 'false'\n\nSample Input 3: '?(...) ...' → Output: '0250341' (length 7)\n\nSample Input 4: '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__. → Output '0101' (length 4)\n\nLooking for a pattern in the outputs' lengths. For sample 1, output is 4; sample 4's output is 4. Let's check the jaws part of sample 4's input:\n\nThe jaws part is \"(__+___+__-___)\" → inside the parentheses is __+___+__-___.\n\nCount the underscores here. Let's see:\n\nThe string is __+___+__-___ → that's:\n\ntwo underscores, then '+', then three underscores, then '+', then two underscores, then '-', then three underscores. So total underscores: 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10. But output length is 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of certain characters in the part after the colon. For example, in sample 1's colon part, it's ':-___>__.' → the part after colon is '___>__.' which has three underscores, then a '>', then two underscores and a '.'.\n\nMaybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in this part. Let's count:\n\nIn sample 1: 3 + 2 = 5 underscores. But output is 4 digits. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of characters in the part after the colon, excluding certain symbols. For example, in sample 1, the part after colon is '___>__.' → the underscores are 3 + 2 = 5. But again, not matching.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of commas in the part after the colon. For example, sample 3's input has a part after colon like '___<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.' which has commas. The output length is 7. Let's count the commas: there are 5 commas. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of arrows (like >, <, etc.) in the part after the colon. For example, sample 1's part after colon has '>' once. Sample 4's part after colon has '>' once. Their outputs are 4 digits. But sample 3's part after colon has '<' multiple times. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Maybe I should think about the problem differently. What is the actual problem asking for?\n\nThe problem is to generate the lex smallest sequence of digits (each 0-9) that satisfies some constraints derived from the golorp's name. The constraints are probably defined by the name's structure, and the sequence must be such that when the golorp's jaws process it, it's valid.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternative approach: think of the name as a Befunge-like program, where the variables are pushed onto the stack and operations are performed. However, the problem is to find the lex smallest sequence of digits that allows the program to run without errors, possibly with some constraints on the stack.\n\nBut I'm not familiar with the exact rules of Befunge, but perhaps the problem is inspired by it. For example, in Befunge, the instruction pointer moves through the code, and certain characters perform operations. For example, numbers are pushed onto the stack, and operators like +, -, * etc. perform operations on the top elements of the stack.\n\nBut how does this relate to the problem?\n\nLet's think of the golorp's name as a Befunge program. The part inside the parentheses might be the code, and the colon-separated part might be the initial direction or other parameters.\n\nFor example, the first sample input is:\n\n'?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nAssuming that the '?' indicates the start of the program, and the part inside the parentheses is the code. The colon part might be the initial direction (like '___>__.' which could be the path the IP takes).\n\nBut this is speculative. However, given that the sample outputs are sequences of digits, perhaps each digit represents a value pushed onto the stack, and the program must process them correctly.\n\nFor example, in the first sample output, the sequence is 0010. Let's say that these are four numbers pushed onto the stack. Then the code in the parentheses would process them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is a series of operations that require certain numbers of variables. For example, each operation may require a certain number of variables to be present in the stack. For example, the '+' operator requires two numbers on the stack, and then adds them. Similarly, '-' subtracts, etc. The problem is to find the lex smallest sequence of variables (digits) that allows the program to execute without errors.\n\nBut how to model the program's execution based on the name string.\n\nLet me try to think of the first sample input:\n\nThe code inside the parentheses is \"_-_/___*__\". Let's assume that each underscore represents a variable (digit), and other characters are operations. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is a series of instructions. For example, each '_' is a step that pushes a variable onto the stack, and the other characters are operations. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nFor example, the code \"_-_/___*__\" would be parsed as:\n\n_ (push variable), - (subtract), / (divide), _ (push variable), _ (push), _ (push), * (multiply), _ (push), _ (push).\n\nBut how would that work? Let's think: suppose the variables are the digits in the sequence. The code would process them in order. However, for each operation, there must be enough variables on the stack.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's think of the first sample's output as 0010. Let's say that the code is processed as follows:\n\nThe variables are 0, 0, 1, 0. The code is _ - _ / _ _ * _ _.\n\nWait, but the code is \"_-_/___*__\". Let's break it down into tokens. Assuming that each '_' is a variable push, and other characters are operations. So the code would be:\n\n[push var], '-', '/', [push var], [push var], [push var], '*', [push var], [push var].\n\nBut how many variables are needed? The code has 6 '_' characters. So the sequence must have 6 variables. But the sample output has 4 digits. Contradiction. Hence, this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon. For example, in the first sample's colon part, it's '___>__.' which has 3 + 2 = 5 underscores. But the output is 4 digits. Still not matching.\n\nHmm. Another idea: the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the entire string. Let's take the first sample input:\n\nThe entire string is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' \n\nCount all underscores:\n\nInside the parentheses: \"_-_/___*__\" has 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 underscores.\n\nAfter the colon: '___>__.' has 3 + 2 = 5 underscores.\n\nTotal underscores: 6 + 5 = 11. Not matching any of the sample outputs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of commas in the part after the colon. For example, sample 3's input has multiple commas, and the output length is 7. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother thought: the problem says that the name is valid, and the output is the lex smallest sequence of variable values. This suggests that the problem is to generate a sequence of digits that satisfies certain constraints derived from the name string. The constraints might involve arithmetic operations, and the sequence must allow the program to execute without errors.\n\nBut without knowing the exact rules of how the name string translates into constraints, this is challenging.\n\nPerhaps looking for hints in the sample outputs and inputs can help. For example, sample 1's output is '0010' which is four digits. Let's think about the first sample input's colon part: ':-___>__.' The part after colon is '___>__.' which has three underscores, then a '>', then two underscores and a '.'.\n\nMaybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in this part. So 3 + 2 = 5, but sample output is 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores before the arrow. For example, the part '___>__.' has three underscores before the '>', so 3 variables. But the output is 4 digits. No.\n\nAlternatively, the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon, minus some value. For example, 3 + 2 = 5, minus 1 gives 4. But why?\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Perhaps I should look for another way.\n\nThe problem says that the name is valid. So perhaps the name has a specific structure that I can parse.\n\nLooking at the sample input strings, they all start with '?(', then have some characters, then ')', then a colon, then more characters.\n\nFor example, the first sample input is:\n\n'?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nBreaking this down:\n\n- The '?' is the start.\n- Inside the parentheses: '_-_/___*__'\n- After the colon: '___>__.'\n\nMaybe the part inside the parentheses represents the operations that the golorp's jaws perform, and the part after the colon represents the path that the jaws take. \n\nIn Befunge, the instruction pointer moves in a certain direction, and the code is executed as it moves. So perhaps the part after the colon represents the path, and the number of variables is determined by the number of steps in that path.\n\nFor example, the part after the colon in the first sample is '___>__.' which might represent a path with certain steps. Each step could require a variable. Let's count the number of characters in this part, excluding the colon and the parentheses. The part after the colon is '___>__.' which has 6 characters (including the > and .). But the output is 4 digits. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the path part. For example, in '___>__.' there are 3 + 2 = 5 underscores. But output is 4. No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the path part minus the number of operators. For example, in '___>__.' the operators are '>', '.' — which are 2 operators. So 5 underscores minus 2 = 3. No match.\n\nAnother idea: the problem may be related to the number of variables required to satisfy a certain equation derived from the name. For example, the part inside the parentheses may represent an equation that the variables must satisfy.\n\nFor example, the first sample's part inside the parentheses is '_-_/___*__'. Let's imagine that each '_' represents a variable, and the operators are operations between them. For example, the expression could be a - b / c * d, but this is just speculation.\n\nBut how to parse the expression? The expression could be a series of operations. For example, the string \"_-_/___*__\" could be parsed as a sequence of variables and operators. Let's try to parse it:\n\nAssuming that the operators are in between variables. For example, the first '_' is a variable, then '-', then '/', then three variables, then '*', then two variables. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, the expression is a sequence of operations that must be evaluated with the variables in order. For example, the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the expression. For example, in \"_-_/___*__\", there are 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 underscores. So six variables. But sample output is 4. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think about the sample outputs and see if there's a pattern.\n\nSample 1 output: 0010 (four digits). Let's think about what this sequence could represent. For example, 0,0,1,0.\n\nIf this sequence is used in some equation, perhaps the equation evaluates to zero or some valid value.\n\nBut without knowing the equation, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother approach: the problem might be similar to generating a sequence that satisfies certain conditions based on the number of variables and the operations. For example, the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the jaws part. Once the number is known, we need to find the lex smallest sequence of digits that allows the operations to be performed without errors (e.g., division by zero, etc.).\n\nBut how to determine the number of variables?\n\nLet me look at the sample outputs and try to find a correlation with the input:\n\nSample 1: output length 4. Input has jaws part with 6 underscores. Not matching.\n\nSample 4: input is '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.' \n\nJaws part is \"__+___+__-___\" which has 2+3+2+3 = 10 underscores. Output is 4 digits. No match.\n\nSample 3: output length is 7. Let's look at the input: the jaws part is \"______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___\" — this has a lot of underscores. Let's count them:\n\nThe first part is 24 underscores (assuming the first part is 24 underscores?), then '/__', then '+', then 7 underscores, then '*', then 2 underscores, '-', then 5 underscores, '*', then 6 underscores, '-', then 3 underscores. This is too tedious to count manually. But the output is 7 digits. So maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of operators in the jaws part plus one? Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon. For example, in sample 1, the part after the colon is '___>__.' which has 3 + 2 = 5 underscores. Output is 4. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of commas in the part after the colon. For example, sample 3's input has commas in the part after the colon, and the output length is 7. Let's count commas in sample 3's input:\n\nThe part after colon is '___<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.' \n\nThere are commas separating the parts. Let's count: the commas are after the first '___<___', then after '___<____', then after '____<_____', then after '_____<______', then after '______<_______'. So total of 5 commas. The output is 7 digits. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I need to find another way to approach the problem.\n\nThe problem says that the golorp's name is valid, and the output is the lex smallest sequence of digits. So perhaps the name string has a specific format that can be parsed into a set of constraints on the variables.\n\nLet me think about the sample input and output again. For example, the first sample's output is '0010', which is four digits. Let's think about the part after the colon in the first input: ':-___>__.' \n\nMaybe this part represents a path that the jaws take, and each segment of the path requires a variable. For example, the path is made up of certain directions, and the number of variables is the number of segments.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the part after the colon could be a series of directions that the jaws move, and the number of variables is determined by the number of steps in that path. For example, in '___>__.' the path is three steps to the right, then a step to the right, then two steps. Or perhaps it's a sequence of movements that require variables at certain points.\n\nAlternatively, the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon. For example, in the first sample, there are 3 + 2 = 5 underscores, but the output is 4. So perhaps it's 5-1=4.\n\nBut why subtract one?\n\nThis is too speculative. Perhaps I should think about the fact that the output is the lex smallest possible sequence. So for a given number of variables, the lex smallest sequence is 000...0, unless there are constraints that make this impossible.\n\nSo perhaps the number of variables is determined by some part of the input string, and once that number is known, the problem reduces to checking if there exists a sequence of that length, and finding the lex smallest one.\n\nBut how to find the number of variables from the input string?\n\nAnother observation: the sample outputs have lengths that match the number of commas in the part after the colon plus one. For example, sample 3's input has 5 commas in the part after the colon, and output length is 7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of commas plus one. For example, sample 3 has 5 commas, output is 7. No.\n\nThis is not helping. Let's think about the sample input 2, which outputs 'false'. The input is '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.' \n\nThe part after the colon is ':-__>__,_____<__.' Let's count the number of commas in this part: there are two commas. So if the number of variables is 2 + 1 = 3, but the output is 'false', which means no solution exists. But how to know?\n\nAt this point, I think I need to find a way to parse the input string into the number of variables and the constraints on them. Since I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for patterns in the sample inputs and outputs.\n\nSample 1: Output length 4.\n\nSample 4: Output length 4.\n\nSample 1's input has a part after colon of '___>__.' which has 3+2=5 underscores. Sample 4's part after colon is ':-___>__.' which also has 3+2=5 underscores. Both outputs are length 4. So perhaps the number of variables is 5 - 1 = 4? Why subtract one?\n\nMaybe the number of variables is the number of underscores in the part after the colon minus the number of arrows (like >, <, etc.). For example, sample 1's part has 5 underscores and 1 arrow, so 5-1=4.\n\nSample 4's part after colon is '___>__.' which has 5 underscores and 1 arrow → 5-1=4. That matches the output length of 4.\n\nSample 2's part after colon is ':-__>__,_____<__.' Let's count underscores and arrows.\n\nThe part after colon is '__>__,_____<__.' \n\nBreaking it down: \n\nThe first part is '__>__' which has 2 underscores, then '>', then 2 underscores. Then a comma, then '_____<__.' which has 4 underscores, then '<', then 2 underscores. \n\nTotal underscores: 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 = 10. Number of arrows: 2 (one '>' and one '<'). So 10 - 2 = 8. But the output is 'false' which implies no solution. But if the number of variables is 8, then it's possible that no sequence exists, hence 'false'.\n\nSample 3's input part after colon is '___<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.' Let's count underscores and arrows.\n\nEach part between commas has underscores and an arrow. Let's count:\n\nFirst part: '___<___' → 3 underscores, then '<', then 3 underscores. Total underscores: 3 + 3 = 6. One arrow.\n\nSecond part: '___<____' → 3 + 4 = 7 underscores. One arrow.\n\nThird part: '____<_____' → 4 + 5 = 9 underscores. One arrow.\n\nFourth part: '_____<______' → 4 + 6 = 10 underscores. One arrow.\n\nFifth part: '______<_______' → 6 + 7 = 13 underscores. One arrow.\n\nTotal underscores: 6 + 7 + 9 + 10 + 13 = 45. Number of arrows: 5. So 45 - 5 = 40 variables. But the sample output is 7. This doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Sample 3's output is 7, but according to this calculation it would be 40. So this approach is wrong.\n\nBut samples 1 and 4 seem to fit. Let's think again.\n\nMaybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon, minus the number of arrows, minus 1. For example, sample 1: 5 - 1 - 0 = 4? Or 5 - 1 = 4.\n\nBut sample 3 doesn't fit this. So this might be a coincidence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon divided by some factor. For example, in sample 1, 5 underscores, divided by 1.25 gives 4. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: the part after the colon represents a path that the jaws take, and each segment between certain characters represents a variable. For example, each segment between arrows or other operators represents a number of variables.\n\nIn sample 1, the part after colon is '___>__.' which could be interpreted as moving three steps, then turning right, then moving two steps, then ending. The number of variables is the number of steps, which is 3 + 2 = 5. But the output is 4. No.\n\nAlternatively, each arrow represents a direction change, and the number of variables is the number of steps taken in each direction. But this is unclear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for other clues in the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. So the jaws' shape determines the number of variables. So I need to find the number of variables from the jaws part of the input.\n\nThe jaws part is the part inside the parentheses. Let's focus on that.\n\nIn sample 1, the jaws part is \"_-_/___*__\" which has 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 underscores. Sample output is 4 digits. Not matching.\n\nSample 4's jaws part is \"__+___+__-___\" which has 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10 underscores. Output is 4 digits. No match.\n\nAnother observation: the sample outputs for the first and fourth inputs have lengths 4, which is the same as the number of operators in their jaws part. For example, sample 1's jaws part has 3 operators (-, /, *), and sample 4's has 3 operators (+, +, -). But 3 is not 4. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the number of variables is equal to the number of operators plus 1. For sample 1: 3 + 1 = 4, which matches. Sample 4: 3 + 1 = 4, which matches. Sample 2's jaws part is \"__-_+_/_____\" — let's count the operators. The part is \"__-_+_/_____\" → operators are '-', '+', '/'. So 3 operators. Number of variables would be 3 + 1 = 4. But sample 2's output is 'false', which may imply that no solution exists for 4 variables. But how?\n\nLet's check sample 2's input: '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.' \n\nIf the number of variables is 4, then the output would be a 4-digit sequence. But the sample output is 'false', which means no solution exists. So this hypothesis might be correct.\n\nSample 3's jaws part is \"______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___\" — let's count the operators. The operators are '/', '+', '*', '-', '*', '-', so 6 operators. Number of variables would be 6 + 1 = 7, which matches the sample output length of 7. Yes!\n\nThis seems promising! Let's verify:\n\nSample 1: 3 operators → 3 + 1 = 4 variables → output length 4. Correct.\n\nSample 4: 3 operators → 4 variables → output length 4. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 3 operators → 4 variables → output is 'false' (no solution). Correct.\n\nSample 3: 6 operators → 7 variables → output length 7. Correct.\n\nYes! This seems to be the pattern. So the number of variables is equal to the number of operators in the jaws part plus 1. The jaws part is the part inside the parentheses.\n\nNow, the task is to parse the input string to extract the jaws part, count the number of operators in it, add 1 to get the number of variables.\n\nOnce we know the number of variables, we need to find the lex smallest sequence of digits (0-9) that satisfies the constraints imposed by the jaws part.\n\nBut what are the constraints? How do the operators in the jaws part translate into constraints on the variables?\n\nAssuming that the jaws part is a sequence of variables and operators, and the sequence of variables is applied to the operators. For example, each operator requires a certain number of variables to be present on a stack, and the sequence must allow the operations to be performed without errors.\n\nThis sounds like a stack-based evaluation, similar to Befunge's operations. For example, each variable is pushed onto the stack, and each operator pops the required number of values, performs the operation, and pushes the result back.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet's take the first sample's jaws part: \"_-_/___*__\" \n\nThe operators are '-', '/', '*'. So the number of variables is 3 + 1 = 4. Let's assume that the variables are v0, v1, v2, v3.\n\nThe sequence of operations would be:\n\nPush v0, then subtract (which requires two values), but wait, there's only one value on the stack. This would be an error. So this suggests that my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, but this would imply that the sample input is invalid, but the sample output is '0010', which is valid. So this suggests that my assumption about the operators is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the operators are applied in a different way. For example, each operator is applied to the previous variables in a certain way.\n\nLet me think again. If the jaws part is a sequence of variables and operators, and the number of variables is n, and the number of operators is k = n - 1, then it's like an expression with n variables and k operators, forming a valid expression.\n\nFor example, with 4 variables and 3 operators, it could be something like v0 op1 v1 op2 v2 op3 v3. But how to parse the operators?\n\nThe jaws part is \"_-_/___*__\" which has 6 underscores and 3 operators. Let's assume that the operators are applied between the variables. For example, the sequence is v0 - v1 / v2 * v3. But this would require that during evaluation, the operations are performed in a certain order.\n\nBut how to evaluate this expression? Let's see:\n\nThe expression would be (((v0 - v1) / v2) * v3). But this requires that during evaluation, the division and subtraction are done in the correct order.\n\nHowever, this would require that during evaluation, the operations are performed sequentially, and that each operation has sufficient operands on the stack.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of it as a postfix expression, where each operator acts on the top elements of the stack.\n\nFor example, the sequence of tokens would be: v0, v1, '-', v2, '/', v3, '*'.\n\nWait, but the jaws part is \"_-_/___*__\" which has the operators in the order '-', '/', '*'. Let's parse the jaws part as a sequence of tokens: each '_' is",
