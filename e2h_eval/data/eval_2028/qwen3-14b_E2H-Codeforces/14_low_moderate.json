He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the trailing zero count is exactly m. However, there's a catch here. For example, when m is 5, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9) which all have exactly 5 trailing zeros. Wait, but why? Because when you calculate the trailing zeros for 5, it's 1 (from 5/5). Then 25 would contribute more. Wait, let me check the example given. In the first sample input, m is 1, and the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Wait, but wait, 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1 zero), etc. So for m=1, the numbers 5-9 all have exactly one trailing zero. But why?\n\nWait, because for n=5, the count is 1. For n=6, it's still 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1). Similarly up to 9. Then when n reaches 10, it's 2 (10/5=2, plus 10/25=0, so total 2). So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Hence, for m=1, there are 5 numbers. So the problem is to find all n's that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nBut how do I find these n's?\n\nThe key idea here is that for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, for example, if m is 5, then what's the possible n's?\n\nLet me think. Let's compute the trailing zeros for some numbers. Let's take n=24: trailing zeros is 24/5 =4 + 24/25=0 → 4. n=25: 25/5=5 + 25/25=1 → total 6. So between 25 and 24, there's a jump. So for m=5, there are numbers between 25 and ... Well, let's see. Let me find the numbers where the count is exactly 5. Let's think: for n=25, the count is 6. So what about numbers before 25? Let's see. For example, n=24 gives 4. So perhaps there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros? Or maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, maybe there's a range where the count increases by 1. For example, if there's a number where the count increases by 1, then there's a range of numbers that have that count.\n\nWait, but how does the count function behave? The count of trailing zeros is a non-decreasing function as n increases. Because adding a higher number can't decrease the count. So for example, when n increases by 1, the count either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, it adds at least 1. If it's a multiple of 25, adds two, etc.\n\nSo, for a given m, the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros would form a contiguous range. However, sometimes there might be no such n. For example, if m is 5, but there's no n where the count is exactly 5. Like in the case above where between 24 (count 4) and 25 (count 6). So in that case, m=5 would have zero solutions.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n such that the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nFirst, we need to find the minimal n where",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in a factorial are formed and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight:\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5, every multiple of 25 contributes an additional one, and so on. The formula to compute the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is:\n\n$$\n\\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n$$\n\nThis function is non-decreasing as $ n $ increases. Therefore, for a given $ m $, there may be zero or more values of $ n $ such that $ \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = m $.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy:\n\n1. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Use binary search to find the smallest and largest values of $ n $ for which the trailing zeros count is exactly $ m $.\n2. **Check Validity of $ m $**: If no such $ n $ exists (i.e., the trailing zeros function jumps over $ m $), return 0.\n3. **Generate Results**: If such $ n $ values exist, generate them in increasing order.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation:\n\nHere's the Python implementation of the above strategy:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    # Binary search to find the lower bound\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    left = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    left = low\n\n    # Binary search to find the upper bound\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    right = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) > m:\n            high = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    right = high\n\n    if count_trailing_zeros(left) != m:\n        return []\n\n    result = []\n    for n in range(left, right + 1):\n        if count_trailing_zeros(n) == m:\n            result.append(n)\n    return result\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        m = int(line.strip())\n        res = find_n_values(m)\n        print(len(res))\n        if len(res) > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- **count_trailing_zeros(n)**: Computes the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ using the formula.\n- **find_n_values(m)**: Uses binary search to find the smallest and largest values of $ n $ such that the trailing zeros count equals $ m $.
