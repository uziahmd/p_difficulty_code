He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n such that the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how many?\n\nWait, the key here is that the number of trailing zeros increases as n increases, but sometimes multiple n's can give the same count. For example, when m=1, the numbers 5,6,7,8,9 all have exactly one trailing zero. Wait, no. Wait, 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1 zero), etc. So for m=1, the possible n's are 5,6,7,8,9? Wait, but 10! would have 2 trailing zeros. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) give exactly 1 zero. So that's five numbers. Which matches the sample input where m=1 gives output 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSo the first thing is, for a given m, how do I find the possible n's?\n\nBut how do I find the range of n's that produce exactly m zeros?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThis function is non-decreasing. As n increases, f(n) can stay the same or increase. For example, when n is 5, f(n) is 1. Then for n=6, it's still 1. Until n=10, which adds another 5 (from 10/5=2, plus 10/25=0, so total 2). So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Then at 10, it jumps to 2.\n\nSo for each m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers (or maybe other counts?) that have exactly m zeros. Wait, but why 5? Because when you have a number like 5, adding 5,6,7,8,9 (five numbers) gives the same count. But maybe in some cases, there are more or less?\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose m is such that there's a range of numbers where f(n) = m. How long can that range be?\n\nFor example, when n increases by 1, the count of zeros can increase by 0 or 1. Because adding a number that's not a multiple of 5 doesn't add any new 5s. But when you hit a multiple of 5, you add one or more (if it's a multiple of higher powers of 5).\n\nSo, for example, when you hit 25, which is 5^2, then the count increases by 2. So for example, for n=24, the count is floor(24/5) + floor(24/25) = 4 + 0 = 4. For n=25, it's 5 + 1 = 6. So between 25 and 24, the count jumps by 2. So that implies that for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros? Or wait, what's the count for 25?\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nFor n=25: 25/5 = 5, 25/25=1, 25/125=0. Total 5+1=6. So for numbers before 25, say 24: 24/5=4, 24/25=0. Total 4. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Therefore, for m=5, there are zero possible n's. So the answer would be 0.\n\nSo that's why in the sample input, when m=5, the output is 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many positive integers $ n $ exist such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. Additionally, we must output these integers in increasing order if they exist.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the sequence from 1 to $ n $. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\n$$\nf(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\cdots\n$$\n\nThis function is non-decreasing as $ n $ increases. For some values of $ m $, there may be multiple values of $ n $ that produce exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. However, due to the nature of the function $ f(n) $, it's possible that no such $ n $ exists for certain values of $ m $.\n\n---\n\n### Approach\n\nWe proceed with the following steps:\n\n1. **Binary Search**:\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ f(n) = m $.\n   - Then, check how many consecutive values of $ n $ also yield $ f(n) = m $.\n\n2. **Edge Case Handling**:\n   - If no such $ n $ exists (i.e., the function $ f(n) $ skips over $ m $), return `0`.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**:\n   - Implement a helper function `count_zeros(n)` to compute the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ efficiently.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    low, high = 0, 5 * m\n    left = -1\n    right = -1\n\n    # Find the first n where count_zeros(n) == m\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    if count_zeros(low) != m:\n        return []\n\n    # Now find the upper bound\n    low2, high2 = low, 5 * m\n    while low2 <= high2:\n        mid = (low2 + high2) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z > m:\n            high2 = mid - 1\n        else:\n            low2 = mid + 1\n    right = high2\n\n    # All numbers from left to right inclusive have exactly m trailing zeros\n    return list(range(left + 1, right + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input)\n    result = find_n_values(m)\n    print(len(result))\n    if len(result) > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- The `count_zeros` function efficiently calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ using repeated division by powers of 5.\n- We use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds of $ n $ that yield exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n- If no such $ n $ exists, we return an empty list.\n- Finally, we print the count and the sorted list of such $ n $ values.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and accurate, even for large values of $ m $ up to 100,000.",
