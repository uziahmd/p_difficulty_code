He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the trailing zero count is exactly m. Let's think about how the trailing zero count changes as n increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the count of trailing zeros either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. Wait, no. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, then the count increases by 1. But if it's a multiple of 25, then it increases by 2. So, for example, when n crosses 25, the count increases by 2. So, the function is non-decreasing.\n\nSo, for each m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers n that have exactly m trailing zeros. Wait, why 5? Because when you have a number like 25, which contributes two 5s, then the count increases by two. So, between certain ranges, there might be multiple n's that have the same count. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me take the example from the problem. For m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's see:\n\n5! has 1 zero. 6! is 720, which also has 1. Similarly up to 9! which is 362880. So, why does this happen? Because when you go from 4! (which has 0 zeros) to 5! (which adds one 5), then the count increases by 1. Then, for numbers 5-9, the count remains 1. But when you reach 10, which adds another 5 (since 10 is 2*5), so the count becomes 2 (from 10/5=2, plus 10/25=0). So, the count increases by 1 again. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. So for m=1, there are 5 numbers.\n\nSo, the key is that when the trailing zero count increases by more than 1, there's a gap. For example, when n is 25, the count increases by 2. So, for m=5, there might be some numbers that have exactly m zeros. But how to find them?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the trailing zero count is m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have the same count. But how?\n\nWait, here's a thought: For each m, the possible n's that satisfy the condition must lie in a range. Because the trailing zero count function is non-decreasing. So, suppose that for a particular m, there exists some n where the count is m. Then, the numbers from n_min to n_max (where n_max is the first number where the count increases beyond m) will all have exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to find n_min and n_max?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the lower bound and upper bound of n that would produce exactly m trailing zeros. However, how?\n\nAnother approach is to find the smallest n such that the count is m, and then check if the next numbers (n+1, etc.) also have the same count. However, since the count can jump by more than 1, there may be cases where there are no numbers for a given m. For example, if m is 5, but there's a jump from 4 to 6, then there's no n with exactly 5 zeros.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n where the count of trailing zeros is m. Let's call this n_low. Then, find the minimal n where the count is m+1. Let's call this n_high. Then, the numbers between n_low and n_high -1 will have exactly m zeros. But how many numbers are there?\n\nFor example, in the sample input m=1, the minimal n is 5 (count is 1). The next number where count increases is 10 (count is 2). So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. So the count is 5.\n\nSo the number of solutions is n_high - n_low. But wait, if n_high is the first number where the count is m+1, then the numbers from n_low to n_high -1 will have count m. So the number of solutions is (n_high - n_low) ?\n\nBut what if there's no n that gives exactly m zeros? For example, if m is 5, but there is no n such that the count is exactly 5. Then the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Check if there exists any n such that the count is m. If not, output 0.\n\n- If there is, find the lower and upper bounds, then compute the numbers between them.\n\nBut how to find the lower and upper bounds?\n\nTo find the minimal n where the count is m, and the minimal n where the count is m+1.\n\nBut how to find these n's?\n\nWe can use binary search for this. Because the count of trailing zeros increases with n. So for example, to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m, but then check if it's exactly m.\n\nWait, here's a plan:\n\nFirst, write a helper function to compute the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, for a given m, find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) = m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) >= m, and then check if it's exactly m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nWait, but maybe there are multiple n's where count_zeros(n) equals m. For example, in the sample case, m=1, the minimal n is 5. The next n where count_zeros increases is 10. So, the numbers between 5 and 9 (inclusive) all have count 1.\n\nSo, for the upper bound, we can find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m+1. Then the numbers from the lower bound (the first n where count is m) to upper bound -1 will be all the possible n's.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\nGiven m:\n\n1. Find the minimal n_low such that count_zeros(n_low) = m. If there is no such n_low (i.e., the count_zeros(n) never reaches m), then output 0.\n\n2. Find the minimal n_high such that count_zeros(n_high) = m+1.\n\n3. The numbers from n_low to n_high -1 are all the possible n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. The count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to find n_low and n_high?\n\nBut how to find n_low? Because for example, for m=5, there may be no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Let's check that.\n\nLet me compute count_zeros for numbers:\n\nLet's see:\n\ncount_zeros(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\ncount_zeros(25) = 25//5 + 25//25 = 5 + 1 = 6. Oh, so between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there is no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Hence, the answer is 0.\n\nSo for m=5, the answer is 0.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nFind the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. How?\n\nWell, perhaps using binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m, and then check if it's exactly m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, we can find the lower and upper bounds using binary search.\n\nLet me think about how to find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m, and then check if count_zeros(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nSimilarly, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nOnce we have these two values, then the count is (n_high - n_low).\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m?\n\nThis can be done via binary search.\n\nLet me think about the binary search approach for finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe count_zeros function is non-decreasing, so binary search is possible.\n\nSo, for example, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m is the lower bound.\n\nOnce we find that, we can check if count_zeros(n) is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, the lower bound is n_low.\n\nSimilarly, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. That is n_high.\n\nThen, the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are the valid numbers.\n\nSo the number of solutions is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut wait, let's take the sample case where m=1.\n\nFor m=1, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1 is 5. And count_zeros(5) is 1, so it's valid. Then for m+1=2, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=2 is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. So 10-5 =5, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example, m=5. Let's say we find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Let's compute.\n\nLet's try n=25: count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is larger than m=5. Hence, there is no solution. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor given m:\n\n- Find the minimal n_low where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n- Check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, then return 0.\n\n- Else, find the minimal n_high where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\n- The answer is the numbers from n_low to n_high -1, inclusive. The count is n_high - n_low.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nImplement a function count_zeros(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nImplement a binary search function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nNow, how to implement the binary search.\n\nThe binary search for finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nThe lower bound for n can be 0, and upper bound can be 5*m (since for n=5*m, the count_zeros(n) is at least m, because 5*m /5 = m, and higher terms add more. So for example, for target m, the upper bound can be 5*m. But maybe even 5*m is too big. But for binary search, it's manageable.\n\nBut for m up to 1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the binary search function would look something like this:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but for example, if the target is m, then this function returns the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nOnce we get that n_low, we check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\nOtherwise, proceed to find n_high, which is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nThen, the numbers from n_low to n_high -1 are the valid ones.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input m=1, n_low is 5, and n_high is 10. So the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's compute.\n\nfind_min_n(5) returns the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(24) is 4+0=4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25, but count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So there is no solution. Hence, output 0.\n\nThus, the code structure would be:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthe answer is the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 inclusive.\n\nthe count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to handle cases where m+1 is not possible? Well, for example, if m is very large, but the code would still work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, implement the count_zeros function.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, the find_min_n function. Let's code that as a helper function.\n\nBut for the binary search, the upper bound can be set as 5*m. But for m=1, 5*1=5, which is the correct n_low. But for m=5, 5*5=25, which is the n_low. But for m=100000, 5*m is 500000, which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, what if m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nBut wait, what if the target is larger than the maximum possible count_zeros(n)? For example, m is 1e5, but for some n, count_zeros(n) can't reach m. But according to the problem statement, m can be up to 1e5, but for n=5*1e5, count_zeros(n) is 1e5 + 2e4 + ... which is definitely larger than m. So for the given problem constraints, the upper bound of 5*m is sufficient.\n\nBut perhaps for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is acceptable for binary search.\n\nOnce we find n_low, check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, then output 0.\n\nElse, find n_high as find_min_n(m+1). Then the answer is the list from n_low to n_high-1.\n\nSo the code for the problem would be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthe numbers are from n_low to n_high-1 inclusive.\n\nSo the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut what if m is such that there are multiple numbers?\n\nBut for example, when m=5, the code would find n_low as 25 (count_zeros(25)=6, which is not equal to m=5, so output 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6. Let's see.\n\nfind_min_n(6) would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=6.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So n_low=25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is equal to m=6. Then find n_high for m+1=7. find_min_n(7) would be 25? Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So for target 7, the minimal n is 25+1=26?\n\nWait, let's compute count_zeros(25) is 6, count_zeros(26) is 6, ..., count_zeros(29) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 30//5 + 30//25 = 6 + 1 =7. So the minimal n for target 7 is 30. So n_high is 30. Thus, the numbers from 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers. So the answer is 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the code would output 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, the code needs to read m from input, and output the k and the numbers.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nn_low = find_min_n(1) → returns 5. count_zeros(5) is 1, which is correct. n_high = find_min_n(2) → returns 10. So numbers from 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers. Output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSample input 2: m=5. n_low is find_min_n(5) → let's see. Let's compute:\n\nfind_min_n(5) is looking for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(24) is 4+0=4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the binary search would find 25 as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5. But count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=6. The code would output 5 numbers.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what about when m=0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. Let's think about the input.\n\nThe input is a single integer m. But in the example, the input is ['1', '5'] which probably represents two test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the example input is:\n\nInput\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases? But the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer m. But the example shows input as ['1', '5'], which seems to be a list of two test cases. But perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. For example, perhaps the example is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the first sample input, the input is 1, and output is 5 followed by the numbers. In the second sample input, the input is 5, output is 0.\n\nSo perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. But the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. However, the example shows that the input is a list of two elements. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo perhaps the input is a single integer m, but the example shows two test cases. Maybe the example is written in a way that the input is a list of test cases, but the actual code should process a single m.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should read multiple lines of input. But the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are provided, but the original problem says that the input is a single integer. But perhaps the example is written in a way that the input is a list of test cases, but the code should read one line per test case.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m...\n\nSo the code should read a single integer m. However, the sample shows two test cases. But perhaps that's a mistake. For example, the first sample input is m=1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second sample input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut the way the sample is presented is perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single integer m. Therefore, perhaps the sample is presented as a list of inputs and outputs for multiple test cases, but the actual code should read a single m.\n\nBut the user's note says:\n\nNote that this is a very easy question.\n\nSo perhaps the code should read a single m from input, and output the required answer.\n\nBut the example shows that for input 1, the output is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\", and for input 5, output is 0. So perhaps the code should read m from input, and output the answer accordingly.\n\nThus, the code should read m from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list, but perhaps that's a mistake. For example, in the problem statement, the input is a single integer m. So the code should read m from stdin, which is a single integer.\n\nTherefore, the code will read m from input, and output the answer.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nImplement the helper functions.\n\nBut for the code, the code must read from stdin. So:\n\nRead m from input. For example, m = int(input().strip())\n\nThen, proceed as per the algorithm.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nImplement find_min_n(target):\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nBut for large target, 5*target could be very big. For example, m=1e5, 5*1e5=5e5. But even for that, the binary search is manageable.\n\nOnce we have that, proceed:\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = n_high - n_low\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nWait, but for the sample input m=1, the code would generate range(5, 10) which is 5,6,7,8,9. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, range(n_low, n_high) is [n_low, n_high-1], since range is exclusive of the end. So yes.\n\nBut in Python, range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code would output k, then the numbers.\n\nBut what if k is zero? Well, in that case, the code would have printed 0 earlier.\n\nBut in the else clause, k is n_high -n_low. For example, in the case where m=6, n_high is 30, n_low is 25. So k=5, and the numbers are 25-29.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut let's test for m=6:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(6) → 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) → 30. So numbers are 25-29 (5 numbers). So the code would output 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says m starts from 1.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where m=0: but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nAnother edge case: m=1. Which is handled correctly.\n\nAnother edge case: m=2.\n\nLet's compute.\n\nFor m=2, find_min_n(2) is 10 (count_zeros(10) is 2). Then find_min_n(3) is 15 (count_zeros(15) is 3). So numbers from 10 to 14 inclusive. That's 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by 10 11 12 13 14.\n\nAnother case: m=24.\n\nLet's see. For example, n=99: count_zeros(99) is 99//5 =19 + 99//25=3 + 99//125=0 → total 22. Not enough. n=100: 100//5=20 + 100//25=4 + 100//125=0 → 24. So count_zeros(100) is 24. So for m=24, n_low is 100. Then find_min_n(25) would be 100? Or higher?\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. So for target 25, find_min_n(25) would be 105? Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(105) = 105//5=21 + 105//25=4 + 105//125=0 → 25. So n_high is 105. So the numbers from 100 to 104 inclusive. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo code would output 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nBut what if m is 25?\n\nfind_min_n(25) would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=25. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(105) is 25. So n_low is 105. count_zeros(105) is 25. So proceed. Then find_min_n(26) is 110? Let's check count_zeros(110) is 22 + 4 (from 110//25=4) → 26? 110//5=22, 110//25=4, 110//125=0. Total 22+4=26. So n_high is 110. So numbers from 105 to 109 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother case: m=6. As discussed earlier.\n\nBut what if there is a case where the count_zeros(n) jumps by more than 1?\n\nLike m=5. Which is impossible. So the code would return 0.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nBut for the code, the code must read m from input, and output the answer.\n\nBut when m is very large, say 1e5, the code may take some time, but with binary search, it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut the code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut the code must handle multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So the code reads one line, which is m.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is ['1', '5'], which may be a mistake. However, the user's note says that the first sample input is 1, and output is 5 followed by numbers, and the second input is 5 with output 0.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single integer. So the code should read m as int(input().strip()).\n\nThus, the code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = n_high - n_low\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nWait, but for the sample input m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. But the code would print 5 followed by the numbers. However, the code prints the numbers as a space-separated line. But the sample output shows that the first line is k, then the second line is the numbers. But the code is printing k followed by the numbers in the same line? No, the code does:\n\nprint(k) → which prints k followed by a newline.\n\nThen print(' '.join(...)), which prints the numbers separated by spaces, followed by a newline.\n\nWhich matches the sample. For example, for the first sample input, the output is:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the sample output given, the first output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is two lines. The code does that.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if k is zero? Then the code would print 0, and not print anything else. Which is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input m=5:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(5). Let's see:\n\ntarget is 5.\n\nbinary search between 0 and 25.\n\nInitially, low=0, high=25.\n\nmid = 12. count_zeros(12) is 2 (12//5=2, 12//25=0). 2 <5 → low becomes 13.\n\nmid = (13+25)/2 = 19. count_zeros(19) is 3 (19//5=3). Still less than 5. low becomes 20.\n\nmid = (20+25)/2=22. count_zeros(22)=4. Still less. low=23.\n\nmid= (23+25)/2=24. count_zeros(24)=4. low=25. Now low=high=25. return 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So print 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. The code would return 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when m is such that there is exactly one n. For example, when m=24, but the code returns 5 numbers. Wait, no. For m=24, the code would have n_low=100 (count_zeros(100)=24), and n_high is find_min_n(25) which is 105. So the numbers are 100-104, which is 5 numbers. So even for m=24, it's 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if m is such that there's only one number?\n\nIs there such a case?\n\nFor example, let's imagine m=25. Suppose that the count_zeros(n) jumps from 24 to 25. But that's not possible. Because when you increase n by 1, the count_zeros increases by the number of 5s in that n. For example, if n is 100, count_zeros is 24. Then n=101, count_zeros is 24. ... until n=105, which adds another 5 (since 105 is divisible by 5). So count_zeros(105) is 25. So for m=25, the n_low is 105. Then n_high is find_min_n(26) which is 110. So numbers from 105 to 109, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo, in all cases, the number of solutions is either 0 or 5?\n\nWait, why 5? Because when the count_zeros increases by 1, the numbers between n_low and n_high-1 is 5 numbers. But why?\n\nBecause when the count_zeros increases by 1, the difference between n_high and n_low is 5.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause when the count_zeros increases by 1, the next number is 5 more than the previous. For example, when you have a number that is not a multiple of 5, adding 1 to it doesn't change the count. But when you reach a multiple of 5, it increases by 1. But if it's a multiple of 25, then it increases by 2, etc.\n\nBut in the case where the count_zeros increases by 1, the numbers between n_low and n_high-1 are 5 numbers. For example, when m=2, n_low=10, n_high=15. So numbers from 10 to 14, which is 5 numbers.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause for n=10, count is 2. For n=11, same. Up to n=14. Then n=15 adds another 5 (count_zeros(15) is 3). So the difference is 15-10=5. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo in general, when the count_zeros increases by 1, the difference between n_high and n_low is 5, hence 5 numbers.\n\nBut what if the count_zeros increases by more than 1?\n\nFor example, when m=4, and the count_zeros jumps from 4 to 6. Then, there's no solution for m=5, but for m=4, the code would find n_low=20 (count_zeros(20) is 4+0=4?), wait:\n\ncount_zeros(20) is 20//5=4, 20//25=0. Total 4. So for m=4, n_low is 20. Then n_high is find_min_n(5) which is 25. So numbers from 20 to 24 inclusive. Which is 5 numbers. So for m=4, there are 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nSo in this case, the count_zeros increases by 2 (from 4 to 6). But for m=4, the numbers are 20-24 (5 numbers) which have exactly 4 trailing zeros.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code is written. Now, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut for the code, when the code prints the numbers, it uses 'range(n_low, n_high)'. However, in Python, the range is up to but not including the end. So for example, if n_high is 10, range(n_low, n_high) is from n_low to 9. Which is correct, since n_high is the first number where count_zeros is m+1. So the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are the valid ones.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing for m=5, the code returns 0.\n\nAnother test case: m=24, the code returns 5 numbers: 100, 101, 102, 103, 104.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of values for $ n $ that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, making the count of 5s the limiting factor.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: To efficiently find the smallest $ n $ such that $ n! $ has at least $ m $ trailing zeros, we use binary search. This helps in narrowing down the range of possible values for $ n $ quickly.\n\n3. **Check Validity of Range**: Once we determine the smallest $ n $ (let's call it $ n_{\\text{low}} $) that has exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we then find the smallest $ n $ (let's call it $ n_{\\text{high}} $) that has $ m+1 $ trailing zeros. The valid range of $ n $ values that result in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros lies between $ n_{\\text{low}} $ and $ n_{\\text{high}} - 1 $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input().strip())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = n_high - n_low\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5 and summing up the quotients until $ n $ becomes zero.\n\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the given target value. The upper bound for the binary search is set to $ 5 \\times \\text{target} $, which is a safe estimate based on the properties of trailing zeros in factorials.\n\n3. **Main Logic**: After determining the smallest $ n $ (n_low) that has exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we check if it is valid. If valid, we find the smallest $ n $ (n_high) that has $ m+1 $ trailing zeros. The valid range of $ n $ values is from $ n_{\\text{low}} $ to $ n_{\\text{high}} - 1 $, which gives the count of such $ n $ values and the values themselves.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the required range using binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large values of $ m $.",
