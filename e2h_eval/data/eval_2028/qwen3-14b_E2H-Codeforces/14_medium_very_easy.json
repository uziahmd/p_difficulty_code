    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n such that the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, no, the sample input was m=5, and the output was 5 numbers. Wait the first example input is '1' and output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'? Wait no, looking back: the example input is ['1', '5']? Wait the example says input is '1' and output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'? Or maybe the example input is m=5, and output is 0? Wait the example shows:\n\nInput: ['1', '5'] — perhaps that's two test cases? Wait the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. Oh, perhaps the example shows two different cases. Like, for input m=1, the output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. And for input m=5, the output is 0. Wait the sample input shows that when m is 5, the output is 0? Or maybe the example is a bit different. Let me check again.\n\nThe example says:\n\nInput:\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nAh, maybe the first input is m=1, and the second is m=5. But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the example is showing two different test cases. For example, when m is 1, the answer is 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9), but when m is 5, there are zero such numbers. Wait why?\n\nWait let me think. For m=5, what n's would have exactly 5 trailing zeros?\n\nLet me compute trailing zeros for some numbers:\n\nFor n=24: floor(24/5) =4, floor(24/25)=0. Total 4. So not enough.\n\nn=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So 6 zeros. So for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Because between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. Hence, for m=5, the answer is zero. So that's why the sample input for m=5 outputs 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Now, how do I find those n's?\n\nThe approach I think is:\n\nFirst, for a given m, find the possible n's. But how?\n\nThe key is that the count of trailing zeros is a non-decreasing function as n increases. So for each m, there can be either 0, 1, or 5 numbers (or some other count?) that have exactly m trailing zeros.\n\nWait, for example, when m=1, the numbers 5,6,7,8,9 all have exactly 1 trailing zero. Because 5! is 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1), etc. So that's 5 numbers. So why does that happen?\n\nBecause when you reach n=5, the count increases by 1. Then, for n=6, the count remains same as 5, since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1. So for numbers between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Then when n reaches 10, the count increases by 2 (since 10/5=2, 10/25=0, so total 2). So the count increases by 2 here. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. So for m=1, there are 5 numbers.\n\nSo the idea is that for each m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait but how?\n\nBut how to find the possible n's for a given m.\n\nThe plan is:\n\n- Find the minimum n such that the count of trailing zeros is m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have the same count.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find all n where count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find these n's efficiently.\n\nFirst, we can find the lower and upper bounds for n.\n\nLet me think of the count_zeros function as f(n). So f(n) is the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nWe need to find all n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut since f(n) is non-decreasing, the set of n's that satisfy f(n) = m must form a contiguous range. So if there exists such n's, they will be from some lower bound to upper bound.\n\nBut how to find that range?\n\nFor example, for m=1, the range is 5 to 9. So the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. So the count is 5 numbers.\n\nBut how to find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nSo, for a given m, first check if there exists any n such that f(n) = m. If not, output 0. Else, find the minimal and maximal n that have exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to find them.\n\nLet me think of binary search. For example, to find the minimal n where f(n) = m. But since f(n) can be m for multiple n's, perhaps we can find the first occurrence and the last occurrence.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the smallest n where f(n) = m, and then find the largest n where f(n) = m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) are the solutions.\n\nBut how to find the first and last occurrence.\n\nLet me think. For example, for m=5, the minimal n where f(n) >= m is 25. But f(25) is 6, which is larger than 5. So there's no solution.\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Let's call it low.\n\n2. Find the maximal n such that f(n) = m. Call it high.\n\nIf such n exists, then the count is high - low + 1. But how to find low and high.\n\nBut how to find if there exists any n with f(n) = m.\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, find the possible n's by checking if there's a value where f(n) = m. For example, find the lower bound and upper bound.\n\nBut how to find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nLet me think of using binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is equal to m. Similarly, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1, then subtract 1 to get the upper bound.\n\nWait, for example, suppose we want to find the maximum n where f(n) = m. That would be the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1 minus 1. Because once f(n) reaches m+1, all higher numbers will have at least m+1 zeros. So the maximum n with exactly m zeros is the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1 minus 1.\n\nSimilarly, the minimal n with exactly m zeros is the minimal n where f(n) >= m and f(n) == m. But how?\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nCompute the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call it left.\n\nIf f(left) != m, then there are no solutions. So return 0.\n\nOtherwise, compute the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Call it right. Then the maximum n with exactly m zeros is right -1.\n\nSo the range of n's is from left to right-1. The count is right - left.\n\nSo for example, in the case where m=1:\n\nleft is 5 (since f(5) is 1). Then compute right as the minimal n where f(n) >= 2. Let's see: for n=10, f(10) is 2. So right is 10. So the maximum n is 9. So the numbers are 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers (9-5+1 = 5).\n\nSo the count is right - left, which is 10-5 =5. Which matches.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For given m, find left = the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\n- Check if f(left) is m. If not, return 0.\n\n- Else, find right = minimal n where f(n) >= m+1.\n\n- The numbers are from left to right-1. So the count is right - left.\n\nThus, the number of n's is right - left.\n\nBut how to compute left and right.\n\nTo compute left, we can use binary search. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, we can perform binary search on n to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nBut what's the possible range of n for binary search?\n\nWell, for m, the minimal n that can have f(n) = m is m*5. Because for example, m=1, 5 is 5*1. But for m=5, the minimal n is 25, but f(25) is 6. So that's not the case. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count of zeros is at least m. Because each multiple of 5 contributes at least 1. So for example, 5*m /5 = m. So the count is at least m. So for binary search, the upper bound can be 5*m.\n\nBut wait, for m=5, 5*5=25, which gives 6 zeros. So the upper bound may need to be higher. Wait, but for the binary search, we can use a higher upper bound. For example, 5*m is sufficient for the upper bound. Because for m=5, 5*5=25 gives f(25) = 6, which is larger than m. So the minimal n for m=5 is somewhere between 20 and 25. But if the upper bound is 5*m, then it's okay.\n\nBut perhaps the upper bound can be 5*m. Let's think: For any m, the minimal n that gives f(n) >= m is less than or equal to 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count is floor(5m/5) + floor(5m/25) + ... which is m + floor(m/5) + ... which is >=m. So yes, 5m is an upper bound for the binary search.\n\nSo for binary search, the lower bound can be 0, and upper bound can be 5*m.\n\nSo the code for finding left and right would be:\n\nImplement a function count_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, for a given m, find left via binary search in [0, 5*m] for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce left is found, check if count_zeros(left) == m. If not, then there are no solutions.\n\nElse, find right via binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the answer is all numbers from left to right-1.\n\nSo the number of values is right - left.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this correctly.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute left = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(left) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute right = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthe numbers are from left to right-1.\n\nso the count is right - left.\n\nThen, output the count followed by the numbers in order.\n\nBut how to implement find_min_n(target)?\n\nImplement binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nLet me think about the binary search function.\n\nFunction find_min_n(target):\n\nlow = 0\n\nhigh = 5 * target (or something like that)\n\nwhile low < high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n    if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n        high = mid\n\n    else:\n\n        low = mid + 1\n\nreturn low\n\nYes, that's a standard binary search for the first occurrence where the condition is met.\n\nSo for example, for target m, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce that is found, check if count_zeros(n) == m.\n\nNow, for example, when m=5, the find_min_n(5) would return 25? Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So for target=5, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25? Or maybe 24?\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4 <5. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6. So when we check, it's not equal to m=5. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo in this case, the code would output zero.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example, m=1.\n\nfind_min_n(1) would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1. Which is 5. Then check if count_zeros(5) is 1, which it is. Then find find_min_n(2) which is 10. So the numbers are 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would generate 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this correctly.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nFirst, the count_zeros function.\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's the standard way to compute the number of trailing zeros.\n\nNow, for the binary search functions.\n\nBut for the binary search, the upper bound for the initial search can be 5*m. However, when m is 0, but according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. So for m=1, 5*1=5, but the minimal n is 5. So that works.\n\nBut for m=5, the upper bound is 25, which is correct.\n\nBut what if m is very large, say 1e5? 5*1e5 is 500,000. But the binary search would run in O(log(5m)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nif m is 0, but according to input constraints, m is >=1.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nImplement the find_min_n function as a helper.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps we can write a helper function.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nBut for very large m, 5*m may be too big? For example, m=1e5, 5*1e5=5e5. But even for that, the binary search is manageable.\n\nOnce we have left = find_min_n(m), then check if count_zeros(left) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, compute right = find_min_n(m+1). Then the numbers are from left to right-1.\n\nSo the list is [left, left+1, ..., right-1].\n\nThe count is right - left.\n\nSo, for example, if right - left is 5, then output 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut what if m is such that there are multiple n's. For example, m=2.\n\nLet me check:\n\nfind_min_n(2) is 10? Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2. So yes. Then find_min_n(3) is 15?\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). So yes. So the numbers are from 10 to 14. Which is 5 numbers. So 10,11,12,13,14. So count is 5.\n\nBut wait, count_zeros(10) is 2, 11 is same, etc. So yes.\n\nBut why is the count 5 numbers here?\n\nBecause when n increases from 10 to 14, the count_zeros is 2. Then at 15, it becomes 3. So yes.\n\nSo the code would return 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, handling the case when m is such that there are no n's. For example, m=5.\n\nSo, left = find_min_n(5) returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So it's not equal to m=5. So output 0.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nRead m from input. Then:\n\nleft = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(left) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    right = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    numbers = list(range(left, right))\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nBut wait, the range from left to right-1 inclusive. So in Python, range(left, right) gives left, left+1,..., right-1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for example, left=5, right=10. range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 elements. Correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for m=0, but according to problem statement m starts from 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nleft = find_min_n(1) → 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\nright = find_min_n(2) → 10. So numbers are 5 to 9. Output is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nSample input m=5:\n\nleft = find_min_n(5) → 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5 → output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=6. What is the answer?\n\nLet's think. For m=6, possible n's?\n\nFind left = find_min_n(6). Let's compute:\n\nWhat's the first n where count_zeros(n) >=6.\n\nLet's compute for 25: count is 6. So left is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So yes. Then find right = find_min_n(7). Let's compute for 25, count_zeros(25) is 6. So need to find the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=25: 6.\n\nn=29: 29//5=5, 29//25=1 → total 6. Still 6.\n\nn=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 7. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. So the numbers are from 25 to 29. That's 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nSo the code would output that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut what about when m is very large, like 1e5?\n\nBut the code should handle it.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input. But the input is a single integer. So in Python:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nleft = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(left) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    right = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    nums = list(range(left, right))\n\n    print(len(nums))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, nums)))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the output for m=1 is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut in the code, when len(nums) is 5, then print(len(nums)), then the numbers. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first case is m=1, and the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut the code would print 5 followed by the numbers. So yes.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is written as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'] for the two test cases. So for the first input m=1, the code produces that.\n\nBut for the code, when m is 1, the code outputs 5 followed by the numbers. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about when the numbers are empty? For example, when m=5, the code prints 0.\n\nBut what if m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle that.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, the code would process it, but the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nBut let's test for m=5.\n\nBut for m=5, the code:\n\nleft = find_min_n(5) → which is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So 6 !=5 → print 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. As discussed earlier, the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nAnother test case: m=2. The numbers are 10-14. So 5 numbers.\n\nBut wait, what about m=3?\n\nLet me compute:\n\nfind_min_n(3) → find the first n where count_zeros(n) >=3.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=15: 15//5=3, 15//25=0. Total 3. So left=15. count_zeros(15)=3. Then find_min_n(4) is 20?\n\ncount_zeros(20) is 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0). So right=20. So the numbers are 15-19. Which is 5 numbers. So yes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there is only one n?\n\nIs there any m where the count is 1?\n\nFor example, m=4. Let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(4) is 20? Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(20) is 4. Then find_min_n(5) is 25. So numbers from 20 to 24. Which is 5 numbers. So count is 5.\n\nWait, but what about m=24?\n\nLet me think. For example, when m=24, what is the count?\n\nLet me find the numbers where count_zeros(n) =24.\n\nBut perhaps for some m, the numbers are not 5. For example, when m is 25?\n\nWait, let's think about n=100. count_zeros(100) is 24 (100/5=20, 100/25=4, 100/125=0 → 24). Then n=101, 102, 103, 104: same count. Then n=105: 105/5=21, 105/25=4, 105/125=0 → 25. So for m=24, the numbers are 100, 101, 102, 103, 104. So 5 numbers. So again, 5.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there is only one n?\n\nIs that possible?\n\nLet me think. Suppose m is 5, but no. For example, when m=6, the numbers are 25,26,27,28,29. So 5 numbers.\n\nWait, but what if there's a case where the next number jumps by more than 1?\n\nLike for example, when n=24, count_zeros is 4. n=25 gives 6. So for m=5, there's no solution.\n\nSo for m=5, the code returns 0.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=1 → output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSample Input 2: m=5 → output is 0.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n   \n2. **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the range of $ n $ values that produce exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we use binary search. This helps us quickly determine the smallest $ n $ where the count of trailing zeros is at least $ m $ and the smallest $ n $ where the count is at least $ m + 1 $.\n\n3. **Range Calculation**: Using the results from binary search, we determine the range of $ n $ values that result in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If no such values exist, we return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\nleft = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(left) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    right = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    nums = list(range(left, right))\n    print(len(nums))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, nums)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5 and summing the quotients until $ n $ becomes zero.\n\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the count of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the given target value. This helps in determining the lower and upper bounds of valid $ n $ values.\n\n3. **Main Logic**:\n   - Read the input value $ m $.\n   - Use `find_min_n` to determine the smallest $ n $ where the trailing zero count is at least $ m $.\n   - Check if this $ n $ actually results in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If not, print 0.\n   - If valid, find the smallest $ n $ where the trailing zero count is at least $ m + 1 $, which gives the upper bound for valid $ n $ values.\n   - Output the count of valid $ n $ values and the values themselves in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the valid range of $ n $ values using binary search, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
