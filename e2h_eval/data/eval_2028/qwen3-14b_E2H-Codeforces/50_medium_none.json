    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the sum of d(1,n) for all good trees. Let me first understand what a good tree is.\n\nSo, a good tree is an edge-weighted tree where each edge has weight 1 or -1. And for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i must be -1. Oh right, because each vertex's edges' product is -1. \n\nWait, for each vertex, the product of all edges connected to it is -1. So for example, if a vertex has degree k, then the product of its k edges is -1. Since each edge is either 1 or -1, that product depends on the number of -1s. For instance, if there are an odd number of -1 edges connected to a vertex, the product would be -1. Because (-1)^odd = -1, and 1s don't affect the product. So for each vertex, the number of edges with -1 weight incident to it must be odd. \n\nBut how does that constraint affect the structure of the tree? Let's think about the degrees. Each vertex's degree in a tree is at least 1 (unless it's a single node). Wait, but for n=1, the tree is just one node. But according to the problem statement, n is given as a positive integer. However, the sample input includes n=1, which outputs 0. Because d(1,1) is zero regardless of anything. But let's think about the constraints for a good tree when n=1. Well, since there are no edges, the product condition for the single vertex is... well, the product of zero edges. Wait, but the product of zero terms is 1. But the problem says that the product must be -1. So for n=1, there are no trees that are good. But the sample input for n=1 outputs 0. Wait, the note says that for the second test case (n=1?), the answer is 0. Wait, looking back: the second example input is 1, output is 0. But according to the note, for n=1, the value of d(1,1) is 0. However, the problem says that the trees must be good. But for n=1, there are no edges, so for the single vertex, the product of the edges (zero edges) is 1. Which doesn't equal -1. Therefore, there are zero good trees for n=1. But the answer is zero because the sum over all good trees is zero. But the sample input for n=1 gives output 0. So that's correct.\n\nSo, the first thing to do is to figure out for which n there exists any good trees. Because for some n, there might be no good trees. For example, n=1. Let's think about the constraints.\n\nEach vertex must have an odd number of edges with weight -1. Let's consider the degrees of the vertices. For a tree with n vertices, the sum of degrees is 2(n-1). Let's denote for each vertex i, the number of edges with weight -1 incident to it is m_i. Then, for each i, m_i must be odd. So the sum of m_i over all vertices is equal to the sum of the number of edges with -1 in the entire tree multiplied by 2? Wait, no. Because each edge connects two vertices. So each edge contributes to the count of m_i for both of its endpoints. So if an edge has weight -1, then it contributes 1 to the count of m_i for both of its endpoints. If it has weight 1, it contributes 0. So the total sum of m_i over all vertices is equal to twice the number of edges with weight -1. Let's denote that as 2k, where k is the number of edges with weight -1.\n\nBut since each m_i is odd, the sum of all m_i is the sum of n odd numbers. The sum of n odd numbers is congruent to n mod 2. Because each odd number is 1 mod 2. So the total sum is n mod 2. But the sum is also 2k, which is 0 mod 2. Therefore, we have n â‰¡ 0 mod 2. Which implies that n must be even for there to exist any good trees. Otherwise, if n is odd, the sum of m_i would be n mod 2 = 1 mod 2, but 2k is 0 mod 2. Contradiction. Therefore, for n odd, there are no good trees. Hence, the answer is 0 when n is odd. \n\nWait, that's a crucial point. So for n odd, the answer is zero. Let's check the sample input. The second input is n=1, which is odd. Output is 0. Third input is n=4 (even), output is non-zero. Fourth input is n=10 (even), output is non-zero. So for n even, there may be good trees, but for n odd, there are none. So the first thing our code can do is check if n is odd. If it is, output 0. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nSo for even n, we need to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to handling even n. Let's proceed under the assumption that n is even.\n\nNow, the question is: How to compute the sum of d(1,n) for all good trees.\n\nLet me think about the properties of good trees. \n\nFirst, the tree must satisfy that for every vertex, the product of the edge weights incident to it is -1. As discussed earlier, this implies that each vertex has an odd number of edges with weight -1. \n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think about the edges. Each edge is between two vertices. Let's consider that each edge's weight is either 1 or -1. However, the constraints on the product per vertex imply that the number of -1 edges incident to each vertex is odd. \n\nBut how can we count the number of such trees? Well, perhaps we can model this as a system of equations. However, considering that the tree is arbitrary, maybe there's a way to find the number of valid assignments of edge weights given a particular tree structure. But since the problem requires considering all possible trees and their edge weightings, perhaps we need to find a way to compute the sum over all possible good trees.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a clever combinatorial approach here. Let's think about the constraints again. \n\nEach edge's weight is either 1 or -1. For each vertex, the product of the edges adjacent to it is -1. Let me think about the parity of the number of -1 edges adjacent to each vertex. For each vertex, the number of -1 edges is odd. \n\nBut since each edge is between two vertices, changing the weight of an edge affects two vertices. This seems like a system of linear equations over GF(2), but perhaps not. Let me think: the product of the edges around a vertex is -1. Taking logs (but since we are dealing with multiplicative factors, perhaps not helpful). Alternatively, considering that the product of the edges is -1, which is equivalent to the sum of the exponents (mod 2) being 1. Since each edge weight is either 1 or -1, which can be represented as (-1)^x where x is 0 or 1. Then, the product is (-1)^sum(x_i), where x_i is the number of -1 edges adjacent to the vertex. For the product to be -1, sum(x_i) must be 1 mod 2. So for each vertex, the sum of x_i (the variables indicating whether the edge is -1 or not) must be 1 mod 2. \n\nSo this is a system of linear equations over GF(2). Each equation corresponds to a vertex. For each edge, the variable is whether it is -1 (1) or not (0). Each equation is the sum of variables (edges) incident to the vertex equals 1 mod 2. \n\nBut for a tree, which is a connected graph with n-1 edges. The system has n equations (one per vertex) and n-1 variables (each edge is a variable). However, the sum of all equations would be sum_{v} (sum_{e incident to v} x_e) ) mod 2. Each edge is counted twice (once for each endpoint). So the total sum is 2 * sum x_e mod 2, which is 0. On the other hand, the sum of the equations is sum_{v} 1 mod 2 = n mod 2. For the system to be consistent, we must have that n mod 2 is 0. Which is exactly our earlier conclusion that n must be even. \n\nSo when n is even, the system is consistent. For even n, the system has solutions. The number of solutions depends on the rank of the system. \n\nBut since the system is over GF(2), and the equations are dependent (sum of all equations is zero), the rank is n-1. So the solution space is of dimension (number of variables) - (rank of equations). The number of variables is n-1. The rank is n-1 - 1? Wait, the equations are n equations, but they have a dependency. So the rank is n-1. So the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} }? No, wait. The number of solutions is 2^{number of variables - rank}. The rank is n-1 (since the equations are dependent, but the rank is n-1). The number of variables is n-1. So the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 2^0 = 1. So there is exactly one solution for the system of equations. \n\nWait, that can't be. For example, take n=2. The tree is just one edge between 1 and 2. The equations are:\n\nFor vertex 1: x_1 = 1 mod 2.\n\nFor vertex 2: x_1 = 1 mod 2.\n\nSo the system is consistent, and the only solution is x_1 = 1. So indeed, there is exactly one solution. Which matches the first sample input. For n=2, there is exactly one good tree. Which is the tree with one edge of weight -1. And d(1,2) is -1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4. Let's imagine a tree. Suppose we have a star-shaped tree with node 1 connected to nodes 2, 3, 4. Then, each of the three edges must be assigned weights such that for each node, the product is -1. For node 1, which has three edges, the product of the three edges must be -1. For each of nodes 2, 3, 4, which have one edge each. So for each of these nodes, the product (which is just the weight of their single edge) must be -1. Therefore, each of the edges (1-2, 1-3, 1-4) must be -1. Then, for node 1, the product is (-1)^3 = -1, which satisfies the condition. So this is a valid assignment. But there's only one solution? Because according to the previous logic, the system has exactly one solution. But in this case, the three edges are fixed. However, what if the tree is different? Like a chain 1-2-3-4. Then, for each node, the product of edges adjacent to it must be -1. Let's see:\n\nNode 1: has one edge (to 2). So its product is the weight of that edge. Must be -1. So edge 1-2 is -1.\n\nNode 2: has edges to 1 and 3. Their product must be -1. Since edge 1-2 is -1, the edge 2-3 must be 1. Because (-1) * x = -1 => x = 1.\n\nNode 3: has edges to 2 and 4. Their product must be -1. Edge 2-3 is 1, so edge 3-4 must be -1.\n\nNode 4: has one edge (to 3), so it must be -1. Which matches.\n\nSo in this case, the edge weights are determined uniquely. So for any tree structure, the edge weights are uniquely determined. Which suggests that for any tree structure, there's exactly one way to assign the edge weights to make it a good tree. Therefore, the total number of good trees is equal to the number of possible trees multiplied by 1 (since for each tree, exactly one weighting is valid). \n\nBut wait, the number of trees is n^{n-2} (by Cayley's formula). For each tree, exactly one edge weighting is valid. So the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} * 1. But according to the sample input for n=4, the third test case says there are 16 good trees. Let's check: for n=4, Cayley's formula gives 4^{2} = 16 trees. So yes, each tree contributes exactly one valid weighting. Therefore, the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} for even n, and zero otherwise. \n\nSo the problem now becomes: for even n, compute the sum over all trees T (with n vertices) of d_T(1, n), where d_T(1,n) is the sum of the edge weights along the path from 1 to n in tree T, with the edge weights uniquely determined by the good tree conditions.\n\nSo the key is to find the sum over all trees T of d_T(1,n), where each tree T has exactly one valid edge weighting (as per the good tree conditions).\n\nNow, how can we compute this sum? It seems challenging, but perhaps there's a way to find the expected value of d(1,n) over all trees, multiplied by the number of trees (since each tree contributes once). \n\nBut how to compute this expectation?\n\nLet me think about the edge weights. For each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined by the constraints. So for each tree, the edge weights are fixed. Let's think about how to find the sum of d(1,n) across all trees.\n\nLet me think of each edge's contribution to the sum. For each edge e, what is the sum over all trees T of the contribution of e to d(1,n) in T's edge weighting?\n\nBecause d(1,n) is the sum of the edge weights along the path from 1 to n. So each edge that lies on the path from 1 to n in tree T contributes its weight to d(1,n). Therefore, the total sum across all trees is the sum over all trees T of (sum_{e in P_T} w_e), where P_T is the path from 1 to n in T, and w_e is the weight of e in T's unique valid weighting. \n\nThis can be rewritten as the sum over all edges e of (number of trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n in T) multiplied by the expected value of w_e for those trees. Wait, no. Because for each tree T, each edge e contributes w_e to the sum if and only if e is on the path from 1 to n. So the total sum is the sum over all edges e of [ (number of trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n) Ã— (expected value of w_e for those trees) ] ?\n\nBut since for each tree T, the edge weights are uniquely determined, perhaps we can find for each edge e, the value of w_e in the unique valid weighting of T, and multiply that by the number of trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n. \n\nBut how can we compute this for all edges e?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each edge e, the value of w_e in the valid weighting of a tree T, and then find the sum over all trees T of (w_e if e is on the path from 1 to n, else 0). \n\nBut how can we find the value of w_e in the valid weighting of a tree T?\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined by the conditions that each vertex has an odd number of -1 edges. \n\nBut how can we find the value of w_e for a given tree T?\n\nLet me consider that the edge weights are determined by the system of equations. For each vertex, the sum of the variables (whether the edge is -1) is 1 mod 2. Since this is a system of equations over GF(2), and the solution is unique. \n\nBut solving this system for a general tree might be complicated. However, perhaps there's a way to find the value of the edge weights in terms of the tree structure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think about the problem in terms of the spanning tree and the constraints. For example, in the case of a tree, the system of equations can be solved by choosing a root and propagating the values. \n\nLet me think of the tree as rooted at node 1. Then, for each node, the product of the edges along the path from the root to that node must satisfy certain properties. Wait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think of the tree as a graph where each edge has a variable x_e (either 0 or 1, representing whether the edge is -1 or 1, since x_e=1 means weight -1, x_e=0 means weight 1). The constraints are for each vertex v, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to v is 1 mod 2. \n\nLet me think of the tree as a connected graph. Let's pick an arbitrary root, say node 1. Then, for each node, except the root, we can define a parent edge. Let's consider the tree as a rooted tree with parent pointers. \n\nSuppose we have a rooted tree. For each node v (except the root), let's consider the edge between v and its parent p(v). Let me denote the variable x_{v} as the value of this edge (x_v is 0 or 1). Then, for the root, the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. For each non-root node v, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to it includes the edge to its parent (x_v) and the edges to its children. However, since the tree is connected and acyclic, each non-root node has exactly one parent edge. \n\nBut this seems complicated. However, for the system of equations, since the solution is unique, perhaps we can find a way to express the variables in terms of each other. \n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a tree. Let's pick an arbitrary root, say node 1. For each node v, except the root, the edge between v and its parent p(v) can be determined based on the constraints of the subtree. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the system of equations. The equations are:\n\nFor each vertex v, sum_{e incident to v} x_e = 1 mod 2.\n\nLet me consider the root node. Its equation is sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it equals 1 mod 2. For the children of the root, each of them has an equation that includes the x_e of their edge to the root and the sum of x_e for their other edges (to their children). \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to assign variables in such a way. For example, suppose we fix the value of x_e for all edges except those in a certain way. \n\nBut since the system has a unique solution, perhaps we can find that the value of x_e for each edge is determined by the parity of the number of vertices in some subtree. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to assign the variables based on the degrees of the nodes. \n\nWait, but I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about the value of d(1,n) in terms of the variables x_e. \n\nThe distance d(1,n) is the sum of the weights of the edges along the path from 1 to n. Since each edge weight is (-1)^{x_e}, where x_e is 0 or 1. So the sum is sum_{e in path} (-1)^{x_e}.\n\nBut the problem requires us to compute the sum of this over all good trees. \n\nBut for each tree T, the variables x_e are uniquely determined. So perhaps we can find for each tree T, the value of sum_{e in path} (-1)^{x_e} and sum over all trees T. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find the expected value of this sum across all trees, and then multiply by the number of trees (n^{n-2}).\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the following: For each tree T, the path from 1 to n is unique. Let me denote that path as P_T. The sum over all trees T of d_T(1,n) is equal to the sum over all trees T of [sum_{e in P_T} (-1)^{x_e(T)} }, where x_e(T) is the value of the edge e in the unique valid weighting of tree T. \n\nThis can be rewritten as the sum over all edges e of [ (-1)^{x_e(T)} * (number of trees T where e is on P_T) ] summed over all trees T. \n\nWait, no. Because for each tree T, each edge e contributes (-1)^{x_e(T)} to the sum if and only if e is on P_T. So the total sum is sum_{T} sum_{e in P_T} (-1)^{x_e(T)} } = sum_{e} [ sum_{T where e is on P_T} (-1)^{x_e(T)} } ].\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each edge e, compute the number of trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the value (-1)^{x_e(T)} for those trees. \n\nBut how to compute this for each edge e?\n\nBut the problem is that x_e(T) depends on the tree T and the way the variables are set. \n\nBut perhaps for a given edge e, the value of (-1)^{x_e(T)} can be determined in terms of the tree structure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find that for each edge e, the value of x_e in the valid weighting is determined by some property of the tree T, such as the size of the subtree when e is removed. \n\nLet me think about the case where the tree T is split into two subtrees when edge e is removed. Suppose that edge e connects nodes u and v. Let me assume that in the tree T, the path from 1 to n passes through e. Let me think about the subtree that contains node 1 when e is removed. Let's call this subtree S. The other subtree contains the rest of the tree. \n\nBut how does this relate to the value of x_e? \n\nLet me think about the system of equations again. For the unique solution, perhaps the value of x_e depends on the parity of the number of nodes in the subtree S. \n\nAlternatively, think of the following approach. Since the system of equations has a unique solution, the value of x_e for each edge e can be determined by the parity of the number of vertices in one of the subtrees created by removing e. \n\nLet me take an example. Consider n=2, the only edge between 1 and 2. The solution is x_e = 1. The number of nodes in the subtree containing 1 when e is removed is 1. Which is odd. So perhaps x_e is 1 if the size of the subtree is odd, and 0 otherwise? Or maybe something else.\n\nAnother example: Take n=4, and a tree where node 1 is connected to node 2, node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 2 is connected to node 4. So the tree is like 1-2-3, and 2-4. Let's determine the x_e for each edge. \n\nThe equations are:\n\nFor node 1: x_1 (edge 1-2) must be 1 mod 2. So x_1 = 1.\n\nFor node 2: x_1 (edge 1-2) + x_2 (edge 2-3) + x_3 (edge 2-4) = 1 mod 2. Since x_1 is 1, this gives x_2 + x_3 = 0 mod 2.\n\nFor node 3: x_2 (edge 2-3) must be 1 mod 2. So x_2 = 1.\n\nFor node 4: x_3 (edge 2-4) must be 1 mod 2. So x_3 = 1.\n\nSubstituting x_2 and x_3 into the equation for node 2: 1 + 1 = 2 mod 2 = 0. Which satisfies the equation. \n\nSo the edge weights are x_1=1 (so weight -1), x_2=1 (weight -1), x_3=1 (weight -1). \n\nThe path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-4. The sum is (-1) + (-1) = -2. \n\nNow, let's look at the edges. For edge 1-2, which connects subtree {1} (size 1) and the rest. The size is 1 (odd), and x_e is 1. For edge 2-3, which connects subtree {3} (size 1) and the rest. Size 1 is odd, x_e is 1. For edge 2-4, which connects {4} (size 1) and the rest. Size 1 is odd, x_e is 1. So perhaps the rule is that for each edge e, if the size of the subtree containing node 1 when e is removed is s, then x_e is 1 if s is odd, and 0 if even? Let's check.\n\nIn this example, for edge 1-2, removing it splits into {1} (size 1) and {2,3,4} (size 3). So the size of the subtree containing 1 is 1 (odd), and x_e is 1. For edge 2-3, removing it splits into {3} (size 1) and {1,2,4} (size 3). The size of the subtree containing 1 is 3 (odd), so x_e is 1. For edge 2-4, removing it splits into {4} (size 1) and the rest. So x_e is 1. Which fits the rule.\n\nAnother example: take the tree from the third sample input (n=4). The sample says that there are 16 good trees. For each tree, the path from 1 to 4 varies. However, for each tree, the edge weights are determined by the same rule. \n\nLet me consider a different tree. Suppose the tree is a chain 1-3-2-4. The path from 1 to 4 is 1-3-2-4. Let's determine the x_e values. \n\nFor each edge:\n\nEdge 1-3: removing it splits into {1} (size 1) and {3,2,4} (size 3). So x_e is 1.\n\nEdge 3-2: removing it splits into {1,3} (size 2) and {2,4} (size 2). The subtree containing 1 is size 2 (even). So x_e would be 0?\n\nLet me solve the equations:\n\nEquations:\n\nFor node 1: x_1 (edge 1-3) = 1 mod 2. So x_1 = 1.\n\nFor node 3: x_1 (edge 1-3) + x_2 (edge 3-2) = 1 mod 2. Since x_1 is 1, x_2 must be 0.\n\nFor node 2: x_2 (edge 3-2) + x_3 (edge 2-4) = 1 mod 2. Since x_2 is 0, x_3 must be 1.\n\nFor node 4: x_3 (edge 2-4) = 1 mod 2. Which is satisfied.\n\nSo the x_e values are 1, 0, 1. \n\nWhich corresponds to the edge 3-2 having x_e = 0. The size of the subtree containing 1 when removing edge 3-2 is 2 (nodes 1 and 3). Which is even. So according to the rule, x_e should be 0. Which matches. \n\nSo this seems to confirm the hypothesis: for each edge e, x_e is 1 if the size of the subtree containing node 1 when e is removed is odd, and 0 otherwise. \n\nSo the rule is: for any tree T and edge e, the value of x_e (which determines the weight of the edge as -1 if x_e is 1, else 1) is equal to (s mod 2), where s is the size of the subtree containing node 1 when e is removed. \n\nThis seems promising. Let me check another example. Take the edge 2-4 in the previous example. Removing it splits the tree into {2,3,1} (size 3) and {4} (size 1). The size of the subtree containing 1 is 3 (odd). So x_e is 1. Which matches the earlier calculation. \n\nAnother example: take a tree where node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 2 is connected to node 4. Let's take edge 2-3. When removed, the subtree containing 1 is {1,2,4} (size 3, odd). So x_e is 1. Which matches the earlier example where x_2 was 1. \n\nSo this rule seems to hold. \n\nTherefore, for any tree T, and any edge e in T, the value of x_e is equal to the parity (mod 2) of the size of the subtree containing node 1 when e is removed. \n\nIf this is true, then the weight of the edge e is -1 if the size is odd, else 1. \n\nSo the weight of edge e is (-1)^{s mod 2}, where s is the size of the subtree containing node 1 when e is removed. \n\nTherefore, the contribution of edge e to the distance d(1, n) is (-1)^{s_e}, where s_e is the size of the subtree containing node 1 when e is removed. \n\nBut how does this help us compute the sum over all trees T of d(1,n)? \n\nWell, for each tree T, the path from 1 to n consists of certain edges. For each such edge e, its contribution to d(1,n) is (-1)^{s_e}, where s_e is the size of the subtree containing node 1 when e is removed. \n\nThus, the total sum over all trees T of d(1,n) is equal to the sum over all trees T, and for each edge e on the path from 1 to n in T, add (-1)^{s_e}.\n\nBut how can we compute this sum? \n\nThe key idea is to find, for each edge e, the number of trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by (-1)^{s_e}, where s_e is the size of the subtree containing node 1 when e is removed in tree T. \n\nWait, but s_e depends on the tree T. However, for a given edge e, which connects nodes u and v, in any tree T that contains e, when we remove e, the tree splits into two subtrees. One of them contains node 1, and the other contains node n. Or not necessarily. But in any case, the size of the subtree containing node 1 is s_e, and that depends on how the tree is structured. \n\nBut this seems too vague. Perhaps we can find for each possible edge e (in the sense of connecting two subsets of nodes), how many trees include e and have e on the path from 1 to n. \n\nAlternatively, think about the following: for any pair of nodes u and v, the number of trees where the edge between u and v is present and lies on the path from 1 to n. \n\nBut this feels too abstract. \n\nLet me think differently. For a fixed edge e that connects nodes u and v, what is the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n? \n\nBut in order for e to be on the path from 1 to n, one of the two subtrees formed by removing e must contain node 1 and the other must contain node n. \n\nSo, for any edge e that connects two components A and B (when e is removed), where A contains node 1 and B contains node n, then e is on the path from 1 to n. \n\nThus, for any such edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of trees that contain e and have the structure where A and B are as described. \n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think about the number of trees that contain edge e and have e on the path between 1 and n. \n\nLet me denote that when we remove e, the tree splits into two subtrees: one containing node 1 (call this subtree A) and one containing node n (call this subtree B). Let the sizes of A and B be a and b respectively. Note that a + b = n. \n\nThe number of trees that include e and have e on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of ways to connect the two subtrees with e, multiplied by the number of ways to form trees on each subtree. \n\nWait, the number of trees on the entire graph that include edge e and have e on the path between 1 and n is equal to the number of ways to form trees on A and B, and then connect them via e. \n\nBut according to Cayley's formula, the number of trees on a set of k nodes is k^{k-2}. So the number of trees on A is a^{a-2}, and on B is b^{b-2}. Then, the total number of trees that include e and have e on the path between 1 and n is a^{a-2} * b^{b-2} * 1 (since we connect A and B with e). \n\nBut how do we find the sum over all such edges e of this quantity multiplied by (-1)^{s_e}? \n\nBut wait, for each such edge e, the value of s_e is a, the size of the subtree containing node 1. \n\nSo for each possible pair (A, B) where A contains node 1 and B contains node n, and A and B are connected by e, the contribution to the total sum is (number of trees with e on the path) * (-1)^{a}.\n\nBut how to compute this sum over all possible edges e that connect A and B?\n\nBut this seems challenging. However, the problem is to find the sum over all trees T of d(1,n) for good trees. And we have established that for each tree T, the contribution of edge e to d(1,n) is (-1)^{a_e}, where a_e is the size of the subtree containing 1 when e is removed. And the edge e is on the path from 1 to n in T. \n\nBut the total sum is the sum over all trees T of sum_{e in path} (-1)^{a_e} = sum_{e} [ (-1)^{a_e} * (number of trees T where e is on the path from 1 to n) ].\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing for each possible edge e (i.e., for each possible split of the nodes into A and B where A contains 1 and B contains n), the value (-1)^{a} multiplied by the number of trees that have e on the path from 1 to n. \n\nBut how to find this sum?\n\nLet me think about the sum over all possible splits of the nodes into A and B, where A contains 1, B contains n, and a = |A|, b = |B|. For each such split, there are C(n-2, a-1) ways to choose the nodes in A (excluding 1 and n). Wait, no. Because A must contain node 1 and B must contain node n. So the number of ways to choose the subset A (which includes 1 and excludes n) is C(n-2, a-1), since we need to choose a-1 nodes from the remaining n-2 nodes (excluding 1 and n). \n\nOnce A and B are chosen, the number of trees that have e on the path between 1 and n is a^{a-2} * b^{b-2} * 1 (since the tree is formed by connecting the two subtrees with edge e). However, for each such split, there are multiple edges e that could connect A and B. But in this context, we are considering that the edge e is part of the tree. However, the number of trees for a given split is a^{a-2} * b^{b-2} multiplied by the number of ways to choose the edge e between A and B. But wait, no. Because for a given split into A and B, any tree that connects A and B must have exactly one edge between them. But in our case, we are considering all possible trees that have such a connection. However, the number of trees that connect A and B is exactly a",
