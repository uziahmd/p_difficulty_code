Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two given names. So, the idea is that the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name should exactly match the letters in the pile. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the concatenation of the first two input strings (guest and host) has exactly the same characters as the third string (the pile), with the same counts for each character.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nHmm. Well, one way is to take the first two strings, combine them into one, then check if the sorted version of that combined string is equal to the sorted version of the third string.\n\nYes, because when you sort both, if they are the same, then the counts of each character must be the same. That's a common technique for anagram problems.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read three lines of input.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Sort this concatenated string and the third line's string.\n4. Compare if the two sorted strings are equal.\n5. Output \"YES\" if they are equal, else \"NO\".\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the combined length of the first two is different from the third? For example, if the guest and host's names combined have a length of 5, but the pile has 6 letters. Then obviously it's impossible, so the answer is NO. But checking the sorted strings would automatically handle that, since the lengths would differ and thus the sorted strings can't be equal. So that's covered.\n\nSo the code would look something like:\n\nRead the three lines as guest, host, pile.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThat's straightforward. Let me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nguest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\nCombined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' — let's count the letters. Let me see:\n\nBut maybe the sorted version of combined and pile would be same. The sample output says YES.\n\nSecond example: guest is 'PAPAINOEL', host is 'JOULUPUKKI', pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'\n\nCombined is 'PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI' — let's see the length. Let me count:\n\nGuest length: len('PAPAINOEL') is 9 letters. Host is 'JOULUPUKKI' which is 10 letters. Combined is 19 letters. The pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' — let me count the letters. Let me see:\n\nThe pile's length is len('JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI') — let's see: let me count letters. Let me think, but perhaps the code would catch that. For example, the combined string of guest and host is 'PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI' — let's check the letters. The pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'. Let me check the sorted versions.\n\nBut according to the note, the pile is missing a P and has an extra L. So the code would compare the sorted combined and sorted pile. The combined has two P's? Let me check:\n\nOriginal guest is 'PAPAINOEL' — letters: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L. So two P's. Host is JOULUPUKKI: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I. So one P. So combined has 3 P's?\n\nWait, guest's 'PAPAINOEL' has two P's. Host's 'JOULUPUKKI' has one P. So total of 3 P's. But the pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' — let me count the P's. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the pile string: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's break it down:\n\nLetters: J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I. Wait, how many P's here? There's two P's. So the combined has 3 P's, but the pile has two. So the sorted combined would have more P's than the pile. So the code would return NO, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nThird example:",
