            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo the problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, but with some special cases when b is 'R' which means Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a, and I have to convert it to base b, which could be a normal base or Roman.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R'. Then the next line is the number c in base a. The output depends on whether b is R or not.\n\nThe steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Convert the input number c (which is in base a) to a decimal integer.\n2. Then, convert that decimal integer to base b. If b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as usual.\n\nBut wait, how to handle the conversion from base a to decimal? Because c can have letters if a is greater than 10. For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F. Wait, but the problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. Also, the note says that for cases with Roman numerals, the number is <= 3000 in decimal, and otherwise, it's up to 1e15. So during the conversion from base a to decimal, I need to parse each character of c as a digit in base a.\n\nSo first, I need a function to convert a string in base a (with possible letters for digits >=10) into a decimal integer. Then, after getting the decimal value, I need to convert it to base b, or to Roman numerals if b is R.\n\nLet me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is two values: a and b. But b could be 'R'. So for example, in the sample input, one case is '16 R\\n5', which would mean converting 5 (base 16) to Roman. The decimal value of 5 in base 16 is 5, which converts to 'V'.\n\nAnother sample input is '5 R\\n4', which is converting 4 in base 5 to Roman. The decimal value is 4, which is 'IV'.\n\nSo the first step is to parse the input correctly.\n\nSo for the first line, split into a and b. But since b can be 'R', we need to check if the second part is 'R' or a number. For example, in the input, the first line could be like '10 2' or '16 R'.\n\nOnce I have the decimal value, then:\n\nIf b is not R, then convert the decimal number to base b. But how to handle bases larger than 10? For example, if base is 12, then digits above 9 are represented as letters (A for 10, B for 11, etc). Also, the output must not have leading zeros. So for example, if the converted number is zero, but according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. But for other cases, perhaps the input c could be zero? Wait, the problem says that if Roman is involved, the number is not zero. Otherwise, the number can be zero?\n\nWait, the input says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510.\" So when converting to Roman, the number is non-zero. But for other cases, the number could be zero? Well, the input c is a non-negative integer. For example, if c is '0' in base a, then the decimal is 0. But when converting to base b, which is not R, then output is 0. However, the problem says to omit leading zeros. So for example, if the number is zero, the output is '0'.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nFirst, convert the input string c (base a) to decimal.\n\nThen, depending on b, convert to base b or to Roman.\n\nNow, the functions needed:\n\nFunction 1: Convert a string in base a to decimal. Let's call this function parse_base_a_to_decimal(s, a).\n\nFunction 2: Convert decimal to base b (as a string), handling bases up to 25. For bases >10, use letters A, B, etc. Also, leading zeros must be omitted.\n\nFunction 3: Convert decimal to Roman numerals.\n\nLet me think about each function.\n\nFunction 1: parse_base_a_to",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, with a special case for Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from its given base to a decimal integer and then converting that decimal integer to the target base or Roman numerals as required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a` and needs to be converted to a decimal (base 10) integer. This involves parsing each digit of the input string, considering both numeric and alphabetic characters for bases greater than 10.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: If the target base `b` is not Roman numerals, convert the decimal integer to the specified base. For bases greater than 10, use letters A, B, etc., for digits above 9.\n3. **Convert Decimal to Roman Numerals**: If the target base is Roman numerals, convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to their respective Roman numeral symbols.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef parse_base_a_to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = \"\"\n    for (v, symbol) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    inputs = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in inputs:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        parts = line.strip().split('\\n')\n        first_line = parts[0].split()\n        a_str, b_str = first_line[0], first_line[1]\n        a = int(a_str)\n        c_str = parts[1]\n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = parse_base_a_to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        # Determine output\n        if b_str == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            b = int(b_str)\n            result = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, b)\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Parsing Input**: The input is read and split into the base `a`, target base `b`, and the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `parse_base_a_to_decimal` converts the input number from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating through each character and computing its value based on the base.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal integer to the specified base, handling bases greater than 10 by using letters A-Z for digits beyond 9.\n4. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts the decimal integer to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, iterating from the highest to the lowest value and appending the corresponding symbols.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion between different bases and Roman numerals, ensuring correct results while adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
