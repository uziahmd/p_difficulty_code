She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the task is to find the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the operations available. Each second, she can move left or right (but constrained by the current a and b, which are the min and max of the open tabs). Or she can close all tabs to the left or right of her current position. Closing those tabs would adjust a and b accordingly.\n\nBut since the goal is to leave exactly the [l, r] tabs open, we need to close everything outside that range. So the problem reduces to figuring out the optimal sequence of moves and closes to achieve that.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. The initial state has all tabs open, so a=1 and b=n. But as she closes tabs, a and b change. However, since the final state must have a = l and b = r, we need to perform operations that result in closing all tabs left of l and right of r.\n\nSo the key steps are: closing all tabs to the left of l, and closing all tabs to the right of r. But how to do that optimally?\n\nBut the order might matter. For example, maybe it's better to close the left first, then the right, or vice versa. Also, the position of the cursor affects how many moves are needed.\n\nLet me think about the steps required. Suppose that the current position is pos. To close the left part (tabs before l), she needs to be at position l, then close all tabs to the left. Similarly, to close the right part (tabs after r), she needs to be at position r, then close all tabs to the right. But maybe there's a way to do it more efficiently.\n\nWait, but what if l is already to the left of pos, and r is to the right? Then maybe she can close left and right in some order. But let's think about the steps.\n\nLet me consider different cases based on where pos is relative to l and r.\n\nCase 1: The current pos is already within [l, r]. Then, she needs to close tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose l=2, r=4, pos=3. She needs to close tabs 1, and tabs 5 and 6 (assuming n is 6). To close tabs to the left of l (which is 2), she needs to be at position 2, then close left. But to get there from pos=3, she can move left once. Then close left. Then, she needs to close the right side. For that, she needs to be at position 4, then close right. So moving from 2 to 4 takes two steps (right twice). Then close. So total steps would be 1 (move left) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move right) + 1 (close right) = 5 steps. Which matches the first example given.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Like, maybe closing the right first. Let's see. Suppose she moves to 4, closes right (which would take 1 step to move to 4 from 3, then close right. Then, she needs to close left. But for that, she needs to be at position l=2. So from 4, moving left to 2 (two steps), then close left. That's 1 (move to 4) + 1 (close) + 2 (move to 2) + 1 (close) = total 5 again. Same steps.\n\nSo regardless of the order, maybe the steps are same. But what if the positions are such that one of the closes can be done without moving?\n\nAnother example: the second input in the sample is 6 3 1 3. The output is 1. Because she can close all tabs to the right of her current position (pos 3). Since the desired range is [1,3], closing right would close tabs 4-6. So that's one operation. So that's why the answer is 1.\n\nSo the idea is that depending on whether the current position is already in a position where closing left or right can be done immediately.\n\nSo the general approach would be to compute the steps required to reach the positions where closing left and closing right can be done, and then add those steps plus the two closes (each taking 1 second).\n\nBut there are cases where closing left and closing right can be done in a single operation. For example, if the current position is already at l, then closing left would close all tabs left of l (which is nothing if l is 1). Or if the current position is at r, then closing right would close all tabs right of r",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos`. The operations allowed include moving the cursor left or right and closing all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Target Positions**: Determine the positions where Luba needs to be in order to close all tabs to the left of `l` and to the right of `r`. These positions are `l` and `r`, respectively.\n2. **Calculate Moves**: Calculate the number of moves required to reach these target positions from the initial position `pos`.\n3. **Determine Closes**: Depending on whether the initial position is already within the target range [l, r], calculate the necessary moves and closes efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# If the current position is already within [l, r], we need to close left and right\n# But depending on the position, we can optimize the steps\n\n# The steps needed to reach l and r\nsteps = 0\n\n# Check if we need to close left (i.e., l > 1)\nif l > 1:\n    # Need to move to l and close left\n    if pos < l:\n        steps += (l - pos)\n    elif pos > l:\n        steps += (pos - l)\n    steps += 1  # the close operation\n\n# Check if we need to close right (i.e., r < n)\nif r < n:\n    # Need to move to r and close right\n    if pos < r:\n        steps += (r - pos)\n    elif pos > r:\n        steps += (pos - r)\n    steps += 1  # the close operation\n\n# However, if the initial pos is already in the correct range and doesn't need to move\n# But if l == 1 and r == n, then no steps needed\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Check if the current pos is already at l or r and can close directly\n    # Adjust the steps based on whether the closes can be done without moving\n    # We need to consider the case where both l and r are within the range and pos is inside\n    # So, the above steps may have added both moves, but maybe we can do it more optimally\n\n    # Let's recalculate in a better way\n\n    # If we need to close left (l > 1) and right (r < n)\n    # Then, the minimal steps is the steps to reach l, then steps to reach r from l, plus 2 closes\n    # Or steps to reach r first, then steps to reach l from r, plus 2 closes\n    # Which one is better?\n\n    # But in the code above, the steps are calculated as moving to l, then moving to r, or vice versa\n    # But the code above may not account for overlapping steps\n\n    # Let's re-express the problem:\n\n    # The steps required to close left: if l > 1, then we need to move to l, then close left\n    # The steps required to close right: if r < n, then we need to move to r, then close right\n\n    # However, if we are already in the [l, r] range, the steps to reach l and r are calculated as follows:\n\n    # For example, if pos is between l and r, then moving to l takes (pos - l) steps, then moving to r takes (r - l) steps\n    # Or moving to r first takes (r - pos) steps, then moving to l takes (r - l) steps\n    # So total steps is (pos - l) + (r - l) + 2, or (r - pos) + (r - l) + 2. Which is better?\n\n    # But the minimal steps would be the minimal of the two options.\n\n    # However, in the original code, the steps were calculated as (pos - l) + (r - pos) = r - l, but that's not correct.\n\n    # Therefore, the previous approach was incorrect.

But the minimal steps would be the minimal of (distance to l + (r - l)) or (distance to r + (r - l))? No, because if we go to l first, then from l to r is (r - l) steps. Similarly, going to r first, then from r to l is (r - l) steps. So regardless of the order, the total steps is (distance to l or r) + (r - l).\n\n    # However, if we can close both in one move?

Therefore, we need to handle this case specially.\n\n    # Let's recompute the steps correctly.\n\n    # Reset steps\n    steps = 0\n\n    # If both l > 1 and r < n:\n    if l > 1 and r < n:\n        # Calculate the two options\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2  # move to l, then to r, close both\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2  # move to r, then to l, close both\n        steps = min(option1, option2)\n    elif l > 1:\n        # Only need to close left\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    elif r < n:\n        # Only need to close right\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    else:\n        # No need to close anything\n        steps = 0\n\n    print(steps)",
