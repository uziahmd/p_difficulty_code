The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$. Find the number of permutation pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ that satisfy the following conditions:  $$$p$$$ is lexicographically smaller than $$$q$$$.  the number of inversions in $$$p$$$ is greater than the number of inversions in $$$q$$$. Print the number of such pairs modulo $$$mod$$$. Note that $$$mod$$$ may not be a prime.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$mod$$$ ($$$1\\le n\\le 500$$$, $$$1\\le mod\\le 10^9$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer, which is the answer modulo $$$mod$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 403458273']\n\n### Output\n['17']\n\n## Note\nThe following are all valid pairs $$$(p,q)$$$ when $$$n=4$$$.  $$$p=[1,3,4,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,2,3]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,3,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,1,4,3]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[2,3,1,4]$$$,  $$$p=[1,4,3,2]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,3,4,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,1,3]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,2,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,1,4,2]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[3,2,1,4]$$$,  $$$p=[2,4,3,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,2,4,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,1,2]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,2,3]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,1,3,2]$$$,  $$$p=[3,4,2,1]$$$, $$$q=[4,2,1,3]$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And then return this count modulo a given mod. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. For all possible pairs of permutations p and q where p is lex smaller than q, we need to check if inv(p) > inv(q). The answer is the total count of such pairs.\n\nBut considering n can be up to 500, the number of permutations is n! which is way too big for brute force. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the constraints. The key here is that for all pairs (p, q) where p < q lex, we need to count how many have inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nLet me consider that the total number of pairs where p < q lex is (total number of permutation pairs) divided by 2, minus the cases where p = q. But since p and q are distinct permutations, the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p != q is (n!)^2. But since p < q lex is exactly half of these (since for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds), the total number of such pairs is (n! * (n! -1 )) / 2. However, this isn't directly helpful unless we can find some symmetry.\n\nBut the problem requires us to find, among all these pairs, those where inv(p) > inv(q). So maybe there's a way to compute for each possible inversion count, how many permutations have that count, and then use that to calculate the required pairs.\n\nLet me denote for each k, the number of permutations of size n with exactly k inversions as inv_count[k]. Then, for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, we want to count the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how do I compute this?\n\nLet me think: for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, the total number of such pairs is total_pairs = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. Now, among these, how many have inv(p) > inv(q)? Let's denote that as the answer.\n\nBut perhaps there's a symmetry here. Suppose we consider all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q. Each such pair contributes either inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q). If there's no case where inv(p) = inv(q), then the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) would be exactly half of the total number of unordered pairs. But since there are cases where inv(p) = inv(q), the actual count would be (total_pairs - same_count) / 2, where same_count is the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) = inv(q).\n\nWait, but in our problem, the pairs (p, q) are ordered such that p is lex smaller than q. So for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is counted in the total_pairs. So if for the unordered pair {p, q}, inv(p) > inv(q), then it contributes 1 to the answer if p < q, else 0. Similarly for inv(p) < inv(q).\n\nSo the total answer is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q, plus the number of unordered pairs where inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q. Wait, no. Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) is true. So the total number of (p, q) pairs with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} where inv(p) > inv(q) multiplied by 1 if p < q, but how does that relate to the total?\n\nAlternatively, for all unordered pairs {p, q} where p != q, exactly one of the following is true:\n\n- inv(p) > inv(q) and p < q\n\n- inv(p) < inv(q) and p < q\n\n- inv(p) = inv(q) and p < q\n\nOr, more precisely, for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of (p < q) or (q < p) holds. Let me consider that for the unordered pair {p, q}, if inv(p) > inv(q), then when considering the ordered pair (p, q), if p < q, it contributes 1 to the answer. Otherwise, if q < p, then (q, p) would be considered",
    "response": "To solve the problem of counting the number of permutation pairs $(p, q)$ such that $p$ is lexicographically smaller than $q$ and has more inversions than $q$, we need an efficient way to compute the number of permutations with a given number of inversions and leverage symmetry.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations\n\n1. **Inversion Symmetry**:\n   - For any pair of distinct permutations $p$ and $q$, either:\n     - $\\text{inv}(p) > \\text{inv}(q)$\n     - $\\text{inv}(p) < \\text{inv}(q)$\n     - $\\text{inv}(p) = \\text{inv}(q)$\n   - This symmetry helps us reduce the problem from brute-force enumeration to counting the total number of unordered pairs and subtracting those where the inversion counts are equal.\n\n2. **Lexicographic Order and Pair Counting**:\n   - Among all unordered pairs of distinct permutations, exactly half will be in lexicographic order $p < q$, and the other half will be $q < p$. \n   - So, for each unordered pair where $\\text{inv}(p) \\neq \\text{inv}(q)$, exactly one of $(p, q)$ or $(q, p)$ will be counted in the final answer.\n\n3. **Efficient Counting Using DP**:\n   - We use dynamic programming to count the number of permutations of size $n$ with exactly $k$ inversions.\n   - Let `dp[i][j]` be the number of permutations of length $i$ with exactly $j$ inversions.\n   - The recurrence is based on inserting the new number into all possible positions of permutations of length $i-1$.\n\n4. **Final Computation**:\n   - Compute the total number of unordered pairs: $T = \\frac{n! \\times (n! - 1)}{2}$\n   - Compute the number of unordered pairs with equal inversion counts: $S = \\sum_k \\binom{\\text{cnt}[k]}{2}$\n   - The answer is: $\\left( T - S \\right) \\mod \\text{mod}$\n\n---\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n, mod = map(int, input().split())\n\n    max_inv = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    dp = [[0] * (max_inv + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1  # base case: one permutation of 0 elements with 0 inversions\n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        for j in range(max_inv + 1):\n            for k in range(i):\n                if j - k >= 0:\n                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - k]\n                    dp[i][j] %= mod\n\n    fact = [1] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % mod\n\n    total_pairs = fact[n] * (fact[n] - 1) % mod\n    total_pairs = total_pairs * pow(2, mod - 2, mod) % mod  # equivalent to division by 2 mod mod\n\n    same_count = 0\n    for inv in range(max_inv + 1):\n        cnt = dp[n][inv]\n        same_count = (same_count + cnt * (cnt - 1) // 2) % mod\n\n    ans = (total_pairs - same_count + mod) % mod\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Dynamic Programming Table (`dp[i][j]`)**:\n  - Stores the number of permutations of length `i` with exactly `j` inversions.\n  - Built using the recurrence: inserting the `i-th` element into all possible positions of permutations of length `i-1`.\n\n- **Factorial Calculation**:\n  - Used to compute the total number of permutations $n!$, which is needed to calculate the total number of unordered pairs.\n\n- **Symmetry and Modulo Arithmetic**:\n  - The result is computed using modular arithmetic, taking care to handle division by 2 using modular inverse.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the desired count without enumerating all permutations explicitly, making it feasible even for large values of $n$ up to 500.",
