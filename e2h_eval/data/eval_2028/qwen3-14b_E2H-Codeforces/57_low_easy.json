His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have based on his minimum total points x. The input gives me the first and second tour scores for all participants, but they are in arbitrary order. \n\nSo, the key here is that Vasya's total is at least x. But since the teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to Vasya, we need to consider all possible pairs (a_i + b_j) that are >=x. For each such pair, we need to determine how many people can have a higher total than him (for the worst case) or how many can have higher or equal (for best case), but considering that the jury can arrange ties in any way.\n\nWait, the problem says that when there are ties, the jury can assign places as they choose. So for the best possible rank, we want to assume that Vasya is placed as high as possible. For example, if multiple people have the same total, he could be first among them. For the worst possible rank, we want to assume that he is placed as low as possible in the group of people with the same total.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for the best possible rank: We need to find the maximum number of people who have a total strictly greater than Vasya's possible total. Then add 1. But since Vasya's total can be any value >=x, but we want the best possible scenario for him. So to minimize his rank, we need to maximize his total. Wait, no. Because if his total is higher, then fewer people can be above him. So for the best rank, we need to choose the highest possible total that is >=x. Because that would give the minimal number of people above him.\n\nWait, but how do I find that? Let's think. For the best possible rank, we can choose the maximum possible a_i + b_j that is >=x. Because if we take that maximum, then the number of people with a total higher than that is zero. So his best possible rank is 1. But maybe there are other possibilities. For example, if someone else has the same total as him, then the jury can assign him first place. So the best possible rank is 1 if there exists a pair where his total is the maximum possible.\n\nBut perhaps the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have (i.e., the maximum a_i + b_j >=x). Then, the number of people with sum strictly greater than that is zero, so his best rank is 1.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for the best case, we can imagine that Vasya's total is as high as possible. Then, the number of people who have a higher total than him is as small as possible. So the best possible rank is 1 + the number of people with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum. But since we can choose his sum to be as high as possible, we can choose it to be the maximum possible sum (among all possible pairs that are >=x). Then, the number of people with sum strictly greater than that is zero, so best rank is 1.\n\nBut how do I find that maximum possible sum? Well, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of a_i + b_j, but only considering pairs where a_i + b_j >=x. However, since the problem states that there exists at least one such pair, we can proceed.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya has at least x points. So the actual sum for Vasya is some value >=x. But the teacher wants to find the best and worst possible positions given that.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, we want to select a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x, and that this sum is as high as possible. Because that way, the number of people with a higher sum is minimized.\n\nFor example, if the maximum possible sum is S, then all others can't have a sum higher than S. So the best possible rank is 1 (if there are people with sum equal to S, then the jury can put him first).\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to select a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x, and that the number of people with sum strictly greater than that is as large as possible. Then, the worst rank is that count plus 1. But how?\n\nWait, for the worst case, we want to choose a sum for Vasya that is as small as possible (but still >=x). Because then, more people can have a higher sum. So for example, if Vasya's sum is exactly x, and there are many people with higher sums, then",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the possible sums of points from both tours and considering how these sums can be arranged to determine the best and worst possible ranks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank, we consider the highest possible sum that Vasya could have achieved, which is the maximum sum of any pair (a_i, b_j) such that the sum is at least x. This ensures that Vasya's rank is as high as possible.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To find the worst possible rank, we consider the lowest possible sum that Vasya could have achieved, which is the minimum sum of any pair (a_i, b_j) such that the sum is at least x. This ensures that Vasya's rank is as low as possible by considering the maximum number of participants who could have higher sums.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    first_line = input[idx].split()\n    n, x = int(first_line[0]), int(first_line[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Sort a and b for efficient calculation\n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n    \n    # For best place: find the maximum possible sum >=x\n    # We can use two pointers to find the maximum sum\n    max_sum = -1\n    i = n - 1\n    j = n - 1\n    while i >= 0 and j >= 0:\n        current = a[i] + b[j]\n        if current >= x:\n            max_sum = current\n            break\n        elif current < x:\n            if a[i] < b[j]:\n                j -= 1\n            else:\n                i -= 1\n    # Now count how many people have sum > max_sum\n    # But since max_sum is the maximum possible, no one has sum > it\n    best = 1\n    \n    # For worst place: find the minimum possible sum >=x\n    min_sum = float('inf')\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        current = a[i] + b[j]\n        if current >= x:\n            min_sum = current\n            break\n        elif current < x:\n            if a[i] < b[j]:\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                j += 1\n    # Now count how many people have sum > min_sum\n    # We can compute this by checking all pairs\n    # However, for efficiency, we can sort the combined sums\n    # Generate all possible sums and count those > min_sum\n    # But for n up to 1e5, generating all pairs is O(n^2) which is not feasible\n    # Alternative approach: for each a_i, find the number of b_j such that a_i + b_j > min_sum\n    # Since a and b are sorted, we can do this efficiently\n    count = 0\n    # Sort b in reverse order for easier counting\n    b_rev = sorted(b, reverse=True)\n    for ai in a:\n        target = min_sum + 1\n        # Find the first index in b_rev where b_j < target\n        left, right = 0, n\n        while left < right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            if b_rev[mid] >= target:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid\n        count += left\n    worst = count + 1\n    \n    print(f\"{best} {worst}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Best Possible Rank**: The code uses a two-pointer technique to find the maximum possible sum Vasya could have, ensuring he gets the highest possible rank (1).\n- **Worst Possible Rank**: The code finds the minimum possible sum Vasya could have that meets the threshold x.
