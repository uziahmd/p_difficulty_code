Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about selecting souvenirs with maximum total cost without exceeding the weight limit. The constraints are that n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Also, each souvenir's weight is between 1 and 3. Hmm, so the weights are small. That must be a hint for an efficient approach.\n\nSo the usual knapsack problem is O(nm), which would be way too slow here because n is 1e5 and m is 3e5. So that approach isn't feasible. But since the weights are limited to 1, 2, 3, maybe we can find a way to handle each weight category separately.\n\nLet me think. For items of weight 1, 2, 3, perhaps we can sort them in descending order of cost per unit weight, and then take as many as possible. But since the weight varies, maybe there's a way to optimize.\n\nWait, but even if I sort each group by their value, how do I combine them optimally? Because taking some items of weight 2 might leave space for more items of weight 1, or vice versa. For example, if I have a weight limit of 3, taking one item of weight 2 and one of 1 might be better than a single item of weight 3.\n\nSo the idea is to process each weight group (1, 2, 3) and find the optimal way to select items from them, considering the interactions between different groups.\n\nLet me think of the approach:\n\nFirst, separate all items into three groups based on their weight: w=1, w=2, w=3.\n\nFor each group, sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, compute a prefix sum array. This way, for any number of items taken from that group, we can quickly get the total cost.\n\nOnce we have these prefix sums, we can try all possible combinations of taking x items from weight 1, y items from weight 2, z items from weight 3, such that x*1 + y*2 + z*3 <= m. But even this seems computationally heavy if done naively.\n\nBut given that m is up to 3e5, maybe we can find a way to iterate through possible numbers of items from two groups and compute the third accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is small (up to 3), perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nLet's consider all possible numbers of items taken from weight 1 and 2, and then compute how many items from weight 3 can be taken. However, even that could be O(m^2) in the worst case, which would be too slow.\n\nWait, but the maximum number of items for weight 1 is up to m (since each is weight 1). Similarly for weight 2, it's up to m//2. But with m up to 3e5, this would be O( (3e5)^2 ) which is 9e10 operations. Definitely not feasible.\n\nSo that approach isn't going to work. Need another idea.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible number of weight 3 items, we can calculate the remaining weight and then solve the problem for the remaining weight using the weight 1 and 2 items. But again, how to compute that?\n\nBut maybe for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute the best possible selection for any given weight capacity. Let's think about that.\n\nLet me think of the problem as two parts: first, handling the weight 3 items, and then handling the rest. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Since the weight is up to 3, perhaps for each possible remainder modulo 1, 2, or 3, we can find the optimal way. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows:\n\nThe maximum weight is m. For each possible number of weight 3 items (z), we can take up to k = min( (number of weight 3 items), floor( (m) / 3 )) items. Then, for the remaining weight (m - 3*z), we can compute the optimal selection of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to compute the optimal selection for weight 1 and 2 items given a certain capacity?\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can use a dynamic programming approach. However, since the capacity could be up to 3e5, and the number of items could be up to 1e5, even that may not be feasible. Wait, but for the weight 1 and 2 items, the DP would be O(m) time, but with m up to 3e5, and multiplied by the number of possible z (which is up to m/3, which is 1e5), that would be O(m^2), which is again not feasible.\n\nHmm. So perhaps there's a smarter way to handle the weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have sorted the weight 1 items in descending order of cost. Similarly for weight 2 items. Then, for any given capacity, say W, the optimal selection is to take as many high-value items as possible from both groups. But how to balance between taking weight 1 and 2 items?\n\nFor example, given a capacity W, how do I choose between taking x items of weight 1 and y items of weight 2 such that x + 2y ≤ W, and maximize the total cost?\n\nThis is similar to a knapsack problem with only items of weight 1 and 2, but with a lot of items. But how can I compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following approach: For the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute prefix sums. Then, for a given capacity W, we can iterate over the number of weight 2 items taken (say y) and compute the maximum possible number of weight 1 items (x = W - 2y) and take min(x, len(w1)) items. But since y can be up to W//2, which is O(W), this would be O(W) per query. However, if we need to do this multiple times (for different W values), this might be too slow.\n\nBut in our problem, when considering the weight 3 items, we can loop through all possible z (number of weight 3 items) and for each z, compute the remaining capacity as rem = m - 3*z. Then, for rem, compute the best possible combination of weight 1 and 2 items. If this is done efficiently, then the overall time complexity could be acceptable.\n\nSo the question is: How to compute the best combination for weight 1 and 2 items given a capacity W, quickly.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for this part:\n\nSuppose we have two prefix sums arrays:\n\n- For weight 1 items: sorted in descending order of cost. prefix1[i] is the sum of the first i items. So prefix1[0] = 0, prefix1[1] = cost of first item, etc. The maximum number of items we can take is len1 = len(prefix1) - 1.\n\n- For weight 2 items: sorted similarly. prefix2[j] is sum of first j items. len2 is len(prefix2) - 1.\n\nNow, for a given capacity W, the best possible is to take some number of weight 2 items (j) and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (up to (W - 2*j) items).\n\nBut since j can range from 0 to min(len2, W//2), for each j, the maximum possible is prefix2[j] + prefix1[ min( (W - 2*j), len1 ) ].\n\nBut to find the maximum over all possible j, this would take O(min(len2, W//2)) time. However, for W up to 3e5, and for each possible z (number of weight 3 items), this could be expensive. So what's the total time?\n\nIf the number of possible z is up to m//3, which is 1e5, and each iteration takes O(W) steps, then the total time would be O( (m/3) * m ), which is O( (3e5)^2 ) = 9e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, find a way to compute the maximum value for any capacity W in O(1) or O(1) per query after some preprocessing.\n\nLet me think. For each possible number of weight 2 items taken (j), the maximum number of weight 1 items is (W - 2j). However, perhaps we can find the optimal j for a given W by considering that the optimal j is around W//2, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible W, the optimal choice is to take as many as possible of the highest value items. For example, for weight 1 items, each has a value of c_i, and for weight 2 items, each has a value of c_j. So, for the same amount of weight, which gives more value?\n\nBut since the weight 2 items take two units, perhaps the optimal strategy is to compare the value of taking one weight 2 item versus two weight 1 items. However, this depends on the specific items.\n\nBut given that the items are sorted in descending order, maybe we can find for each possible capacity W, the optimal way is to take as many of the highest value items as possible, considering whether to take a weight 2 item or two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, here's a trick. For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible capacity W, the maximum value. But how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For the weight 1 and 2 items, create a dynamic programming array dp where dp[w] represents the maximum value achievable with weight exactly w. Then, for each weight w, we can consider adding a weight 1 or 2 item. However, since the number of items is large (up to 1e5), this approach would not be feasible for large W.\n\nBut wait, the items are sorted, so maybe we can find a way to compute the best possible for each weight.\n\nAnother idea: For the weight 1 items, the best is to take the top x items. For weight 2 items, the best is to take the top y items. Now, given a capacity W, we can find the optimal x and y such that x + 2y <= W, and the sum of their costs is maximized.\n\nBut how to find x and y quickly?\n\nLet me think about the following. For each possible y (number of weight 2 items taken), the maximum x is min( len1, W - 2y ). Then the total value is prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( len1, W - 2y ) ].\n\nBut since y can be up to min( len2, W//2 ), perhaps we can find the optimal y by considering that for a given W, the optimal y is either floor( (W)/2 ), or something like that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given W, the optimal y can be in the range [max(0, (W - len1) // 2 ), min( len2, W//2 ) ].\n\nWait, because taking y weight 2 items uses 2y weight, leaving W - 2y weight for weight 1 items. The maximum number of weight 1 items we can take is min( len1, W - 2y ). So for each y, we can compute the value. But to find the maximum over all possible y, perhaps the optimal y is around (W - x)/2, where x is the number of weight 1 items. However, this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, since the prefix sums are sorted, perhaps for a given W, the optimal number of weight 2 items is the one that maximizes (prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( len1, W - 2y ) ]), and we can find this maximum by checking a few candidates near the optimal point.\n\nBut how to find those candidates?\n\nLet me think of this as follows. For the weight 2 items, each item contributes a cost of c_i. For the weight 1 items, each contributes c_j. Suppose we have sorted the weight 1 items in descending order and the same for weight 2.\n\nThen, for a given W, the maximum number of weight 2 items we can take is y_max = min( len2, W//2 ). So for y in [0, y_max], the corresponding x is min( len1, W - 2y ). However, since the prefix sums are increasing, for each y, the value is prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( len1, W - 2y ) ].\n\nBut the function may not be unimodal, so binary search might not help. However, perhaps the optimal y is either the maximum possible, or the one that allows taking as many weight 1 items as possible. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut maybe for each W, the optimal y is in the vicinity of (W - k) / 2, where k is the number of weight 1 items. However, this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea inspired by the fact that the items are sorted. For each possible W, the optimal choice is to take as many of the highest value items as possible. For example, compare the value of taking one weight 2 item versus two weight 1 items. If the weight 2 item's cost is higher than the sum of two weight 1 items, then take the weight 2 item. Otherwise, take the two weight 1 items. This is similar to the greedy approach for the fractional knapsack problem, but since items are indivisible, this approach might not always work. However, in this case, since the items are sorted, maybe we can find a way to greedily select items.\n\nBut how to apply this for the combined selection of weight 1 and 2 items?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have the weight 1 items sorted in descending order, and the weight 2 items sorted in descending order. Then, for each step, I can compare the next available weight 1 item (cost c1) and the next available weight 2 item (cost c2). If c2 > c1 + c1 (i.e., taking the weight 2 item gives more value than two weight 1 items), then take the weight 2 item. Else, take two weight 1 items.\n\nBut this is a greedy approach and may not always yield the optimal solution. For example, suppose there are three weight 1 items with costs 5, 5, 5, and one weight 2 item with cost 8. The capacity is 3. Taking one weight 2 item (cost 8) and one weight 1 (cost 5) gives total 13, but taking three weight 1 items gives 15. However, according to the greedy approach, the first comparison would be between 8 and 5+5=10. Since 8 < 10, the algorithm would take two weight 1 items (total 10) and then have 1 weight left, which can take one more weight 1 item. So total 15. Which is correct. So perhaps this approach works.\n\nSo the idea is to simulate this process. However, how to implement it efficiently for a given capacity W?\n\nBut for the problem at hand, we need to compute, for a given W, the maximum value of combining weight 1 and 2 items. So perhaps we can precompute the best combination for all possible W up to m, but how?\n\nAlternatively, during the processing of the weight 3 items, for each possible z (number of weight 3 items taken), we can compute the remaining capacity W = m - 3*z, and then compute the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items for W. To compute this quickly, we can use the greedy approach described above, but how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach for a given W:\n\nInitialize pointers i (for weight 1 items) and j (for weight 2 items). Both start at 0.\n\nWhile there is capacity left:\n\n   if (current weight 2 item is better than two weight 1 items):\n\n       take it, add to total, increment j, subtract 2 from W.\n\n   else:\n\n       take as many weight 1 items as possible (either one or two, depending on the remaining W).\n\nBut this seems complicated to implement, especially since we need to know how many items are left.\n\nAlternatively, since the items are sorted, we can use the following method:\n\nWe can take as many weight 2 items as possible, but in a way that balances with the weight 1 items. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given W, the maximum number of weight 2 items we can take is y = min( len2, W//2 ), and the maximum number of weight 1 items is x = min( len1, W ). However, the optimal combination is somewhere between taking y=0 and y=y_max.\n\nBut how to find the best y?\n\nLet me think of the following: For each possible W, the optimal number of weight 2 items to take is either floor( (W) / 2 ), or floor( (W - k) / 2 ), where k is the number of weight 1 items. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea. For a given W, the optimal number of weight 2 items is the one that makes the remaining weight (W - 2y) as large as possible, but also taking into account the value of the weight 2 items. However, since the weight 2 items are sorted, the first y items are the best ones.\n\nSo, for a given W, the optimal y is in the range [max(0, y_max - K), y_max], where K is a small constant (like 1000). Then, for each of these K possibilities, compute the value. This is a heuristic approach, but given that the weight is small, maybe it's possible.\n\nBut how to choose K? Well, considering that the maximum number of weight 2 items is up to m//2, but for each W, trying up to 200 possibilities would be manageable.\n\nBut why would this work? Because the optimal y is likely to be near the maximum possible y (since each weight 2 item is more valuable than two weight 1 items?), but this depends on the actual items.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps for a given W, the optimal y is either the maximum possible y, or the maximum possible y minus 1, or something like that. But this is not guaranteed.\n\nBut given that the problem requires an efficient solution, perhaps we can proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items:\n\nSort them in descending order of cost.\n\nCompute prefix sums for both.\n\nFor a given W, iterate y from max(0, y_max - 1000) to y_max, and for each y, compute the corresponding x = min( len1, W - 2*y ), and take the maximum of prefix2[y] + prefix1[x].\n\nBut why would this work? Well, if the optimal y is within 1000 of y_max, then this approach would find it. However, this is a heuristic and may not work for all cases. However, given the time constraints, perhaps this is the only feasible way.\n\nBut how to choose the number of candidates to check? Let's think. For example, if the weight 2 items are all very valuable, then taking as many as possible would be optimal. However, if there are some weight 1 items that are more valuable than the sum of two weight 2 items, then perhaps taking fewer weight 2 items and more weight 1 items would be better. However, since the weight 1 items are sorted, the first few items are the most valuable.\n\nBut given that the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps the optimal y is in the vicinity of y_max or around (W - x)/2, where x is the number of weight 1 items. But without knowing x, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, here's another idea. For a given W, the optimal number of weight 2 items y can be determined by finding the maximum between:\n\na) Take as many weight 2 items as possible, and then fill the remaining weight with weight 1 items.\n\nb) Take as many weight 1 items as possible, and then see if there are any weight 2 items that can be added.\n\nBut even this would require checking two possibilities, but perhaps not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for the weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection can be found by considering two cases:\n\nCase 1: Take as many weight 2 items as possible (y_max), then take as many weight 1 items as possible.\n\nCase 2: Take as many weight 1 items as possible (x_max = W), then see how many weight 2 items can be added. But this is not clear.\n\nBut perhaps for each W, we can compute the best possible by considering a few possibilities, such as:\n\n- Take y = floor(W / 2) and y = floor(W / 2) - 1, etc.\n\nBut again, this is not guaranteed.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let me think of the problem again. The weight of each item is 1, 2, or 3. So, for the entire problem, perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\nSeparate the items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3. Sort each group in descending order of cost. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\nThen, for each possible number of weight 3 items (z), we can compute the remaining weight as rem = m - 3*z. We then compute the best possible combination of weight 1 and 2 items for rem. The maximum over all z would be the answer.\n\nBut how to compute the best combination for weight 1 and 2 items for a given rem.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for that part:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, the optimal selection is to take as many of the highest value items as possible, given that their combined weight is <= rem.\n\nBut since the items are sorted, perhaps we can use a greedy approach here. For example, we can take the top items from weight 1 and 2, choosing between taking one weight 2 item or two weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to implement this for a given rem?\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm for a given rem:\n\nInitialize i = 0 (index for weight 1 items), j = 0 (index for weight 2 items), total = 0.\n\nWhile i < len1 and j < len2 and rem > 0:\n\n   if (rem >= 2 and (j < len2 and (prefix2[j+1] - prefix2[j]) >= (prefix1[i+1] - prefix1[i]) * 2 )):\n\n       take the weight 2 item. rem -= 2. total += cost. j += 1.\n\n   else:\n\n       take the weight 1 item. rem -= 1. total += cost. i += 1.\n\nBut this is a greedy approach and may not work in all cases. However, given that the items are sorted, this might be the best we can do for a quick computation.\n\nBut this approach would take O(len1 + len2) time for each rem, which is not feasible if rem is computed multiple times.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible rem, we can compute the maximum number of weight 2 items that can be taken (y_max), and then compute the maximum between taking y_max and y_max - 1, etc., up to a small number of candidates.\n\nBut again, this is not clear.\n\nLet me look for alternative solutions. Since the weight is limited to 1, 2, 3, perhaps there's a way to model this with a modified knapsack approach that is optimized for small weights.\n\nWait, for the original problem, the weight is up to 3, so for each item, it's either weight 1, 2, or 3. So, perhaps the standard knapsack approach can be optimized by grouping items by their weight.\n\nLet me think about the following:\n\nWe can process each weight group (1, 2, 3) separately. For weight 1 items, since they are all of weight 1, the best way to take them is to take as many as possible of the highest value ones. Same for weight 2 and 3.\n\nBut combining them optimally is the challenge.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible number of weight 1 items (x) and weight 2 items (y), we can compute the maximum possible value for x and y such that x + 2y <= m. But this is again O(m^2), which is not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items, the maximum number of weight 1 items that can be added.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me try to think of the following. Let's assume that we have sorted the weight 1 and 2 items. For the weight 1 items, the prefix sum is prefix1, and for weight 2 items, it's prefix2.\n\nNow, for any capacity W, the maximum value is the maximum of prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( W - 2y, len1 ) ] for all y in [0, min( len2, W//2 ) ].\n\nBut how to find this maximum quickly?\n\nLet me think about the following. For each possible y, the term W - 2y is the remaining weight for weight 1 items. Since prefix1 is non-decreasing, the maximum for a given y is prefix1[ min( len1, W - 2y ) ].\n\nNow, since W is fixed, the function f(y) = prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( len1, W - 2y ) ] is what we need to maximize.\n\nBut how to find the maximum of this function.\n\nSince prefix2 is non-decreasing (because items are sorted in descending order), and prefix1 is also non-decreasing, the function f(y) is not necessarily monotonic. However, perhaps for some ranges of y, the function increases and then decreases.\n\nBut how to find the maximum.\n\nLet me think of the following: For a given W, the optimal y is the one that maximizes the sum of prefix2[y] and the maximum possible prefix1[ ... ].\n\nLet me define for a given y, the value of prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( len1, W - 2y ) ].\n\nLet me denote that W is fixed. Let's assume that W - 2y >= 0. If W - 2y is negative, then y is too large.\n\nNow, for y ranging from 0 to y_max, where y_max = min( len2, W//2 ), we need to find the maximum of this function.\n\nLet me consider that for each y, the value of W - 2y decreases as y increases. So for larger y, the available weight for weight 1 items decreases.\n\nBut since prefix2 increases with y, and prefix1 increases with the available weight, the function f(y) is a trade-off between taking more weight 2 items (higher prefix2) and less weight 1 items (lower prefix1).\n\nThe maximum could be anywhere in this range. However, since the items are sorted, perhaps the optimal y is either where the weight 2 items are better than the weight 1 items, or vice versa.\n\nBut how to find this quickly.\n\nLet me think of the following: For a given W, the maximum number of weight 2 items is y_max. Let me try all y in [y_max - K, y_max], where K is a small number like 1000. For each y in this range, compute the value and take the maximum. Similarly, also try some y near the minimum. This would give us a good approximation, and since K is small, it's feasible.\n\nBut why would this work? Well, if the optimal y is within K of y_max, then this approach would find it. Otherwise, it might miss it. But for the purposes of passing all test cases, perhaps this is acceptable, especially given the time constraints.\n\nBut what is K? Well, since the weight 1 items can have very high values, perhaps the optimal y is not at y_max. For example, if there are many high-value weight 1 items, taking fewer weight 2 items and more weight 1 items might be better.\n\nBut how to determine K. Well, since the maximum weight is 3e5, and K is 1000, then for each W, we'd have to check 2000 possibilities. And for each z (number of weight 3 items), which is up to m//3 = 1e5, this would be 1e5 * 2000 = 2e8 operations. Which is probably too slow for Python.\n\nBut maybe K can be set to 300 or something smaller. Or perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the following: since the weight 1 items are sorted, for any given y, the maximum number of weight 1 items is x = min( len1, W - 2y ). So, the value is prefix2[y] + prefix1[x]. Now, since prefix1 is non-decreasing, and x decreases as y increases, the function f(y) is the sum of two terms: one increasing with y, and the other decreasing with y. This suggests that the function f(y) may have a single peak, which can be found with ternary search.\n\nBut is the function unimodal? Let's think. For example, when y increases, prefix2[y] increases, but x decreases, so prefix1[x] decreases. The overall function may first increase and then decrease, making it unimodal. If that is the case, then ternary search can be applied to find the maximum.\n\nBut how to confirm that the function is unimodal.\n\nLet me imagine a scenario where the function is unimodal. Suppose that initially, adding more weight 2 items increases the total value, but after a certain point, the decrease in weight 1 items outweighs the gain from the additional weight 2 items, leading to a decrease in the total value. This would make the function unimodal.\n\nIf this holds, then we can perform a ternary search on y in the range [0, y_max] to find the maximum value of f(y).\n\nThis would reduce the time complexity for each W to O(log y_max), which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to verify if the function is indeed unimodal.\n\nLet me take an example:\n\nSuppose W = 5.\n\nWeight 2 items: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1] (prefix2[y] is 5, 9, 12, 14, 15)\n\nWeight 1 items: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1] (prefix1[x] is 6, 11, 15, 18, 20, 21)\n\nFor various y:\n\ny=0: x=5 → sum 0 + 20 = 20\n\ny=1: x=5-2=3 → sum 5 + 18 = 23\n\ny=2: x=5-4=1 → sum 12 + 6 = 18\n\ny=3: x=5-6 = -1 → x=0 → sum 14 + 0 = 14\n\nSo the function increases from y=0 to y=1, then decreases. So unimodal.\n\nAnother example: W=4.\n\ny=0: x=4 → sum 0 + 15 = 15\n\ny=1: x=4-2=2 → sum 5 + 11 = 16\n\ny=2: x=4-4=0 → sum 9 + 0 =9\n\nSo again, unimodal.\n\nAnother example where there's a plateau.\n\nWeight 2 items: [5,5], prefix2: [0,5,10]\n\nWeight 1 items: [5,5,5], prefix1: [0,5,10,15]\n\nW=4.\n\nPossible y:\n\ny=0: x=4 → 15.\n\ny=1: x=4-2=2 → 5 + 10 = 15.\n\ny=2: x=4-4=0 → 10 + 0 = 10.\n\nSo the function is flat between y=0 and y=1, then decreases. Still unimodal.\n\nSo it seems that the function is unimodal, which means that ternary search can be applied.\n\nIf this is true, then for each W, we can perform a ternary search on y in [0, y_max] to find the maximum value of f(y).\n\nThis would reduce the time complexity for each W to O(log y_max), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items:\n\n- Sort each in descending order.\n\n- Compute prefix sums.\n\nFor a given W:\n\n- Compute y_max = min( len2, W // 2 )\n\n- Perform ternary search on y in [0, y_max] to find the maximum value of prefix2[y] + prefix1[ min( len1, W - 2*y ) ]\n\nThis would give the optimal value for combining weight 1 and 2 items for capacity W.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this ternary search.\n\nIn Python, for a given function f(y), we can perform ternary search on the interval [low, high], and find the maximum.\n\nBut since the function may have a plateau, we need to ensure that we check all possible candidates in the vicinity of the found maximum.\n\nBut assuming that the function is unimodal, ternary search should work.\n\nOnce this is implemented, the overall approach would be:\n\n- Separate the items into three groups based on weight.\n\n- Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n- Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n- Iterate over possible z (number of weight 3 items taken), from 0 to min(len3, m//3).\n\n   For each z:\n\n      rem = m - 3*z\n\n      if rem < 0: skip\n\n      compute the best value for rem using the weight 1 and 2 items (using the ternary search method)\n\n      total_value = prefix3[z] + best_value\n\n      keep track of the maximum total_value.\n\nFinally, return the maximum total_value.\n\nNow, the code structure would look like this:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nInitialize lists for w1, w2, w3.\n\nFor each of the n items:\n\n   read wi and ci.\n\n   append to the corresponding list.\n\nSort each list in descending order.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each list.\n\nFor example:\n\nprefix1 = [0]\n\nfor i in range(len(w1)):\n\n   prefix1.append( prefix1[-1] + w1[i] )\n\nSimilarly for prefix2 and prefix3.\n\nThen, for each possible z in 0 to min(len3, m//3):\n\n   rem = m - 3*z\n\n   if rem < 0: continue\n\n   current_value = prefix3[z]\n\n   compute best_value for rem with weight 1 and 2 items.\n\n   current_total = current_value + best_value\n\n   update max_total.\n\nNow, the key part is implementing the best_value function for rem.\n\nImplementing the ternary search for best_value:\n\ndef get_max_value(rem):\n\n    len2 = len(prefix2) - 1\n\n    y_max = min( len2, rem // 2 )\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = y_max\n\n    best = 0\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n        val1 = get_value(mid1, rem)\n\n        val2 = get_value(mid2, rem)\n\n        if val1 < val2:\n\n            best = max(best, val2)\n\n            low = mid1 + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            best = max(best, val1)\n\n            high = mid2 - 1\n\n    # After the loop, check some points around low, high, etc.\n\n    # Also, check the endpoints.\n\n    for y in [0, y_max, low, high, (low + high)//2 ]:\n\n        if 0 <= y <= y_max:\n\n            current = get_value(y, rem)\n\n            best = max(best, current)\n\n    return best\n\nBut wait, the ternary search implementation may vary. Alternatively, since the function is unimodal, we can perform a standard ternary search.\n\nHowever, in practice, sometimes the function may have plateaus, and the ternary search might not find the exact maximum. So, after performing the ternary search, it's safer to check the nearby points.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps a simple ternary search will suffice.\n\nThe get_value function is:\n\ndef get_value(y, rem):\n\n    available = rem - 2*y\n\n    x = min( len(prefix1)-1, available )\n\n    return prefix2[y] + prefix1[x]\n\nBut since the prefix1 and prefix2 are precomputed, this is O(1).\n\nNow, for the code.\n\nBut what about when the rem is zero? Then, the best_value is zero.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n2 1\n\nSo n=1, m=1. The item has weight 2, cost 1. So the best is to take none, output is 0.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo n=2, m=2. Items are (1,3) and (2,2). The best is to take the first item (",
