Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm, so the standard knapsack approach won't work here because the m is too big for O(nm) time. So I need a smarter way.\n\nFirst, since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe I can handle each weight category separately. Let me think about how to process items of each weight.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, I can sort them in descending order of cost and take as many as possible. Same for weight 2 and 3. But since combining different weights might give a better total, I need to find an optimal way to combine them.\n\nWait, but how do I handle combinations? Like, if I have some weight 2 items and some weight 1 items, maybe replacing two weight 1 items with one weight 2 item could be better. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can pre-process each weight group by sorting them and then creating prefix sums. Then, for each possible number of weight 1 items, weight 2 items, and weight 3 items, I can check if their total weight is within m, and compute the maximum cost. But even that seems computationally heavy if done naively.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to iterate through possible numbers of weight 3 items and then use the remaining capacity for weight 1 and 2 items. Let me think.\n\nLet me break down the problem into steps:\n\n1. Separate all items into three groups based on their weight: w1, w2, w3.\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost. Then compute prefix sums for each group. This way, for any number of items taken from a group, I can quickly get the total cost.\n3. Now, the problem becomes choosing how many items to take from each group such that the total weight is <= m, and the sum of their costs is maximized.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the best combination?\n\nLet me think about the possible approaches. Since the weights are small (1, 2, 3), perhaps for each possible number of weight 3 items (say k), I can compute the remaining capacity and then find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut even that, for each k, the remaining capacity is m - 3*k. Then, for that remaining capacity, I need to find the optimal selection of weight 1 and 2 items. How to do that efficiently?\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps I can precompute for all possible capacities up to m. But again, m is up to 3e5, which is manageable for some processing.\n\nAlternatively, for a given capacity (say rem), how do I find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items?\n\nLet me think: For each possible number of weight 2 items (say x), the maximum number of weight 1 items I can take is (rem - 2x). But since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking the top (rem - 2x) of them would be optimal. However, x can vary from 0 to min(rem//2, len(w2)).\n\nBut trying all x for each rem would be O(rem) per case, which might be expensive if done for each k.\n\nWait, but for the weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps there's a way to precompute for all possible capacities. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: For the weight 1 and 2 items, we can model this as a knapsack problem with items of weight 1 and 2. But since the items are sorted, maybe we can find an optimal way.\n\nSuppose we have sorted lists of weight 1 items and weight 2 items. Let's say we have prefix sums for each. For a given capacity rem, we can try to take as many weight 2 items as possible, and then fill the rest with weight 1 items, but also consider cases where we take one less weight 2 item and add more weight 1 items, etc.\n\nBut how to find the optimal x (number of weight 2 items) for a given rem?\n\nLet me think of it as follows: Let's say we have a capacity of rem. Let's take x weight 2 items. Then the maximum possible x is min( len(w2), rem // 2 ). For each x, the number of weight 1 items is min( (rem - 2x), len(w1) ). But since the weight 1 items are sorted, taking the first (rem - 2x) gives the maximum sum",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs Petya can carry given a weight limit. The key insight is that the weights of the souvenirs are limited to 1, 2, or 3.

But perhaps checking a window around x_max will cover the optimal case.\n            # Let's proceed with this approach\n            # Now, implement this part\n            # So, for the current rem, compute x_max\n            x_max = min(len(w2), rem // 2)\n            start_x = max(0, x_max - 100)\n            end_x = x_max\n            for x in range(start_x, end_x + 1):\n                if x > len(w2):\n                    continue\n                available = rem - 2 * x\n                y = min(available, len(w1))\n                current_sum = prefix2[x] + prefix1[y]\n                if current_sum > best:\n                    best = current_sum\n        # Also check for x=0 to len(w2) in case x_max is zero\n        # Wait, the above code may miss some x when x_max is small.
