You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about replacing digits in a number to make it as large as possible using a given sequence of digits. Each digit in the sequence can be used once. So, the goal is to choose which digits to replace and in which positions to maximize the overall number.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the approach. The key idea here is to replace the leftmost possible digits with the largest possible digits from s. Because changing a digit in a more significant position (like the left) has a bigger impact on the number's value than changing a digit in a less significant position (right side).\n\nBut how to do that? Let's think:\n\nLet me sort the sequence s in descending order. Then, for each digit in the original number a, starting from the left, if there's a larger digit available in s, replace it. But we have to use the digits in s optimally.\n\nWait, but since we can choose any order of replacements, but each element in s can be used once. So, the optimal way is to take the largest digits from s and apply them to the earliest possible positions in a where they can make the number larger.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the s digits in descending order. So the largest digits come first.\n2. Iterate through each digit in the original number a, from left to right.\n3. For each position, check if the current digit can be replaced by a larger digit from the sorted s list. If yes, replace it with the largest possible available digit from s, and remove that digit from the s list (so it's not reused).\n4. Continue until all digits in s are used or all positions are checked.\n\nThis way, we ensure that the most significant positions are upgraded as much as possible.\n\nFor example, let's take the first sample input:\n\nOriginal a is '1024', s is '010' → sorted s is ['1', '0', '0'].\n\nNow, iterate through each digit of a:\n\nFirst digit is '1'. Check the sorted s. The first element is '1', which is not larger than current digit. So no replacement here. Move to next digit.\n\nSecond digit is '0'. The next available in s is '1' (since sorted s is in descending order). Since 1 is larger than 0, replace it. Now, the s list becomes ['0', '0'].\n\nThird digit is '2'. The next available in s is '0', which is smaller than 2. So no replacement.\n\nFourth digit is '4'. Again, s has '0's. No replacement. So the final number is '1124'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: the second input is a = '987' and s is '1234567'. Sorted s is ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1'].\n\nCheck each digit of a:\n\nFirst digit is '9'. The largest in s is 7, which is smaller than 9. So no replacement.\n\nSecond digit is '8'. The next in s is 7, which is smaller than 8. No replacement.\n\nThird digit is '7'. The next in s is 7. Since it's equal, replacing would not help. So no replacement. So the original number remains '987'.\n\nWhich is the sample output.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this efficiently?\n\nLet's think about the steps:\n\n- Read a as a string, since it's a very big number (up to 1e5 digits), but handling as a string is manageable.\n- Read s as a string, then sort it in descending order. For example, s = '010' → sorted becomes ['1', '0', '0'].\n- Then, iterate over each character in a, and for each position, check if there's a digit in the sorted s that is larger than the current digit. If so, replace it and remove that digit from the sorted list.\n\nBut how to efficiently check and remove the digits? Since the sorted s is in descending order, we can process it as a list, and for each position in a, check if the first element of the sorted s is larger than the current digit. If yes, replace and pop the first element. Else, move to the next digit in a.\n\nWait, but the sorted s is in descending order. So, for example, if we have sorted_s = [9,7,5,3, ...], then for each digit in a, we check if sorted_s[0] is larger than current digit. If yes, replace and pop the first element. Otherwise, move on.\n\nThis way, we are using the largest available digits first for the earliest positions.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\nsorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n\nthen for each i in 0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the value of a given integer by replacing its digits with a sequence of digits provided. The goal is to use the digits from the sequence optimally to achieve the highest possible value for the original number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Sequence**: First, we sort the sequence of digits in descending order. This allows us to use the largest digits first, which is crucial for maximizing the value of the number.\n2. **Iterate Through Digits**: We iterate through each digit of the original number from left to right. For each digit, we check if there is a larger digit available in our sorted sequence. If so, we replace the current digit with the largest available digit from the sequence and remove that digit from the sequence to ensure it is not reused.\n3. **Construct the Result**: By following the above steps, we construct the maximum possible value of the original number after all valid replacements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    a = input[0]\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    sorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n    result = []\n    s_ptr = 0  # Pointer to the current position in sorted_s\n    \n    for digit in a:\n        if s_ptr < len(sorted_s) and sorted_s[s_ptr] > digit:\n            result.append(sorted_s[s_ptr])\n            s_ptr += 1\n        else:\n            result.append(digit)\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single string split into two parts: the original number `a` and the sequence of digits `s`.\n- **Sorting the Sequence**: The sequence `s` is sorted in descending order to prioritize using the largest digits first.\n- **Replacement Process**: As we iterate through each digit of `a`, we check if the current largest available digit from the sorted sequence can replace the current digit of `a`. If it can, we perform the replacement and move the pointer in the sorted sequence forward. If not, we keep the original digit.\n- **Output the Result**: The result is constructed as a list of characters and then joined into a string for output, ensuring no leading zeros are present as required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the value of the number by making optimal replacements starting from the most significant digits, leveraging the sorted sequence efficiently.",
