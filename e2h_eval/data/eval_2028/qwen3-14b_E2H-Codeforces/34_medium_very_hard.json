And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Each week is defined as k consecutive days. For each of these weeks, we calculate the sum of the sleep times and then take the average of all those sums. The output should be the average with enough decimal precision.\n\nSo, the input gives n and k, followed by a list of n integers. The output is the average of all the sums of consecutive k-day periods.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to compute the sum for each window of size k and then divide by the total number of such windows. But since n can be up to 2e5, a naive approach that checks each window in O(n*k) time would be too slow. For example, if n is 2e5 and k is 1e5, then the total operations would be 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10, which is way beyond acceptable time limits.\n\nSo, we need an efficient way to compute the sum of all consecutive k-day periods. The sliding window technique comes to mind here. Let's think about that.\n\nThe sliding window approach can compute each window sum in O(1) time after the initial sum. For example, the first window is from index 0 to k-1. Then, each subsequent window is the previous sum minus the element that's leaving the window (the leftmost element) plus the new element entering the window (the next element). This way, each sum is computed in O(1) time, leading to O(n) total time for all the sums.\n\nOnce we have all the window sums, we need to compute their average. The average is the total sum of all window sums divided by the number of windows, which is (n - k + 1).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the initial window sum for the first k elements.\n2. Iterate through the array from index k to n-1, updating the window sum by subtracting the element leaving the window and adding the new element.\n3. Keep a running total of all these window sums.\n4. Divide the total by (n - k + 1) to get the average.\n5. Output the result with sufficient decimal precision.\n\nNow, let's think about handling the edge cases. For example, when k equals n, there's only one window. Also, when k is 1, each element is its own window, so the average is the average of all elements.\n\nBut the sliding window approach works for all cases. Let's test with the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n3 2\n3 4 7\n\nThe windows are [3,4] sum 7, and [4,7] sum 11. Total sum is 18, divided by 2 gives 9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: 1 1, the sum is 10, divided by 1 gives 10.\n\nThird example: 8 2. The windows are 7 in total. Let's see:\n\nThe array is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]. The windows are:\n\n[1,2] sum 3\n[2,4] sum 6\n[4,100000] sum 100004\n[100000,123] sum 100123\n[123,456] sum 579\n[456,789] sum 1245\n[789,1] sum 790\n\nTotal sum is 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = Let's calculate:\n\n3+6=9; 9+100004=100013; +100123 = 200136; +579=200715; +1245=201960; +790=202750.\n\nDivide by 7: 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the inputs. The input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows three different test cases. Wait, the input is given as a list of inputs, but in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows three different test cases. So perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the user provided sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWhich seems to be three separate test cases. However, the problem's original input is supposed to be for a single test case. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nLooking back, the problem's input description says that the first line contains two integers, and the second line contains n integers. So the sample input given by the user is perhaps a list of multiple test cases. However, the original problem probably expects that each test case is processed separately. But the problem's original input is for a single test case. Wait, the user's sample input shows three different test cases, but the problem's input is for a single test case. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. However, the actual problem statement's input is for a single test case. Therefore, the code must process a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample outputs, the outputs are given for three test cases. Therefore, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases in the input. However, the problem's original input is for one test case. Therefore, perhaps the user's sample input is incorrect. But perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input format. However, the code needs to read from stdin, which in the problem's context is a single test case.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nTherefore, the code should read a single test case. However, the sample input given by the user has three test cases. That suggests that perhaps the user is showing multiple test cases in the sample input. But the original problem's sample input is probably for a single test case. However, the user's sample input seems to be a list of inputs, but perhaps that's just a way to represent multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is expecting that the code handles multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k, and the second line contains the array. So, for example, in the sample input, the first case is 3 2 followed by the array, then another case 1 1 followed by array, etc. So, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how many test cases are there? The problem's input is not clear. However, looking at the original problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output:\n\n9.0000000000\n\nBut the user's sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the user is using a different format. However, the original problem may have multiple test cases. But the original problem's input is not specified as such. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nLooking back, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k...\n\nSo it's for a single test case. Therefore, the sample input provided by the user may have been formatted incorrectly. However, the user's sample input shows multiple test cases, and the output shows multiple outputs. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how?\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nFor example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is 9. So the sample input is for a single test case.\n\nBut the user's sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the user's sample input is not part of the problem statement but is a way to show multiple examples. However, the code needs to handle a single test case. But the problem's original input is for a single test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should read a single test case. However, the user's sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the user is using a different approach, but the code must read from stdin, which for the problem is a single test case.\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. So, perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, split into test cases, and process them. However, the problem statement does not mention multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the user's sample input is incorrect, and the actual problem expects a single test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement's note, the third example says that there are 7 weeks. So the third example is a single test case.\n\nThus, the code must process a single test case. However, the user's sample input shows multiple test cases. But that's perhaps a mistake. Therefore, the code should read two lines from stdin: the first line with n and k, and the second line with the array.\n\nBut the user's sample input shows that for the third example, the input is '8 2\\n1 2 4 ... 1', and the output is '28964.2857142857'.\n\nThus, the code should read one test case.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the sum of each consecutive k-day window.\n\nSum all those sums, divide by the number of windows (n -k +1), and output with 10 decimal digits.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this efficiently.\n\nImplementing the sliding window approach.\n\nLet's proceed.\n\nFirst, compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\nThen, for each i from k to n-1:\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n\nAdd this current_sum to the total.\n\nBut wait, the initial sum is for the first window. Then, for each next window, we subtract the element that's leaving (the first element of the previous window) and add the new element.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nCompute total_sum = 0.\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0...k-1])\n\ntotal_sum += current_sum\n\nthen for i in range(k, n):\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n\ntotal_sum += current_sum\n\nThen, the average is total_sum / (n -k +1)\n\nBut for n=1, k=1, then the total_sum is a[0], divided by 1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this correctly.\n\nBut for large n and k, say 2e5, the sum can be up to 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10, and multiplied by 2e5, the total_sum could be up to 4e15, which fits in Python's integer type.\n\nSo, no problem with integer overflows.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nThen read the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the initial sum.\n\nThen iterate.\n\nBut for the initial sum, if k is 0? No, since constraints say 1<=k<=n.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(k, n):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i -k] + a[i]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\naverage = total_sum / (n -k +1)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for the first example:\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\na = [3,4,7]\n\ninitial sum is 3+4=7. total_sum is 7.\n\nThen i=2 (since k=2, and n=3, so range(k, n) is 2 to 2 (since n is 3, range(2,3) is [2]).\n\ni=2:\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 - a[0] + a[2] = 7-3+7= 11.\n\ntotal_sum becomes 7+11=18.\n\naverage is 18/(3-2+1) = 18/2=9. Correct.\n\nSample output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSo the code would print that.\n\nAnother sample input is 1 1, array [10]. The initial sum is 10. total_sum is 10. average is 10/1=10. Correct.\n\nThird example:\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\narray is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nThe initial sum is 1+2=3. Then, for i=2 (k=2, so i starts from 2 to 7 (n=8)).\n\ni=2: current_sum = 3 - a[0] + a[2] = 3-1+4=6. total_sum +=6 → total_sum is 3+6=9.\n\ni=3: current_sum = 6 -a[1] +a[3] → 6-2+100000= 100004 → total_sum += 100004 → 9 + 100004 = 100013.\n\ni=4: current_sum = 100004 - a[2] + a[4] → 100004 -4 +123 = 100123 → total_sum += 100123 → 100013 + 100123 = 200136.\n\ni=5: current_sum = 100123 - a[3] + a[5] → 100123 -100000 +456 = 579 → total_sum +=579 → 200136 +579 = 200715.\n\ni=6: current_sum = 579 -a[4] + a[6] → 579 -123 +789 = 1245 → total_sum +=1245 → 200715+1245=201960.\n\ni=7: current_sum = 1245 -a[5] +a[7] → 1245 -456 +1 = 790 → total_sum +=790 → 201960 +790 = 202750.\n\nThen average is 202750 / (8-2+1) = 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nBut what about when k is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, k is at least 1.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle the case where n=k. Then, the loop for i in range(k, n) is range(k, n) which is empty. So, total_sum is the initial sum, divided by 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, k=1. Then the number of windows is 2. The initial sum is a[0], then for i=1, current_sum is sum of a[1]. So total_sum is a[0]+a[1], average is (a[0]+a[1])/2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, the code is correct. But in Python, when you have very large numbers, but since Python handles big integers, there's no problem.\n\nBut for the output, the code needs to print the average with at least 6 decimal digits. The code uses the format string {0:.10f}, which will print 10 decimal digits. For example, in the first sample, it's 9.0000000000. Which matches.\n\nBut what about when the average is an integer? Like 9.0, the code will print 9.0000000000, which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nBut the user's sample input includes three test cases. However, the code is written to read one test case. So, if the code is run with multiple test cases, it would read the first two lines as the first test case, then the next two lines as the next test case, etc. However, the problem statement's input is for a single test case. Therefore, the code is correct.\n\nBut in the user's sample input, the code would need to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement doesn't mention that. Therefore, perhaps the user's sample input is incorrect, and the code should process a single test case. However, the user's sample output shows three outputs, which implies that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the user's input is a list of test cases. For example, the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. How can we know?\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the input is two lines. However, the sample input given by the user has three test cases. So perhaps the problem is from a programming competition where multiple test cases are present. But the original problem statement does not mention that. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's input and output sections:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\nOutput:\n\nOutput average sleeping time... \n\nSo, the input is for a single test case. Therefore, the code should read a single test case. However, the user's sample input shows multiple test cases, but that's probably a mistake. Therefore, the code should read a single test case.\n\nBut the user's sample input is given as a list of inputs, but the actual code should process each test case as per the problem statement.\n\nThus, the code is correct as written.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut need to make sure that when reading from stdin, the code reads the two lines correctly. However, sometimes, the input may have multiple lines, but for the code, it's better to read the entire input and split accordingly.\n\nBut for the problem, the code is supposed to read from stdin. So, the code would read the first line as n and k, then the second line as the array.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have multiple lines, but for the problem, it's two lines.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total_sum = current_sum\n    for i in range(k, n):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i - k] + a[i]\n        total_sum += current_sum\n    average = total_sum / (n - k + 1)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut what if the input is given with multiple test cases? For example, the user's sample input. In that case, the code would read the first two lines as the first test case, then the next two lines as the next test case, etc. But the problem's input is for a single test case. Therefore, the code is correct.\n\nBut the user's sample input shows three test cases. However, the problem's original input is for one test case. Therefore, the code is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input, and the code should process multiple test cases. How can we know?\n\nWell, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output:\n\n9.0000000000\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nOutput: 10.0000000000\n\nThird sample input:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nOutput: 28964.2857142857\n\nSo, the code would process each test case as per the problem's input.\n\nBut if the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases, then the code should read all test cases. However, the problem statement does not mention that. Therefore, the code is correct as written.\n\nThus, the code should be written as above.\n\nBut in Python, when reading from stdin, sometimes there are issues with trailing spaces or multiple lines. But the code uses readline() twice, which should read the first line (n and k) and the second line (the array).\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nFor the third sample input:\n\nn=8, k=2, array is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nThe code computes the total_sum as 202750, divided by 7, which is 28964.2857142857..., which when printed with 10 decimal digits is 28964.2857142857.\n\nBut how does the code format it?\n\nThe code uses print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average)).\n\nBut when the average is 28964.285714285714..., the .10f format will round it to 10 decimal places. Let's see:\n\nThe exact value is 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857142857... So, the decimal digits are 2857142857... So, the 10 decimal digits would be 2857142857, but the exact value depends on the division.\n\nLet me compute 202750 /7:\n\nLet me compute 7 * 28964 = 202748. 202750 - 202748 = 2. So 202750/7 = 28964 + 2/7 = 28964.2857142857..., with the 285714 repeating.\n\nSo, when printed with 10 decimal digits, it would be 2857142857 (the first 10 digits after decimal point). Let me check:\n\nThe value is 28964.285714285714..., so the first 10 decimals are 2857142857. So the output is 28964.2857142857, which matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, for the code to handle very large n and k, like 2e5 elements. The code uses O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for the initial sum, sum(a[:k]) could take O(k) time. But since k can be up to 2e5, this is acceptable, as the total time is O(n).\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive k-day periods (weeks) from a given list of daily sleep times. The solution must be efficient to handle large input sizes up to 200,000 days.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: This technique allows us to efficiently compute the sum of each consecutive k-day period in linear time. By maintaining a running sum of the current window and adjusting it as we slide the window one day at a time, we avoid recalculating the sum from scratch each time.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the initial sum of the first k days. Then, for each subsequent window, adjust the sum by subtracting the element that is sliding out of the window and adding the new element that is sliding into the window.\n3. **Average Calculation**: Once all window sums are computed, the average is obtained by dividing the total sum of all window sums by the number of such windows, which is (n - k + 1).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total_sum = current_sum\n    for i in range(k, n):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i - k] + a[i]\n        total_sum += current_sum\n    average = total_sum / (n - k + 1)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains two integers `n` (number of days) and `k` (length of each week). The second line contains `n` integers representing the sleep times for each day.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first `k` days is calculated to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Sliding Window Adjustment**: For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by removing the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that enters the window. This adjustment ensures each window sum is computed in constant time.\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all window sums is accumulated, and the average is computed by dividing this total by the number of windows. The result is formatted to ensure at least 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach ensures an efficient O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes as specified in the problem constraints.",
