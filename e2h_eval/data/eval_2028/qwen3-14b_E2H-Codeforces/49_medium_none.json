They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the GCD and LCM values given for each road. The input gives me a graph with n lawns (vertices) and m roads (edges). Each edge has a GCD and LCM of the two connected lawns. My task is to assign numbers to each lawn such that all these conditions are satisfied. If it's not possible, output NO.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this problem. Each edge between two nodes u and v has a GCD g and LCM l. For two numbers a and b, we know that GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So, for each edge, the product of the GCD and LCM must equal the product of the two node values. But since GCD and LCM are given, that gives us some constraints.\n\nBut wait, there's another condition: for any two numbers a and b, their GCD must divide both a and b, and their LCM must be a multiple of both. Also, the GCD must divide the LCM. Because if GCD(a,b) is g, then LCM(a,b) must be a multiple of g. Otherwise, it's impossible. So for each edge, we should check if the given GCD divides the LCM. If not, then it's impossible, and we can immediately return NO.\n\nSo first step: for each edge, check if g divides l. If any edge fails this, output NO.\n\nAssuming that's okay, then for each edge between u and v, the numbers a_u and a_v must satisfy:\n\ngcd(a_u, a_v) = g, and lcm(a_u, a_v) = l.\n\nWhich implies that a_u and a_v are multiples of g. Let me think: Let a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y. Then, gcd(x,y) must be 1, because the GCD of a_u and a_v is g * gcd(x,y), which equals g. Therefore, gcd(x,y) = 1. And the LCM of a_u and a_v is g * x * y. Which must equal l. Therefore, l = g * x * y. So x * y = l / g. Since x and y are coprime.\n\nSo for each edge, l must be divisible by g. Which is the first check. Then, x*y = l/g, and x and y are coprime.\n\nSo for each edge, the product of x and y is fixed (l/g), and they are coprime. So x and y are two coprime numbers whose product is k = l/g.\n\nSo for each edge, we have that a_u and a_v must be multiples of g, and when divided by g, they are coprime numbers x and y such that x*y = k.\n\nBut how do we assign these values to the nodes?\n\nThis seems like a graph problem where each node's value is determined by the constraints from edges. The problem is similar to building a graph where each edge imposes a relation between two nodes. However, since each edge connects two nodes, and their values are related through GCD and LCM, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value must be a multiple of some base value, and with relations between pairs.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe using a union-find structure? Or perhaps building equations for each node.\n\nAnother approach: For each node, its value must be a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. Wait, no. Because for example, if a node is connected to two different edges, each with their own GCDs. Let's say node u is connected to v with GCD g1 and to w with GCD g2. Then, the value of u must be a multiple of g1 and also a multiple of g2. So the value of u must be a multiple of LCM(g1, g2). But maybe not. Let me think again. Suppose u and v have GCD g1, so u and v must be multiples of g1. Similarly, u and w have GCD g2, so u and w must be multiples of g2. Therefore, u must be a multiple of LCM(g1, g2). But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node, the value is determined by the product of certain factors along the edges. But how?\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a system where each edge imposes a relationship between two nodes. Let's consider that for each edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, then the values of u and v must be of the form g * x and g * y, where x and y are coprime and x * y = l/g. So for each edge, x and y are coprime and their product is k = l/g.\n\nBut x and y can be any pair of coprime numbers multiplying to k. However, the problem is that the same node may be involved in multiple edges. For example, if node u is connected to v and to w, then the value of u must be compatible with both edges.\n\nThis seems like a problem where each node's value is determined up to some factors, but with constraints that propagate through the graph.\n\nSo perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to others. For example, if we can assign variables to the nodes, and for each edge, set up equations that relate them.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as a graph where each node's value is determined by the product of the GCD of the edge and some other factors. For example, for each edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, we can say that u = g * x and v = g * y, where x and y are coprime and x*y = l/g. Then, for each edge, we can represent this as a relationship between u and v.\n\nBut how do we assign x and y for each edge, and ensure consistency across the entire graph?\n\nThis seems complicated. Another idea is to note that for each connected component in the graph, the values of the nodes are determined up to a certain factor. Let's think of building a graph where each node's value is determined by a base value multiplied by some factors.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a system of equations. For each edge, the product of the values of u and v must be equal to GCD * LCM. Because GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So for each edge (u, v, g, l), we have a_u * a_v = g * l.\n\nBut this is a multiplicative constraint. However, since the same node can be part of multiple edges, this creates a system of equations that must be satisfied.\n\nBut solving such a system is challenging. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nIf the graph is connected, then we can pick a starting node and assign it a value, then propagate the constraints through the edges. However, the problem is that the constraints are multiplicative, and the values may not be uniquely determined unless certain conditions are met.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a tree structure. Let's pick a root node and assign it a value. Then, for each edge from the root to another node, we can compute the value of the adjacent node based on the equation a_root * a_adjacent = g * l. But this would require knowing the value of the root. However, since the equation has two variables, we need more constraints.\n\nWait, but for each edge, we have a_u * a_v = g * l. But also, the GCD of a_u and a_v is g. Let me think again. Because if a_u and a_v have GCD g, then a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime. Then, their product is g² * x * y. But according to the equation, a_u * a_v = g * l. Therefore, g² * x * y = g * l → g * x * y = l. But since x * y = l/g, which is the same as earlier.\n\nSo for each edge, x * y = l/g, and x and y are coprime. So, for each edge, the product of x and y is fixed, and they are coprime.\n\nSo, for each edge, the ratio between a_u and a_v can be determined once we choose x and y. However, this choice affects the rest of the graph.\n\nBut how can we assign these x and y values consistently across the entire graph?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of building a graph where each edge imposes a relation between two nodes. For example, if u and v are connected by an edge with GCD g and LCM l, then:\n\na_u = g * x\n\na_v = g * y\n\nwith x * y = l/g and gcd(x, y) = 1.\n\nNow, suppose that in a connected component, we can assign a base value to one node, and then compute the values of others based on the edges. But how?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose we have a connected component. Let's pick a starting node, say u, and assign it a value. Then, for each edge connected to u, we can compute the value of the adjacent node.\n\nBut for this, we need to know x and y for that edge. However, x and y are coprime and multiply to k = l/g. So, for each edge, x and y can be any pair of coprime numbers whose product is k. However, the choice of x and y affects the rest of the graph.\n\nBut how do we choose them?\n\nWait, perhaps for each edge, the ratio between a_u and a_v is either x/g or y/g? No, a_u is g * x, a_v is g * y. So the ratio between a_u and a_v is x/y. But since x and y are coprime, this ratio is in reduced form.\n\nBut for the rest of the graph, this ratio must be consistent. For example, if node u is connected to node v via an edge, and node v is connected to node w via another edge, then the ratio between u and v must be compatible with the ratio between v and w.\n\nThis seems like a problem where the values of the nodes are determined up to a multiplicative factor. However, the constraints from the edges must be compatible.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each edge (u, v), the product of a_u and a_v is fixed (g*l). So, if I have a connected component, the product of all the a_i's around a cycle must be consistent. For example, if there's a cycle of edges, the product of the equations around the cycle must hold.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the product of the equations. Suppose we have a cycle u1 - u2 - ... - uk - u1. For each edge (ui, ui+1), we have a_ui * a_ui+1 = p_i (where p_i is g_i * l_i). So, multiplying all these equations together, we get:\n\nproduct_{i} (a_ui * a_ui+1) ) = product p_i.\n\nBut the left side is (a_u1 * a_u2) * (a_u2 * a_u3) * ... * (a_uk * a_u1) ) = (a_u1^2 * a_u2^2 * ... * a_uk^2) ). So the product of the p_i must be a square. But this is only possible if the product of the p_i is a perfect square. However, this is not necessarily the case. Therefore, if there's a cycle in the graph, the product of the p_i's (g*l for each edge) must be a square. Otherwise, there is no solution.\n\nBut wait, this is only true if the equations are consistent. For example, in the case of a triangle, if each edge's product is p, then the product of all three edges would be p^3. For the left side, it's (a1*a2)*(a2*a3)*(a3*a1) = (a1*a2*a3)^2. So the product of the p_i must be a square. Which in this case, p^3 must be a square, implying that p must be a square. But that's not necessarily true. Wait, this suggests that there's a contradiction here. So what's wrong with my reasoning?\n\nAh, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-express the product.\n\nThe product of all the equations around the cycle would be:\n\n(a_u1 * a_u2) * (a_u2 * a_u3) * ... * (a_uk * a_u1) ) = product of p_i.\n\nEach term in the product is a_ui * a_ui+1. So when you multiply all of them, each a_ui appears exactly twice (once as a_ui and once as a_ui+1, except for the first and last terms). Wait, for example, in a triangle u1-u2-u3-u1, the product is (a1a2)(a2a3)(a3a1) = a1²a2²a3² = (a1a2a3)^2. So the product of p_i's must be a square. Therefore, if the product of the p_i's for the cycle is not a square, then there's no solution.\n\nBut this is a necessary condition. However, this is not sufficient. Because even if the product is a square, there might be other constraints. For example, individual edges may not allow the assignments.\n\nBut this gives me an idea: For each connected component, the product of all p_i (g*l) for the edges in that component must be a square. Otherwise, it's impossible. However, this is only a necessary condition, not sufficient. But perhaps this is part of the solution.\n\nBut how can I check this? Well, for each connected component, I need to compute the product of all p_i's (g*l) for edges in that component. If any of those products is not a square, then it's impossible. But this seems computationally expensive for large graphs, but perhaps manageable.\n\nWait, but even this may not be the case. For example, in a connected component that's a tree, there are no cycles, so there's no such constraint. Therefore, the product of p_i's for the tree can be anything, but the tree's structure allows for a solution.\n\nBut how do I handle the assignments in the tree?\n\nLet me think again. Let's take a tree. Suppose I start with a root node. Assign it a value. Then, for each edge, I can compute the adjacent node's value based on the equation a_u * a_v = p (where p is g*l). However, since there are two variables (a_u and a_v), how do I choose them?\n\nBut in addition to the equation a_u * a_v = p, there's the GCD condition. Which requires that the GCD of a_u and a_v is g, and their LCM is l. Which implies that a_u and a_v must be multiples of g, and their product is g*l. So, for example, given that a_u * a_v = g*l, and that GCD(a_u, a_v) = g, we can derive that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime, and x * y = l/g. So for each edge, the product x*y is fixed, and x and y are coprime.\n\nBut how to assign x and y for each edge such that when traversing the tree, the values are consistent?\n\nThis seems like a problem where for each edge, we can assign x and y, but the assignments must be compatible with the rest of the tree.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each connected component, we can build a graph where each node's value is determined relative to others. For example, if I have a tree, I can assign a value to the root node, and then for each edge, compute the adjacent node's value based on the equation a_u * a_v = p. However, the problem is that there's a degree of freedom here. For example, if the root is assigned a value of a, then for an edge connecting to node v, the value of v is p/a. But then, this must also satisfy the GCD and LCM constraints. How?\n\nWait, but the equation a_u * a_v = p is derived from the fact that GCD(a_u, a_v) * LCM(a_u, a_v) = a_u * a_v. So, if we have that equation, then the GCD and LCM are already accounted for. Wait, no. Because the equation a_u * a_v = g * l holds regardless of the GCD and LCM. However, the GCD and LCM are given. So, the problem is that even if the product is correct, the GCD and LCM may not match. For example, suppose we have a_u = 2 and a_v = 4. Their product is 8. Suppose the given GCD is 2 and LCM is 4. Then 2*4 = 8, which matches. However, if the given GCD was 1, then it's impossible. Because GCD(2,4) is 2, not 1.\n\nTherefore, the equation a_u * a_v = p is necessary but not sufficient. We also need to ensure that the actual GCD and LCM of a_u and a_v are as given. So, how can we ensure that?\n\nSo, the problem is that even if the product is correct, the GCD and LCM may not match. Therefore, the approach of just ensuring the product is correct is not enough. We need to ensure that the GCD and LCM are correct.\n\nSo, back to the earlier approach where a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, with x and y coprime, and x * y = l/g.\n\nThis gives us that the product is g * x * g * y = g² * x y = g² * (l/g) ) = g*l, which matches the required product. Therefore, if we can assign x and y for each edge such that x and y are coprime and their product is l/g, then the product condition is satisfied, and the GCD and LCM are also satisfied.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning x and y for each edge, which are coprime and multiply to k = l/g, and ensuring that these assignments are consistent with the rest of the graph.\n\nBut how can we do this?\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where each edge has a certain k = l/g, and for each edge, the two nodes must be assigned x and y such that x*y =k and gcd(x,y) = 1. However, since the same node can be part of multiple edges, the assignments must be consistent.\n\nThis seems like a problem where each node's value is a product of some factors, but with constraints that they are coprime with their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a graph where each node's value is determined by a product of certain primes, but this seems too vague.\n\nAnother idea: For each connected component, we can model the relationships between nodes as a graph where each edge enforces that the ratio between the two nodes' values is a certain fraction. For example, if a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y, then the ratio a_u / a_v = x/y. Since x and y are coprime, this ratio is in reduced form. Therefore, for each edge, we can represent the ratio between the two nodes as x/y. However, this ratio depends on the choice of x and y for that edge. But since x and y are coprime and their product is k, the possible ratios are determined by the factors of k.\n\nBut how to choose x and y for each edge such that the ratios are consistent across the entire graph?\n\nThis feels like a problem where we need to assign variables to the nodes, and for each edge, assign a ratio between the two nodes. However, the choice of x and y for each edge is constrained by the fact that their product is k and they are coprime.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we have an edge between u and v with k=6 (so l/g=6). The possible (x,y) pairs are (1,6), (6,1), (2,3), (3,2). All of these pairs are coprime. So for this edge, the ratio between a_u and a_v could be 1/6, 6/1, 2/3, or 3/2. Depending on which pair is chosen.\n\nBut if this edge is part of a larger graph, the choice of ratio must be compatible with other edges connected to u and v.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a system of equations where each equation is a ratio between two variables, but the variables are constrained to certain possible ratios.\n\nBut solving such a system is non-trivial. How can we approach this?\n\nPerhaps, for each connected component, we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal, and for each node, assign a value based on the ratios determined by the edges. However, the challenge is choosing the correct ratios for each edge.\n\nLet me think of a way to assign the values. Suppose we pick a starting node and assign it a value. Then, for each edge connected to it, we can choose x and y such that the value of the adjacent node is determined. However, the choice of x and y for each edge must be made in a way that ensures consistency with future edges.\n\nBut how to choose x and y for each edge?\n\nLet me think again of the relationship between the two nodes. For an edge between u and v with k = l/g, we have a_u * a_v = g * l. Also, a_u and a_v must be multiples of g. So, let's define a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y. Then, x * y = k, and gcd(x, y) = 1.\n\nTherefore, x and y are coprime divisors of k, such that their product is k. So, for each edge, the possible pairs (x, y) are pairs of coprime integers whose product is k. These pairs are (d, k/d) where d is a divisor of k and gcd(d, k/d) = 1.\n\nSo for each edge, we can choose one of these pairs. However, the choice must be consistent with the rest of the graph.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each connected component, we can build a graph where each node's value is determined relative to the starting node. For example, during a BFS traversal, we can assign a value to each node based on the edges. However, the problem is that for each edge, there are multiple possible choices of x and y, and the choice affects the rest of the graph.\n\nBut perhaps, for each edge, there's only one possible way to assign the ratio once the value of one node is known.\n\nFor example, suppose during BFS traversal, we have a node u with value a_u. When we process an edge between u and v, we can compute a_v as (g * l) / a_u. But this requires that a_v is a multiple of g, and that the GCD of a_u and a_v is g. But how do we ensure that?\n\nWait, let's think again. Suppose that during the traversal, we have a_u. Then, for the edge between u and v, the product a_u * a_v must be equal to g * l. Therefore, a_v = (g*l)/a_u. However, this a_v must be such that GCD(a_u, a_v) = g, and LCM(a_u, a_v) = l.\n\nBut how can we ensure that?\n\nWell, since a_u is a multiple of g (because for any edge connected to u, a_u must be a multiple of the GCD of that edge), then a_v must be a multiple of g as well. Because:\n\na_v = (g*l)/a_u. Since a_u is a multiple of g, say a_u = g * x. Then a_v = (g*l)/(g*x) = l/(x). But l must be a multiple of g (as checked earlier). Also, since x * y = l/g, then y = (l/g)/x. Therefore, a_v = g * y. Which is a multiple of g. So this works.\n\nBut then, what about the GCD and LCM? Let's see:\n\nGiven that a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y, with x * y = l/g and gcd(x, y) = 1. Then, the GCD of a_u and a_v is g * gcd(x, y) = g * 1 = g. And the LCM is g * x * y = g * (l/g) = l. So yes, this satisfies the conditions.\n\nTherefore, if during the traversal, we assign a_v as (g*l)/a_u, then the GCD and LCM conditions will be satisfied, provided that a_u is a multiple of g, and that the product a_u * a_v equals g*l.\n\nBut how do we ensure that a_u is a multiple of g? Because for each edge connected to u, the a_u must be a multiple of the GCD of that edge. So during traversal, when we assign a value to a node, it must be compatible with all edges connected to it.\n\nBut how can we ensure that?\n\nLet me think of the traversal approach. Suppose we have a connected component. We pick a starting node, say u. We assign it a value. But what value? Well, the value must be compatible with all edges connected to u. However, since u is the starting node, we have no information yet. So perhaps we can assign it a value that is compatible with the first edge.\n\nBut this seems tricky. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\nInput: 1 0 → Output: YES 1. Since there are no edges, any value is allowed. But the problem says that the numbers on the roads were no less than 1. But since there are no roads, the answer is possible. So the code should output 1.\n\nSample 2:\nInput: 2 1 → the road is between 1 and 2, GCD 1, LCM 3. So for this edge, k = 3/1 = 3. So x and y are coprime and multiply to 3. Possible pairs are (1,3) and (3,1). So a_1 = 1 * 1 = 1, a_2 = 1 * 3 = 3. Or vice versa. Either way, the answer is valid. So output is YES 1 3.\n\nSo during traversal, if I pick a starting node, say node 1, assign it a value. Let's say for the first edge between 1 and 2, the product is 1*3=3. So a_1 * a_2 = 1 * 3 = 3. So if I assign a_1 = 1, then a_2 = 3. Or if I assign a_1 = 3, then a_2 = 1. Either is acceptable. So during traversal, once I assign the value to the first node, the rest can be computed.\n\nBut how do I choose the initial value for the starting node? Because if I assign it a value that is not compatible with other edges, it might cause problems.\n\nBut how can I choose the initial value? Well, for the first edge connected to the starting node, the value must be a multiple of the GCD of that edge. For example, if the first edge has GCD g, then the value of the starting node must be a multiple of g. But how can I choose that value?\n\nWait, the value of the starting node can be set as g * x, where x is part of the pair (x, y) for that edge. But since x and y are coprime, and x*y = k, then x can be any divisor of k that is coprime with k/x.\n\nBut how can I choose x?\n\nIn this case, perhaps the problem is that there's a degree of freedom in the initial assignment. However, for the traversal to work, once I assign a value to the starting node, I can compute the values of the other nodes based on the edges.\n\nBut what if during the traversal, I encounter a contradiction?\n\nFor example, suppose a node has two edges leading to it, and the computed values from each edge are inconsistent.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we have a graph with nodes 1-2-3, and edges:\n\nEdge 1-2: GCD=1, LCM=6 → k=6. So possible pairs (1,6), (2,3), etc.\n\nEdge 2-3: GCD=1, LCM=6 → same k=6.\n\nSuppose during traversal, I start at node 1, assign it value 1. Then for edge 1-2, a_2 = (1*6)/1 = 6. Then for edge 2-3, a_3 = (1*6)/6 = 1. Now, check if this assignment works.\n\na_1 =1, a_2=6, a_3=1. Check edge 1-2: GCD(1,6)=1, LCM=6. Correct. Edge 2-3: GCD(6,1)=1, LCM=6. Correct. So this is valid.\n\nBut what if during traversal, I had chosen a different pair for the first edge. Suppose for edge 1-2, I chose x=2 and y=3. Then a_1 would be 1*2 = 2? Wait, no. Wait, in this case, the edge between 1 and 2 has GCD=1 and LCM=6. So for that edge, a_1 and a_2 must be multiples of 1 (which they are). And their product is 1*6=6. So if I assign a_1 = 2, then a_2 = 6/2 = 3. Which is valid. Then, for the edge 2-3, a_3 would be 6/3 = 2. Then a_3 is 2. Check edge 2-3: a_2=3, a_3=2. GCD(3,2)=1, LCM=6. Correct. So this is also valid.\n\nSo the choice of initial value for the starting node can vary, but the rest of the assignments follow from that. However, the problem is that for the starting node, there may be multiple possible values that are compatible with the edges connected to it. How can we choose one of them?\n\nBut perhaps during the traversal, the starting node's value can be set arbitrarily, as long as it is compatible with the first edge. However, this may not be possible if there are multiple edges connected to the starting node.\n\nWait, but for the starting node, if it has multiple edges, then the value must be compatible with all of them. How?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose node 1 is connected to node 2 and node 3. Edge 1-2 has GCD g1 and LCM l1, and edge 1-3 has GCD g2 and LCM l2. Then, the value of node 1 must be a multiple of both g1 and g2. So the value of node 1 must be a multiple of LCM(g1, g2). But how can we choose it?\n\nBut during the traversal, we can't know what that value is. So perhaps the approach is to assign a value to the starting node that is compatible with the first edge, and then during the traversal, check for consistency with other edges.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value of the starting node can be set to g * x, where x is a divisor of k for the first edge. But how to choose x?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps the way to proceed is to model this as a graph where each node's value is determined as a product of the GCD of the edge and some variable, and then during traversal, assign variables based on the edges.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let me think again about the initial approach of setting the value of the starting node to g * x, and then propagating the values through the edges.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose during BFS traversal, when visiting a node u, for each neighbor v connected by an edge with GCD g and LCM l, we can compute a_v = (g * l) / a_u. However, this requires that a_u is a multiple of g, and that a_v is a multiple of g. Also, after computing a_v, we must check that for the edge between u and v, the GCD of a_u and a_v is indeed g, and the LCM is l. However, earlier analysis shows that this is guaranteed if a_u and a_v are computed as (g*l)/a_u and a_u is a multiple of g.\n\nWait, earlier analysis said that if a_u is a multiple of g, then a_v is (g*l)/a_u, which is g * y, where y is a divisor of k = l/g, and x * y = k. Therefore, the GCD and LCM conditions are automatically satisfied.\n\nBut how can we ensure that a_u is a multiple of g for all edges connected to u?\n\nBecause during the traversal, when we assign a_u, we have to ensure that for every edge connected to u, the value of a_u is a multiple of the GCD of that edge.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems to be a problem. For example, suppose node u is connected to two edges. One edge has GCD g1, and another has GCD g2. Then, the value of u must be a multiple of both g1 and g2. So, during traversal, if the initial assignment of u's value is not a multiple of both, then the other edges would not be satisfied.\n\nBut how can we ensure that during the traversal?\n\nThis suggests that the initial value assigned to the starting node must be compatible with all edges connected to it. However, during traversal, the starting node's value is determined based on the first edge. This may not be compatible with other edges connected to it.\n\nSo, for example, suppose the starting node is connected to two edges. The first edge has GCD g1, and the second has GCD g2. If during traversal, we assign the starting node's value based on the first edge, it may not be compatible with the second edge.\n\nThis seems like a problem. How can we resolve this?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose node 1 is connected to node 2 with GCD 2 and LCM 6 (so k = 6/2 = 3). And node 1 is also connected to node 3 with GCD 3 and LCM 9 (k = 9/3 = 3). So for the first edge, a_1 * a_2 = 2 * 6 = 12. For the second edge, a_1 * a_3 = 3 * 9 = 27.\n\nNow, during traversal, suppose I start at node 1 and assign it a value based on the first edge. Let's say I choose x=1 and y=3 for the first edge. Then a_1 = 2 * 1 = 2. Then a_2 = (2 * 6)/2 = 6. Now, for the second edge, a_1 is 2. The product a_1 * a_3 must be 3 * 9 = 27. So a_3 = 27 / 2. Which is not an integer. Therefore, this assignment is invalid. Hence, the problem arises.\n\nBut why did this happen? Because the value of node 1 (2) is not compatible with the second edge's GCD (3). Because a_1 must be a multiple of 3 for that edge. However, 2 is not a multiple of 3. Hence, this assignment is invalid.\n\nSo, the problem is that during the traversal, the initial assignment of the starting node's value must be compatible with all edges connected to it. But how can we ensure that?\n\nThis suggests that the initial assignment of the starting node's value must be a multiple of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. But how can we find such a value?\n\nIn this example, the starting node's value must be a multiple of 2 (from first edge) and 3 (from second edge). So the value must be a multiple of LCM(2,3) = 6. So, for example, if we assign a_1 = 6, then for the first edge, a_2 = (2*6)/6 = 2. Which is a multiple of 2. For the second edge, a_3 = 27 / 6 = 4.5, which is not valid. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the product for the second edge is g*l = 3 * 9 = 27. So a_1 * a_3 = 27. If a_1 is 6, then a_3 = 27 / 6 = 4.5, which is not an integer. Hence, this is invalid.\n\nSo even though a_1 is a multiple of both 2 and 3, it's still invalid. Why?\n\nBecause for the second edge, the product a_1 * a_3 must be 3 * 9 = 27. But a_1 is 6, which is a multiple of 3. Then a_3 = 27 / 6 = 4.5, which is not an integer. Hence, this assignment is invalid.\n\nSo, this suggests that even if",
