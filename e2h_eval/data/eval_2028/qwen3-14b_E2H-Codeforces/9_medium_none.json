Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about selecting souvenirs with maximum total cost without exceeding a weight limit. The constraints are that n can be up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Each souvenir has a weight of 1, 2, or 3. Oh right, because the input says wi is between 1 and 3. So that's an important point. \n\nSo the standard knapsack approach might not work here because n is too big for a O(nm) solution. For example, if n is 1e5 and m is 3e5, then O(nm) would be 3e10 operations, which is way too slow. So we need a more optimized approach.\n\nLet me think. Since the weights are only 1, 2, 3, maybe we can group the items by their weight. Then, for each weight category, we can sort them in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight group, we can compute the prefix sums. Then, the problem becomes how to combine these groups optimally.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For example, suppose I have all items of weight 1, sorted by cost. Similarly for weight 2 and 3. Then, for each possible number of items taken from each group, I need to find the combination that maximizes the total cost without exceeding the weight limit.\n\nBut how do I do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, group all items by their weight. For each weight (1, 2, 3), sort the items in descending order of cost. Then compute the prefix sums for each group. For example, for weight 1, the prefix sum array will have the sum of top k items. Same for weight 2 and 3.\n\nOnce I have these prefix sums, I can try different combinations of taking some number of items from each group, such that the total weight is <= m.\n\nBut how to find the optimal combination?\n\nLet me think: since the weights are small (1,2,3), maybe we can iterate over the number of items taken from the weight 3 group, then for each possible number of 3s, compute how many 2s and 1s can be taken. But even that might be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each possible number of 3s, we can compute the remaining weight and then find the best combination of 2s and 1s. Let me think.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me consider that the maximum number of items for each weight group is limited.\n\nFor example, for weight 3, the maximum number of items you can take is m//3. Similarly for others.\n\nBut given that n is large, but the weight is small, perhaps we can process each group's prefix sums.\n\nLet me outline the approach:\n\nGroup all items into three lists: w1, w2, w3. Sort each list in descending order of cost. Compute prefix sums for each list. Let's call them pre1, pre2, pre3.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to choosing x items from w1, y items from w2, z items from w3, such that x*1 + y*2 + z*3 <= m. And maximize the sum pre1[x] + pre2[y] + pre3[z].\n\nBut how do I find x, y, z efficiently?\n\nAn alternative idea: for each possible number of 3s (z), we can compute the remaining weight and then find the best combination of 2s and 1s. But since the maximum possible z is up to m//3, which is 1e5 (since m is 3e5), but m can be 3e5, so m//3 is 1e5. For each z, we can iterate through possible y (number of 2s), but that might be expensive.\n\nWait, but for each z, the remaining weight is m - 3*z. Let's call that rem. Then, we need to choose y and x such that 2y +x <= rem. How to find the best combination of x and y?\n\nBut again, for each z, how do we find the best y and x? Well, for the remaining rem, we can try all possible y (number of 2s) and compute the maximum possible x (number of 1s) given that 2y +x <= rem. However, even that could be O(m) per z, which may be too slow.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute for the 2s and 1s. For example, for any given weight limit, what's the maximum sum of 1s and 2s?\n\nLet me think about how to compute that. Suppose I have a certain amount of weight left, say 'w'. How can I choose the best combination of 1s and 2s?\n\nWell, since the 2s are sorted in descending order, and the 1s are also sorted. So for a given w, the optimal approach is to take as many 2s as possible, then fill the rest with 1s. But perhaps not, because sometimes taking one less 2 and adding two 1s could be better.\n\nWait, but since the 2s are sorted, and the 1s are sorted, the optimal way is to take the maximum number of 2s possible, then take as many 1s as possible. However, perhaps there's a case where taking one less 2 and adding two 1s gives a better total. For example, if the next 2 is worse than two 1s. So to cover all possibilities, for each possible number of 2s (up to the maximum possible), we can check the corresponding number of 1s.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, for the 2s and 1s, for any possible weight limit, we can compute the best combination by considering all possible numbers of 2s (up to min(possible, len(w2)), and then take the maximum of (pre2[y] + pre1[remaining_weight - 2y]).\n\nBut for each possible y, we can compute that. However, for each z, the remaining weight is fixed. So for each z, the rem is known. Let's say rem = m - 3*z. Then, for this rem, we can compute the best combination of 2s and 1s.\n\nBut how to compute that quickly?\n\nThe maximum number of 2s possible for rem is y_max = min( len(w2), rem // 2 ). So for each possible y in 0 to y_max, we can compute the maximum possible x = min( len(w1), rem - 2*y ), and then take pre2[y] + pre1[x]. But trying all y from 0 to y_max for each z would be O(y_max) per z. If z can be up to 1e5, and y_max can be up to 1.5e5, this would be O(1e5 * 1.5e5) = 1.5e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThat's not feasible. So this approach is not efficient enough.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible number of 2s, precompute the best possible combination with 1s. But how?\n\nLet me think. For a given rem, the maximum number of 2s is y_max. For each possible y in 0 to y_max, we can take as many 1s as possible (rem - 2y). However, since the 1s are sorted, taking the first x items gives the maximum sum.\n\nBut for a given rem, the optimal choice of y is not obvious. However, perhaps for each possible rem, we can find the best combination by trying all possible y in a certain range around the maximum possible y. Because the optimal y is either the maximum possible, or one less, etc., but maybe not too far.\n\nWait, but how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for the 2s and 1s, we can precompute for all possible weight values up to m. But how?\n\nAnother approach: since the 2s and 1s can be combined optimally by taking as many 2s as possible and then filling with 1s, but sometimes it's better to take one less 2 and add two 1s. So for each possible weight limit, we can compute the best combination by checking the maximum between taking the maximum number of 2s and the maximum number of 2s minus 1, etc. But how many possibilities do we need to check?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the maximum number of 2s is y_max. Then, the best combination is either:\n\n- take y_max 2s and (rem - 2*y_max) 1s.\n\nOR\n\n- take y_max - 1 2s and (rem - 2*(y_max-1)) 1s.\n\nBecause if the next 2 is worse than two 1s, then taking one less 2 and adding two 1s is better. However, since the 2s are sorted in descending order, the cost of the y_max-th 2 is less than or equal to the cost of the previous ones. Similarly for the 1s.\n\nBut how do I know which option is better? Well, for the given rem, I can check both options. So for any rem, the best combination can be found by checking the maximum between taking y_max 2s and (rem - 2y_max) 1s, and taking y_max - 1 2s and (rem - 2(y_max-1)) 1s. Also, perhaps even taking y_max - 2, but I think that checking up to two possibilities would suffice. Because if the optimal is to take y_max - k, then comparing with y_max and y_max-1 would capture that.\n\nBut this is a heuristic. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose rem is 5. The maximum number of 2s is 2 (2*2=4). Then, the remaining is 1. So take 2 2s and 1 1s. Alternatively, take 1 2 and 3 1s. Which is better depends on the values. But if the third 1 is better than the second 2, then taking 1 2 and 3 1s is better. However, if the third 1 is worse than the second 2, then taking 2 2s is better. So, for this case, checking the two possibilities (y_max and y_max-1) would capture the best option.\n\nSo, perhaps for any rem, the optimal combination can be found by checking up to two possibilities for the number of 2s. That would reduce the computation for each rem to O(1) time.\n\nIf this holds, then the approach would be:\n\nFor a given rem, compute the maximum number of 2s possible (y_max). Then, check for y = y_max and y = y_max -1. For each of those y, compute the maximum possible x (the number of 1s) and calculate the sum. Take the maximum between them. Also, perhaps check y_max + 1? No, because y_max is the maximum possible. So for y_max, 2y_max <= rem. For y_max+1, 2(y_max+1) would be larger than rem. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo, for each rem, the maximum possible y is floor(rem / 2). Then, the possible candidates for y are y_max and y_max-1. Because for example, when rem is odd, taking y_max-1 2s leaves rem - 2(y_max-1) = rem - 2y_max + 2 = (rem - 2y_max) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 (if rem was 5, then y_max is 2, rem - 2y_max is 1, then 2y_max - 2 is 2*2 - 2 = 2, rem - 2(y_max - 1) = 5 - 2*1 = 3, so 3 1s).\n\nSo, for each rem, we can check two possibilities for y (the maximum possible and one less), and then compute the corresponding x (number of 1s) and take the maximum sum.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nSo putting this together, here's the plan:\n\n- Preprocess the 1s, 2s, 3s by sorting and computing prefix sums.\n\n- For each possible number of 3s (z), from 0 to max_z (which is min(len(w3), m//3)), compute the remaining weight rem = m - 3*z.\n\n- For this rem, compute the best combination of 2s and 1s as follows:\n\n   - Compute the maximum number of 2s possible, y_max = min( len(w2), rem // 2 )\n\n   - Check for y in [y_max, y_max - 1], but ensuring y >= 0.\n\n   - For each of these y values, compute x = min( len(w1), rem - 2*y )\n\n   - The total sum is pre2[y] + pre1[x]\n\n   - Take the maximum of these possibilities.\n\n- Keep track of the overall maximum sum across all z and their corresponding best 2s/1s combinations.\n\nBut wait, what if rem is negative? For example, if 3*z exceeds m. So in that case, we can't take that z. So for each z, we need to ensure that 3*z <= m. So z can range from 0 to max_z, where max_z is min( len(w3), m//3 )\n\nSo this approach would loop through all possible z (up to m//3, which is 3e5 /3 = 1e5). For each z, we process O(1) steps. So the total time would be O(1e5) * O(1) = acceptable.\n\nBut then, what about the case where rem is zero? Then, no 2s or 1s can be taken. So the code handles that.\n\nNow, what about the 3s? For each possible z, we take the first z items from the sorted w3 list (since they are sorted in descending order of cost). So the sum for the 3s is pre3[z].\n\nSo the overall maximum is the maximum over all possible z, and for each z, the sum pre3[z] + best_2_1_sum.\n\nNow, the steps are:\n\nGroup the items into three separate lists based on their weight. Sort each list in descending order of cost. Compute prefix sums for each list. Then, for each possible z (number of 3s), compute the remaining weight, and compute the best combination for 2s and 1s as described.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read n lines of wi and ci. Then, group them into three lists.\n\nFor example:\n\nw1 = list of all items with weight 1, sorted descending by cost.\n\nSimilarly for w2 and w3.\n\nThen, compute prefix sums for each list. The prefix sums for w1 would be pre1 where pre1[0] = 0, pre1[1] = w1[0], pre1[2] = w1[0]+w1[1], etc. Similarly for pre2 and pre3.\n\nOnce the prefix sums are computed, we can proceed.\n\nNow, for the 3s, the maximum possible z is min( len(w3), m // 3 )\n\nSo for z in 0 to max_z:\n\n   current_weight = 3*z\n\n   if current_weight > m: skip (but since z is up to m//3, this can't happen)\n\n   rem = m - 3*z\n\n   compute the best 2s and 1s for rem.\n\n   then, total = pre3[z] + best_2_1_sum\n\n   compare with the global maximum.\n\nBut how to compute best_2_1_sum?\n\nAs discussed, for rem, compute y_max = min( len(w2), rem // 2 )\n\nThen, for y in [y_max, y_max-1], and possibly y_max-2 (but I think checking two options is sufficient).\n\nWait, but what if rem is 3, and the best is to take 1 2 and 1 1. Or take 0 2s and 3 1s. Which is better? So, for y_max = 1 (since 3//2=1). Then, check y=1 and y=0.\n\nSo, in code, for the possible y values, we can check y_max and y_max-1, but need to make sure that y is not negative.\n\nSo, for each rem:\n\nmax_y = min( len(w2), rem // 2 )\n\ncandidates for y are max_y and max_y - 1. But also, if max_y is 0, then max_y-1 is -1, which is invalid. So in code, we can generate all possible y in the range [max(0, max_y - 1), max_y], and check those.\n\nSo for each rem, we can generate y_candidates = [max_y, max_y -1], but filter out those that are negative.\n\nFor each y_candidate in y_candidates:\n\n   if y_candidate is >=0 and <= len(w2):\n\n      then, the weight used by 2s is 2*y_candidate.\n\n      remaining_weight_1 = rem - 2*y_candidate\n\n      x = min( len(w1), remaining_weight_1 )\n\n      sum_2_1 = pre2[y_candidate] + pre1[x]\n\n      keep track of the maximum sum_2_1.\n\nSo, for each rem, this gives us the best combination of 2s and 1s.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1 1\n\n2 1\n\nSo n=1, m=1. The item has weight 2 and cost 1. Since the total weight is 1, which is less than 2, Petya can't take it. So output is 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo items are (1,3) and (2,2). m=2. The possible options:\n\nTake the first item (weight 1, cost 3). Total weight 1, cost 3.\n\nOr take the second item (weight 2, cost 2). Total cost 2. So maximum is 3. Which matches sample output.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n4 3\n\n3 10\n\n2 7\n\n2 8\n\n1 1\n\nSo items are:\n\nitem 1: weight 3, cost 10\n\nitem 2: weight 2, cost7\n\nitem3: weight 2, cost8\n\nitem4: weight 1, cost1.\n\nGrouping:\n\nw1: [1]\n\nw2: [8,7] (sorted descending)\n\nw3: [10]\n\npre1: [0, 1]\n\npre2: [0, 8, 8+7=15]\n\npre3: [0, 10]\n\nNow, for possible z values:\n\nz can be 0 or 1 (since m=3, 3//3=1, and len(w3) is 1).\n\nCase z=0: rem =3.\n\nFor rem=3:\n\nmax_y = min( len(w2)=2, 3//2=1 ) → 1.\n\nCheck y=1 and y=0.\n\nFor y=1: 2*1=2. rem -2y = 3-2=1. x is min(1,1) =1. sum_2_1 = pre2[1]=8 + pre1[1]=1 → total 9.\n\nFor y=0: rem is 3. x=3, but len(w1) is 1. So x=1. sum_2_1 is 0 +1=1. So maximum is 9. So total for this case is pre3[0] (0) +9=9.\n\nCase z=1: rem=3-3*1=0. So rem=0. So no 2s or 1s. sum_2_1 is 0. total is pre3[1] (10) + 0 =10. So the maximum is 10. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach works here.\n\nAnother test case: when rem is 5. Suppose the 2s are [5,4,3], and 1s are [2,1]. Then for rem=5:\n\nmax_y = 5//2=2. So y=2, which uses 4 weight, leaving 1. Take x=1 (cost 2). sum is 5+4 +2 = 11.\n\nAlternatively, y=1 (uses 2, rem 3). Take x=3 (but len(w1) is 2, so x=2, sum 5 + (2+1) = 5+3=8. So 5+4+2=11 is better. But if the 1s were [3, 2], then for x=3, but len(w1) is 2, so x=2. sum is 5+4 +3+2= 14? Wait, no. Wait, the pre1 is the prefix sum. For x=2, pre1[2] is 3+2=5. So for y=2, sum is pre2[2] (5+4=9) + pre1[1] (3) → total 12. For y=1, pre2[1] (5) + pre1[3-2*1=3 → x= min(2,3) → 2 → pre1[2] is 5 → total 5+5=10. So in this case, the maximum is 12.\n\nBut suppose the 2s are [5, 4], and the 1s are [3, 2, 1]. So for rem=5:\n\ny_max = 2 (5//2=2). So 2*2=4. rem -4 =1. x=1 (sum 3). total is 5+4 +3= 12.\n\nAlternatively, y=1, rem-2*1=3. x=3 (sum 3+2+1=6). So total is 5 +6=11. So the first option is better.\n\nBut if the 2s are [5, 1], and the 1s are [3, 2, 1]. Then for y_max=2, the sum of 2s is 5+1=6. rem-4=1, sum of 1s is 3. total 9. For y=1, sum of 2s is 5. rem-2 is 3. sum of 1s is 3+2+1=6. total is 5+6=11. Which is better. So in this case, the code checks both y=2 and y=1, finds the maximum between 9 and 11. So the code would capture the better option.\n\nThus, checking the two possible y values seems sufficient.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement grouping, sorting, prefix sums.\n\nNow, for Python, since n can be up to 1e5, and m up to 3e5, the code needs to handle that efficiently.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, split into wi and ci.\n\nGroup into three lists:\n\nw1, w2, w3.\n\nSort each list in descending order of cost.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each.\n\nFor example:\n\npre1 = [0]\n\nfor i in range(len(w1)):\n\n    pre1.append( pre1[-1] + w1[i] )\n\nSame for pre2 and pre3.\n\nOnce that is done, iterate over possible z values.\n\nBut for z, the maximum possible is min( len(w3), m //3 )\n\nBut for each z, we need to take the first z items from w3, which is pre3[z].\n\nSo, the code can loop z from 0 to max_z:\n\nmax_z = min( len(w3), m // 3 )\n\nfor z in 0 ... max_z:\n\n   rem = m - 3*z\n\n   compute the best 2s and 1s for rem.\n\n   total = pre3[z] + best_2_1_sum\n\n   update the global maximum.\n\nBut how to compute best_2_1_sum for rem?\n\nImplementing the code for that part:\n\ndef get_best_2_1(rem, pre1, pre2, len1, len2):\n\n    max_y = min( len2, rem // 2 )\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    # check y = max_y and y = max_y -1\n\n    for y in [max_y, max_y -1]:\n\n        if y < 0:\n\n            continue\n\n        # compute x\n\n        weight_used_by_2 = 2 * y\n\n        remaining = rem - weight_used_by_2\n\n        x = min( len1, remaining )\n\n        current_sum = pre2[y] + pre1[x]\n\n        if current_sum > max_val:\n\n            max_val = current_sum\n\n    return max_val\n\nBut also, what if rem is zero? Then, y can be zero, and x is zero. Which is handled.\n\nBut also, what if rem is larger than 2 * len2? Like, rem is 100, and len2 is 5. Then, max_y is 5 (if 100//2=50, but len2 is 5. So max_y is 5. Then, for y=5, the weight_used_by_2 is 10, rem -10 is 90. x is min(len1, 90). So that's handled.\n\nSo, this function should return the best combination.\n\nNow, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, edge cases to consider:\n\n- All items have weight 3, and m is 3. Take one item.\n\n- Some items have weight 1, but m is 0. Output is 0.\n\n- When rem is 0, then the 2s and 1s can't contribute anything.\n\nAnother edge case: when the rem is not enough to take any 2s. For example, rem=1. Then, max_y is 0, and check y=0 and -1. Only y=0 is considered. So x is 1.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut for the prefix sums, we need to make sure that the pre arrays are properly built. For example, if the list is empty, then pre1 is [0], and for any x, min(len1, ...) is 0.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nw1 = []\nw2 = []\nw3 = []\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    wi, ci = map(int, input().split())\n    if wi == 1:\n        w1.append(ci)\n    elif wi == 2:\n        w2.append(ci)\n    else:\n        w3.append(ci)\n\nSort each list in descending order.\n\nw1.sort(reverse=True)\nw2.sort(reverse=True)\nw3.sort(reverse=True)\n\nCompute prefix sums:\n\npre1 = [0]\nfor c in w1:\n    pre1.append(pre1[-1] + c)\n\npre2 = [0]\nfor c in w2:\n    pre2.append(pre2[-1] + c)\n\npre3 = [0]\nfor c in w3:\n    pre3.append(pre3[-1] + c)\n\nThen, compute the max_total.\n\nInitialize max_total = 0\n\nmax_z = min( len(w3), m // 3 )\n\nfor z in range(0, max_z + 1):\n\n    current_weight_3 = 3 * z\n\n    if current_weight_3 > m:\n        continue  # but since z is up to m//3, this is not possible.\n\n    rem = m - current_weight_3\n\n    # compute best for 2 and 1.\n\n    len1 = len(pre1) - 1  # since pre1 starts with 0, and has len(w1)+1 elements.\n    len2 = len(pre2) - 1\n\n    max_y = min( len2, rem // 2 )\n\n    best_2_1 = 0\n\n    for y in [max_y, max_y -1]:\n        if y < 0:\n            continue\n        # compute x\n        weight_2 = 2 * y\n        rem_after_2 = rem - weight_2\n        x = min( len1, rem_after_2 )\n        current_sum = pre2[y] + pre1[x]\n        if current_sum > best_2_1:\n            best_2_1 = current_sum\n\n    total = pre3[z] + best_2_1\n    if total > max_total:\n        max_total = total\n\nreturn max_total\n\nWait, but in the code, for the variables len1 and len2, they are len(w1) and len(w2), since pre1 has len(w1)+1 elements. So len(pre1)-1 is len(w1). So yes.\n\nBut in the code, len1 is len(w1), len2 is len(w2).\n\nBut in code:\n\nlen1 = len(pre1) - 1 → which is len(w1). Similarly for len2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code, for example, if rem_after_2 is 5, and len1 is 3 (so there are 3 items in w1), then x is 3.\n\nSo this is correct.\n\nNow, let's test this code against the sample input 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, m=2.\n\nitems:\n\n1 3 → w1\n\n2 2 → w2.\n\nSo:\n\nw1 = [3], sorted → [3]\n\npre1 = [0, 3]\n\nw2 = [2], sorted → [2]\n\npre2 = [0, 2]\n\nw3 is empty.\n\nmax_z is min(0, 2//3=0) → 0. So z can be 0.\n\nrem = 2 - 0 =2.\n\nmax_y is min(1, 2//2=1) →1.\n\ncheck y=1 and 0.\n\nFor y=1:\n\nweight_2 = 2*1=2. rem_after_2 = 0. x = min(1, 0) → 0. sum is pre2[1] (2) + pre1[0] (0) → 2.\n\nFor y=0: rem_after_2 is 2. x = min(1,2) →1. sum is pre2[0] (0) + pre1[1] (3) →3. So best_2_1 is 3. total is pre3[0] (0) +3 →3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case.\n\nAnother edge case: when rem is 0. Then, the code returns 0.\n\nAnother case: when there are no items of weight 1 or 2.\n\nBut the code handles that.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut what about when the rem is larger than the maximum possible 2s and 1s? For example, rem is 100, but there are only 5 items in w2 and 10 items in w1. The code would take all 5 2s (using 10 weight) and then take 90 1s (but only 10 available). So x is 10. Which is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the loops, in Python, for z in range(0, max_z + 1):\n\nBut for len(w3) could be larger than m//3. For example, if m is 3, and there are 5 items of weight 3. Then, max_z is min(5, 3//3=1) →1. So z ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nNow, the code is correct.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut note that in Python, for very large n (like 1e5), building the lists and sorting them may take O(n log n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead the input. But note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, no. The problem says that the input is given as per the first line, then n lines. But looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows three test cases, but the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m.\n\nThen n lines follow.\n\nSo the code is supposed to read one test case. But the sample input shows three different test cases, but the outputs are given as three different outputs. But that's probably because the user provided multiple examples. However, the code must read from stdin once, and output once.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of three inputs, but that's just for example. The actual code must read from stdin once. So the code must read n and m, then n lines of wi and ci.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the user provided three different test cases. But in practice, the code must process one test case.\n\nSo the code must read from stdin once.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    m = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n\n    w1 = []\n    w2 = []\n    w3 = []\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n        wi = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        ci = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        if wi ==1:\n            w1.append(ci)\n        elif wi ==2:\n            w2.append(ci)\n        else:\n            w3.append(ci)\n\n    # sort and compute prefix sums\n    w1.sort(reverse=True)\n    w2.sort(reverse=True)\n    w3.sort(reverse=True)\n\n    pre1 = [0]\n    for c in w1:\n        pre1.append(pre1[-1] + c)\n\n    pre2 = [0]\n    for c in w2:\n        pre2.append(pre2[-1] + c)\n\n    pre3 = [0]\n    for c in w3:\n        pre3.append(pre3[-1] + c)\n\n    max_total = 0\n\n    max_z = min( len(w3), m //3 )\n\n    len1 = len(w1)\n    len2 = len(w2)\n\n    for z in range(0, max_z +1):\n        rem = m - 3*z\n        # compute best for 2 and 1\n        max_y = min( len2, rem //2 )\n        best_2_1 = 0\n        # check y = max_y and max_y-1\n        for y in [max_y, max_y -1]:\n            if y <0:\n                continue\n            weight_2 = 2 * y\n            rem_after_2 = rem - weight_2\n            x = min( len1, rem_after_2 )\n            current_sum = pre2[y] + pre1[x]\n            if current_sum > best_2_1:\n                best_2_1 = current_sum\n        total = pre3[z] + best_2_1\n        if total > max_total:\n            max_total = total\n\n    print(max_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code above, for the case when rem is 0, then rem_after_2 is 0. So x is min(len1, 0) →0. So pre1[0] is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother thing: for the case where rem is 0, but there are items in 2s and 1s. But since rem is zero, the code will take y=0, and x=0. So sum is 0.\n\nAnother possible optimization: when rem is zero, the best_2_1 is zero. So no need to compute. But the code already does that.\n\nNow, testing the sample input 2:\n\nSample input 2 is:\n\n2 2\n\n1 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich would be parsed as n=2, m=2. The items are (1,3) and (2,2). The code groups them into w1 = [3], w2 = [2], w3 is empty.\n\npre1 is [0,3], pre2 [0,2], pre3 [0].\n\nmax_z is min(0, 2//3=0) →0. So z=0.\n\nrem is 2.\n\nmax_y is min(1, 2//2=1) →1.\n\nCheck y=1 and 0.\n\nFor y=1: rem_after_2 is 2 - 2*1 =0. x= min(1, 0) →0. current_sum = pre2[1] (2) + pre1[0] (0) →2.\n\nFor y=0: rem_after_2 is 2. x is min(1,2) →1. sum is pre2[0] (0) + pre1[1] (3) →3. So best_2_1 is 3. total is 0 +3=3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case where rem is 5, and the code checks y_max and y_max-1.\n\nBut the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple items of weight 3?\n\nFor example, m=6, and there are two items of weight 3 with cost 10 and 9. Then, taking",
