Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm, so the standard knapsack approach won't work here because the m is too big for O(nm) time. So I need a more efficient method.\n\nLet me think. Since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe I can handle each weight category separately. For example, for items of weight 1, I can take as many as possible, but since they have different costs, I should sort them in descending order of cost and take the top ones. Same for weight 2 and 3. But how do I combine them optimally?\n\nWait, the problem is similar to the unbounded knapsack but with limited items. But since each item is unique, it's the 0-1 knapsack problem. However, the standard 0-1 knapsack is O(nm) which would be 3e11 operations here, which is impossible.\n\nSo, given the weights are only 1, 2, 3, perhaps we can find a way to process each group and compute the best combination.\n\nLet me think about grouping the items by their weight. Let's say:\n\n- Group 1: all items with weight 1.\n- Group 2: all items with weight 2.\n- Group 3: all items with weight 3.\n\nFor each group, I can sort them in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, I can precompute prefix sums. For example, for group 1, the prefix sum array will tell me the maximum cost if I take k items from group 1.\n\nOnce I have these prefix sums, I can try all possible combinations of taking some items from each group, such that the total weight is <= m.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the optimal combination?\n\nLet me think. Let's denote:\n\n- For weight 1, let's take x items. Each contributes 1 weight and their cost is the sum of the top x items.\n- Similarly for weight 2, take y items (each contributes 2 weight).\n- For weight 3, take z items (each contributes 3 weight).\n\nThe total weight is x*1 + y*2 + z*3 ≤ m. And we want to maximize the sum of their costs.\n\nBut trying all possible x, y, z is not feasible. However, since the groups are sorted, maybe we can iterate through one of the variables and compute the others.\n\nBut even that might be computationally heavy. Let's think of possible approaches.\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider that for each possible number of weight 3 items taken, and weight 2 items taken, we can compute the remaining capacity and take as many weight 1 items as possible. But even that might be O(k^2), where k is the number of items in each group.\n\nBut considering that the maximum number of items in each group could be up to 1e5, but with m up to 3e5, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: since the weight is small (only 1, 2, 3), we can handle the problem by considering the following steps:\n\n1. Sort each group by cost in descending order and compute prefix sums.\n\n2. For each possible number of weight 3 items (z), and for each possible number of weight 2 items (y), compute how much weight is left, then take as many weight 1 items as possible. However, even this approach may be too slow if done naively.\n\nBut perhaps we can limit the number of possibilities for each group. For example, for group 3, the maximum number of items we can take is min(m // 3, len(group3)). Similarly for group 2.\n\nBut even then, if group3 has up to 1e5 items, iterating over all possible z would be O(1e5), and same for group2. Then for each pair (z, y), we'd have O(1e5 * 1e5) = 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nHmm, that's not feasible. So we need a better way.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible number of weight 3 items (z), and for each possible number of weight 2 items (y), but instead of iterating all pairs, we can precompute for each possible total weight allocated to group3 and group2, then compute the best possible for group1.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's first process group 1, group 2, group 3.\n\nLet me think about the following steps:\n\n- Precompute the prefix sums for each group.\n\nThen, for group3, we can try all possible numbers of items taken (z) from 0 to max_z (which is min(len(group3), m//3)).\n\nFor each z, the weight used is 3*z. Then, the remaining weight is m - 3*z. Now, for this remaining weight, we need to choose between group1 and group2 items.\n\nNow, how to optimally choose group2 and group1 items for the remaining weight.\n\nThis is similar to a classic problem where you have two groups (weight 1 and 2), and you want to maximize the value given a certain capacity.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a capacity W. We can take some number of group2 items (y) and group1 items (x), such that 2*y + x ≤ W. We need to maximize the sum of their prefix sums.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly for any W.\n\nOne approach is to precompute for group2's prefix sums and then, for each possible y, compute the maximum x possible. However, again, this could be O(W) for each z.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for the remaining capacity W, we can try all possible y (number of group2 items) up to min(len(group2), W//2), and for each y, take x = W - 2*y (but not exceeding the number of group1 items). However, this would be O(W) per z, which could be expensive.\n\nBut given that W can be up to m (3e5), and z can be up to 1e5 (if group3 has 1e5 items), this would be O(3e5 * 1e5) = 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo this approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For the group2 and group1 combination, precompute for each possible weight w (up to m) the maximum value achievable by combining group1 and group2 items. Then, for each z, the remaining weight is W = m - 3*z, and we can just look up the precomputed value for W.\n\nBut how to compute this precomputed array for group1 and group2?\n\nLet me think. Let's call this dp2[w] = maximum value achievable with weight w using group1 and group2 items.\n\nHow to compute dp2?\n\nWell, group1 has items of weight 1, group2 has items of weight 2. So for each possible weight, we can take some number of group1 and group2 items.\n\nBut since group1 and group2 are sorted, we can compute for each possible number of group2 items, and then take as many group1 items as possible.\n\nWait, here's a way to compute dp2:\n\nFor a given capacity W, the optimal way is to take as many group2 items as possible (since each has higher weight, but maybe not higher value per unit weight), but since the items are sorted, maybe for each possible number of group2 items, we can compute the maximum.\n\nBut again, for each W, this could be O(W) time.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea. Since group2 items are sorted, for each possible number of group2 items (y), we can compute how much weight is left for group1 items (W - 2*y). Then, the maximum number of group1 items is min( (W - 2*y), len(group1) ). But how to find the best y for each W.\n\nBut for each W, the best y is between 0 and min( W//2, len(group2) ). However, trying all possible y for each W would be O(W) per W, which is O(W^2) overall. That's not feasible for W up to 3e5.\n\nHmm. So perhaps another approach is needed here.\n\nWait, but for group2, since the items are sorted in descending order, the prefix sum for group2 is also non-decreasing. Similarly for group1. So, for a given capacity W, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible y (number of group2 items taken) of (sum_group2[y] + sum_group1[x]), where x is min( (W - 2*y), len(group1) ), and x >= 0.\n\nBut how can we find the optimal y quickly?\n\nLet me think about for each possible W, what is the maximum possible sum.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor group2, the prefix sum array is s2, where s2[y] is the sum of the first y items. Similarly, for group1, the prefix sum is s1[x].\n\nSo, for a given W, the maximum value is the maximum of s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2*y, len(s1) ) ] for all y between 0 and min( W//2, len(s2) )\n\nBut how to find this maximum efficiently.\n\nLet me note that for each W, the value of y can be up to min( W//2, len(s2) ). Let's call this Y_max.\n\nBut if we can find for each W the best y in O(1) or O(log n) time, that would be great.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about varying y. For each y, the term is s2[y] + s1[ (W - 2y) ] (assuming W - 2y is non-negative and within the group1's length). But since group1's sum increases with x, for each y, the maximum x is min( W - 2y, len(s1) ), which is the maximum possible for that y.\n\nBut for each W, the optimal y is such that 2y is as large as possible, but not exceeding W, and also considering the sum of s2[y] and s1[W - 2y].\n\nBut how to find this y efficiently.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible y, the value of 2y can be up to W. So for each W, the possible y ranges from 0 to Y_max. Let me imagine that for each W, we can iterate y from 0 to Y_max, but that's O(W) time again.\n\nBut perhaps for each W, the optimal y is around (W - x)/2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that group2 items have higher weight per item, but maybe higher value. However, since we can't know that, perhaps the best approach is to precompute for all possible W up to m, the maximum value for group1 and group2.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the following approach for group1 and group2:\n\nFor group1 and group2, we can precompute for all possible weights up to m, the maximum value.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nWe can model this as a knapsack problem with two types of items: weight 1 and weight 2. However, since each item is unique (so 0-1 knapsack), but with the items grouped by their weight.\n\nBut again, for n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5, the standard dynamic programming approach would be O(m * (n1 + n2)), which is still O(3e5 * 1e5) = 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nHmm, but perhaps since the items are sorted, we can find a way to compute the maximum value for each weight in O(1) or O(log n) time.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose I have for group1, sorted in descending order. So the best x items are the first x items. Similarly for group2.\n\nSo, for a given capacity W, the optimal is to take some number of group2 items (say y) and then take as many group1 items as possible (x = W - 2y), but not exceeding the available group1 items.\n\nSo for each possible y, we can calculate the sum. But how to find the best y quickly.\n\nBut for each W, the maximum y can be up to min( W//2, len(group2) ). Let's denote that as Y_max.\n\nNow, for each W, we can iterate y from max(0, Y_max - K) to Y_max, where K is a small number (like 100), and pick the maximum. The idea is that for a given W, the optimal y is likely to be near the maximum possible y or near the point where 2y is as large as possible. Because group2 items are sorted, so taking more of them gives higher values.\n\nBut why would this work? Well, suppose that for a given W, the optimal y is either the maximum possible or close to it. For example, if taking y_max group2 items gives a certain value, but perhaps taking y_max - 1 allows taking more group1 items which could be better.\n\nBut how to know how many possibilities to check.\n\nAlternatively, since group2 items are sorted, the prefix sum s2[y] increases with y. However, when you take more group2 items, you have less weight left for group1 items. So there's a trade-off between the two.\n\nBut maybe for each W, the optimal y is in the range [max(0, Y_max - k), Y_max], where k is like 300. Since for each W, checking up to 300 possibilities would be manageable.\n\nBut how to choose k. Well, since the weight of group1 items is 1, and group2 is 2. Suppose that the best y is such that 2y is as close as possible to W. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each W, we can check all possible y where 2y is between W - k and W. For example, if k is 300, then for each W, we check up to 300 possibilities. Since the maximum W is 3e5, and for each W, 300 steps, this would be 3e5 * 300 = 9e7 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to decide k. Let's think: the maximum number of group1 items that can be replaced by group2 items. For example, if taking one less group2 item (y-1) gives 2 less weight, which can be used for two group1 items. So, if the value of those two group1 items is higher than the value of the group2 item, then it's better to take y-1 and add two group1 items.\n\nBut since group1 and group2 items are sorted, the first few items in group1 and group2 are the most valuable. So, perhaps the optimal y is in the vicinity of Y_max (the maximum possible y for group2) and checking a few hundred possibilities around that would cover the optimal case.\n\nBut how to choose k. Well, considering that the maximum weight for group1 items is 3e5, and each group1 item is 1 weight. If we check up to 300 possibilities, then even if we have to check for each W, it's manageable.\n\nThis seems like a viable approach.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Split the items into three groups based on their weight.\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost, and compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n3. For group3, iterate all possible z (number of items taken from group3), from 0 to min(len(group3), m//3). For each z, compute the remaining capacity W = m - 3*z. Then, compute the maximum value from group1 and group2 for this W.\n\n4. To compute the maximum value for group1 and group2 for W, we iterate possible y (number of group2 items) in a certain range around the maximum possible y (Y_max = min(W//2, len(group2))). For each such y, compute x = min(W - 2*y, len(group1)), and take the sum s2[y] + s1[x]. Keep track of the maximum value found.\n\nBut how to choose the range for y. For example, for each W, we can check y from max(0, Y_max - 300) to Y_max. Also, check y up to Y_max, but since Y_max can be up to 1.5e5 (for m=3e5), but with 300 steps per W, this would be manageable.\n\nBut why 300? Well, because for each W, the optimal y could be up to Y_max, and possibly Y_max-1, etc., but the exact number depends on the trade-off between group2 and group1 items. However, given that each group1 item is worth up to 1e9, but group2 items are also up to 1e9, but with 2 weight each, perhaps checking a few hundred possibilities is enough to capture the optimal solution.\n\nBut what if the optimal y is far away from Y_max? For example, if taking fewer group2 items allows taking more group1 items, which could be better. However, with the groups sorted, the prefix sums are non-decreasing, so the trade-off is that for each y, the loss in group2 is s2[y] - s2[y-1], while the gain in group1 is s1[x+2] - s1[x], where x = W - 2y. But since the group1 and group2 items are sorted, the first items are the best, so the trade-off would be between the next group2 item and two group1 items.\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, the optimal y is within a small range of Y_max. For example, if Y_max is the maximum number of group2 items possible, then checking up to 300 possibilities before and after Y_max would cover all possible cases where the optimal choice is not too far from the maximum possible.\n\nAlternatively, we can check all possible y up to min(Y_max, 300) and also check y from 0 to min(300, Y_max). But this may not be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the group1 and group2 items are sorted, for each W, the optimal y is the one that maximizes s2[y] + s1[min(W - 2y, len_s1)]. So, for a given W, the function f(y) = s2[y] + s1[W - 2y] is a function that may have a single peak. However, it's possible that it's not unimodal, but for practical purposes, checking a few hundred possibilities around Y_max would suffice.\n\nBut how to confirm this? Well, given that the problem is from programming competition, and given the time constraints, this approach might be the only feasible way.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFor each possible z (number of group3 items):\n\n   current_weight = 3*z\n\n   if current_weight > m: skip\n\n   remaining = m - current_weight\n\n   compute the best value from group1 and group2 for remaining weight.\n\n   total_value = value from group3 (s3[z]) + best value from group1 and group2.\n\n   keep track of the maximum total_value.\n\nSo, the key part is computing the best value for group1 and group2 for a given remaining weight.\n\nNow, how to implement that.\n\nLet me code this logic in mind.\n\nFirst, group the items:\n\ngroup1 = list of all items with weight 1, sorted descending, prefix sum.\n\nSimilarly for group2 and group3.\n\nThen, for each z in 0 to len(group3):\n\n   if 3*z > m: break\n\n   rem = m - 3*z\n\n   then compute the best value for rem using group1 and group2.\n\nBut how to compute that best value.\n\nSo, for rem, the maximum y is min(rem//2, len(group2)).\n\nLet me call this Y_max.\n\nThen, for y in range( max(0, Y_max - 300), Y_max + 1 ):\n\n   if y exceeds len(group2): continue\n\n   available_weight_for_group1 = rem - 2*y\n\n   x = min(available_weight_for_group1, len(group1))\n\n   current_sum = s2[y] + s1[x]\n\n   keep the maximum.\n\nBut also, what about y being less than Y_max - 300? For example, maybe the optimal y is lower than that. However, given that the group2 items are sorted, taking more group2 items is better (since they are sorted in descending order, adding more items gives higher sum). However, the available weight for group1 may decrease.\n\nBut for example, if Y_max is 1000, but the optimal y is 500. Then checking up to Y_max-300 would miss it. So this approach would fail.\n\nSo this approach may not be correct.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible rem, the optimal y can be found by considering that for each possible number of group2 items, the best x is the maximum possible. However, since the group2 items are sorted, and group1 items are sorted, the maximum value for group2 and group1 can be found by checking all possible y up to min(rem//2, len(group2)), but this would be O(rem) per z, which is too slow.\n\nBut given that rem can be up to 3e5, and z can be up to 1e5, this would be O(3e5 * 1e5) = 3e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nHmm. This is tricky.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of group1 and group2 as follows. For group2, each item takes 2 weight. For group1, each item takes 1 weight. Let's imagine that we can take any combination of group1 and group2 items, and for a given weight W, find the maximum value.\n\nLet me think about the following: for each possible number of group2 items taken, say y, then the maximum number of group1 items is x = W - 2y. However, since group1 is sorted, we can take the first x items (if x is positive). So, for a given W, the maximum is the maximum over all possible y (0 <= y <= Y_max) of s2[y] + s1[min(x, len1)], where x = W - 2y.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly.\n\nLet me consider that for each W, the optimal y is such that 2y is as large as possible, but also the sum of s2[y] and s1[W - 2y] is maximum.\n\nBut since s2[y] is increasing with y, and s1[W - 2y] is decreasing with y, the function f(y) is not necessarily monotonic. Hence, there could be multiple peaks.\n\nBut perhaps we can find the optimal y by binary search. However, I don't see an obvious way to do that.\n\nAnother idea: Since group2 items are sorted, and group1 items are sorted, the best y for a given W is such that the marginal value of adding a group2 item is higher than the marginal value of adding two group1 items. But how to find this point.\n\nAlternatively, for each W, the optimal number of group2 items y is in the range [y_low, y_high], where y_low = max(0, Y_max - k) and y_high = Y_max. But again, this is the same as before, and the question is choosing k.\n\nBut perhaps k can be set to 300, which would allow us to cover all possible cases where the optimal y is within 300 steps of Y_max. This is a heuristic, but given the time constraints, this might be the only way to proceed.\n\nLet me try to think of an example. Suppose group2 has items with very high cost, so taking as many as possible is optimal. In this case, the optimal y is Y_max, and checking that would be sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, suppose group1 has items that are much more valuable per unit weight than group2. For example, group2 items have cost 1 per item (so 1 per 2 weight units), and group1 items have cost 2 per item (so 2 per 1 weight unit). In this case, for a given W, it's better to take as many group1 items as possible. So, for W=5, taking 5 group1 items (cost 10) is better than taking 2 group2 items (cost 2) plus 1 group1 item (cost 2) for total 4.\n\nSo, for this case, the optimal y is 0, which is far from Y_max (which would be 2 for W=5). Thus, checking only y near Y_max would miss the optimal solution.\n\nBut in this case, the group2 items are not sorted in a way that makes taking them better. However, in our approach, group2 is sorted in descending order of cost, so if the group2 items have low cost, then taking them is worse than taking group1 items. Hence, the code would choose y=0, but how would that happen?\n\nAh, but the code would check y in the range [Y_max - 300 ... Y_max], which for W=5, Y_max=2. So checking y from 0 to 2. Which includes y=0. So the code would find that taking y=0 gives a better result.\n\nBut how would the code check y=0 if Y_max is 2 and we check from Y_max - 300 to Y_max. Well, since Y_max - 300 is negative, we start from 0. So yes, in this case, it would check all possible y.\n\nSo, the key is that for each W, we check all possible y from 0 to Y_max, but that would be O(Y_max) per W, which is too slow.\n\nBut what if we limit the number of y's checked to a fixed number, say 300, but in both directions. For example, check the top 300 possible y's (starting from Y_max down to max(0, Y_max - 300)), and also check the bottom 300 (from 0 to 300). But this would require checking up to 600 possibilities per W. Which would be manageable for W up to 3e5.\n\nBut how to ensure that this covers the optimal y.\n\nWell, in the worst case, it might not, but perhaps in practice, it works for the given problem constraints.\n\nAlternatively, since group1 and group2 items are sorted, the optimal y is either the maximum possible, or the maximum possible minus some small number, or the one that allows taking as many group1 items as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: For the group1 and group2 combination, the maximum value for a given W can be computed as follows:\n\nWe can precompute for group2 the prefix sums, and for group1 the prefix sums.\n\nThen, for a given W, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking as many group2 items as possible (y_max), and then group1 items for the remaining weight.\n\n- Or taking y_max - 1 group2 items, and then group1 items for the remaining weight.\n\n- And so on for up to some steps.\n\nBut how many steps? Well, for example, if we check up to 300 steps back from y_max, and also check taking zero group2 items, then perhaps it's sufficient.\n\nBut how to determine the number of steps.\n\nAlternatively, we can note that for any W, the optimal number of group2 items y can't be more than min( len(group2), W//2 ), and also can't be less than max( 0, (W - len(group1)) // 2 ). Because if you take fewer than that, then you could take more group1 items, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: the optimal y is between y_min and y_max, where y_min = max(0, (W - len(group1)) // 2 ). But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother way to think: For each W, the optimal y is such that 2y + x = W, where x is the number of group1 items. Since x can't exceed len(group1), then 2y can't be less than W - len(group1). Hence, y >= ceil( (W - len(group1)) / 2 ). But since y must be >= 0, the lower bound is max(0, ceil( (W - len(group1)) / 2 )).\n\nSo for each W, the optimal y is in the range [y_low, y_high], where y_low = max(0, (W - len(group1)) // 2 ), y_high = min( W//2, len(group2) ).\n\nBut even this, the range could be large.\n\nBut if I can find the best y in this range, then that would be the maximum. However, how to do this quickly.\n\nBut given that the range could be large, this doesn't help directly.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another way. Let's think about the following: for group1 and group2, the maximum value for weight W is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking some number of group2 items, and then filling the rest with group1 items.\n\nBut since group1 items are sorted, the best way to fill the rest is to take as many as possible.\n\nSo, for each possible y, the value is s2[y] + s1[min(W - 2y, len1)].\n\nNow, since s2 is non-decreasing, and s1 is non-decreasing, but W - 2y decreases as y increases, the function may have a single peak. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut if the function is unimodal, then ternary search could be used. However, I'm not sure whether it's unimodal.\n\nLet me take an example:\n\nSuppose group2 has items with values [5, 4], and group1 has items with values [3, 3, 3].\n\nFor W=4.\n\nPossible y values:\n\ny=0: 0 + min(4, 3) = 3 → sum is 3.\n\ny=1: 5 + min(4-2=2, 3) → 5+3=8.\n\ny=2: 5+4=9, but 2*2=4 → W-2y=0 → sum is 9 + 0 =9. So maximum is 9.\n\nSo the function increases with y.\n\nAnother example: group2 has [5, 1], group1 has [4,4,4]. W=4.\n\ny=0: 0 +4 →4.\n\ny=1: 5 + min(4-2=2, 3) →5+4+4= 5+8=13? Wait no. group1's prefix sum for x=2 is 4+4=8. So total is 5+8=13.\n\ny=2: 5+1=6. 4-4=0 → sum is 6+0=6. So the function increases up to y=1, then decreases.\n\nSo the function is not monotonic. Hence, ternary search may not work.\n\nBut in this case, the maximum is at y=1.\n\nSo, in this case, the optimal y is somewhere in the middle.\n\nBut how to find it quickly.\n\nAnother idea: For a given W, the optimal y is the one that maximizes s2[y] + s1[ min( W - 2y, len1) ]. Since s2[y] is increasing and s1[...] is decreasing with y, the function could have a single peak. If that's the case, then we can use ternary search on y in the range [0, Y_max].\n\nBut how to verify if this is true.\n\nIn the first example, the function was increasing with y. In the second example, it increased then decreased. So it's possible that the function is unimodal, which would allow ternary search.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each W, we can perform a ternary search on y in [0, Y_max] to find the maximum value.\n\nBut how to confirm that the function is unimodal.\n\nAssume that the function f(y) = s2[y] + s1[ min(W - 2y, len1) ].\n\nLet me think of the derivative. As y increases by 1, the change in f(y) is s2[y] - s2[y-1] (which is the cost of the y-th group2 item) minus the change in s1[...], which is the cost of two group1 items (since W - 2y decreases by 2, so x decreases by 2, assuming that W-2y is >=2).\n\nBut since the group2 items are sorted in descending order, the cost of the y-th group2 item is <= the previous ones. Similarly, the group1 items are sorted in descending order, so the cost of the first two group1 items is higher than later ones.\n\nSo, as y increases, the gain from adding a group2 item decreases, while the loss from losing two group1 items also decreases (since the two group1 items that are lost are the ones with lower value).\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nHowever, assuming that the function is unimodal, ternary search can be applied. This would reduce the time complexity for each W to O(log Y_max), which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of implementing a ternary search for each W:\n\nFor the current W, the range of y is [low, high] = [0, Y_max].\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n   mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n   if f(mid1) < f(mid2):\n\n       low = mid1 + 1\n\n   else:\n\n       high = mid2 - 1\n\nOnce the loop ends, check all values around low to find the maximum.\n\nBut this is just an approximation. Alternatively, perform a binary search for the maximum.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the correctness of this approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of possible y is up to 3e5, and for each W, we need to find the maximum, it's possible that this is not feasible for large W.\n\nBut given that the time constraints are tight, perhaps the only feasible way is to try to find a way to compute for group1 and group2 quickly.\n\nLet me think of another approach. For group2, since each item is weight 2, and group1 is weight 1, we can think of this as a knapsack problem with items of weight 1 and 2. But since we can take any number of items from each group, but each item can be taken once.\n\nBut given that the items are sorted, perhaps we can find for each possible number of group2 items, the best number of group1 items.\n\nBut again, this brings us back to the same problem.\n\nAnother idea: For group1 and group2, we can precompute for each possible number of group2 items y, the maximum possible x for any weight. But I don't see how.\n\nWait, let's think of the following: for each possible y, the total weight used by group2 is 2y. The remaining weight is W - 2y. The maximum number of group1 items we can take is min(W - 2y, len(group1)). So, for a given W, the value is s2[y] + s1[min(W - 2y, len(group1))].\n\nBut for a given W, this is a function of y. Let's imagine that we can find the y that maximizes this expression.\n\nNow, since the group1 items are sorted, the s1[x] increases with x. So, for a fixed W, the term s1[min(W - 2y, len1)] is a non-increasing function of y. Because as y increases, W - 2y decreases, so x decreases, and thus s1[x] decreases.\n\nOn the other hand, s2[y] is an increasing function of y.\n\nSo, the function f(y) = increasing + decreasing. It's possible that it has a single peak, but it's not guaranteed.\n\nBut if it does, then ternary search could find the maximum.\n\nLet me try with the earlier example where f(y) increased then decreased.\n\nExample:\n\nW=4, group2 items [5,1], group1 items [4,4,4].\n\ns2 = [0,5,6].\n\ns1 = [0,4,8, 12].\n\nFor y=0: f=0 + min(4,3)= 12 → 12.\n\nWait no: for y=0, the remaining weight is 4, so x=4, but len(group1) is 3. So x=3, s1[3]=12.\n\nFor y=1: s2[1]=5, remaining weight is 4-2=2. x=2, s1[2]=8. Total is 5+8=13.\n\nFor y=2: s2[2]=6, remaining weight is 4-4=0 → x=0, s1[0]=0. Total is 6+0=6.\n\nSo the function increases from y=0 to y=1, then decreases. So it has a single peak at y=1.\n\nAnother example: group2 items [5,4],",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs Petya can carry given a weight limit. Each souvenir has a weight of either 1, 2, or 3, and we need to efficiently determine the optimal combination of these items.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Grouping by Weight**: First, we group the souvenirs based on their weights (1, 2, or 3). This allows us to handle each group separately.\n2. **Sorting and Prefix Sums**: For each group, we sort the items in descending order of their cost and compute prefix sums. This helps in quickly determining the maximum cost for taking the top `k` items from each group.\n3. **Iterating Over Possible Combinations**: We iterate over possible numbers of items from the heaviest group (weight 3) and calculate the remaining weight capacity. For the remaining capacity, we determine the optimal combination of items from the lighter groups (weights 1 and 2) using a heuristic approach that checks a limited range around the maximum possible number of items from the weight 2 group.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    group1 = []\n    group2 = []\n    group3 = []\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        w = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        c = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        if w == 1:\n            group1.append(c)\n        elif w == 2:\n            group2.append(c)\n        else:\n            group3.append(c)\n    \n    # Sort each group in descending order\n    group1.sort(reverse=True)\n    group2.sort(reverse=True)\n    group3.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    def get_prefix_sum(arr):\n        res = [0]\n        for num in arr:\n            res.append(res[-1] + num)\n        return res\n    \n    s1 = get_prefix_sum(group1)\n    s2 = get_prefix_sum(group2)\n    s3 = get_prefix_sum(group3)\n    \n    max_total = 0\n    \n    len1 = len(group1)\n    len2 = len(group2)\n    len3 = len(group3)\n    \n    # Iterate through all possible z (number of group3 items)\n    max_z = min(len3, m // 3)\n    for z in range(0, max_z + 1):\n        weight_used = 3 * z\n        if weight_used > m:\n            continue\n        rem = m - weight_used\n        \n        # Now find the best combination of group1 and group2 for rem\n        # Y_max is min(rem // 2, len2)\n        Y_max = min(rem // 2, len2)\n        # Check up to 300 possibilities around Y_max\n        start_y = max(0, Y_max - 300)\n        end_y = min(Y_max, len2)\n        current_max = 0\n        for y in range(start_y, end_y + 1):\n            available = rem - 2 * y\n            x = min(available, len1)\n            val = s2[y] + s1[x]\n            if val > current_max:\n                current_max = val\n        # Also check from 0 to 300, in case Y_max is too high\n        start_y = max(0, Y_max - 300)\n        end_y = min(Y_max, len2)\n        # Check some values below start_y\n        for y in range(max(0, start_y - 300), start_y):\n            available = rem - 2 * y\n            x = min(available, len1)\n            val = s2[y] + s1[x]\n            if val > current_max:\n                current_max = val\n        total = s3[z] + current_max\n        if total > max_total:\n            max_total = total\n    \n    print(max_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping and Sorting**: The souvenirs are grouped by their weights and sorted in descending order of cost to prioritize higher value items.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: Prefix sums are computed for each group to quickly determine the total cost of taking the top `k` items from any group.\n3. **Iterative Combination Check**: For each possible number of items taken from the heaviest group (weight 3), the remaining weight capacity is calculated.
