His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the first and second tour scores for all participants, but they are not linked to names. So, we need to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j (but each participant has exactly one a and one b, right? Wait no, the input gives two lists: a1...an are the first tour points for each participant, and b1...bn are the second tour points. But the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for each participant, their first tour score is a_i and second tour is b_i? Or are the a's and b's for the same participants but in different order? No, the problem says that the teacher has the results of both tours, but the problem is that the results have only points, no names. So, the teacher doesn't know which a_i corresponds to which b_j. So for each participant, their first tour score is a_i and second tour is b_i, but the lists are given in arbitrary order. Wait no, the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for example, the first list is the first tour scores of all participants, and the second list is the second tour scores of all participants. However, the problem is that the teacher doesn't know which a_i belongs to which b_j. Because the lists are not sorted by participants. So, for example, participant 1 has a1 in first tour and some b_j in second tour. But the teacher doesn't know which pairing is correct. However, it's guaranteed that there exists at least one pairing where a_i + b_j >=x (since Vasya was present).\n\nBut our task is to find the best and worst possible rank Vasya could have, considering all possible pairings of a's and b's (each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa) such that there exists at least one pair (a_i + b_j) >=x. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. So, the actual Vasya's total is some a_i + b_j (for some i and j), but since the teacher doesn't know which pairing is correct, we need to consider all possible pairings where there exists at least one pair (a_i + b_j) >=x. But the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. So, the actual Vasya's pair (a_i + b_j) is >=x. But for the purposes of determining the best and worst possible ranks, we can assume that Vasya's total is exactly some value that is >=x, and we need to find the best and worst possible ranks he can have in the overall rankings.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Because the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible place that Vasya could have, given that there exists some pairing where a_i + b_j >=x. But the actual pairing of a and b's is unknown. So, the problem is to imagine that the a's and b's are matched into pairs (each a is matched with exactly one b), and that in this matching, there is at least one pair (which is Vasya's) with sum >=x. Then, for that matching, what is the best and worst possible rank that Vasya could have.\n\nBut the question is, for all possible matchings (permutations of b's) that have at least one pair with sum >=x, what is the best and worst possible rank that Vasya can have. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the teacher wants to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have, given that there exists some a_i and b_j (possibly from different participants) such that a_i + b_j >=x. But since the actual pairing is unknown, the teacher has to consider all possible pairings (i.e., permutations of the b array) and for each possible pairing, determine the possible positions of Vasya's pair (assuming that in that pairing, there is a pair with sum >=x). Then, find the best and worst possible positions across all possible such pairings.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, the key point here is that Vasya's actual pair is some (a_i, b_j), and the rest of the participants are paired as per the permutation. However, since the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible positions, considering that the actual pairing could be any possible permutation of the b's, as long as there exists a pair (a_i + b_j) >=x.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible place Vasya could have, given that he has at least x points. So, the teacher is trying to find the best possible scenario (where Vasya's position is as high as possible) and the worst possible scenario (where it's as low as possible), given that there exists a pairing where Vasya's total is at least x.\n\nBut how to model this. For the best possible rank, we want to choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible (so he can be first), and arrange others so that as many as possible have lower totals. For the worst possible rank, we want to arrange the pairings such that as many as possible have higher or equal totals than Vasya's.\n\nBut how do we model Vasya's total? Since the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. So for the best case, we can assume that Vasya's total is the maximum possible (so that he can be first). For the worst case, we can assume that Vasya's total is exactly x, and arrange others to have as many as possible higher totals.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya has at least x points. So, for the best possible case, we can take the maximum possible sum that Vasya could have (i.e., the maximum a_i + b_j for any i and j), and then arrange the pairings so that this sum is as high as possible, and others are arranged to be as low as possible. But perhaps that's not the way. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem requires that there exists at least one pair (a_i + b_j) >=x. So, for the best possible rank, we want to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as high as possible (so that he can be first). Then, arrange the other pairs to be as low as possible. But how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, the best possible rank is determined by choosing the best possible pair (a_i + b_j) for Vasya (so that he has maximum possible sum), and then count how many other participants have sum >= that value. But since the other participants are paired in a way that their sums are as small as possible, but that depends on the pairing.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher can choose any possible pairing (permutation of b's) as long as there exists a pair (a_i + b_j) >=x. So, for the best possible rank, the teacher can choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and arrange other pairings so that as few as possible people have a higher sum than him.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank, the teacher can arrange the pairings so that Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange others to have as many as possible higher sums.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think of the best possible rank first.\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\nWe can choose Vasya's pair to be the maximum possible a_i + b_j. Then, in this scenario, the number of people who have a sum greater than or equal to this maximum would be zero (if there are no others with the same sum). But since the problem allows for the jury to assign places arbitrarily when there are ties, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but if there are multiple people with the same sum as Vasya, the jury can assign him first place. So for the best possible scenario, the answer is 1. Because the teacher can arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, and others are arranged to have lower sums. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but how? Because if there's another pair that can have the same maximum sum, but that depends on the pairing. Let's take an example. Suppose there are two participants, and the a's are [5, 0], and the b's are [5, 0]. Then, the maximum possible sum is 5+5=10. But to get that, you need to pair the first a with first b. However, if you pair the first a with second b (sum 5+0=5), and second a with first b (sum 0+5=5), then the maximum is 5. So in that case, the best possible scenario for Vasya is to have sum 10, which is possible. Then, in that case, he would be first. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is always 1, unless there's no possible way for Vasya to have a sum >=x. But the problem states that it is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So, for the best possible rank, it's always 1. Wait, but in the first example in the problem statement, the output is 1 for the best. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut then why is the first sample output's best 1? Because in that case, all participants have sum 2. So the teacher can assign Vasya to be first. So yes.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1. Unless there's some constraint. But why? Because the teacher can arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but how to confirm this. Let's think of the example where there are two participants. a = [3, 1], b = [3, 1]. Suppose x is 4. Then, the possible pairings are:\n\nPairing 1: (3,3) and (1,1): sums 6 and 2. So Vasya could have 6, which is best possible.\n\nPairing 2: (3,1) and (1,3): sums 4 and 4. Then Vasya's sum is 4, which is >=x=4. In this case, the best possible rank is 1 (since the jury can assign him first).\n\nSo in any case, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, the first part of the answer is always 1. But wait, the problem's sample input shows that in the second example, the best is 1. So that's correct.\n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1. Therefore, the first part of the output is 1. But why?\n\nBecause the teacher can arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. Therefore, he can be first. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut how to confirm that this is always possible. Well, because the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. So, the teacher can choose that pair as Vasya's, and arrange the rest of the pairings in such a way that none of them have a sum higher than that. But how?\n\nWait, for example, suppose that the maximum possible sum (over all possible pairings) is S. Then, in the best case, Vasya's sum is S, and the rest of the pairings are arranged so that their sums are as low as possible. But how can we ensure that there are no other pairings with sum S? Well, maybe not, but the jury can assign the ranks in such a way that even if others have same sum, Vasya is placed first.\n\nSo regardless of how many people have the same sum as Vasya's, the best possible rank is 1. Hence, the first part of the answer is always 1.\n\nTherefore, the first output is always 1. That seems to be the case.\n\nNow, the main challenge is to compute the worst possible rank.\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible number of participants that can have a sum greater than or equal to Vasya's sum. But since Vasya's sum is at least x, and we want to maximize the number of people with sum >= his sum, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x) and arrange the other pairings to have as many as possible sums higher than or equal to that.\n\nSo the approach for the worst case is:\n\nFind the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have (but >=x) and then find the maximum number of people that can have a sum >= that value. Then, the worst possible rank is that number.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think. For the worst case scenario, we need to choose a sum s (s >=x) such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is s, and as many other participants as possible have sum >=s. Then, the worst rank is the number of people with sum >=s plus 1 (since if there are k people with sum >=s, then Vasya can be placed last among them, hence rank k+1? Or is it k? Wait, if there are k people with sum >=s, then the worst possible rank is k+1? Or depends on how the jury assigns ranks.\n\nNo. If there are k people with sum >=s, then Vasya's rank can be as bad as k+1. Because if all those k people have sum strictly greater than s, then Vasya's rank is k+1. But if some have equal sum, then the jury can assign him to be after them. So, for the worst possible rank, we need to maximize the number of people that have sum >=s, where s is the minimal possible sum for Vasya (>=x).\n\nBut how to find this s?\n\nLet me think again. To maximize the number of people that can have sum >=s, where s is the sum of Vasya's pair (which must be >=x). So the minimal s is x. But perhaps even higher. But to maximize the number of people with sum >=s, we need to choose the smallest possible s (as small as possible, but >=x). Because for a smaller s, more people can have sum >=s.\n\nWait, for example, if s is x, then the number of people with sum >=x may be larger than if s is higher. So the worst possible rank would be achieved when Vasya's sum is as small as possible (x), and then the maximum number of people have sum >=x.\n\nBut how can we compute this?\n\nThe problem reduces to: find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum >=x, given that there's a way to pair a_i and b_j such that exactly one of them (Vasya's) is >=x. Wait, no. Actually, the pairing must allow for at least one pair (Vasya's) with sum >=x. But for the worst case scenario, we can arrange the pairing such that Vasya's sum is exactly x, and as many others as possible have sum >=x.\n\nSo the steps for the worst case:\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum >=x, given that there exists a pairing where at least one of the pairs (Vasya's) has sum >=x. But how to model this.\n\nBut how can we compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >=x in any possible pairing, given that there exists a pairing where at least one pair is >=x?\n\nWait, but the worst case scenario for Vasya is when the number of participants with sum >= his sum is as large as possible. Since his sum is at least x, but we can choose his sum to be as low as possible (x) to maximize the number of people with sum >=x.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: what is the maximum number of pairs (a_i + b_j) that can be >=x, given that the pairing is a bijection between a and b. Then, the worst possible rank is that number. But wait, no. Because in that case, if there are k pairs with sum >=x, then Vasya's rank could be k (if all those pairs are >=x, and he is one of them). But the worst possible rank is k, because if all those k pairs are >=x, then Vasya can be placed in the last position among them, hence rank k. But how to compute that maximum k?\n\nWait, but how to find the maximum number of pairs that can be formed such that their sum is >=x. Because if we can find that maximum number, then that would be the worst possible rank. Because in that case, Vasya's sum is x (or higher), and there are that many people with sum >=x. So his rank is that number.\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of pairs (a_i + b_j) >=x, given that the pairing is a bijection between a and b. That is, find the maximum possible number of pairs that can be formed such that each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, and each pair's sum is >=x.\n\nWait, but that's not exactly the case. Because the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=x is the maximum possible. For example, if there are 5 participants, and all possible pairings can have 5 pairs with sum >=x, then the worst possible rank is 5. But if the maximum is 3, then the worst possible rank is 3.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum number of pairs. This is similar to the problem of maximum matching where each pair must have a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nThis sounds like a classic problem. How to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x, with each a and b used exactly once.\n\nTo find this maximum, we can sort a and b in certain ways. For example, sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, and then check for each a_i and b_j whether their sum is >=x. Let me think.\n\nLet me think of the following approach: sort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Then, for each i, pair a[i] with b[i]. Then, count how many pairs have sum >=x. This is a common greedy approach for maximum matching.\n\nAlternatively, sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order, and then use two pointers. For example, for each a_i, find the smallest b_j that can be paired with it such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, proceed greedily.\n\nWait, here's a standard approach for maximum matching: sort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, find the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet and is the smallest possible to satisfy a_i + b_j >=x. Wait, perhaps the two pointers approach.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose we want to maximize the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j >=x. How can we do this?\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Then, use two pointers. Let me have i start from the end of a (largest elements), and j start from the end of b (largest elements). For each a_i, try to pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet. If a_i + b_j >=x, then count it and move both pointers. Else, move the a pointer left (since a_i is too small to pair with any remaining b_j). Wait, but this might not be optimal. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose a is [1, 2, 3], b is [1, 2, 3], x is 4. Then, the maximum number of pairs is 2: (3+1=4, 2+2=4, 1+3=4). But using the approach above:\n\nSort a and b ascending: a = [1,2,3], b = [1,2,3].\n\ni starts at 2 (a[2]=3), j starts at 2 (b[2]=3). 3+3=6 >=4 → count 1. Now i=1, j=1.\n\na[1]=2, b[1]=2 → 4 ≥4 → count 2. Now i=0, j=0. a[0]=1, b[0]=1 → sum 2 <4. So total count is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [1, 1, 1], b = [1, 1, 1], x=2. All pairs sum to 2. So maximum is 3. Using the approach, i starts at 2 (a[2]=1), j starts at 2 (b[2]=1). Sum is 2 ≥2 → count 1. i=1, j=1. sum 2 → count 2. i=0, j=0. sum 2 → count 3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [1, 3, 5], b = [2, 4, 6], x=6. How many pairs can we get?\n\nPossible pairs:\n\n(5,6) = 11, (3,4)=7, (1,2)=3 → 2 pairs.\n\nBut if we pair (5,2) (sum 7), (3,4) (7), (1,6) (7) → all three pairs sum to 7 ≥6. So maximum is 3.\n\nBut according to the two pointers approach:\n\na sorted ascending: [1,3,5], b sorted ascending [2,4,6].\n\ni starts at 2 (a=5), j starts at 2 (b=6). 5+6=11 ≥6 → count 1. i=1, j=1. a=3, b=4 → 7 ≥6 → count 2. i=0, j=0. a=1, b=2 → 3 <6. So total count 2. But the correct maximum is 3. So this approach is not working.\n\nAh, so the two pointers approach in this way isn't sufficient. So what's wrong here?\n\nThe problem is that pairing the largest a with the largest b may not be the optimal way. In this example, pairing the largest a with the smallest b allows the other a's to pair with larger b's. So perhaps the correct approach is to sort a in ascending order, and b in descending order, and then pair each a_i with b_i. Let's see.\n\nIn the example above, a sorted ascending [1,3,5], b sorted descending [6,4,2].\n\nPair 1 with 6: sum 7 ≥6 → count 1.\n\nPair 3 with 4: sum 7 ≥6 → count 2.\n\nPair 5 with 2: sum 7 ≥6 → count 3. So all three pairs are valid. So this approach works.\n\nSo the idea is: sort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, pair with b_i. Then, count how many pairs have a_i + b_i >=x.\n\nThis seems to work for the example. Let me think of the previous example where the two pointers approach failed. So this approach would give 3 pairs, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [1,2,3], b = [1,2,3], x=4. Sort a ascending, b descending: [1,2,3], [3,2,1]. Pair 1+3=4, 2+2=4, 3+1=4. All three pairs are valid. So count is 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [1,2,3], b = [1,2,3], x=5. Then, pairs are 1+3=4 <5, 2+2=4 <5, 3+1=4 <5. So count is 0. But if we pair 3+3=6, 2+2=4, 1+1=2. Then, only one pair. So the approach of sorting a ascending and b descending gives 0, but the correct maximum is 1. Wait, but in this case, the approach would have:\n\na sorted ascending [1,2,3], b sorted descending [3,2,1]. Pair 1+3=4 <5. Then, 2+2=4 <5. 3+1=4 <5. So count 0. But the correct maximum is 1. So this approach is not correct here.\n\nWait, but how? Because in this case, the maximum number of pairs is 1. For example, pair 3 with 3 (sum 6), and the other pairs are 1+2=3 and 2+1=3. So only one pair meets the condition. But according to the approach, the count is 0. So the approach is not correct here.\n\nSo what's the problem here?\n\nAh, the approach of sorting a ascending and b descending and pairing them in order gives a count of 0, but there exists a way to pair to get 1. So this suggests that the approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. So how to find the maximum number of pairs that can be formed such that their sum is >=x?\n\nThis seems like a classic problem. Let me think again. How to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >=x, where each a_i and b_j is used exactly once.\n\nAn alternative approach is to sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, find the smallest b_j that hasn't been used yet and can be paired with a_i such that their sum is >=x. Then, use a two-pointer approach.\n\nLet me think again about this. For example, in the case where a is [1,2,3], b is [1,2,3], x=5. We need to find the maximum number of pairs.\n\nSort a ascending, sort b ascending. So a = [1,2,3], b = [1,2,3].\n\nWe can use two pointers: i starts at the beginning of a (smallest), j starts at the end of b (largest). For each a_i, check if a_i + b_j >=x. If yes, then count +=1, move i forward and j backward. If not, move i forward (since a_i is too small to pair with any b_j, even the largest ones).\n\nIn this example:\n\ni=0 (a=1), j=2 (b=3). 1+3=4 <5. So move i to 1.\n\ni=1 (a=2), j=2 (b=3). 2+3=5 >=5. count=1. Move i to 2, j to 1.\n\ni=2 (a=3), j=1 (b=2). 3+2=5 >=5. count=2. Move i to 3 (end), j to 0. So total count is 2. But the correct maximum is 1. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, this approach would give count 2. But in reality, how can you have two pairs with sum >=5?\n\nFor example, pair (2,3) and (3,2). Their sums are 5 and 5. So yes, that's two pairs. So the approach gives the correct count of 2. But earlier thought that the maximum was 1 was incorrect. So the approach is correct here.\n\nSo the two-pointer approach works here. So what was the mistake before? I thought that the maximum was 1, but actually it's 2. So the two-pointer approach gives the correct answer.\n\nSo, the two-pointer approach seems to work.\n\nLet me think of the previous example where a is [1,3,5], b is [2,4,6], x=6. The two-pointer approach would sort a and b in ascending order. a = [1,3,5], b = [2,4,6]. i starts at 0, j starts at 2 (b=6). a[0] + b[2] = 1+6=7 >=6 → count +=1. i=1, j=1. a[1] + b[1] =3+4=7 >=6 → count +=1. i=2, j=0. a[2]+b[0] =5+2=7 >=6 → count +=1. Total count 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [1,2,3], b = [1,2,3], x=5. The two-pointer approach gives count 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [3, 1, 5], b = [2, 4, 6], x=6. After sorting a ascending [1,3,5], b ascending [2,4,6]. i=0, j=2. 1+6=7 >=6 → count 1. i=1, j=1. 3+4=7 >=6 → count 2. i=2, j=0. 5+2=7 >=6 → count 3. Correct.\n\nSo the two-pointer approach seems to work. So the steps are:\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i=0 (start of a), j = n-1 (end of b).\n\ncount = 0.\n\nWhile i < n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] >=x:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1\n\nSo this gives the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=x.\n\nThis seems to be the correct approach.\n\nSo, for the worst possible rank, we need to compute this count, and then the worst possible rank is count. Because in this scenario, there are count participants with sum >=x, including Vasya. So the worst possible rank is count.\n\nWait, but why? Because if there are count participants with sum >=x, then Vasya can be placed in the last position among them, hence rank count. But how does that work?\n\nYes. For example, in the first sample input, all participants have sum 2. The count is 5. So the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nIn the second sample input, the worst possible rank is 5. Let's see:\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=6, x=7\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nAfter sorting a in ascending order:\n\na = [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n\nb sorted ascending: [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\nNow, apply the two-pointer approach.\n\ni=0 (a=3), j=5 (b=8). 3+8=11 >=7 → count=1. i=1, j=4.\n\na=4, b=6 → 10 >=7 → count=2. i=2, j=3.\n\na=4, b=4 → 8 >=7 → count=3. i=3, j=2.\n\na=4, b=4 → 8 >=7 → count=4. i=4, j=1.\n\na=5, b=3 → 8 >=7 → count=5. i=5, j=0.\n\na=6, b=0 → 6 >=7? No. So i increases to 6, loop ends. So count is 5. Hence, the worst possible rank is 5, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the worst possible rank is this count.\n\nSo the approach for the worst possible rank is to compute this count, which is the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=x, using the two-pointer approach.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor the best possible rank, output 1.\n\nFor the worst possible rank, compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >=x, using the two-pointer approach.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple pairings that allow for different numbers of pairs with sum >=x? For example, if x is 2, and all pairs have sum >=2. Then the count is n, which would be the worst possible rank of n.\n\nBut how to ensure that there's at least one pair (Vasya's) with sum >=x. Well, the problem statement says that it is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. So the count computed by the two-pointer approach will be at least 1.\n\nThus, the worst possible rank is the count computed by the two-pointer approach.\n\nThus, the steps for solving the problem are:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the a array.\n\nRead the b array.\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in ascending order.\n\nCompute the maximum number of pairs with sum >=x using the two-pointer approach.\n\nThen, the output is 1 and the count.\n\nWait, but in the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=5, x=2.\n\na is [1,1,1,1,1], sorted as [1,1,1,1,1].\n\nb is [1,1,1,1,1], sorted as [1,1,1,1,1].\n\ntwo-pointer approach:\n\ni=0, j=4. a[0] + b[4] = 2 >=2 → count=1. i=1, j=3. sum 2 → count=2. i=2, j=2 → sum 2 → count=3. i=3, j=1 → sum 2 → count=4. i=4, j=0 → sum 2 → count=5. So the count is 5, which is the worst possible rank. Hence, output is 1 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nAnother test case: in the second sample input, the count is 5, which is the worst possible rank.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead a list, read b list.\n\nSort a in ascending order.\n\nSort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i=0, j = n-1, count=0.\n\nLoop while i < n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] >=x:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1\n\nThen, output 1 and count.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple pairings that allow for different counts? For example, suppose there's a way to have more pairs with sum >=x than the two-pointer approach. But according to the examples, the two-pointer approach gives the maximum count. So I think this approach is correct.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=1. Then x must be <= a[0] + b[0]. The best is 1, worst is 1.\n\nCase 2: x=0. Then all pairs are >=0. So the count is n. Output is 1 and n.\n\nAnother case: some pairs can be formed with sum >=x, but the two-pointer approach returns the maximum count.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead n and x from input.\n\nThen read the a list, then the b list.\n\nSort a, sort b.\n\nInitialize i=0, j = n-1, count=0.\n\nLoop:\n\nwhile i < n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] >=x:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1\n\nThen print 1 and count.\n\nWait, but in the sample input 2, the count is 5. Which is correct.\n\nBut let's check the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2:\n\n6 7\n\na: [4,3,5,6,4,4] → sorted a is [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n\nb: [8,6,0,4,3,4] → sorted b is [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\nNow, the two-pointer approach:\n\ni=0 (3), j=5 (8): 3+8=11 >=7 → count=1. i=1, j=4 (6).\n\na[1]=4, b[4]=6 → 4+6=10 >=7 → count=2. i=2, j=3 (4).\n\na[2]=4, b[3]=4 → 8 >=7 → count=3. i=3, j=2 (4).\n\na[3]=4, b[2]=4 → 8 >=7 → count=4. i=4, j=1 (3).\n\na[4]=5, b[1]=3 → 8 >=7 → count=5. i=5, j=0 (0). a[5]=6 + 0 =6 <7 → so i increases to 6, loop ends. count=5. So output is 1 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the possible pairings of scores from the two tours to determine these ranks efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: The best possible rank Vasya can achieve is always 1. This is because we can always find a pairing where Vasya's total score is the highest possible, ensuring he gets the first position regardless of other participants' scores.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To determine the worst possible rank, we need to maximize the number of participants who can have a total score greater than or equal to Vasya's minimum score (x). This is done using a two-pointer technique:\n   - Sort both the scores from the first tour (`a`) and the second tour (`b`) in ascending order.\n   - Use two pointers starting from the beginning of `a` and the end of `b` to count the maximum number of valid pairs (where the sum of scores is at least x).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr + n]))\n    ptr += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr + n]))\n    ptr += n\n    \n    a.sort()\n    b.sort()\n    \n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    count = 0\n    \n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        if a[i] + b[j] >= x:\n            count += 1\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    print(1, count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum score `x`, and the lists of scores from the two tours.\n- **Sorting**: Both score lists are sorted in ascending order to facilitate the two-pointer technique.\n- **Two-pointer Technique**: By starting with the smallest element in `a` and the largest in `b`, we check if their sum meets or exceeds `x`. If it does, we count this pair and move both pointers inward. If not, we move the pointer in `a` forward to try the next larger element. This ensures we maximize the number of valid pairs efficiently.\n- **Output**: The best possible rank is always 1, and the worst possible rank is determined by the count of valid pairs found using the two-pointer technique.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the ranks with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting and O(n) for the two-pointer traversal, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
