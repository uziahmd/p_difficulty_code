And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. Each week is k consecutive days. For each of these weeks, I need to compute the sum of their sleep times, then take the average of all those sums. Then output that average with enough decimal places.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the steps. First, the problem requires me to process multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the example input, it seems like there are multiple test cases given. Wait, the input examples show something like ['3 2\\n3 4 7', ...], but maybe in the actual problem, the input is multiple test cases. Wait, no, the original problem statement says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input description says that the first line contains two integers n and k, then the second line has n integers. So each test case is two lines. But the example shows three different inputs, each with their own outputs. Oh right, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases in the input. Wait, but in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, maybe the example is showing multiple test cases as part of the sample input. Wait, looking at the example input given:\n\nThe first example input is \"3 2\\n3 4 7\", which would be one test case. Then another input is \"1 1\\n10\" and another is \"8 2\\n1 2 4 ... 1\". So perhaps the actual problem expects that the code can handle multiple test cases. But wait, the original problem's input description says that the first line contains two integers n and k. So perhaps in the actual programming competition problem, the input is a single test case. However, the example given here seems to have multiple test cases. Wait, maybe the user is showing multiple examples. But in the actual problem, the code should read from stdin, which would be for a single test case. Or perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe original problem says that the input is for a single test case. Because the input is given as two lines: first line n and k, second line the array. However, in the sample input provided here, there are three different test cases. So perhaps the user is showing multiple examples, but the actual code needs to process a single test case. Wait, but the user's note says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first input is '3 2\\n3 4 7' which would be one test case. The output is '9.0000000000'. Then the next input is '1 1\\n10' with output '10.0000000000', and third input is '8 2\\n...' with output '28964.2857...'.\n\nSo perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases. But how are they given? For example, in programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. But the original problem's input description says that the first line contains two integers n and k. Which suggests that there is only one test case. However, the sample input seems to show multiple test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the example. Or perhaps the problem is expecting to process multiple test cases.\n\nWait, perhaps the user is presenting multiple test cases as part of the example, but the actual problem is for a single test case. For example, the original problem's sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n3 2\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output:\n9.0000000000\n\nBut in the user's example, they have three different inputs. So perhaps the user is showing three separate test cases, but the actual code needs to handle one test case. However, the code that the user wants must process multiple test cases. Wait, but the original problem statement says that the input is for one test case. So perhaps the user's example is incorrect. Or perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. But looking back at the problem statement's input and output sections. The input says that the first line contains two integers n and k, then the second line has n integers. So the code should read one test case. However, the sample input given in the problem's example shows three different test cases. But perhaps that's just an example of different possible test cases, not that the code should process multiple test cases. So perhaps the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut then",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to compute the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week is defined as `k` consecutive days from a list of `n` days. The solution must be efficient due to the constraints on input size.\n\n---\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - Given a list of `n` integers representing the sleep times for `n` days.\n   - We are to consider every possible sequence of `k` consecutive days as a \"week\".\n   - For each such week, calculate the sum of the sleep times.\n   - Compute the average of these sums across all valid weeks and output it with sufficient precision.\n\n2. **Efficient Summation Using Sliding Window:**\n   - A brute-force approach of recalculating the sum for every subarray of length `k` would be too slow (O(n*k) time).\n   - Instead, we use the sliding window technique to maintain the current sum of a window of size `k`, updating it in constant time for each new window.\n   - This reduces the time complexity to O(n), which is suitable for large inputs up to 200,000.\n\n3. **Precision Handling:**\n   - The result must be printed with at least 6 decimal places, ensuring that absolute or relative error does not exceed `1e-6`.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    for line in data:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n_k = line.strip().split()\n        if len(n_k) < 2:\n            continue\n        n, k = map(int, n_k)\n        a = list(map(int, data[data.index(line) + 1].strip().split()))\n        \n        total_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_weeks = n - k + 1\n        avg_sum = total_sum / total_weeks\n        \n        # Handle edge case where there is only one week\n        if total_weeks == 1:\n            print(f\"{avg_sum:.10f}\")\n            continue\n        \n        # Sliding window to compute the sum of all weeks\n        for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n            total_sum += a[i + k - 1] - a[i - 1]\n            avg_sum += total_sum / total_weeks\n        \n        print(f\"{avg_sum:.10f}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Reading Input:** The code reads from standard input and processes each test case line by line.\n- **Sliding Window Technique:** It computes the initial sum of the first `k` elements. Then, for each subsequent window, it subtracts the element that's no longer in the window and adds the new element entering the window.\n- **Averaging:** The average is computed by dividing the total sum of all weekly sums by the number of weeks.\n- **Precision Output:** The final result is printed with 10 decimal digits to ensure compliance with the required precision.\n\nThis approach ensures efficiency and correctness even for the largest input sizes.",
