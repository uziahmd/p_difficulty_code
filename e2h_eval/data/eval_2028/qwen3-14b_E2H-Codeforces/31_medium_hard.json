Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The original cards have numbers that don't exceed x in absolute value, and he can use any number of cards from -x to x, but each card has a single integer.\n\nSo, the approach here is to calculate the total sum of the found cards. Then, we need to find how much more we need to add (or subtract) to make the total sum zero. But since we can only add cards with values between -x and x, we need to figure out the minimal number of cards required to reach that target.\n\nLet me think. Let's say the sum of the found cards is S. We need to find some number of cards (let's say k cards) such that their sum is -S. Because adding those cards will make the total sum zero.\n\nBut what's the minimal k? Well, each card can contribute at most x (if we take positive numbers) or at least -x (if taking negative). So, the maximum possible sum we can get from k cards is k * x. Similarly, the minimum is -k * x.\n\nSo, for the sum of the new cards to be equal to -S, we need that -k*x ≤ -S ≤ k*x. Wait, no. Let me rephrase. The sum of the new cards must be exactly -S. Let's call this target T = -S. So, we need to find the minimal k such that T can be achieved by adding k numbers, each between -x and x.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal k?\n\nLet me think about the absolute value of T. Let's say |T| is the absolute value. For example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then each card can contribute up to +2. So, the minimal k is ceil(5 / 2) = 3 (since 2*2=4 <5, so need 3 cards: 2+2+1=5). But wait, but each card can be any value between -x and x. So, the maximum possible sum for k cards is k * x. So, to get T, we need that |T| ≤ k * x. Because, for example, if T is positive, then we can take as many x as possible. So the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x). But wait, what if T is negative? Well, since we can take negative numbers, but the same logic applies. So the minimal number of cards needed is ceil(|T| / x), but maybe there's some cases where it's not possible? No, because if you have |T| divided by x, and you take the ceiling, then you can always get it. For example, if |T| is 5 and x is 2, then 5/2 is 2.5, ceiling is 3. So 3 cards. 2+2+1=5. But since each card can be any value between -x and x, you can adjust the numbers to reach exactly T.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the cards can be any integer between -x and x. So, for example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then the maximum sum per card is 2. So, 3 cards can give up to 6, which is more than 5. So, we can have 2+2+1 = 5. So, yes, the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x).\n\nBut wait, what if |T| is exactly divisible by x? Like T is 6, x is 2. Then 6 / 2 = 3, so 3 cards. Which is correct. So, the minimal k is ceil(|T| / x).\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then, we need zero cards. But in that case, the original sum is already zero. So the answer is zero. But the problem says that the initial sum may not be zero. So, the steps would be:\n\nCalculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call it S. Then T is -S. If T is zero, then answer is zero. Otherwise, compute the minimal k such that k is the minimal number of cards needed to reach T. Which is ceil(|T| / x). But wait, let's check the examples.\n\nFirst example input is 3 2, with numbers -1, 1, 2. The sum S is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. So |T| is 2. x is 2. So 2 / 2 = 1. So k is 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input is 2 3, numbers -2, -2. Sum is -4. T is 4. x is 3. So |T| is 4. 4/3 is 1.333..., ceil is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that seems to work. So the formula is:\n\nCompute the sum S of the found cards. Then T = -S. If T is zero, answer is 0. Else, compute |T| divided by x, rounded up. But how to compute that in Python?\n\nIn Python, to compute the ceiling of a division, we can do (a + b - 1) // b. For example, 5 / 2 is 2.5, ceiling is 3. (5 + 2 -1 ) // 2 = 6//2=3. Similarly, 4 / 3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. (4 +3 -1) //3 = 6//3=2.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and x.\n\n2. Read the list of numbers.\n\n3. Compute the sum S.\n\n4. T = -S.\n\n5. If T is 0, output 0.\n\n6. Else, compute |T| divided by x, rounded up. That's the answer.\n\nBut wait, what if x is larger than |T|? For example, if T is 2 and x is 3. Then |T| / x is 0.666, ceil is 1. Which is correct. Because you can take one card with 2. So yes.\n\nAnother example: T is 3 and x is 3. Then 3/3=1, so 1 card. Correct.\n\nAnother example: T is 4, x is 3. 4/3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. So two cards. For example, 3 + 1 =4. But since each card can be up to 3. So yes.\n\nSo this formula seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? For example, T is -5. Then |T| is 5, same as before. So the calculation is the same. So yes.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nsum_s = sum of the list.\n\nt = -sum_s\n\nif t == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n\n    # compute ceil(abs_t / x)\n\n    print( (abs_t + x -1 ) // x )\n\nBut wait, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nsum is 2. t is -2. abs_t is 2. x is 2. (2 + 2-1 ) // 2 → 3//2 = 1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: sum is -4. t is 4. x is 3. (4 +3-1) //3 → 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if sum is 0, output 0.\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x is 5 → 1.\n\nsum is 5, x is 4 → (5 +4-1)/4 = 8/4=2. Which is correct (4 + 1 =5, but 1 is allowed since x=4. So two cards.)\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if x is 0? Wait, no. The input constraints say x is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo this seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what if the sum is zero? Then the answer is zero. So that's handled.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nRead the input: first line is n and x. Second line is n integers.\n\nIn Python, read from stdin. So:\n\nProbably, the input is given as two lines. For example, in the first sample input, the first line is '3 2', the second line is '-1 1 2'.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_s = sum(nums)\n\nt = -sum_s\n\nif t == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_t = abs(t)\n\n    print( (abs_t + x -1 ) // x )\n\nWait, but what if x is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, x is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nBut let's check the sample input.\n\nSample 1: sum is 2. t is -2. abs_t is 2. x is 2. (2 +2-1)//2 → 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSample 2: sum is -4. t is 4. x is 3. (4 +3-1) is 6. 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1, and the number is 1. sum is 1. t is -1. abs_t is 1. (1 +1-1)//1 = 1//1=1. So output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1, number is -1. sum is -1. t is 1. (1 +1-1)//1 = 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 3, x is 2. So t is -3. abs_t is 3. (3 +2-1)/2 = 4/2=2. Which is correct (2+1=3, two cards).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what if the sum is zero? For example, input is 2 5, numbers 1 and -1. sum is 0. So output is 0. Correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut let's check the note in the problem. In the second sample, the input is 2 3, numbers -2 and -2. Sum is -4. So t is 4. x is 3. So (4 +3-1) //3 = 6//3=2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work. So the code is as written.\n",

The solution involves calculating the sum of the found cards and then determining the minimum number of additional cards required to balance this sum.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Sum of Found Cards**: First, compute the sum of the integers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum needed to balance the found cards is the negative of the calculated sum.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards Needed**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula `ceil(|target| / x)`, where `x` is the maximum absolute value allowed on a card.
