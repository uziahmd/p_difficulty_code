For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me try to understand the problem step by step.\n\nThe problem is about counting the number of ways to choose values c_s for all binary strings s of length 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. The answer needs to be computed modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let's understand what a beautiful multiset is. For each binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of binary strings of exactly length n. The maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f, and we need to count the number of valid c_s configurations that make this true.\n\nHmm. So the problem is about choosing c_s values such that when you construct the multiset (with maximum size), it's exactly f. But how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset. How is this determined by the c_s values?\n\nThis feels like a problem related to constraints on prefixes. Each string in the multiset contributes to multiple prefixes. For example, a string of length n has prefixes of all lengths from 1 to n. So, when constructing the multiset, each string added must not cause any of its prefixes to exceed their respective c_s counts.\n\nThe maximum size of the beautiful multiset would then be determined by some kind of constraints on the c_s values. Perhaps it's similar to a trie structure where each node (prefix) has a capacity, and the total number of strings that can be placed without exceeding capacities is determined by the minimum capacities along paths.\n\nWait, maybe there's a way to model this as a tree. Each binary string can be thought of as a path in a binary trie. For each node (prefix), the number of strings passing through it (i.e., having it as a prefix) can't exceed c_s. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is then the sum over all leaves (strings of length n) of 1, but constrained by the capacities of their prefixes.\n\nBut how do we find the maximum possible size given the c_s values?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements that can be placed in a trie with capacities on each node. For each node, the number of strings passing through it is the sum of the counts of its children. Wait, no. Wait, each string in the multiset is a path from root to a leaf. Each such path contributes +1 to every prefix along the path. Therefore, the constraints are that for each node (prefix), the number of paths passing through it is <= c_s.\n\nThe maximum number of such paths is determined by the minimum capacities along certain paths. How?\n\nThis is similar to the problem where each node has a capacity, and the maximum number of paths is the minimum over all nodes of (capacity of node) multiplied by something. Wait, perhaps it's equivalent to the problem of finding the maximum number of paths such that for every node, the number of paths passing through it is ≤ c_s. This is similar to the problem of finding the maximum flow in a tree with capacities on the nodes, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For the root node (empty string?), but here the strings are of length from 1 to n. Wait, the root here is the empty string? Or maybe the root is considered as the first level. Let me think again.\n\nEach binary string of length m (from 1 to n) is a node in the trie. The trie is built for all possible binary strings up to length n. Each node (prefix) has two children: appending a 0 or 1. The root is the empty string, but in our problem, the prefixes start at length 1. Hmm, maybe not. Let me clarify.\n\nThe problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n, we have a c_s. So for example, the string \"0\" (length 1) has a c_s value. The string \"00\" (length 2) also has a c_s value, etc.\n\nNow, the multiset consists of binary strings of length exactly n. Each such string contributes to all its prefixes. For example, the string \"010\" (length 3) contributes to prefixes \"0\", \"01\", \"010\".\n\nThe maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the maximum number of such strings that can be chosen such that for every prefix s, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nSo how to compute this maximum size given the c_s's?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the maximum number of strings that can be placed in the trie, respecting the capacities on each node. How is this maximum determined?\n\nI",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign values to `c_s` for all binary strings of length from 1 to `n` such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. The solution involves understanding how constraints on prefixes affect the maximum size of such a multiset.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each binary string contributes to multiple prefixes. For instance, a string of length `n` contributes to all its prefixes of lengths from 1 to `n`.\n2. **Tree Structure Insight**: We can model the problem using a binary trie structure where each node represents a prefix. The capacity `c_s` for each node limits how many strings can pass through it.\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations. The key insight is that the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the minimum capacities along the paths in the trie.\n4. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the result can be very large, we use modulo `998244353`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        f = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        # Precompute dp for all possible lengths up to n\n        # dp[m] = number of ways to assign c_s for all strings of length m such that the max is exactly f\n        # But we need to think about the constraints recursively\n        \n        # Let's think in terms of the minimal constraints for the paths\n        # The maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the minimum over all nodes of (capacity of node) * something?\n        # Actually, for each node (prefix), the number of strings passing through it is the sum of the counts of its children.\n        # This is similar to a tree with capacities on nodes, and we want to find the maximum number of paths from root to leaves such that no node's count is exceeded.\n        \n        # However, since the problem is about choosing c_s such that the maximum possible multiset size is exactly f, we need to model the constraints.\n        \n        # The key idea is that the maximum possible size of the multiset is the minimum of (sum_{i=1}^n (c_s for s of length i) * 2^{n-i} ?) or something else.\n        # Wait, perhaps the maximum size of the multiset is determined by the minimum of the capacities along the paths.

Therefore, the total number of strings in the multiset cannot exceed the minimum over all nodes s of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}. Because for a node s of length l, you can have up to c_s different strings that start with s, and each such string can be extended in 2^{n-l} ways. However, this is an upper bound.\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is the minimum over all s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        \n        # Thus, to ensure that the maximum possible size is exactly f, we must have that the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) across all s is exactly f.\n        \n        # Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s values such that:\n        # 1.
