Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem with the examples given. For example, the input 'ababa' gives output 3. The substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. So the length is 3. Another example is 'zzz' where the output is 2. The substrings 'zz' occur multiple times, but the maximum length is 2. Wait, but why not 3? Because the substring 'zzz' occurs once. So for the substring to be counted, it needs to appear at least twice. So for 'zzz', the substrings of length 2 are 'zz' which appears three times, so that's why the answer is 2.\n\nSo the approach is to check for all possible substrings of the string and find the maximum length where there's at least two occurrences.\n\nBut how do I efficiently check this?\n\nThe brute force approach would be to generate all possible substrings, track their occurrences, and then find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist. But since the string length is up to 100, maybe this is feasible.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFor each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer. If no such substring exists for any L, return 0.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Iterate L from min possible (which is 1) up to the maximum possible (which is len(s)//2, but maybe even higher? Wait, for example, if the string is \"aaaaa\", then the maximum possible L where a substring occurs twice is 4 (since \"aaaa\" occurs twice, overlapping). So for a string of length N, the maximum possible L is N-1. For example, if the string is length 2, like \"aa\", then L=1 is the maximum. So for the general case, the maximum possible L is N-1. But for the problem, we need to check all possible L from N-1 down to 1, and see if any substring of that length occurs at least twice.\n\nWait, but for a string of length N, the maximum possible length of a substring that can occur twice is floor(N/2). Wait, no. For example, if the string is \"abab\", length 4. The substring \"ab\" occurs twice. But also, the substring \"aba\" occurs once. But if the string is \"aaaaa\", then a substring of length 4 occurs twice. So for N=5, the maximum possible L is 4, which is N-1. So the maximum possible L is N-1. But for a substring of length L to appear twice, the string must have at least two occurrences. So for L = N-1, the substring can be s[0:N-1] and s[1:N], but they have to be the same. For example, in \"aaaaa\", the substrings of length 4 are \"aaaa\" (positions 0-3) and \"aaaa\" (positions 1-4). So yes, they are same. So for that case, the answer would be 4.\n\nSo the approach is to check for all possible L starting from the maximum possible (N-1) down to 1. For each L, check if there's any substring of length L that occurs at least twice. Once found, return that L. If none found after checking all L, return 0.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the steps for each L:\n\nFor each L in range (max_L down to 1):\n\n   collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\nBut how to collect them? For example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bab' (positions 1-3), 'aba' (positions 2-4). So the substring 'aba' occurs twice. So for each L, generate all possible substrings of that length, and track their counts.\n\nBut for checking if any of them occurs at least twice, perhaps we can use a set. For each substring of length L, we can add it to a set. If during the process, we find that the substring has already been added before, then we can immediately return that L as the answer.\n\nWait, but for the same L, there might be multiple substrings. For example, in 'ababa', for L=3, the first substring is 'aba', then 'bab', then 'aba'. So when we process the third substring, we see that 'aba'",
