In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and I have to find the minimum draws required.\n\nFirst, let's understand the requirements. For the given three tiles, check if they already form a mentsu. If not, figure out how many more tiles are needed to make it possible.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFor each input case (each of the three given tiles), check if there's already a mentsu. If yes, output 0. Otherwise, calculate the minimum number of tiles needed to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nBut how do I check for possible mentsu?\n\nLet's break it down into checking for triplet and sequence possibilities.\n\nFirst, check for triplet (koutsu): all three tiles must be the same. So, for example, if the three tiles are 9m, 9m, 9m, then it's a triplet. So in this case, output 0.\n\nIf not, check for a sequence (shuntsu). A sequence requires three consecutive numbers in the same suit. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. But the order doesn't matter. So the three tiles must be in the same suit, and their numbers must be consecutive.\n\nSo for the three tiles, check if they can form a sequence. For example, if the numbers are 2,3,4 in same suit, yes. If they are 1,2,3, yes. Or 7,8,9. But if they are 1,3,5, no.\n\nSo for the initial three tiles, first check if they already form a triplet or a sequence. If either is true, output 0.\n\nIf not, then we need to find the minimum number of tiles to add to get a mentsu.\n\nNow, the problem is: what's the minimal number of tiles to add so that the total tiles (original + added) contains a mentsu.\n\nBut how to approach this?\n\nLet me think about possible cases where the original three tiles don't form a mentsu, but adding one or two tiles can form one.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: Adding one tile to form a triplet. For example, if two of the tiles are same, adding another same tile. Like if the original tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then adding another 1m would make a triplet. But wait, the original three tiles are not a triplet. So the current count is two of one tile. So need one more.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Also, for sequences, perhaps adding one tile can complete a sequence.\n\nLike for example, the original tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Then adding 3s would form a sequence. So in that case, the answer is 1.\n\nOr, if the original tiles are 1s, 3s, 4s. Then adding 2s gives a sequence. So again 1.\n\nBut what if the original three tiles can't form a sequence or triplet, but adding two tiles can?\n\nFor example, if the original tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then adding one 1m makes a triplet. So that's 1 tile. Alternatively, adding 3m would allow a sequence of 1,2,3. So that's also 1 tile. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo in this case, the answer is 1.\n\nSo the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that in the combined set, there exists a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, for each of the three original tiles, check if there's already a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nOtherwise, check for possible ways to reach a mentsu with adding 1 tile, then 2, etc.\n\nBut since the answer is minimal, we need to check for the earliest possible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each case:\n\nCheck if the current three tiles form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check whether adding one tile can make a mentsu. If possible, return 1.\n\nElse, check whether adding two tiles can make a mentsu. Return 2.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible required? Let's think.\n\nSuppose the original tiles are all different and not in sequence, and not same. For example, 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, to form a triplet, you need two more tiles (e.g., add two 1m's to make triplet). But for sequence, you need to add two tiles. For example, add 2m and 3m. So the total tiles would be 1m, 2m, 3m. So that's a sequence. So in this case, adding two tiles. So the answer is 2.\n\nBut maybe there's a scenario where adding two tiles can form a triplet. Like, if you have two of the same tile, and then adding another one. Wait, but that would require adding one tile. So for example, if the original tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then adding one more 1m makes triplet. So answer is 1.\n\nSo the minimal steps would be 1 in this case.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each input case:\n\nCheck if there's already a mentsu. If yes, 0.\n\nElse, check if adding one tile can form a mentsu. If yes, 1.\n\nElse, check if adding two tiles can form a mentsu. If yes, 2.\n\nBut how to check for these possibilities?\n\nLet me think about how to check for possible ways to add tiles.\n\nFirst, for the case of adding one tile.\n\nPossible scenarios:\n\nEither:\n\n- Form a triplet by adding one tile. For example, if two of the same tile exist. Then adding one more.\n\nOR\n\n- Form a sequence by adding one tile. For example, if the three tiles can be extended into a sequence by adding one tile.\n\nSo for example, if the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 4s. Adding 3s would form a sequence. Or if the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s (already a sequence, so answer 0).\n\nBut for the case where the original three are not forming a mentsu, but adding one can.\n\nSo, for the triplet possibility: check if there are two same tiles. Then, adding one more.\n\nFor example, original tiles are [a, a, b]. Then adding a would form triplet.\n\nSimilarly, if the original tiles are [a, b, c], where two are same, but not three. Like [a, a, b], then adding a would make triplet.\n\nSo for the triplet case, check if any of the counts of the tiles is two. Because then adding one more would make three.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the original three tiles are [a, a, a], then it's already a triplet. But that case would have been checked in the initial check.\n\nSo, for the case where adding one tile can create a triplet, the original three must have exactly two of a certain tile, and the third is different.\n\nSo for the triplet possibility, check if there's a tile that occurs twice. If so, then adding one more of that tile would create a triplet. So in that case, the answer is 1.\n\nBut also, for the sequence possibility. How to check if adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nFor example, the original tiles are [1s, 2s, 4s]. Adding 3s would form a sequence. So how can we check if adding one tile can make a sequence?\n\nWe need to check if the three tiles can be part of a sequence, and missing one tile.\n\nSo for the three tiles, they must be in the same suit. Then, check if the numbers can form a consecutive triplet when adding one tile.\n\nFor example, the three numbers could be 1,2,4. Then, adding 3 would form 1,2,3,4. So there's a sequence of 1,2,3 or 2,3,4. But in this case, the original three tiles are 1,2,4. Adding 3 allows sequences 1-2-3 or 2-3-4. So the three tiles plus the added one can form a sequence.\n\nSo how to check this?\n\nFirst, all three tiles must be in the same suit. Otherwise, even adding one tile can't form a sequence (since sequence requires same suit). So, for example, if the original three tiles are in different suits, then adding one tile can't form a sequence. So, the only way to form a sequence is if the original three are in same suit, and the numbers can be extended with one tile.\n\nSo, for the sequence possibility, the steps are:\n\nCheck if all three tiles are in the same suit. If not, then can't form a sequence by adding one tile.\n\nIf they are in the same suit, then collect their numbers. Let's sort them. Then check if they can form a sequence with one missing tile.\n\nFor example, sorted numbers are [1, 2, 4]. The missing number is 3. So adding 3 would allow a sequence.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 4]. Then, adding 2 would allow 1-2-3, or adding 5 would allow 3-4-5. So in this case, adding one tile would allow a sequence.\n\nAnother example: [2,3,4]. Then, already a sequence. So answer is 0.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3]. Already a sequence, answer 0.\n\nSo, for the three numbers in same suit, sorted as x, y, z. We can check if the numbers can be part of a sequence with one missing.\n\nSo, the possible scenarios for the three numbers:\n\nCase 1: x, x+1, x+2 → already a sequence. So no need to add.\n\nCase 2: x, x+1, x+3 → missing x+2. So adding x+2.\n\nCase 3: x, x+2, x+3 → missing x+1. Adding x+1.\n\nCase 4: x, x+1, x+4 → missing x+2 and x+3. So can't form a sequence with adding one tile.\n\nWait, but for example, if the numbers are [1,2,4], adding 3 would allow a sequence of 1,2,3. So that's one tile.\n\nSimilarly, if the numbers are [1,3,4], adding 2 would allow 1,2,3. Or adding 5 would allow 3,4,5. So in that case, adding one tile would suffice.\n\nSo, for the three numbers in same suit, sorted as a, b, c. Check if there is a gap of 1 between any two consecutive numbers. For example, if a and b are consecutive, and b and c are not. Then, adding the missing number between b and c. Or if a and b are not consecutive, but b and c are. Then adding the missing between a and b. Or if a and b are not consecutive, and b and c are not. Then, check if the gap between a and b is 2, and between b and c is 1. Then adding a+1. Or similar.\n\nAlternatively, the three numbers can be considered. For the three numbers, the maximum possible consecutive numbers is 3. So, for example, if the three numbers are 1, 2, 4. Then, the maximum consecutive is 2 (1,2). So adding 3 would allow 1,2,3. Similarly, if the three numbers are 1,3,4, adding 2 would allow 1,2,3. So the idea is that the three numbers must have at least two consecutive numbers, and the third is one step away from one of them.\n\nAlternatively, the three numbers can be checked for whether they can form a sequence when adding one tile. For that, after sorting, the numbers must satisfy either:\n\n- The difference between the first and second is 1, and between the second and third is 2. Then adding the third's value -1.\n\n- The difference between the first and second is 2, and between the second and third is 1. Then adding the first's value +1.\n\n- The difference between the first and second is 1, and between the second and third is 1. Then already a sequence.\n\n- The difference between the first and second is 1, and between the second and third is more than 1. Then, adding the third's value -1.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to check if the three numbers can be part of a sequence of three consecutive numbers. For example, the three numbers must be such that the maximum minus the minimum is 2, and there's exactly one missing number. For example, if the numbers are 1,2,4. max - min is 3. So that's not possible. But if the numbers are 1,2,3, then max - min is 2. So that's okay.\n\nWait, for three numbers to be part of a sequence of three consecutive numbers, the max - min must be 2. Because, for example, 1,2,3: max - min is 2. If there's a gap, like 1,2,4: max - min is 3. So that's not possible. So if the three numbers have max - min equal to 2, then they must be consecutive. So if the three numbers are sorted as a, b, c, and c - a = 2, then they form a sequence. Otherwise, not.\n\nBut if the three numbers have max - min equal to 1, then they are all same or consecutive? For example, 1,1,2: max - min is 1. But they are not a sequence. However, adding one tile (another 1 would make triplet, but adding 3 would allow 1,2,3. So in this case, adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nWait, but the original three tiles are not in a sequence. So the three numbers may have max - min less than 2, but not forming a sequence. For example, 1,1,2. Max - min is 1. But they are not a sequence. So how can we check if adding one tile can form a sequence?\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nIf all three are in same suit, then check if the three numbers can form a sequence when adding one tile. To do this, we can look for the possible positions where adding one tile would complete the sequence.\n\nLet me think of the sorted numbers as a, b, c.\n\nIf the three numbers are in same suit, then:\n\nCheck if there's a way to add one tile to form a sequence. For example, the possible scenarios are:\n\nCase 1: a, a, a. Then, already a triplet. So handled earlier.\n\nCase 2: a, a, b. Then, adding a third a would make triplet, or adding a tile to form a sequence. For example, if a=1, b=2. Then adding 3 would form a sequence of 1,2,3. So in this case, adding one tile.\n\nCase 3: a, b, c where a, b, c are not forming a sequence, but adding one tile can.\n\nSo for example, sorted numbers are a, b, c. If the numbers are a, a+1, a+2 → already a sequence. So no need.\n\nIf they are a, a+1, a+3 → then adding a+2 would form a sequence of a, a+1, a+2.\n\nOr a, a+2, a+3 → adding a+1 would form a sequence of a, a+1, a+2.\n\nOr a, a+1, a+4 → adding a+2 or a+3. But then, adding one tile would allow a sequence of a, a+1, a+2 (if adding a+2) or a+2, a+3, a+4 (if adding a+2? No. Wait, if the original numbers are a, a+1, a+4. Adding a+2 would allow a sequence of a, a+1, a+2. Or adding a+3 would allow a sequence of a+1, a+3, a+4? No, because they need to be consecutive. a+1, a+3, a+4 are not consecutive. So adding a+2 would allow the sequence a, a+1, a+2. So that's possible. So in this case, adding one tile.\n\nSo, in general, if the three numbers are in same suit, and after sorting, the numbers can be covered by a sequence of three consecutive numbers with exactly one missing, then adding that missing tile would form a sequence.\n\nSo how to check that?\n\nFor the sorted numbers a, b, c:\n\nCheck if the max of the three is <= a + 2. Because, if the max is a+2, then the three numbers are a, a+1, a+2 → already a sequence.\n\nBut if the max is a+3, then maybe there is a way to add a tile. For example, a, a+1, a+3. Then adding a+2 would form a sequence.\n\nBut if the numbers are a, a+2, a+3 → adding a+1.\n\nSo, the condition is that the max is at most a + 2 (but that's only when the three numbers are consecutive), or the max is a+3 and the numbers are a, a+1, a+3 (so adding a+2) or a, a+2, a+3 (adding a+1). Or similar.\n\nAlternatively, the following logic can be used:\n\nFor the three numbers, sorted as x, y, z.\n\nIf (y == x+1 and z == y+1) → already a sequence. So no need.\n\nElse if (y == x+1 and z == y+2) → then adding z-1 (which is y+1) would form a sequence. So adding one tile.\n\nElse if (y == x+2 and z == y+1) → same as above. Wait, but sorted x < y < z. So if x, y, z is sorted, then y can't be x+2 and z can be y+1. Because z is larger than y. So that's not possible. So the case would be x, x+2, x+3. Then, adding x+1 would form a sequence.\n\nSo for sorted x, y, z:\n\nCheck if there is a gap of 2 between x and y, and y and z are consecutive. So x, x+2, x+3. Then adding x+1.\n\nOr a gap of 2 between y and z. So x, x+1, x+3. Then adding x+2.\n\nOr, if there is a gap of 1 between x and y, and a gap of 2 between y and z. Then adding y+1.\n\nSo, in any case, if the three numbers are in same suit and the maximum difference between any two is 3, and there's exactly one gap of 2, then adding one tile.\n\nSo, for the three numbers in same suit, if the maximum is x + 2, then it's a sequence. Else, if the maximum is x + 3, then check if the numbers are x, x+1, x+3 → adding x+2. Or x, x+2, x+3 → adding x+1. Or x, x+1, x+2 → already a sequence.\n\nSo, the code for checking whether adding one tile can form a sequence would be:\n\nif all three are same suit:\n\n   sorted_numbers = sorted([n1, n2, n3])\n\n   if sorted_numbers[2] - sorted_numbers[0] <= 2:\n\n       if sorted_numbers[2] - sorted_numbers[0] == 2:\n\n           # check if they are consecutive. For example, 1,2,3.\n\n           # but if the numbers are 1,1,3 → sorted as 1,1,3. Then the difference is 2, but not consecutive. So need to check.\n\n           # So the actual check is that the numbers are consecutive. So for example, the three numbers are 1,2,3. Then yes.\n\n           # So in this case, the numbers must be consecutive. So:\n\n           if sorted_numbers[1] == sorted_numbers[0] + 1 and sorted_numbers[2] == sorted_numbers[1] + 1:\n\n               # already a sequence. So no need to add.\n\n               pass\n\n           else:\n\n               # like 1,1,3 → difference is 2, but not consecutive. So adding one tile?\n\n               # for example, adding 2 would make 1,1,2,3. Then can form a sequence of 1,2,3. So yes.\n\n               # So in this case, adding one tile.\n\n               # So return True.\n\n               return True\n\n       else:\n\n           # the difference is 1. So for example, 1,1,2. Then adding one tile (like 3) to form a sequence.\n\n           # Or, maybe adding 1 to make triplet.\n\n           # But for the purpose of checking if adding one tile can form a sequence, yes.\n\n           # So in this case, adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\n           # So return True.\n\n           return True\n\n   else:\n\n       # the difference is larger than 2. So can't form a sequence by adding one tile.\n\n       # for example, 1,2,4 → difference is 3. Adding 3 would form 1,2,3. So yes.\n\n       # So check if the numbers can be covered by a sequence with one missing.\n\n       # For example, the three numbers are x, y, z. sorted.\n\n       # check if (y == x+1 and z == y+2) → then add y+1.\n\n       # or (x == y-1 and z == y+1) → then add y-1 or y+1? No, wait, if x, y, z are 1,2,4. Then y is 2, z is 4. So x is 1, y is 2, z is 4. So y is x+1, and z is y + 2. So adding y+1 (3) gives a sequence.\n\n       # So, check if (z - y == 2 and y - x == 1) → then adding y+1.\n\n       # Or if (y - x == 2 and z - y == 1) → then adding x+1.\n\n       # Or if (z - x == 2 and y is x+1 and z is x+2) → already covered earlier.\n\n       # So:\n\n       if (sorted_numbers[1] == sorted_numbers[0] + 1 and sorted_numbers[2] == sorted_numbers[1] + 2):\n\n           return True\n\n       elif (sorted_numbers[1] == sorted_numbers[0] + 2 and sorted_numbers[2] == sorted_numbers[1] + 1):\n\n           return True\n\n       else:\n\n           # for example, 1,3,5. Then adding one tile can't form a sequence.\n\n           return False\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe a better approach is to check if the three numbers can be part of a sequence of three consecutive numbers when adding one tile. For that, the three numbers must have at least two consecutive numbers, and the third is adjacent to one of them.\n\nAlternatively, for the three numbers, the number of unique values is 2 or 3.\n\nFor example, if there are two unique numbers, like 1,1,2. Then adding one of them can form a sequence (adding 3 for 1,2,3) or forming a triplet (adding 1). So in this case, adding one tile can form either a triplet or a sequence. So the answer would be 1.\n\nBut how to check for that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can be written as follows:\n\nIf all three are same suit:\n\n   collect the numbers in a list, sorted as x, y, z.\n\n   if x == y == z: already a triplet → handled earlier.\n\n   else:\n\n       check if there exists a sequence of three consecutive numbers that includes at least two of the existing numbers, and adding one tile can fill the missing one.\n\nSo for example, for x, y, z:\n\nthe possible sequences could be:\n\n[x, x+1, x+2], [x-1, x, x+1], [x, x+1, x+2], etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for the three numbers, check if the maximum number is less than or equal to x+2. If so, then adding the missing number.\n\nBut I think this is getting too complicated.\n\nPerhaps, for the case of adding one tile to form a sequence, the code can check for the following:\n\nCheck if the three numbers can be part of a sequence of three consecutive numbers when adding one tile. That is, the three numbers must have two consecutive numbers, and the third is one step away from one of them.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nAnother approach: for the three numbers, generate all possible sequences that can be formed by adding one tile. For example, for the three numbers, check for each possible tile that can be added (in the same suit) whether adding that tile creates a sequence.\n\nBut since the suit is fixed, and the numbers are from 1-9, perhaps for the three numbers, we can generate all possible numbers that can be added (from 1-9) and check if any of them forms a sequence.\n\nBut since the original three are in the same suit, adding any tile in that suit would be considered.\n\nSo, for example, given the three numbers [1,2,4], adding 3 would allow the sequence 1,2,3. So the code would check if any of the possible numbers (from 1-9) when added to the existing three can form a sequence.\n\nBut how to check that efficiently?\n\nFor the three numbers, sorted as x, y, z. After adding a new number, say 'a', the four numbers must contain a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n\nSo, the four numbers (including a) must have at least three consecutive numbers.\n\nBut since the original three are in same suit, and the added tile is also same suit, the four numbers are all same suit.\n\nSo, the code can check for all possible a (from 1-9) whether adding a to the three numbers would allow a sequence.\n\nBut since the added tile is one, and the original three are three, the total is four. We need to check if any three of those four form a sequence.\n\nBut this seems computationally feasible for small numbers.\n\nSo, for example, for the three numbers, generate all possible a (from 1-9), and for each a, check if the four numbers (original three plus a) contain a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n\nBut since the original three are in same suit, and a is same suit, we can proceed.\n\nBut since the code is for a single test case, and the possible a is 9 possibilities, it's manageable.\n\nSo for the code:\n\ndef can_form_sequence_with_one_addition(suit, numbers):\n\n    # numbers is a list of three integers, sorted.\n\n    # check if adding any one number (from 1-9) will allow a sequence.\n\n    for a in range(1, 10):\n\n        temp = numbers + [a]\n\n        temp.sort()\n\n        # check if any three consecutive in temp.\n\n        # check all possible triplets in temp.\n\n        # since temp has four elements, there are C(4,3) = 4 possible triplets.\n\n        for i in range(4):\n\n            for j in range(i+1, 4):\n\n                for k in range(j+1, 4):\n\n                    triplet = [temp[i], temp[j], temp[k]]\n\n                    triplet.sort()\n\n                    if triplet[2] - triplet[0] == 2 and triplet[1] - triplet[0] == 1 and triplet[2] - triplet[1] == 1:\n\n                        return True\n\n    return False\n\nBut this is O(9 * 4) operations, which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there is a smarter way. However, for the problem, since the input is small, this approach is acceptable.\n\nSo, for the original three tiles, if they are all same suit, then check if adding any one tile can form a sequence. If yes, then the answer is 1.\n\nSo, combining all this, the steps for the code would be:\n\nFor each input case:\n\nParse the three tiles into their suit and numbers.\n\nCheck if the three tiles already form a mentsu (triplet or sequence). If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if adding one tile can form a mentsu. How?\n\nCheck for triplet possibility:\n\nCheck if any of the counts of the tiles is 2. For example, if two of the tiles are same. Then adding one more would form a triplet. So for example, if the three tiles are [a, a, b], then adding a would form a triplet. So this is possible. So if there are two same tiles, then the answer can be 1.\n\nCheck for sequence possibility: as discussed, using the function above.\n\nIf either of these is possible, then the answer is 1.\n\nElse, check if adding two tiles can form a mentsu. What's the minimal possible here?\n\nWell, for example, if the original three are all different and not in same suit, then adding two tiles can form a triplet (like adding two same tiles to form triplet with existing one). Or adding two tiles to form a sequence.\n\nBut the minimal is 2.\n\nBut how to check if adding two tiles can form a mentsu?\n\nWell, the answer is always 2 in this case. Because:\n\nIf the original three cannot form a mentsu with adding one tile, then the minimal number is 2.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nBecause:\n\nIn the worst case, adding two tiles can form a triplet. For example, original three are [a, b, c], all different. Then adding two a's would form a triplet. So answer is 2.\n\nAlternatively, adding two tiles to form a sequence. For example, if the three tiles are [1m, 3m, 5m]. Adding 2m and 4m would allow the sequence 1,2,3,4,5. But any three consecutive numbers. So adding two tiles would allow a sequence.\n\nBut in this case, the answer is 2.\n\nSo, if after checking for adding one tile, the answer is not possible, then the minimal is 2.\n\nWait, but is there any case where adding two tiles is not sufficient?\n\nNo, because adding two tiles can always form a triplet. For example, if the original three are all different, then adding two of the same tile as one of the existing ones.\n\nSo for example, original is [a, b, c], then adding two a's would make a triplet. So the answer is 2.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as:\n\nif the original three do not form a mentsu, and adding one tile can't form a mentsu, then answer is 2.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where adding two tiles can form a sequence with fewer than two tiles? No, because adding two tiles is required.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where adding two tiles is not enough? Well, no. Because adding two tiles can form a triplet (as explained), which is a mentsu.\n\nSo the minimal steps are 0, 1, or 2.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCheck for existing mentsu → 0.\n\nElse, check if adding one tile can form a mentsu (either via triplet or sequence). If yes → 1.\n\nElse → 2.\n\nSo now, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nFor each of the three input tiles:\n\nParse into a list of (number, suit) pairs.\n\nCheck if there's a mentsu:\n\nCheck for triplet: all three tiles are same.\n\nCheck for sequence: all three are same suit, and numbers are consecutive.\n\nIf either is true → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if adding one tile can form a mentsu:\n\nCheck for triplet possibility: any two same tiles. Because adding one more would make triplet.\n\nFor example, if the counts of the tiles are [2, 1, 0], etc. So if any tile appears twice.\n\nSo for example, the three tiles are [a, a, b]. Then, adding a would form triplet. So in this case, the answer is 1.\n\nSo, check if any of the three tiles occurs at least two times. Because then adding one more would form a triplet.\n\nBut how to check that? For example, the three tiles could be [a, a, b], [a, b, a], etc. So count the frequency of each tile.\n\nIf any tile has count >= 2, then adding one more would form a triplet. So yes.\n\nSo for the triplet possibility, check if there are at least two same tiles.\n\nBut also, the sequence possibility: check if adding one tile can form a sequence. Which we can check via the function discussed earlier.\n\nIf either of these is possible → answer is 1.\n\nElse, answer is 2.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nParsing the input:\n\nEach input is three strings, e.g., '1s 2s 3s' → split into three tiles.\n\nBut in the example input given, the input is given as a list of three strings. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\n\nSo the input is three strings, separated by spaces. For example, the sample input is:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nWait, no. Wait, the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of three strings, but that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, looking at the problem statement:\n\nSample input:\n\nInput:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nOutput:\n\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nBut that's probably not the actual input format. Probably, the input is three strings on a single line. For example, the first case is \"1s 2s 3s\".\n\nBut the problem says: \"the only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\"\n\nSo the input is three strings, separated by spaces, on one line. For example, the first sample input is \"1s 2s 3s\".\n\nSo, the code should read a line, split into three parts.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would be:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nSo, tiles is a list of three strings, each representing a tile.\n\nThen, process each of the three cases. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is three tiles, and the output is the answer for that case. But looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input shows three different cases, but the sample input seems to be three separate test cases. But the problem says that the input is three strings, which implies that it's one test case. But the sample input shows three different inputs and outputs, which may be a formatting error. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand.\n\nSample input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample output:\n\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nBut this seems to be a mistake in the problem statement. Because the input is supposed to be three strings on one line. But the sample input shows three different inputs, each with three strings, which suggests that the actual input is multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is three strings. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but in reality, each line is a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line with three strings. Therefore, the sample input is probably written as three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to handle one test case per input.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is three strings. So the code reads three strings and outputs one integer.\n\nBut the sample input shows three different input lines, each with three strings. But the sample output has three outputs. Therefore, the problem may have multiple test cases, each with three tiles, and the code should process each line of input as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is \"the only line contains three strings\".\n\nThis is confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['0', '0', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that the input is three test cases, each with three tiles. But the problem says that the input is one line with three strings. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that represents three test cases, but the actual input is one line per test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So perhaps the code should read multiple lines, each line being a test case. However, the problem's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid meld (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand.
