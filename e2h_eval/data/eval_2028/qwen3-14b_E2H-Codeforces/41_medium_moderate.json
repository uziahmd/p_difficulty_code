There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the task is to build houses on n spots, each with a height between 0 and h. The profit is the sum of squares of each house's height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that the maximum height in a certain interval [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. I have to find the maximum possible profit under all these constraints.\n\nHmm. How to approach this? Since n and h are up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach is possible. But even then, for each of the n houses, there are h+1 possibilities. For n=50, that's 51^50 possibilities, which is way too big. So brute force is impossible.\n\nAlternative idea: think of it as an optimization problem with constraints. The constraints are that for each restriction, the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. How can we model this?\n\nAnother thought: since each restriction imposes that the maximum in some interval is at most x_i, perhaps we can model this by determining for each position the maximum allowed height, considering all restrictions that apply to it. But how?\n\nWait, but the restrictions are not per position. For example, a restriction on [1,3] that the max is <= x affects all positions in that interval. So, if there's a restriction that says that in [1,3], the max is <= 2, then each of the three positions can be at most 2. However, if there's another restriction on [1,1] that allows up to 3, then the first position can be up to 3, but the other two can't exceed 2. But how do we find for each position what is the maximum possible height it can have, given all the restrictions?\n\nBut maybe that's not straightforward. Because for a particular position, the maximum allowed height depends on all the intervals that include it. For example, if there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, and another on [2,4] with x=3. Then the first position can be up to 2 (because of the first restriction), the second can be up to min(2,3) = 2, third can be up to min(2,3) = 2, fourth can be up to 3. But if there's another restriction on [1,4] with x=5, then all positions can be up to 5, but the first restriction would limit them to 2.\n\nSo perhaps, for each position, the maximum possible height is the minimum of h and all x_i from restrictions that cover that position. Wait, no. Because a restriction on [l_i, r_i] says that the maximum in that interval is at most x_i. Which implies that each individual house in that interval can be at most x_i. Because if any house in the interval was higher than x_i, then the maximum would be higher than x_i, violating the restriction. Therefore, for each restriction, all houses in [l_i, r_i] must be <= x_i. So, for each position j, the maximum possible height is the minimum between h and the minimum of all x_i where the restriction's interval includes j.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because if there are multiple restrictions that apply to j. For example, suppose there's a restriction on [1,2] with x=3, and another on [1,3] with x=2. Then for position 1, the maximum is min(3,2) = 2. For position 2, the maximum is min(3,2) = 2. For position 3, the maximum is 2. But if there's a restriction on [3,3] with x=5, then position 3 can be up to min(2,5) = 2. So, the maximum height for each position j is the minimum of h and all x_i from restrictions that include j in their interval.\n\nWait, but that's only if each restriction applies to the entire interval. So, for each position j, the maximum allowed height is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i over all restrictions that include j in their [l_i, r_i] interval. Because each such restriction requires that the maximum in that interval is <= x_i. Which implies that every house in that interval must be <= x_i. Therefore, for each j, the maximum possible height is min(h, min{ x_i | restriction i includes j }).\n\nBut wait, this approach might not account for overlapping restrictions. For example, suppose there are two restrictions: one on [1,3] with x=2, and another on [2,2] with x=3. Then for position 2, the first restriction says it can be at most 2, and the second allows up to 3. So the overall maximum is 2. So taking the minimum of all x_i that cover j is correct.\n\nIf that's the case, then the problem reduces to for each position j, find the maximum possible height allowed, which is the minimum of h and the minimum x_i among all restrictions that cover j. Then, set each house to that maximum value. Then the profit is sum of squares of those values.\n\nBut wait, that can't be right. Because the restrictions are about the maximum in the interval. Suppose that for a certain interval, the restrictions require that the maximum is at most x. But if all houses in the interval are set to x, then the maximum is x, which satisfies the restriction. However, if there's a restriction that requires the maximum in [1,3] to be at most 2, and another that requires the maximum in [1,2] to be at most 3. Then the first restriction requires that all houses in [1,3] are at most 2. So the second restriction is redundant. So the maximum for each house in [1,3] is 2. But if there are multiple restrictions, the minimal x_i that covers the position is the limiting factor.\n\nBut then, if that's the case, then the approach is:\n\nFor each position j, compute the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include j in their interval. Then, the maximum allowed for j is min( h, that minimal x_i ). Then, set each house to that value, and sum the squares.\n\nBut wait, let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → covers position 1. So for position 1, the minimal x is 1. So max height is 1.\n\n2 2 3 → position 2, minimal x is 3. So max height is 3.\n\n3 3 2 → position 3, minimal x is 2. So max height is 2.\n\nSum is 1² + 3² + 2² = 1 +9 +4 =14, which matches the sample output. So that works.\n\nSecond example input:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → covers positions 2 and 3.\n\n3 4 7 → covers positions 3 and 4.\n\nSo for each position:\n\nposition 1: no restrictions, so min x is h=10. So 10.\n\nposition 2: covered by restriction 1 (x=8). So 8.\n\nposition 3: covered by both restrictions. The minimal x is min(8,7) =7. So 7.\n\nposition 4: covered by restriction 2 (x=7). So 7.\n\nSo sum is 10² +8² +7² +7² = 100 +64 +49 +49 = 262, which matches the sample. So this approach works here.\n\nAnother test case: suppose there are two restrictions. One on [1,2] with x=3, and another on [2,3] with x=2. Then for position 2, the minimal x is 2. So the maximum for position 2 is 2. But for the first restriction, the maximum in [1,2] must be <=3. However, since position 2 is 2, and position 1 can be up to 3. But according to our approach, position 1 is covered by the first restriction (x=3). So its maximum is 3. So the maximum in [1,2] is 3, which is allowed. So that's okay.\n\nBut what if there is a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, and another on [2,2] with x=3. Then for position 2, the minimal x is 2 (from the first restriction). So the maximum is 2. The first restriction is satisfied because the max in [1,3] is 2. The second restriction allows up to 3, but since the max is 2, it's okay.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the problem reduces to for each position, compute the minimal x_i of all restrictions that include that position, and then take the minimum between that and h. Then, the maximum profit is the sum of squares of those values.\n\nBut wait, why is this correct? Because each restriction requires that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is <= x_i. If for each position j in [l_i, r_i], the maximum allowed is <= x_i, then the maximum in the interval is <= x_i. So the approach of setting each position to the minimal x_i (over all restrictions that cover it) ensures that all restrictions are satisfied.\n\nBut what if there's a restriction that says the maximum in [1,3] must be <= 2, but there's another restriction that says the maximum in [1,2] must be <=3. Then, for positions 1 and 2, their maximums are min(2,3) =2. So the first restriction is satisfied. But the second restriction allows up to 3. However, the maximum in [1,2] is 2, which is <=3. So the approach works.\n\nThus, the problem can be solved by:\n\nFor each position j (from 1 to n), find the minimal x_i among all restrictions that include j in their interval. Then, the maximum allowed height for j is min( h, that minimal x_i ). Then, sum the squares of these values.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For each position j (1-based), collect all restrictions that have l_i <= j <= r_i.\n\n2. For each j, compute the minimal x_i among those restrictions. If there are no such restrictions, then the maximum is h.\n\n3. The maximum allowed height for j is min( h, min_x ), where min_x is the minimal x_i from the restrictions that cover j.\n\nThen, the answer is sum (max_height[j]^2) for all j.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think. For each position j in 1..n:\n\nInitialize min_x as h (since if there are no restrictions covering j, then the maximum is h).\n\nThen, for each restriction, check if j is in [l_i, r_i]. If yes, then take the x_i and compare with current min_x. For each such restriction, min_x is the minimum of all x_i's for restrictions that cover j.\n\nSo, for each j, iterate through all m restrictions, check if j is in [l_i, r_i], and track the minimum x_i.\n\nYes, that's manageable.\n\nNow, code-wise, for each j from 1 to n:\n\ncurrent_min = h\n\nfor each restriction in m restrictions:\n\n   if l_i <= j <= r_i:\n\n      if x_i < current_min:\n\n         current_min = x_i\n\nthen, the allowed height is current_min.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nThen, read m restrictions as a list of tuples (l_i, r_i, x_i).\n\nThen, for each position j from 1 to n:\n\n   min_x = h\n\n   for each restriction in the list:\n\n      if l_i <= j <= r_i:\n\n          if x_i < min_x:\n\n              min_x = x_i\n\n   allowed_height = min_x\n\n   total += allowed_height ** 2\n\nThen output total.\n\nWait, but this would be O(n*m) time. For n and m up to 50, that's 50*50=2500 operations. That's very manageable.\n\nBut let's test this against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nrestrictions are:\n\n(1,1,1), (2,2,3), (3,3,2)\n\nfor j=1:\n\ncheck each restriction. Only the first applies. min_x is 1. allowed is 1.\n\nj=2: second restriction applies, x=3. min_x is 3. allowed is 3.\n\nj=3: third restriction applies, x=2. allowed is 2. sum is 1+9+4=14. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nrestrictions are (2,3,8), (3,4,7).\n\nfor j=1:\n\nno restrictions apply. min_x is h=10. allowed is 10.\n\nj=2: first restriction applies (2-3). x=8. min_x is 8.\n\nj=3: both restrictions apply. x=8 and 7. min is 7.\n\nj=4: second restriction applies (3-4). x=7. allowed is 7.\n\nsum 10² +8² +7² +7² = 100 + 64 + 49 +49 = 262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say, n=2, h=5, m=1. Restriction is l=1, r=2, x=3. Then for j=1 and 2, min_x is 3. sum is 3² +3² = 18.\n\nAnother case: n=2, h=5, m=2. Restriction1: l=1, r=1, x=4. Restriction2: l=2, r=2, x=3. Then for j=1, min_x is 4. j=2, min_x is 3. sum 16 +9 =25.\n\nBut what if there is a restriction that covers a range, but there's another restriction that covers a subset. Like:\n\nn=2, m=2. Restriction1: l=1, r=2, x=3. Restriction2: l=1, r=1, x=4. So for j=1, the restrictions that cover it are both. The min x is 3. For j=2, only restriction1 applies. So allowed is 3. So sum is 3² +3² = 18. Which is correct, because the first restriction requires the max in [1,2] to be <=3. So even though the second restriction allows j=1 to be up to 4, the first restriction requires it to be up to 3.\n\nSo the approach works.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward. Now, how to code this.\n\nRead the input. The input can be multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the example input:\n\nThe input is given as a list of inputs, but in the problem statement, the input is given as a single input. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. Then, the output is the answer.\n\nBut in the example input, there are two test cases. Wait, the example input shows two different inputs, with outputs. But in the problem statement, the input is given as a single test case. Wait, the example shows two separate test cases. But in the actual programming problem, the user would input one test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as per the first line, etc. So for the code, the input is read once. However, the example shows two test cases. But in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, perhaps the example shows two separate test cases, but in the code, we need to read a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m. Then m lines follow. So the code needs to read one test case. But in the example, the input is given as two separate test cases. But perhaps that's just for showing the sample input and output. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nand output is 14. Then the second input is 4 10 2 ... etc. So the code is supposed to process one test case, not multiple.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read from stdin. So the code should read the input as follows:\n\nRead the first line as n, h, m.\n\nThen read m lines, each with l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nThen compute the answer.\n\nSo the code is for a single test case.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the input. For example, in the first sample, the input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nSo the code should read that, process it, and output 14.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n, h, m from input.\n\nThen read m lines, each with l, r, x.\n\nStore them as a list of tuples.\n\nThen, for each position j from 1 to n:\n\nInitialize min_x as h.\n\nFor each restriction in the list:\n\nif l_i <= j <= r_i:\n\n   if x_i < min_x:\n\n      min_x = x_i\n\nallowed_height = min_x\n\nAdd allowed_height squared to the total.\n\nThen print the total.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code that in Python.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input may be read via input().split().\n\nBut note that in some cases, the input may be given with multiple lines. For example, the first line is n, h, m, then m lines follow.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nrestrictions = []\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor j in range(1, n+1):\n\n    min_x = h\n\n    for (l, r, x) in restrictions:\n\n        if l <= j <= r:\n\n            if x < min_x:\n\n                min_x = x\n\n    total += min_x ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in the first sample, for j=1, the restriction is l=1, r=1, x=1. So the code checks if 1<=j<=1. So yes. min_x is 1. So allowed is 1. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the code on the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nOutput: 14. Which is correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor j=1:\n\nno restrictions apply. min_x is 10. So 10^2 = 100.\n\nj=2: check restrictions. First restriction (2-3) applies. x=8. min_x is 8. So 64.\n\nj=3: both restrictions apply. x=8 and 7. min is 7. 49.\n\nj=4: second restriction (3-4) applies. x=7. 49. Total is 100+64+49+49=262. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: when there are overlapping restrictions. For example, n=2, m=2, restrictions (1,2,3) and (1,1,4). Then for j=1, min_x is 3 (since the first restriction applies, and the second has x=4. min is 3. For j=2, only first restriction applies, x=3. sum is 3² +3² = 18.\n\nAnother case: no restrictions. Then each position can be h. Sum is n * h².\n\nAnother case: a restriction that covers all positions. For example, n=5, h=10, m=1, restriction (1,5, 5). Then each position can be 5. sum 5*25=125.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about when a restriction's x_i is larger than h? For example, h=3, and a restriction on [1,1] with x=5. Then, the min_x is min(3, 5) =3. So the code correctly uses h as the upper bound.\n\nBut in the code, min_x is initialized as h. Then, for each restriction that covers j, if x_i is smaller than min_x, then min_x is updated. So if x_i is larger than h, then the code will not update min_x. So the allowed height is h. Which is correct.\n\nYes. Because the restriction says that the maximum in the interval is <=x_i. But since h is the maximum allowed, even if x_i is larger than h, the maximum allowed is h. So the code handles that.\n\nSo this code should be correct.\n\nNow, code that in Python. Also, note that the code must read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nRead m lines of restrictions.\n\nFor each j in 1..n:\n\n   min_x = h\n\n   for each restriction:\n\n      if l <= j <= r:\n\n         if x < min_x:\n\n             min_x = x\n\n   total += min_x **2\n\nPrint total.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code that in Python.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead input:\n\nBut sometimes, when reading input, there may be multiple lines. But in Python, input() reads line by line. So for the first line, after splitting, we get n, h, m.\n\nThen, for m lines, read each line as l, r, x.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nrestrictions = []\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    restrictions.append( (l, r, x) )\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor j in range(1, n+1):\n\n    min_x = h\n\n    for l, r, x in restrictions:\n\n        if l <= j <= r:\n\n            if x < min_x:\n\n                min_x = x\n\n    total += min_x ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nTesting it against the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nOutput is 14. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nOutput is 262. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, h=5, m=1. Restriction is 1 1 3. Then allowed is 3. sum 9. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, h=5, m=0. Then allowed is 5. sum 25.\n\nYes. So the code handles that.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street with given zoning restrictions. Each house can have a height between 0 and a maximum value h, and each restriction imposes a maximum height for the tallest house in a specific range. The goal is to maximize the profit, which is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Constraints**: Each restriction specifies that the tallest house in a given interval must not exceed a certain height. This implies that every house within that interval must be at most the specified height.\n2. **Determine Maximum Heights**: For each house position, determine the minimum height restriction that applies to it. This is because if a house is part of multiple intervals, the strictest (minimum) restriction will govern its maximum height.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: Once the maximum allowable height for each house is determined, compute the profit by summing the squares of these heights.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\nrestrictions = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n    restrictions.append((l, r, x))\n\ntotal = 0\nfor j in range(1, n + 1):\n    min_x = h\n    for l, r, x in restrictions:\n        if l <= j <= r:\n            if x < min_x:\n                min_x = x\n    total += min_x ** 2\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains the number of spots (n), the maximum height (h), and the number of restrictions (m). The subsequent lines contain the restrictions.\n2. **Processing Restrictions**: For each house position from 1 to n, we determine the minimum height restriction that applies to it by checking all restrictions. If a restriction applies to the current position, we update the minimum height allowed for that position.\n3. **Calculating Profit**: For each house, after determining the maximum allowable height based on restrictions, we compute the profit by squaring this height and summing these values across all houses.\n\nThis approach ensures that all restrictions are respected while maximizing the profit by leveraging the minimum restrictions for each house position efficiently.
