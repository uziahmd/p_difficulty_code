Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the maximum number of compatible left-right boot pairs. Each pair must consist of one left and one right boot, and their colors need to be compatible. The compatibility rules are: same specific color, or at least one of them is a question mark. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair. \n\nFirst, I need to think about how to maximize the pairs. Let's think about the approach.\n\nHmm. The main idea is to match the left and right boots in a way that maximizes the count. Let's think about the possible strategies.\n\nLet me consider that for each left boot and right boot, we can pair them if their colors are compatible. But since we need to maximize the total pairs, it's not straightforward to just pair them greedily. However, given the constraints, maybe a greedy approach would work here.\n\nWait, but how to manage the question marks? Because a '?' can be matched with any other boot. But if we use a '?' for a specific color, maybe that's better than using it for a '?'.\n\nSo perhaps the plan is:\n\n1. First, match all the left boots with specific colors to right boots with the same color. For example, if there's a 'a' on the left, find a 'a' on the right. This would be the most direct matches.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently? Maybe count the frequency of each color on left and right, then for each color (excluding '?'), take the minimum of left and right counts, add that to the total. Then, for the remaining boots (those that couldn't be matched with their specific color), use the '?'s.\n\nWait, but that's not considering that some '?' can be used as wildcards. So maybe first, process the specific colors, then use the '?'s for the remaining.\n\nBut there's also the case where a left '?' can be paired with a right '?', but that's only if there are no other options.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nWe can split the problem into two parts:\n\n- Matching left and right boots with specific colors (non-?) that are the same.\n\n- Then, using the remaining left and right boots (including those with ?) to form pairs where either one or both are ?.\n\nBut how to handle this optimally?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nStep 1: Match all left and right boots with specific colors (non-?) that are the same. For example, for each color c (not ?), count how many left boots have c and how many right boots have c. The number of pairs for this is min(left_c, right_c). But we need to track which ones are matched.\n\nBut how to track which indices are used? Because once a left boot is matched with a right boot, they can't be used again.\n\nBut for the purpose of counting, maybe it's easier to first collect all the possible pairs and then manage the indices. But for the actual pairing, we need to track which boots are used.\n\nWait, but the problem requires us to output the actual pairs. So we need to track which boots are used. Therefore, perhaps we need to process the boots in a way that allows us to collect these pairs.\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\nFirst, for each color (non-?), create a list of positions (indices) where that color appears on the left and on the right. Then, for each color, pair as many as possible between the left and right lists. For example, for color 'a', take the first min(len(left_a), len(right_a)) pairs. Once paired, those boots are no longer available for other pairings.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, we can use a dictionary to count the number of each color on the left and right. Then, for each color c (non-?), the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Then, subtract that from both counts. Then, the remaining left and right boots (including ?) can be matched using the ?s.\n\nBut this approach would not account for the fact that some ?s can be matched with specific colors. For example, if there are left ?s and right a's, we can match them. Similarly, if there are left a's and right ?s, we can match them. And also, if there are left ?s and right ?s, we can match them.\n\nSo after processing the specific colors, we have:\n\nleft_remaining: all the left boots that are not yet matched (could be ? or specific colors that couldn't be matched because there were no corresponding right boots).\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nNow, we need to pair these remaining boots. How?\n\nFor the remaining left and right boots, we can:\n\n- For each left boot that is not ?, try to match with a right boot that is ?.\n\n- For each right boot that is not ?, try to match with a left boot that is ?.\n\n- Then, match the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nAnother approach is to collect:\n\nLeft_specific: left boots with specific colors (non-?) that couldn't be matched with their corresponding right boots.\n\nRight_specific: same for right boots.\n\nThen, for these left_specific and right_specific, we can try to pair them with ?s.\n\nFor example, a left_specific (say color 'a') can be matched with a right ? (since ? is compatible with any color). Similarly, a right_specific can be matched with a left ?.\n\nOnce those are handled, the remaining ?s can be matched between left and right.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. First, process all specific color pairs. For each color c (not ?), pair left and right boots with c. For this, we can collect the indices of left and right boots for each color. Then, pair them up, and mark them as used.\n\n2. After that, collect the remaining left boots (those not yet used) and remaining right boots.\n\n3. For the remaining left boots, collect the ones that are not ? (left_specific_remaining), and the ones that are ? (left_question).\n\n   Similarly for the right boots.\n\n4. Now, for each left_specific_remaining, try to pair with a right_question. For example, if a left has color 'a', and a right has '?', then they can be paired. Similarly for right_specific_remaining and left_question.\n\n5. Then, for the remaining left_question and right_question, pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the data structures. For step 1, we need to collect for each color, the list of left and right indices. Then, for each color, we can pair as many as possible.\n\nBut for the actual pairing, perhaps we can use queues. For example, for each color c (non-?), we have a queue of left indices and a queue of right indices. Then, for each c, we pair the first elements of the queues until one of them is empty.\n\nBut how to track which indices have been used. So, perhaps we need to have arrays to mark whether a left or right boot is already used.\n\nSo, let's outline the steps:\n\nInitialize two arrays, used_left and used_right, of size n, initialized to False. These will track which boots are already used in a pair.\n\nThen, for step 1:\n\nFor each color c (not '?'), collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i], and same for right indices.\n\nThen, for each such color, pair the left and right indices. For example, for color c, take the first min(len(left_c), len(right_c)) pairs. For each pair, mark them as used and add to the result.\n\nBut how to collect these indices efficiently? Well, perhaps for each color, we can pre-process the list of left and right indices. For example, create a dictionary where for each color, we have a list of indices (for left and right). Then, during step 1, iterate over each color, and for each, pair the left and right indices.\n\nBut for large n (up to 150000), this needs to be efficient. But for Python, even O(n) operations are acceptable.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, we proceed to step 2: handling the remaining left and right boots.\n\nNow, for the remaining left and right boots, we can collect:\n\nleft_question = list of indices i where l[i] is '?' and not used_left[i]\n\nright_question = list of indices j where r[j] is '?' and not used_right[j]\n\nleft_specific_remaining = list of indices i where l[i] is not '?' and not used_left[i]\n\nright_specific_remaining = list of indices j where r[j] is not '?' and not used_right[j]\n\nNow, for step 3:\n\nWe can pair left_specific_remaining with right_question, and right_specific_remaining with left_question.\n\nFor example, for each left in left_specific_remaining, we can pair it with a right_question. Since the left is a specific color, and the right is a ?, which is compatible. Similarly for the other way.\n\nOnce these are paired, the remaining left_question and right_question can be paired with each other.\n\nSo, how to pair these:\n\nLet me think:\n\nFor left_specific_remaining and right_question:\n\nWe can iterate through each left in left_specific_remaining, and pair them with a right from right_question. Since the right is ?, which can take any color. Similarly for the other direction.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently? For example, for each left in left_specific_remaining, we can take the first available right_question. Then, for each right in right_specific_remaining, take the first available left_question.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_question and right_question can be paired in any way (as long as they are matched 1:1).\n\nSo, the steps for step 3:\n\n1. Pair left_specific_remaining with right_question:\n\n   For each left in left_specific_remaining:\n\n      if there are any right_question left:\n\n          pair them, mark them as used.\n\n2. Similarly, pair right_specific_remaining with left_question.\n\n3. Then, pair the remaining left_question and right_question (each is ?), as much as possible.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, for step 1:\n\nWe can create two dictionaries, left_colors and right_colors. Each is a dictionary mapping color to list of indices (for left and right, respectively). For example, left_colors['a'] is a list of indices where the left boot has color 'a'.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can process the colors in a way that allows us to pair them. For example, for each color c (excluding '?'), we can take the left indices and right indices, and pair them up.\n\nBut how to do that. For example, for color c, the number of possible pairs is min(len(left_c), len(right_c)). So, for each such pair, we can take the first k elements from left_c and the first k elements from right_c, and pair them.\n\nBut to do that, we can loop through each color, and for each, pair up as many as possible.\n\nBut how to track which indices are already used. Wait, no. Because in step 1, we haven't used any of the boots yet. So, for each color c, the left_c list contains all indices where the left boot is c and hasn't been used yet. Similarly for right_c.\n\nWait, but if we process the colors in order, and for each, pair the left and right indices, then once processed, those indices are marked as used.\n\nSo, the code could be something like:\n\nused_left = [False] * n\nused_right = [False] * n\n\nresult_pairs = []\n\n# Step 1: Pair specific colors\nfor c in all colors except '?':\n    left_list = list of indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i]\n    right_list = list of indices where r[i] == c and not used_right[i]\n    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for i in range(k):\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n        result_pairs.append( (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) )\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut how to collect left_list and right_list for each color. Well, perhaps we can precompute for each color, a list of indices. Then, for each color, we can iterate through the list and pair as many as possible.\n\nWait, but for this approach, we need to process the colors in a way that allows us to pair them. For example, if we have a color 'a' in left and right, we can pair them. But the problem is that for each color, we need to collect the left and right indices, and pair them up. However, the order in which we process the colors might affect the total number of pairs. However, since we're trying to pair as many as possible for each color, perhaps the order doesn't matter. For example, processing all colors in any order, and for each, pair as much as possible.\n\nBut in practice, for the code, we can process all colors except '?', and for each, collect the indices. However, since the same color may appear multiple times, we need to collect all occurrences.\n\nBut how to collect the left and right indices for each color. Well, perhaps we can create two dictionaries, left_color_map and right_color_map. For example, left_color_map is a dictionary where the key is the color, and the value is a deque (or list) of indices where that color occurs. Similarly for right_color_map.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map and right_color_map, we can process the pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be structured as follows:\n\nWe create for left and right, a dictionary mapping color to list of indices. For example:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(list)\nright_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if l[i] != '?':\n        left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n    if r[i] != '?':\n        right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map and right_color_map, we can process the pairs. But wait, we need to process all colors that are present in both left and right. For example, for each color c (not '?'), check if it exists in both left and right. Then, for each such c, pair the min of the lengths of left and right lists.\n\nBut how to do that. For example, for color c, the number of possible pairs is min(len(left_color_map[c]), len(right_color_map[c])).\n\nBut the problem is that once we pair them, we need to remove those indices from the lists. However, since we are processing the pairs in this step, and the indices are not yet used, we can process them directly.\n\nWait, but if we process the color 'a' first, and pair some left and right indices, then when processing another color, say 'b', those indices are no longer available. However, since we are only pairing for the same color, this is correct.\n\nBut in this approach, the code would be:\n\nfor c in left_color_map:\n    if c in right_color_map:\n        left_list = left_color_map[c]\n        right_list = right_color_map[c]\n        num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n            result_pairs.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nWait, but this approach is not correct. Because the left_color_map and right_color_map contain all the indices for that color, regardless of whether they have been used. But in reality, once we process a color, the indices that are paired are marked as used. However, the code above would process all the indices for that color, even if they were already used in previous steps.\n\nWait, no. Because in this approach, the left_color_map and right_color_map are built before any processing. So, for example, if a color 'a' appears in both left and right, the left_list and right_list are all the indices of that color. But when we pair them, we mark them as used. However, if we process other colors, they may have overlapping indices. But this approach would not account for that. Because in this approach, for example, if we process color 'a' and pair some indices, but then later process color 'a' again, but the code is not designed to do that. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAh, right! Because the code above would process each color once. But the left_color_map and right_color_map are built once, and then for each color, we process all possible pairs. However, once we pair some indices, they are marked as used. But the left_list and right_list for that color include all the indices, including those that may have been used in previous steps. Wait, no. Because the left_color_map and right_color_map are built once, before any processing. So, for example, if a color 'a' appears in both left and right, and we process it once, pairing the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) indices. But after that, those indices are marked as used. However, the left_list and right_list for that color include all the indices, including those that may have been used in previous steps. So this approach would not work, because when we process color 'a', we pair all the possible pairs, but if some of the indices were already used in previous steps (like if the same color was processed earlier), but that's not possible because we are processing each color once. Wait, no. For example, if the code loops through all colors in left_color_map, and for each color c, checks if it's present in right_color_map. But the left_color_map contains all colors (except ?) present in the left boots. So, if a color is present in both left and right, then the code would process it once. However, in this approach, the code is not considering that after pairing some indices for color c, the remaining indices for color c (in left or right) may still be available for pairing with other colors. But that's not possible. Because the code is processing color c once, and pairing all possible pairs for that color. But that's not correct, because for example, suppose there are left boots with color 'a' and right boots with color 'a' and 'b'. Then, pairing 'a' with 'a' is better than pairing 'a' with 'b' (if possible). However, the code as written would process all colors, and for each color, pair as much as possible. But in this scenario, the code would process color 'a' and pair all left 'a's with right 'a's, which is correct.\n\nBut the problem is that the code above would not account for the fact that once a left or right boot is used in a pair, it cannot be used again. So, the initial approach of building left_color_map and right_color_map is not sufficient, because those lists contain all indices, even those that may have been used in previous steps.\n\nSo, this suggests that the initial approach is wrong. We need to process the colors in a way that allows us to pair the left and right boots, and mark them as used so that they are not considered again.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nFor each color c (not ?), collect the list of left indices and right indices, and pair them. But in order to do this, we need to process the colors in a way that, once we pair them, those indices are marked as used and not considered again in other pairings.\n\nBut how to do that. One way is to process the colors in a certain order, and for each color, pair as many as possible between the left and right, and mark those indices as used.\n\nBut how to collect the left and right indices for each color, excluding those already used. For example, for color 'a', we can collect all left indices where l[i] == 'a' and not used_left[i], and same for right indices.\n\nBut this would require, for each color, to scan the entire array each time. Which would be O(n) per color, leading to O(n * 26) time, which is acceptable for n up to 1.5e5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use a more efficient approach. Let's think about the following steps:\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as False arrays.\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i]\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used_right[i]\n\n   pair as many as possible between these two lists (min(len(left_list), len(right_list)))\n\n   for each pair, mark used_left and used_right as True.\n\nThis way, for each color, we process the available left and right indices, and pair them. Once paired, they are marked as used and not considered again.\n\nBut how to collect the left and right indices for each color. For example, for color 'a', we can loop through all left boots and check if they are not used and have color 'a'.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5 and 26 letters, this would be O(26n) = 3.9e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code for step 1 would be:\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n    right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(k):\n\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n        result_pairs.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut this approach is O(26n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce that is done, we proceed to step 2, which is handling the remaining boots.\n\nSo, after this, the remaining left boots are those that are not used and either have a color that is not matched (because there was no corresponding right boot) or are '?'. Same for right boots.\n\nNow, for the remaining boots, we can proceed to pair the specific colors with ?s.\n\nSo, for example, for each left boot that is not used and has a specific color (non-?), we can look for a right boot that is ? and not used. Similarly for the right boots.\n\nBut again, how to do this efficiently.\n\nSo, perhaps collect:\n\nleft_specific = list of indices where l[i] is not '?' and not used_left[i]\n\nright_specific = list of indices where r[i] is not '?' and not used_right[i]\n\nleft_question = list of indices where l[i] is '?' and not used_left[i]\n\nright_question = list of indices where r[i] is '?' and not used_right[i]\n\nThen, for the left_specific and right_question:\n\nWe can pair each left_specific with a right_question. For example, for each left in left_specific, take the first available right_question and pair them.\n\nSimilarly, for each right in right_specific, take the first available left_question.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_question and right_question can be paired among themselves.\n\nSo, the code for this part would be:\n\n# Collect remaining lists\n\nleft_specific = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_specific = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\nleft_question = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_question = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\n# Pair left_specific with right_question\n\ni = 0\nj = 0\nwhile i < len(left_specific) and j < len(right_question):\n    left_idx = left_specific[i]\n    right_idx = right_question[j]\n    result_pairs.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n    i += 1\n    j += 1\n\n# Pair right_specific with left_question\n\ni = 0\nj = 0\nwhile i < len(right_specific) and j < len(left_question):\n    right_idx = right_specific[i]\n    left_idx = left_question[j]\n    result_pairs.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n    i += 1\n    j += 1\n\n# Pair remaining left_question and right_question\n\nmin_len = min(len(left_question), len(right_question))\nfor i in range(min_len):\n    left_idx = left_question[i]\n    right_idx = right_question[i]\n    result_pairs.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut wait, after pairing left_specific with right_question, and right_specific with left_question, the remaining left_question and right_question can be paired. However, the order in which we pair them may affect the total. But since all are ?, they can be paired in any order.\n\nSo, this seems like a viable approach.\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Process all specific colors (non-?) between left and right.\n\n2. Process left specific with right ?s.\n\n3. Process right specific with left ?s.\n\n4. Process ?s between left and right.\n\nBut what about the order? For example, in step 2, pairing left specific with right ?s first, then right specific with left ?s. Or vice versa. But since the goal is to maximize the number of pairs, the order should not matter. Because pairing left specific with right ?s uses up some ?s, which might have been used otherwise. However, in this case, pairing left specific with right ?s would be better, since those pairs are more valuable (specific color with ?) than pairing two ?s. But since the code pairs as much as possible, the order may not matter.\n\nBut for example, if there are more left specific than right ?s, then after pairing them, the remaining left specific would be paired with nothing, and then the right specific would be paired with left ?s.\n\nBut this approach should capture as many pairs as possible.\n\nNow, the code needs to implement all these steps.\n\nNow, considering the sample input:\n\nFor example, the first sample input:\n\nInput:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nThe output is 5 pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the code would correctly compute that.\n\nNow, what about the case where a left ? can be paired with a right specific, and vice versa. For example, if there's a left ? and a right a, then pairing them is better than leaving them unpaired.\n\nYes, the code would do that in step 2 and 3.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the next thing is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut for large n (up to 1.5e5), the code must be efficient. However, the steps are O(n) for each part.\n\nNow, the problem is that in Python, creating lists for each color in step 1 by looping through all elements for each color may be time-consuming. For example, for 26 letters, for each letter, looping through n elements. That would be O(26n) = 3.9e6 operations for n=1.5e5, which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, precompute for each color, the list of indices.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r strings.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as lists of booleans.\n\nresult_pairs is a list.\n\nProcess step 1:\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n   collect right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n   k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in range(k):\n\n       add pair (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) to result_pairs\n\n       mark used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut for large n, this may be slow. Because for each character, we have to scan all n elements. For example, for 26 letters, it's 26 * O(n) time.\n\nAn alternative approach is to precompute for each color, the list of indices, and then process them. But for that, perhaps:\n\nprecompute for left and right, for each color, a list of indices. Then, for each color, process the list, but during processing, track which indices are used.\n\nBut how to track that. For example, for each color c, we can have a list of left indices, and a pointer indicating how many have been used. But this would require that during step 1, we process the colors in a way that allows us to pair them.\n\nBut perhaps this is not necessary. For the purposes of code correctness, even if it's O(26n), it's acceptable.\n\nNow, moving on.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, collect the remaining lists.\n\nThen, process step 2 and 3.\n\nNow, the code for collecting the remaining lists:\n\nleft_specific = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_specific = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\nleft_question = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_question = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, pair left_specific with right_question:\n\ni = 0\nj = 0\nwhile i < len(left_specific) and j < len(right_question):\n    left_idx = left_specific[i]\n    right_idx = right_question[j]\n    result_pairs.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n    i += 1\n    j += 1\n\nSimilarly for pairing right_specific with left_question:\n\ni = 0\nj = 0\nwhile i < len(right_specific) and j < len(left_question):\n    right_idx = right_specific[i]\n    left_idx = left_question[j]\n    result_pairs.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n    i += 1\n    j += 1\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_question and right_question:\n\nmin_len = min(len(left_question), len(right_question))\nfor i in range(min_len):\n    left_idx = left_question[i]\n    right_idx = right_question[i]\n    result_pairs.append( (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1) )\n    used_left[left_idx] = True\n    used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut wait, the left_question and right_question lists are collected after step 1. So, after step 2 and 3, the remaining left_question and right_question are those that were not used in step 2 and 3. So, when pairing them, we can pair them in any order.\n\nBut in the code above, during step 2 and 3, the left_question and right_question lists are modified by marking some as used. However, the code above uses the original lists, and during the pairing, the indices are marked as used. However, in the code above, the left_question and right_question lists are generated once. Then, during the pairing steps, the code uses the indices in the list, and marks them as used. However, the code is not re-generating the lists after each step. So, for example, during step 2, the code pairs left_specific with right_question. But after that, the right_question list has some elements that are now used. However, the code for step 3 is using the original right_question list. But no, the code for step 3 uses the original right_specific and left_question lists. But during step 2, the code marks some elements in the right_question as used, but the left_question list is not modified. However, in the code, the left_question and right_question lists are generated once, and during the pairing steps, the code uses those lists and marks the elements as used. So, for example, in step 2, during the while loop, the code iterates through the left_specific and right_question lists. But the code uses the indices in the lists, and marks them as used. However, the code doesn't modify the lists themselves. So, for example, after pairing some elements, the code continues to process the rest of the lists. But since the code is using the original lists, and during the pairing, the indices are marked as used, the code is correct.\n\nBut for example, during step 2, the code pairs left_specific[i] with right_question[j], and marks them as used. Then, during step 3, when we process right_specific with left_question, the left_question list includes indices that may have been used in step 2. But no, because the left_question list was generated before step 2. So, during the generation of left_question, it includes only indices not used in step 1. Then, during step 2, those indices are marked as used, but the left_question list is not modified. However, during step 3, when we iterate through left_question, the code checks the used_left[i] flag. Wait no, the code for step 3 is using the left_question list, which was generated before step 2. So, during step 2, some elements in the left_question list may have been marked as used, but the code for step 3 is using the same list. But during step 3, when the code processes left_question, it's possible that some elements in the list are already used (due to step 2). But the code for step 3 is not checking that. For example, during step 2, we have:\n\nleft_specific is a list of indices not used in step 1, and with l[i] not ?. right_question is a list of indices not used in step 1, and with r[i] ?.\n\nIn step 2, we pair left_specific with right_question. For each pair, we mark them as used. Then, during step 3, when we process right_specific with left_question, the left_question list is the same as generated before step 2. However, during step 2, some elements in left_question may have been marked as used (if they were in left_question and paired with right_question in step 2). But no, because in step 2, the code is pairing left_specific (which are not ?) with right_question. The left_question list is separate. So, the left_question list contains indices where l[i] is ?, and not used in step 1. During step 2, those indices are not modified. Only the right_question indices are modified. So, during step 3, the left_question list is still valid.\n\nWait, no. The left_question list is generated as [i for i in ... if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']. So, during step 1, the used_left[i] is marked for some indices. Then, during step 2, some of the right_question indices are marked as used. But the left_question list contains indices that are not used in step 1. So during step 2, when pairing left_specific with right_question, the left_specific indices are marked as used. However, the left_question list is not modified. So, during step 3, when processing right_specific with left_question, the left_question list may have indices that are not used (since they were not used in step 1, and not used in step 2). Because step 2 only uses the right_question indices. So the left_question list is still valid.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=10\n\nl = 'codeforces'\n\nr = 'dodivthree'\n\nLet me see:\n\nProcessing step 1: for each color from a-z, collect left and right indices.\n\nFor example, for 'c':\n\nleft indices where l[i] is 'c' and not used. Let's see:\n\nl is 'c o d e f o r c e s' (assuming indexes 0-based). So positions 0, 6 (assuming 'c' is at 0 and 6? Let me check:\n\n'codeforces' is spelled as:\n\nIndices 0: 'c', 1: 'o', 2: 'd', 3: 'e', 4: 'f', 5: 'o', 6: 'r', 7: 'c', 8: 'e', 9: 's'.\n\nSo, for 'c' in l, indices 0 and 7.\n\nFor r: 'dodivthree' is:\n\nIndices 0: 'd', 1: 'o', 2: 'd', 3: 'i', 4: 'v', 5: 't', 6: 'h', 7: 'r', 8: 'e', 9: 'e'.\n\nSo for 'c' in r, none. So during step 1, for color 'c', the right list is empty. So no pairs.\n\nSimilarly, for other colors. Let's see what pairs are formed in step 1.\n\nBut perhaps the code would pair other colors. For example, 'o' in left and right.\n\nBut for the first sample, the output is 5 pairs. So the code should generate that.\n\nBut regardless, the code seems to be correct.\n\nNow, the code's time complexity:\n\nFor step 1: 26 * O(n) = O(n).\n\nFor",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of left and right boots.
