Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color, which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The goal is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of a left and a right boot with compatible colors. And then output those pairs.\n\nThe compatibility rules are:\n- Two specific colors (non-?) are compatible if they are the same.\n- A ? can be compatible with any color (including another ?).\n\nSo, how do I approach this? Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to find the maximum number of pairs. Then, find the actual pairs.\n\nLet me think about the strategy.\n\nThe key idea is to match the left and right boots in a way that maximizes the count. Since ? can be flexible, maybe we should first match the non-? boots as much as possible, then use the ?s to fill in the remaining spots.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of it as a bipartite graph problem. Each left boot can be connected to right boots that are compatible. Then, finding the maximum matching. However, for n up to 150,000, standard maximum bipartite matching algorithms (like Hopcroft-Karp) would be too slow. So we need a greedy approach.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way to compute the maximum pairs efficiently without going into complex algorithms.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFirst, process all pairs where both are not ?, and their colors match. Then, process the remaining cases using the ?s.\n\nBut how to handle that optimally?\n\nAnother approach: For each color c (a-z), count how many left boots have color c (excluding ?), and how many right boots have color c (excluding ?). The number of pairs for color c is the minimum of left[c] and right[c]. Then, the remaining left and right boots (with ?) can be matched using the ?s.\n\nBut wait, because the ? can be used as any color. However, the problem is that some of the left and right ?s may be used to match with non-?s, but perhaps that's better than leaving them unused.\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\nStep 1: Match left and right boots that are not ?. For each color c, match as many as possible between left and right. For example, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). Then, subtract these from left and right counts.\n\nBut how to track which specific boots are matched? Because we need to actually output the indices.\n\nBut maybe the first step is to find how many pairs can be made between non-? boots. Then, handle the ?s.\n\nBut perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For all non-? left boots and non-? right boots, match them if their colors are the same. But how to do this optimally?\n\nWait, for example, if a left boot is 'a' and a right boot is 'a', they can be paired. But if there are multiple such pairs, how do we choose which ones to pair? Well, since the problem allows any valid pairing, perhaps we can just greedily pair them.\n\nBut how to implement this? Maybe by using a dictionary to count how many left and right boots of each color are available, then for each color, pair as many as possible.\n\nBut for the actual indices, we need to track which ones are used. So perhaps:\n\nWe can create two dictionaries: left_colors and right_colors, which map each color to a list of indices (positions) of boots with that color (excluding ?).\n\nThen, for each color c, take the min of len(left_colors[c]) and len(right_colors[c]), and pair those. For example, for color 'a', pair the first min(number) left and right boots.\n\nBut how to collect those pairs?\n\nOnce that's done, we can process the ?s.\n\nAfter that, the remaining left boots are those that are either ? or have colors that couldn't be matched (because the other side had fewer). Similarly for right boots.\n\nNow, the ? can be used to match with any remaining boots. However, the remaining boots could be:\n\n- Left ?s and right non-?s (which have colors that were not fully matched)\n- Right ?s and left non-?s (same as above)\n- Left ?s and right ?s\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the remaining left ?s with the remaining right non-?s, and vice versa, and then pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to do this optimally.\n\nLet me think. Suppose after step 1, we have:\n\nleft_remaining: list of left boots that are not yet paired (could be ? or non-? colors that couldn't be matched)\nright_remaining: same for right.\n\nNow, for the left boots that are not ?, but their color's count was not fully matched. For example, suppose there are more left 'a's than right 'a's. Then, the extra left 'a's are in left_remaining.\n\nSimilarly for right.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the left ?s with the right non-?s that are still unpaired, and vice versa.\n\nFor example, for each right boot that is not ? and hasn't been paired yet, we can pair it with a left ?.\n\nSimilarly, for each left boot that is not ? and hasn't been paired, pair it with a right ?.\n\nThen, the remaining left and right ?s can be paired among themselves.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Create two lists:\n\n   - left_non_question: list of indices where l[i] is not '?'\n   - right_non_question: same for r[i]\n\n   But perhaps better to track for each color, the available boots.\n\nBut maybe the initial approach is:\n\nProcess all possible same-color non-? pairs first.\n\nSo:\n\nCreate a frequency map for left and right colors (excluding ?). For each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\nOnce that's done, we can subtract those from the counts, and collect the pairs.\n\nBut how to track which indices are used.\n\nAn alternative approach is to collect for each color c, the list of left indices and right indices. Then, for each color, pair the first x elements, where x is min(len(left[c]), len(right[c])).\n\nFor example, for color 'a', we have left_a = [i1, i2, ...] and right_a = [j1, j2, ...]. Then, pair i1 with j1, i2 with j2, etc., up to min(len(left_a), len(right_a)).\n\nThis would give us the pairs for same-colored non-? boots.\n\nOnce that is done, we have some left and right boots that are not ? and not matched yet. Let's call these \"unmatched non-?\".\n\nThen, we can process the ?s.\n\nFor the ?s, they can be matched with any remaining boots (either non-? or ?).\n\nSo, the next step is to match left ?s with right non-?s (that are unmatched), and vice versa.\n\nSo, for example, take all left ?s and try to pair them with right boots that are not ? and not yet matched. Similarly, take all right ?s and pair them with left boots that are not ? and not yet matched.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining ?s can be paired among themselves.\n\nSo, the order of processing might be:\n\n- Pair same-colored non-? boots.\n- Pair left ? with right non-? (unmatched)\n- Pair right ? with left non-? (unmatched)\n- Pair left ? with right ?.\n\nBut how to do this in code.\n\nLet me think of data structures:\n\nWe need to track which left and right boots are already used. So, for each index, mark whether it's used or not.\n\nSo, let's have two arrays: used_left and used_right, of size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, the steps:\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right to False.\n\nFirst, process same-colored non-? pairs.\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = list of indices i where l[i] == c and not used_left[i]\n   right_list = list of indices j where r[j] == c and not used_right[j]\n\n   num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for k in 0..num_pairs-1:\n\n       pair left_list[k] with right_list[k]\n\n       mark used_left[left_list[k]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_list[k]] = True\n\nSo, this would pair as many as possible same-colored non-? pairs.\n\nBut how to collect the left_list and right_list for each color. This can be done by pre-processing for each color.\n\nBut for n up to 150,000, this would be O(n * 26) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to loop through all colors, and for each color, collect the indices once.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for each color, create a list of left indices and a list of right indices.\n\nOnce that is done, for each color, pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nBut during pairing, we have to make sure that the indices are not already used.\n\nWait, but during the first step, the used arrays are initially all False. So, for each color, we can collect all left indices of that color (not used), and same for right.\n\nBut collecting them each time would be expensive. So, perhaps during the first step, for each color, we can collect all left and right indices once, and then pair them.\n\nWait, but the initial approach would be to collect all left and right non-? boots for each color, and then pair them in the order they appear. However, once some are paired, they are marked as used, so they won't be considered again.\n\nSo, perhaps the code for the first step would be:\n\nfor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_indices = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n   right_indices = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == c and not used_right[j]]\n\n   num = min(len(left_indices), len(right_indices))\n\n   for k in 0 to num-1:\n\n       pair left_indices[k] with right_indices[k]\n\n       mark used_left and used_right accordingly.\n\nBut this would be O(26 * n) time, which for n=1.5e5 is 3.9e6 operations, manageable.\n\nBut for each color, creating the lists of left and right indices may take O(n) time per color, which is O(26n) total. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize this by pre-grouping all the non-? boots per color.\n\nSo, for example, before starting, create two dictionaries: left_groups and right_groups. left_groups[c] is a list of indices where l[i] is c (excluding ?). Similarly for right_groups.\n\nThen, during the first step, for each color c, iterate through left_groups[c] and right_groups[c], and pair as many as possible.\n\nBut during pairing, we need to track which ones are already used. So, perhaps we can have pointers for each group, indicating how many have been used so far.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c, the left and right groups are stored, and during the first step, we can pair the first min(len(left), len(right)) elements, and mark them as used.\n\nBut how to track which elements in the groups are already used? Because the groups are static (they include all non-? boots of color c), but during the first step, some may have been used already.\n\nWait, no. Because in the first step, we are only considering non-? boots. So, during the first step, all the left and right groups are non-? boots. So, for each color, the left and right groups are fixed. So, for example, for color 'a', left_groups['a'] is all the left boots with color 'a'. Then, during the first step, we can pair as many as possible between left_groups['a'] and right_groups['a'], but ensuring that each is not already used.\n\nBut if we process the colors in order, and for each color, pair the first available left and right indices, then perhaps we can track which ones are used.\n\nWait, but if we process color 'a' first, and pair some of them, then when we process color 'b', the left and right groups for 'b' are untouched.\n\nBut the problem is that the same left boot can be in multiple groups (if it's a ?). Wait, no, because the left_groups are built only for non-? boots. So each left boot is in exactly one group (the group corresponding to its color). So, during the first step, for each color c, the left and right groups are lists of indices that are not ?.\n\nThus, during the first step, for each color c, we can process the left and right groups for that color. For each pair, we can take the first x elements from left and right groups, and pair them. But how to track which ones are already used?\n\nWait, no. Because the groups are built once. So, during the first step, for each color, we can pair as many as possible, but once we pair them, we need to mark them as used. So, perhaps during the first step, for each color c:\n\nnumber of left boots of color c: len(left_groups[c])\n\nnumber of right boots of color c: len(right_groups[c])\n\nthe number of pairs is min of the two.\n\nBut how to track which ones are paired. For example, for left_groups[c], we can take the first m elements, and pair them with the first m elements of right_groups[c].\n\nBut how to ensure that these elements are not already used. Because if we process the colors in order, and for each color, pair the first available elements, but the used array is being updated as we go.\n\nWait, but initially, all elements are unused. So, when we process color 'a', the left_groups['a'] contains all left boots with color 'a' (which are not used yet). So, for each pair, when we pair left_groups['a'][i] and right_groups['a'][i], we mark them as used. Then, when processing other colors, those elements are already marked as used and will not be considered again.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as all False.\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = left_groups[c]\n\n   right_list = right_groups[c]\n\n   num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in 0 to num_pairs - 1:\n\n       left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n       right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n       if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n\n           add pair (left_idx+1, right_idx+1) to the answer list\n\n           mark used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n           mark used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut wait, the left_list and right_list are static. So, even if some elements in left_list have already been used, they are still in the list. So this approach would not work, because for example, if a left boot was processed in an earlier color's group (but that's impossible, since the color is unique for each boot).\n\nWait, no. Because each left boot is in exactly one group (the group of its color). So, for example, a left boot with color 'a' is only in left_groups['a'], and not in any other group. So, during the first step, when processing color 'a', the left_list is left_groups['a'], and all of them are not used yet. Because the used array is initially all False. So, when we process color 'a', we can pair the first m elements of left and right groups, and mark them as used. Then, when processing other colors, those elements are not in the groups anymore (since they are in the group of their color).\n\nWait, no. The left_groups are fixed. So, for example, if a left boot is in left_groups['a'], then when processing color 'a', we pair some of them. But when processing other colors, like 'b', the left_groups['b'] does not include the 'a' boots.\n\nTherefore, the code for the first step can be:\n\nfor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = left_groups[c]\n\n   right_list = right_groups[c]\n\n   num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n       left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n       right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n       if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n\n           add the pair (left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1)\n\n           mark used_left and used_right as True.\n\nBut since the left_list and right_list are built once, and during the first step, the used arrays are being marked as True, this approach would work. However, this may not capture all possible pairs. For example, if during processing color 'a', the first element in left_list is already used (due to some error?), but that's not possible. Because during the first step, the left_groups[c] is built once, and during the processing of color c, the used arrays are initially False. So, the first time we process color c, all elements in left_list and right_list are unused.\n\nWait, but the code is written as for each color c in order, process all possible pairs. So, for example, for color 'a', we pair as many as possible between left and right 'a's. Then, for color 'b', same thing. So, this is correct.\n\nOnce that's done, the next step is to process the ?s.\n\nSo, after that, we have some left and right boots that are not used. These can be:\n\n- Left boots with color ?, not used yet.\n\n- Right boots with color ?, not used yet.\n\n- Left boots with non-? colors, but their color's right count was less than left count. For example, more left 'a's than right 'a's.\n\n- Right boots with non-? colors, but their color's left count was less than right count.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair left ? with right non-? (unmatched), and vice versa.\n\nSo, for this step, we can collect all the left ?s that are not used, and all the right non-?s that are not used. Then, pair them.\n\nSimilarly, collect all the right ?s not used and pair them with left non-?s not used.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining ?s can be paired between left and right.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nLet me think:\n\nCollect all the left ?s (indices) that are not used. Let's call them left_q.\n\nCollect all the right non-?s that are not used. Let's call them right_nonq.\n\nFor each element in right_nonq, we can pair it with a left_q. Since the right_nonq has a specific color, and the left_q can be any color (so compatible). So, the number of such pairs is min(len(left_q), len(right_nonq)).\n\nSimilarly, collect all the right ?s not used (right_q) and left non-?s not used (left_nonq). Pair them as min(len(left_nonq), len(right_q)).\n\nThen, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired between themselves. The number of pairs is min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining)).\n\nBut how to collect the left_nonq and right_nonq?\n\nAlternatively, during the first step, after processing all same-colored non-? pairs, we can collect:\n\nleft_nonq_unmatched = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_nonq_unmatched = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] != '?' and not used_right[j]]\n\nleft_q_unmatched = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_q_unmatched = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == '?' and not used_right[j]]\n\nThen, for the second step:\n\nPair left_q_unmatched with right_nonq_unmatched. For each right_nonq_unmatched, pair with a left_q_unmatched.\n\nSimilarly, pair right_q_unmatched with left_nonq_unmatched.\n\nBut how to do this in code.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFor the left_q_unmatched and right_nonq_unmatched:\n\nTake the first min(len(left_q_unmatched), len(right_nonq_unmatched)) pairs. For each pair, take a left_q and a right_nonq and pair them.\n\nSimilarly for the other direction.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of code:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q_unmatched), len(right_nonq_unmatched))):\n\n   pair left_q_unmatched[i] with right_nonq_unmatched[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nSimilarly for the other direction.\n\nThen, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as follows:\n\nTake min(len(left_q_unmatched_remaining), len(right_q_unmatched_remaining)) pairs. Pair them in any order.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining after the previous steps.\n\nBut perhaps in code:\n\nAfter the first step, collect:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_nonq = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] != '?' and not used_right[j]]\n\nleft_nonq = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_q = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == '?' and not used_right[j]]\n\nThen:\n\n# Pair left_q with right_nonq\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_nonq))):\n\n    pair left_q[i] with right_nonq[i]\n\n    mark used_left and used_right as True.\n\n# Now, pair right_q with left_nonq\n\nfor i in range(min(len(right_q), len(left_nonq))):\n\n    pair right_q[i] with left_nonq[i]\n\n    mark used_left and used_right as True.\n\n# Now, pair left_q and right_q remaining\n\nremaining_left_q = [i for i in left_q if not used_left[i]]\n\nremaining_right_q = [j for j in right_q if not used_right[j]]\n\nfor i in range(min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q))):\n\n    pair remaining_left_q[i] with remaining_right_q[i]\n\nBut how to collect the remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q? Because after the previous steps, the left_q and right_q may have some elements already marked as used.\n\nWait, but during the first two steps (pairing left_q with right_nonq and right_q with left_nonq), we have to mark the used arrays. So, for example, when pairing left_q[i] with right_nonq[i], we need to mark used_left[left_q[i]] = True and used_right[right_nonq[i]] = True.\n\nBut how to collect the left_q and right_nonq lists. Let me think:\n\nInitially, after step 1, the left_q is the list of left boots with '?' that are not used. Similarly for others.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_nonq = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] != '?' and not used_right[j]]\n\nleft_nonq = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_q = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == '?' and not used_right[j]]\n\nThen, for the first pairing between left_q and right_nonq:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_nonq))):\n\n   left_idx = left_q[i]\n\n   right_idx = right_nonq[i]\n\n   add pair (left_idx+1, right_idx+1)\n\n   used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n   used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nSimilarly for pairing right_q and left_nonq:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(right_q), len(left_nonq))):\n\n   right_idx = right_q[i]\n\n   left_idx = left_nonq[i]\n\n   add pair (left_idx+1, right_idx+1)\n\n   used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n   used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nThen, collect the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nremaining_left_q = [i for i in left_q if not used_left[i]]\n\nremaining_right_q = [j for j in right_q if not used_right[j]]\n\nThen, pair them as:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q))):\n\n   left_idx = remaining_left_q[i]\n\n   right_idx = remaining_right_q[i]\n\n   add pair (left_idx+1, right_idx+1)\n\n   mark used_left and used_right as True.\n\nBut how to collect remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q? Because during the previous steps, some elements of left_q and right_q may have been marked as used. But the initial left_q and right_q lists are collected once, and during the pairing steps, the used arrays are modified. So, when collecting remaining_left_q, it's possible that some elements in the original left_q list are already used.\n\nWait, no. Because in the code above, when we collect left_q as [i ...], and then during the first pairing step, for each i in range(...), we mark used_left[left_q[i]] as True. So, in the remaining_left_q, we need to check if the elements in left_q are still not used. However, since the left_q list was built before the pairing steps, and during the pairing steps, we mark elements as used, the remaining_left_q can be built by checking which elements in the original left_q list are not yet used.\n\nBut this requires iterating through the entire list again. Which could be O(n) time. But given that n is 1.5e5, it's acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, during the first pairing between left_q and right_nonq, we can process as many as possible, and then for the remaining left_q, we can collect them again.\n\nBut perhaps the code is manageable.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as [False] * n.\n\npre-process left_groups and right_groups:\n\nleft_groups = defaultdict(list)\n\nright_groups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if l[i] != '?':\n\n        left_groups[l[i]].append(i)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if r[i] != '?':\n\n        right_groups[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, process same-colored non-? pairs:\n\nfor color in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_list = left_groups.get(color, [])\n\n    right_list = right_groups.get(color, [])\n\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n        if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n\n            add pair (left_idx+1, right_idx+1)\n\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut wait, this is not correct. Because the left_list and right_list are built once. For example, if there are multiple left boots of color 'a', but some have already been used in previous steps. But in the first step, when processing color 'a', the left_groups['a'] includes all left boots with color 'a', but during the processing of color 'a', the code checks if they are not used. However, if the code is processing colors in order, say 'a' to 'z', and for each color, the code tries to pair the first elements of the left and right lists, but some may have been used in previous steps. Wait no, because the left_groups and right_groups are built once. For example, during the first step, when processing color 'a', the code checks the left_groups['a'] which contains all left boots of color 'a', including those that may have been used in previous steps. But that's not correct. Because the used arrays are being updated as we process each color.\n\nWait, this approach is wrong. Because the left_groups and right_groups are built once, and during the first step, when processing color 'a', the code loops through the entire left_groups['a'] list, but some of those elements may have already been used in earlier steps (like processing color 'a' again? No, the code is processing each color once. Wait, no, the code is processing each color once, in order from 'a' to 'z'. So, for example, when processing color 'a', the code pairs some left and right boots. Then, when processing color 'b', the code uses the left_groups['b'] list, which contains all left boots of color 'b' (which have not been processed before). However, during the pairing for color 'a', the code may have marked some left and right boots as used. But the left_groups['a'] list is the same as before. So, during the processing of color 'a', the code may pair some left and right boots, but for the same color 'a', the code may pair the same left boots again. That's a mistake.\n\nAh! Oh right, this approach is incorrect. Because the code is using the left_groups and right_groups, which are precomputed lists, but during the processing of the same color, the code may pair the same indices multiple times. Because the used arrays are being checked in the loop.\n\nWait, but in the code above, for each color, the code loops through the left_list (which is the entire list of left boots of color c) and for each i in 0..num_pairs-1, it checks if the left and right indices are not used. But during the first iteration of the loop, the code may pair left_list[0] and right_list[0], mark them as used. Then, in the same color's loop, when i=1, it checks if left_list[1] is used. Which it is not (unless it was used in an earlier step). So, this code is correct.\n\nBut the code as written would have for each color c, the left_list and right_list are the full lists of indices of that color. Then, for each i in 0 to num_pairs-1, we check if they are not used. If they are not, pair them. But the problem is that the num_pairs is min(len(left_list), len(right_list)), which could be larger than the actual available pairs.\n\nWait, no. Because the code is looping over the entire left_list and right_list, and for each i, it checks if the indices are not used. So, for example, if the left_list has 5 elements and the right_list has 3 elements, then num_pairs is 3. But during the loop, for i=0,1,2, the code checks if the left and right indices are not used. If they are not, pair them. So, in this case, the code would pair 3 pairs (assuming they are not used).\n\nBut this approach would miss some pairs if some elements in the left_list or right_list have been used in earlier steps. Wait, no. Because during the first step, the code processes color 'a', and the left_groups['a'] is a list of all left boots with color 'a'. Initially, none of them are used. So, during the first processing of color 'a', the code would pair as many as possible (up to min(len(left_list), len(right_list))). But if during the processing of color 'a', some of the left_list elements are already used, but how?\n\nNo. Because during the first step, the code is processing each color once, and the used arrays are initially all False. So, during the first pass, for color 'a', all elements in left_list and right_list are unused. Thus, the code can safely pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs. However, the code as written would loop through all i in 0..num_pairs-1, but what if some of the elements in left_list or right_list have already been used? Well, they can't, because the used arrays are initially False, and during the first step, the code is processing color 'a' for the first time.\n\nWait, no. Because the code is written as for each color in 'a' to 'z', process the left and right lists. But the code for the first step is written as:\n\nfor color in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_list = left_groups[color]\n\n    right_list = right_groups[color]\n\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n        if not used_left[left_idx] and not used_right[right_idx]:\n\n            add pair\n\n            mark as used.\n\nBut this code would not pair all possible pairs. For example, suppose that during processing color 'a', the first element in left_list is already used. But why would that be? Because the used arrays are initialized to False, and this is the first time processing color 'a'.\n\nSo, the code is correct. Because during the first step, the left and right groups are built once, and during processing, the code pairs the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) elements of the group. However, the code may not pair all possible pairs because some elements may have been used in earlier steps. But that's not possible because the code is processing colors in order, and the same color is processed once.\n\nWait, but what if a left boot with color 'a' is processed in the left_list for color 'a', and during the loop, it is paired. Then, during the same loop, when i increases, the code may check if the next elements are used. But since they are not, they are paired.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the code can be optimized. For example, instead of checking if the indices are used, we can track pointers. For example, for each color, have a pointer for the left and right lists, and pair as long as both pointers are within the list.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed with this code.\n\nBut there's a problem. Because the code as written would process for each color, the entire left and right lists, but for each i in 0..num_pairs-1, and check if the indices are not used. However, the num_pairs is min(len(left_list), len(right_list)), but during the loop, some of the indices may have already been used. For example, suppose that during processing color 'a', the code processes i=0, and pairs left_list[0] and right_list[0]. Then, when i=1, the code checks if left_list[1] and right_list[1] are not used. Which they are not. So, the code proceeds. But what if during the same color processing, some of the left or right indices were already used? It can't happen, because this is the first time the color is being processed, and all used arrays are initially False.\n\nTherefore, the code for the first step is correct.\n\nBut wait, no. Suppose that during the processing of color 'a', the code pairs left_list[0] and right_list[0], then during the same loop, when i=1, left_list[1] and right_list[1] are not used, and are paired. So, the code pairs as many as possible. So, the code is correct.\n\nBut the code is written as for each color, for i in 0 to num_pairs-1, check if the indices are not used. However, if during the same color processing, some of the indices are already used, the code would skip them. But that can't happen, because during the first step, the used arrays are all False. Therefore, the code can be simplified to pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs, without checking the used arrays.\n\nWait, but why? Because during the first step, the left_groups and right_groups are built with all non-? boots. And during the first step, the code is processing each color once. So, for example, for color 'a', the code is trying to pair all possible left and right 'a's. Since all are unused, the code can safely pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs. Therefore, the code can be simplified to:\n\nfor color in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_list = left_groups.get(color, [])\n\n    right_list = right_groups.get(color, [])\n\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n\n        add pair (left_idx+1, right_idx+1)\n\n        mark used_left[left_idx] = True\n\n        mark used_right[right_idx] = True\n\nBut this is only correct if the left_list and right_list are processed in order, and all of them are unused. But this is true because during the first step, the used arrays are all False.\n\nAh! Because during the first step, the code is processing colors in order, and for each color, the left and right groups are lists of indices that are not used. Therefore, the code can safely pair them without checking the used arrays. Because the used arrays are initially False, and during the first step, the code is processing each color once. Therefore, the code for the first step can be simplified to pair all possible same-colored non-? pairs.\n\nThis would save some time, as we don't have to check the used arrays.\n\nBut why is this correct? Because the left_groups and right_groups are built with all non-? boots, and during the first step, the code is pairing them in order. So, if we pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs, then those indices will be marked as used. But if there are other pairs that could have been made, but",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) based on their colors. A color is compatible if it matches exactly or if it is a wildcard ('?').

This helps in quickly finding compatible pairs.\n2. **Same Color Pairs**: First, pair all non-wildcard boots that have the same color. This is done by iterating through each possible color from 'a' to 'z' and matching as many pairs as possible.\n3. **Wildcard Pairs**: After handling same-color pairs, use wildcard boots to match with non-wildcard boots that couldn't be paired earlier.
