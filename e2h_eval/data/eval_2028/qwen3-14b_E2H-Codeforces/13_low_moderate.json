For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes work. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order of 12, so after H comes C again. Each consecutive note is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. But the problem mentions that the distance between two notes is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the higher. So for example, between C and E, it's 4 semitones. Wait, let me think: the sequence is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Let me count the steps between C and E. From C to C# is 1, then D (2), D# (3), E (4). Oh right, so that's four semitones. So the distance from X to Y is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12, but since the distance is measured from lower to upper, maybe we need to take the positive difference. Wait, but the problem says that the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones when you go from X up to Y. So if X is lower than Y, then it's the difference. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance would be (12 - (X - Y))? Or wait, maybe the distance is computed as (Y - X) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to upper, perhaps the way to compute it is: for two notes, the distance is the minimal number of semitones when moving upwards. Wait, no. Wait the problem says that between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone. So the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Between E and C, it's 8 semitones. Because if you go from E up to C, you have to go through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the distance between X and Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12? No. Wait, if X is before Y in the list, then the distance is Y's index - X's index. But if X is after Y, then the distance is (12 - X's index + Y's index). Wait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones from X to Y. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones from Y to X? No, because the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. So the distance is always calculated as the number of semitones when moving upward from the lower note to the higher. So for two notes, the distance is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y + 12 - X). But how do I compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the distance between two notes can be calculated as (y_index - x_index) % 12. But wait, for example, if X is C (index 0) and Y is E (index 4), then the distance is 4. If X is E (index 4) and Y is C (index 0), then (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which matches the example given. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12. So that's how I can compute the distance between two notes.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its index. Let's create a list of the notes in order. Let me check the order again. The problem says:\n\nThe notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, in the problem statement, the list is given as:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh, and then after H comes C again. So the order is:\n\n0:",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is neither. The solution involves checking the distances between the notes in all possible orderings to see if they fit the criteria for major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: First, we map each note to its corresponding index in the cyclic sequence of musical notes. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: For any two notes, the distance is calculated as the difference between their indices modulo 12. This accounts for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Triad Check**: For the given three notes, we check all permutations of the notes to see if they form a major or minor triad. A major triad has distances of 4 and 3 semitones between consecutive notes, while a minor triad has distances of 3 and 4 semitones.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X-Y is 4 and Y-Z is 3\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    return d1 == 4 and d2 == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X-Y is 3 and Y-Z is 4\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    return d1 == 3 and d2 == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    indices = [note_to_index(note) for note in notes]\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_index` function converts each note into its corresponding index in the list of musical notes, which simplifies distance calculations.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is computed using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Triad Classification**: The `classify_chord` function checks all permutations of the three notes to see if they form a major or minor triad. If none of the permutations match the criteria for either type of triad, the chord is classified as \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible orderings of the notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to determine the correct classification.",
