For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between notes are calculated. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order. The list given is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then after H comes C again.\n\nEach consecutive pair is a semitone apart. So the distance between two notes is the number of steps between them in this cyclic list, moving forward. For example, C to E is 4 semitones (C to C# is 1, then D is 2, D# 3, E is 4). But if the distance is calculated from E to C, that would be 8 semitones because you go E to F (1), F# (2), G (3), G# (4), A (5), B (6), H (7), C (8). But according to the problem statement, the distance is always measured from the lower note to the upper one. Wait, but how do we determine which note is lower? Because the problem says that for the chord, when considering X, Y, Z, the distance between X and Y is measured as per the order. So perhaps when checking for major or minor, we need to arrange the three notes in some order such that the first to second is 4 semitones, and second to third is 3, for major. Similarly for minor, it's 3 and 4.\n\nSo the approach is: for the three notes, generate all possible permutations, check for each permutation if it meets the major or minor conditions.\n\nBut since the chord is unordered, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes. However, since there are three elements, there are 3! = 6 permutations. For each permutation, check if it satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. For example, for a major triad, the total distance between X and Z is 7 semitones. But perhaps that's not necessary here. Let's think about the problem.\n\nLet me think about the steps required:\n\nFirst, I need to map each note to its position in the list. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H which is 11. Then, the distance between two notes can be calculated as (target - start) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured along the musical scale from the lower note to the upper. So for example, if we have two notes, say, X and Y, then the distance is (Y's position - X's position) if Y is higher than X. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y's position + 12 - X's position)? Wait, no. Because the notes are cyclic. So for example, if X is C (position 0) and Y is H (position 11), then the distance from X to Y is 11 semitones. But if X is H and Y is C, then the distance is 1 semitone (since moving from H to C is one step). But according to the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is measured from the lower to upper. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? Or is it (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y + 12 - X)?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitones.\"\n\nSo, for two different notes, the distance from X to Y is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) if Y is higher than X. Otherwise, it's (Y's position + 12 - X's position). But since the notes are arranged in a cycle, the distance between X and Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) if Y is higher, otherwise (Y_pos + 12 - X_pos). But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but if that's zero, then it's 12? No, because if X and Y are same, the distance is zero. But the problem says that",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they fit the criteria for major or minor chords based on the distances between the notes in a cyclic musical scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Positions**: Convert each note to its corresponding position in the cyclic musical scale. This helps in calculating distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes by considering their positions in the scale. The distance from note X to note Y is computed as `(Y_pos - X_pos) % 12` if Y is higher than X, otherwise it's adjusted using modulo arithmetic to ensure it wraps around the cycle correctly.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three notes and check each permutation against the criteria for major and minor chords. A major chord requires a distance of 4 semitones between the first and second note, and 3 semitones between the second and third note. A minor chord requires a distance of 3 semitones between the first and second note, and 4 semitones between the second and third note.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_position(note):\n    notes = [\"C\", \"C#\", \"D\", \"D#\", \"E\", \"F\", \"F#\", \"G\", \"G#\", \"A\", \"B\", \"H\"]\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef distance(a, b):\n    # Calculate the distance from a to b in semitones\n    a_pos = note_to_position(a)\n    b_pos = note_to_position(b)\n    return (b_pos - a_pos) % 12\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    d1 = distance(x, y)\n    d2 = distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 4 and d2 == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    d1 = distance(x, y)\n    d2 = distance(y, z)\n    return d1 == 3 and d2 == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\ninput_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\nnotes = input_line.split()\nresult = classify_chord(notes)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_position` function converts each note to an index in the list of musical notes, facilitating distance calculations.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The `distance` function computes the semitone distance between two notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n- **Checking Chords**: The `classify_chord` function checks all permutations of the input notes. If any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor chord, it returns the appropriate classification. If none do, it returns \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the three notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
