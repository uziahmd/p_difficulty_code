Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the total sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need the minimal number of cards to reach that.\n\nSo first, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum S. The goal is to have the total sum be zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call that target T = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of cards (each with value between -x and x) that sum up to T. But how?\n\nLet me think. Each card can contribute a maximum of x (if positive) or -x (if negative). So, for example, if T is positive, then we need to find some combination of numbers (each up to x) that sum to T. The minimal number of cards would be ceiling(T / x), but maybe there's some adjustment needed based on the remainder.\n\nWait, but for example, if T is 5 and x is 2. Then each card can contribute up to 2. So 5 / 2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because 2+2+1=5. But since each card can be up to 2, but also can be negative. Wait, but in this case, we need to get a positive sum. So the best way is to use as many x as possible. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). But wait, what if T is exactly divisible by x? Then it's T/x. Otherwise, it's (T//x) + 1.\n\nBut wait, let's think about T being positive. For example, T is 3 and x is 2. Then 3/2 is 1.5, so we need 2 cards. Like 2 + 1. But since the maximum per card is 2. So yes. Similarly, if T is 4 and x is 2, then 2 cards (2+2).\n\nBut what if T is negative? Well, the same logic applies. For example, T is -5, x is 2. Then we need to get sum of -5. So each card can contribute up to -2. So the minimal number is ceil(5 / 2) = 3. Because 2 cards would give -4, which is not enough. So three cards: -2 -2 -1 = -5. So the same formula applies. So regardless of the sign of T, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, because each card can contribute up to x in absolute value. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but let me check.\n\nWait, for example, if T is 5, x is 3. Then |T| is 5. 5 / 3 is 1.666..., so ceil is 2. So two cards: 3 + 2 = 5. Which works. So yes. So the minimal number is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, what if T is zero? Then no cards are needed. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nCalculate the sum of the found cards, S. Then T is -S. If T is zero, answer is zero. Else, compute the absolute value of T, divide by x, take the ceiling of that. But how to compute ceiling in Python?\n\nWait, for integers a and b, the ceiling of a / b can be computed as (a + b - 1) // b. So for example, 5 / 2 is 2.5. (5 + 2 -1 ) // 2 = 6//2=3. Which is correct. Similarly, 4 / 2 is 2. (4 + 2-1)//2 = 5//2=2. Correct.\n\nSo for |T| divided by x, the minimal number of cards is (|T| + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut let me test some examples.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nSample 1: Input is 3 2, with numbers -1, 1, 2. Sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. So |T| is 2. x is 2. So (2 + 2 -1 ) // 2 = 3//2 = 1. Which matches the sample output of 1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: input is 2 3, numbers -2, -2. Sum is -4. T is 4. |T|=4. x=3. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Which matches the sample output of 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: T is 5, x is 3. (5 +3-1)/3 =7/3=2.333 floored to 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: T is 0. Then answer is zero.\n\nAnother case: T is 1, x is 1. Then (1 +1-1)/1 = 1/1=1. Which is correct. One card with 1.\n\nWhat if T is -3 and x is 2. Then |T| is 3. (3 +2-1)/2 =4/2=2. So two cards. For example, -2 and -1. Sum is -3. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to work.\n\nSo the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Read n and x.\n\n2. Read the list of numbers.\n\n3. Compute the sum S of the numbers.\n\n4. Compute T = -S.\n\n5. If T is zero, output 0.\n\n6. Else, compute |T|, then calculate (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut wait, what if x is zero? No, the problem says x is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo that's the plan. Let's code that.\n\nNow, let's test some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: sum is zero. Output is zero.\n\nEdge case 2: sum is 1, x is 1. So T is -1. |T| is 1. (1 +1-1)/1 =1. So answer is 1.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x is 2. T is -3. |T|=3. (3+2-1)/2 =4/2=2. So two cards: 2 and 1. Or 2 + 1. So yes.\n\nAnother case: sum is 4, x is 2. T is -4. |T|=4. (4 +2-1)/2 =5/2=2.5 floored to 2. Which is 2 cards. 2+2=4. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x is 5. T is -5. |T|=5. (5 +5-1)/5 =9/5=1.8 floored to 1. Which is correct. One card with 5.\n\nAnother case: sum is 6, x is 5. T is -6. |T|=6. (6 +5-1)/5= 10/5=2. So two cards. 5 +1 =6. So yes.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input. For each test case.\n\nWait, the input format is given as two lines. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '3 2\\n-1 1 2', which is n=3, x=2, and the numbers are -1, 1, 2. Then the second input is '2 3\\n-2 -2'.\n\nWait, but the input is given as a list of inputs. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and x. The second line contains n numbers.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as two separate cases. But perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, the example shows two different inputs, but perhaps that's for two different test cases. However, the problem says that the input is for a single test case. So the code should read from stdin, which for the programming competition problem would be a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line has n and x. The second line has n integers.\n\nSo the code should read two lines. For example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2\n\nWhich would be read as n=3, x=2, and the list [-1,1,2].\n\nSo the code should read two lines. The first line is split into n and x. The second line is split into n integers.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and x.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nCompute the sum S of the list.\n\nCompute T = -S.\n\nIf T is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimal number of cards as (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then the answer is zero.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nLet's code that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input:\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_s = sum(nums)\n\nt = -sum_s\n\nif t == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    res = (abs(t) + x -1) // x\n\n    print(res)\n\nWait, but let's check the sample input.\n\nSample 1: sum is 2. t is -2. So abs(t) is 2. (2 +2-1)//2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSample 2: sum is -4. t is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 0. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x is 5. t is -5. (5 +5-1)//5 =9//5=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 6, x is 5. (6 +5-1)/5 = 10//5=2. Correct.\n\nYes, this seems to work.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me check for possible edge cases.\n\nWhat if x is 1? For example, sum is 3. t is -3. (3 +1-1)/1 =3. So 3 cards. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 1, x is 1. So (1 +1-1)/1 =1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is -1, x is 1. t is 1. (1 +1-1)/1=1. Correct.\n\nWhat about when T is zero? For example, sum is zero. Output is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut wait, what about when the input is like n=1, x=1, and the number is 0. Then sum is 0. So output is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=1, x=1, number is 1. sum is 1. t=-1. (1 +1-1)/1=1. So output is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, x=1, number is -1. sum is -1. t is 1. (1 +1-1)/1 =1. Correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
