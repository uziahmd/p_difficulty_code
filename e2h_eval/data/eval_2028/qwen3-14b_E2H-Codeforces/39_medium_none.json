Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to create an N x N board with numbers from 1 to N² such that when a rook and a queen traverse the board according to specific rules, the rook pays strictly fewer vuns (fees) than the queen. If it's impossible, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the traversal rules. The figure starts at cell 1. Each move, it chooses the smallest-numbered unvisited cell that it can reach in one move. If there are no such cells, it teleports to the smallest unvisited cell, paying 1 vun. This process continues until all cells are visited.\n\nSo, the key is to arrange the numbers in such a way that the rook's path requires fewer teleportations (vuns) than the queen's.\n\nLet me think about how the traversal works for both pieces. For each step, the current position is determined by the previous moves. The movement depends on the available cells that can be reached in one move (rook's movement: same row or column; queen's movement: any direction, including diagonals).\n\nThe challenge is to design a numbering where the rook's path has fewer teleport steps than the queen's.\n\nLooking at the example given for N=4. The output shows that the rook had 1 vun and the queen 2. So, how was that achieved?\n\nIn the example, the rook's path was such that after visiting certain cells, it couldn't move further without teleporting once. The queen had two such instances.\n\nSo, the idea is to arrange the numbers such that the rook's movement is more efficient (i.e., can reach the next minimal number without teleporting more times than the queen).\n\nBut how to construct such a grid?\n\nLet me think of possible patterns. Maybe arranging numbers in a way that the rook can move along rows and columns in a way that allows it to reach the next minimal numbers easily, while the queen might have more detours or require more teleportations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for certain N, it's impossible. For example, N=1: no fees, so output is -1. For N=2, maybe possible or not?\n\nBut the problem says to output -1 if there's no solution. So first, I need to find for which N such a grid exists.\n\nWait, the sample input for N=4 gives a valid output. So the answer exists for N=4. But what about other N?\n\nLet me think about small N:\n\nFor N=1: only cell, no movement. Both pay 0. So output -1.\n\nFor N=2: Let's try to think.\n\nWe need to arrange numbers 1-4. Let's say the starting cell is 1.\n\nSuppose the board is:\n\n1 2\n\n3 4\n\nThen, the rook starts at 1. From there, it can move to 2 (same row) or 3 (same column). The minimal unvisited is 2. So it moves there. Then, from 2, can move to 1 (already visited), or 4 (same column). So next is 4. Then, from 4, can move to 3 (same row?), but wait, rook moves along row or column. From 4 (row 2, column 2), same row is 3 (row 2, column 1). So yes. So next is 3. All cells are visited. No teleportation. So rook pays 0.\n\nQueen's movement: from 1, can reach 2, 3, 4. Minimal is 2. Then from 2, can reach 1 (visited), 3 (diagonal), 4 (same column). So next is 3. From 3, can reach 1 (visited), 2 (visited), 4 (same row). So next is 4. All done. No teleport. So queen also pays 0. So rook and queen have same fees. Not acceptable.\n\nSo need a different arrangement.\n\nWhat if the board is:\n\n1 3\n\n4 2\n\nRook starts at 1. Can move to 3 (same row) or 4 (same column). Minimal is 3. Then from 3, can move to 1 (visited), 2 (same column). So next is 2. Then from 2, can move to 3 (visited), 4 (same row). So next is 4. All done. No teleport. Rook pays 0.\n\nQueen starts at 1. Can reach 3, 4, 2. Minimal is 2? Wait, no. The numbers are 1,3,4,2. So the next minimal unvisited is 2. Wait, but can the queen reach 2 from 1? Queen can move diagonally. From (1,1) to (2,2) is a diagonal. Yes. So queen moves to 2. Then from 2, can reach 1 (visited), 3 (diagonal?), 4 (same row). Let's see. 2 is at (2,2). 3 is at (1,2). That's same column. So yes. So next is 3. Then from 3, can move to 4 (same row?), no. 3 is at (1,2). 4 is at (2,1). Diagonal. So yes. So next is 4. All done. No teleport. Queen also pays 0. So again same.\n\nHmm. How to make the queen have more teleport steps?\n\nMaybe arrange the numbers such that the queen's path requires teleporting more times than the rook's.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach: think of the traversal as a sequence of numbers. The order in which cells are visited depends on the movement rules. The key is to arrange the numbers so that for the rook, the path can reach the next minimal numbers without teleporting, but for the queen, sometimes it can't.\n\nBut how to design such a grid?\n\nAnother thought: the rook can only move along rows and columns. So, if the numbers are arranged in such a way that the next minimal number is in the same row or column as the current position, then the rook can reach it. For the queen, the same applies, but she can reach more cells. However, if the queen's next minimal number is not reachable (because it's not in same row, column, or diagonal), then she must teleport. But since the queen can reach more cells, maybe she can have more options, leading to fewer teleport steps. Wait, but the problem requires that the rook has fewer teleport steps than the queen. So, perhaps the opposite.\n\nWait, the problem says that the rook must pay strictly less than the queen. So, in the example, the queen had two teleport steps, and the rook had one.\n\nSo, how to arrange the numbers such that the queen's path requires more teleport steps than the rook's.\n\nMaybe the idea is to arrange the numbers so that for the queen, the next minimal number is not reachable, but for the rook, it is. But how?\n\nLet me think of a scenario where the queen has to teleport more. For example, suppose that after some steps, the queen's next minimal number is not in her reachable cells (so she has to teleport), but the rook's next minimal number is reachable.\n\nBut how to arrange that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the queen, the order of numbers leads to more situations where she can't reach the next minimal number, while the rook can.\n\nSo, maybe arrange the numbers in such a way that the queen's movement is constrained. For example, arrange the numbers in a spiral or some pattern that makes the queen's path require more teleport steps.\n\nBut how to come up with such a pattern?\n\nAlternatively, think of the rook's path as being able to traverse all cells in a single row or column, while the queen's path may get stuck earlier.\n\nBut this is vague. Let's think of the sample for N=4. The sample output is a grid that's designed such that the rook can move through the cells in a way that requires only one teleport, while the queen has two.\n\nLooking at the sample explanation: the rook's path goes through 1 → 3 → 4 → 6 → 9 → 5 → 7 → 13 → 2 → 8 → 16 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → (teleport to 14). So one teleport.\n\nThe queen's path: 1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 9 → 7 → 13 → 8 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → (teleport to 14) → (teleport to 16). So two teleports.\n\nSo, the key seems to be that for the queen, after visiting 15, the next minimal unvisited is 14, which is not reachable. Then she teleports to 14, and then the next minimal is 16, which is not reachable (from 14?), so she teleports again.\n\nBut the rook, after visiting 15, the next minimal is 14, which is not reachable. So he teleports once.\n\nSo, in this case, the queen has two teleport steps, the rook one.\n\nSo the arrangement must be such that the queen's path requires more teleport steps than the rook's.\n\nHow to achieve that?\n\nPerhaps, arrange the numbers in a way that the queen's movement path is forced to take certain steps that are not reachable, leading to more teleport steps.\n\nBut how to construct such a grid?\n\nAn alternative approach: think of the traversal as a priority queue where each step selects the minimal number reachable. For both the rook and the queen, the path depends on the order of numbers and their positions.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to creating a grid where the order of visiting numbers for the queen results in more teleport steps than the rook's.\n\nBut how to design such a grid?\n\nPerhaps the key is to arrange the numbers in such a way that for the queen, the next minimal number is not reachable, but for the rook, it is. For example, arrange the numbers such that the next number after 1 is in the same row or column for the rook, but not in the queen's reach. But that seems unlikely because queen can move in all directions.\n\nWait, but if the next number is in the same row or column, then the queen can reach it. So that's not helpful. So, the queen can reach more cells than the rook. Therefore, the queen's path would have more options. Which implies that the queen's path would have fewer teleport steps than the rook's. Which contradicts the sample. Therefore, the sample must have some specific arrangement where the queen's path requires more teleport steps.\n\nWait, maybe the queen's movement is such that even though she can reach more cells, the order of the numbers leads to situations where the next minimal number is not reachable. For example, the queen could be in a position where the next minimal number is not in her reach, but the rook's next minimal is reachable.\n\nSo, perhaps the arrangement is such that for the queen, the next minimal number is not reachable, but for the rook, it is. This would cause the queen to teleport, while the rook doesn't.\n\nSo how can this happen?\n\nLet me think of a scenario. Suppose the current position is at a cell. The next minimal number is in the same row or column as the current position (so rook can reach it), but not in the same row, column, or diagonal (so queen cannot reach it). In that case, the rook can move to it, while the queen has to teleport.\n\nBut how to arrange that?\n\nFor example, suppose current position is (x,y). The next minimal number is at (x, y+1) (same row). Then the rook can move there. The queen can also move there. So that's not helpful.\n\nBut if the next minimal number is in the same row or column for the rook, but not in same row, column, or diagonal for the queen. How?\n\nWait, if the next minimal number is in the same row or column, then the queen can reach it. Because queen can move along rows and columns. So that scenario is impossible.\n\nTherefore, the only way the queen can't reach a cell is if that cell is not in the same row, column, or diagonal as the current position. So, for example, if the current position is (x,y), and the next minimal is at (x+1, y+2), then the queen can't reach it directly. But the rook can reach it only if it's in same row or column. So, if the next minimal is in same row or column, then both can reach it. But if it's not, then neither can reach it. So this scenario is not helpful.\n\nSo, perhaps the queen can have more teleport steps when the next minimal number is not reachable by her, but the rook can reach it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the queen's path is such that after some steps, she is forced to take a longer path that requires more teleport steps. But how to model that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the traversal order for both the rook and the queen. The rook's path may have certain steps where it can reach the next minimal number, while the queen's path may have to skip over some numbers, leading to more teleport steps.\n\nBut how to construct such a grid.\n\nAlternatively, think about the sample for N=4. The sample's grid is designed in a way that the queen's path requires more teleport steps. Looking at the sample's grid:\n\nRow 1: 4 3 6 12 \n\nRow 2:7 5 9 15 \n\nRow 3:14 1 11 10 \n\nRow 4:13 8 16 2 \n\nThe starting position is cell 1, which is at (3,2) (assuming rows and columns start at 1). Let's see the order of the queen's path:\n\n1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → ... \n\nBut how does that happen?\n\nWait, the queen starts at 1. The next minimal unvisited is 2. But can she reach 2 from 1?\n\nThe position of 1 is (3,2). The position of 2 is (4,4). Are they in the same row, column, or diagonal? Let's see:\n\nRow difference is 4-3 = 1. Column difference is 4-2 = 2. So no. Not same row or column. Diagonal check: |row diff| == |col diff|. 1 vs 2. No. So queen can't reach 2 directly from 1. So she has to teleport to 2. Wait, but according to the sample explanation, the queen's path starts with 1 → 3 → 4 → 2... So why didn't she teleport to 2 immediately?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in the sample explanation. Let me recheck.\n\nThe note says that the queen's path is: 1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 9 → 7 → 13 → 8 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → (teleport to 14) → (teleport to 16). So the first step after 1 is 3, not 2. So why?\n\nBecause after starting at 1, the queen looks for the minimal unvisited cell that is reachable. The cells reachable from 1 (queen can move any direction) are those in same row, column, or diagonal.\n\nThe position of 1 is (3,2). Let's see which numbers are in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n\nRow 3: cells 14 (row3, col1), 1 (row3, col2), 11 (row3, col3), 10 (row3, col4).\n\nColumn 2: row1, col2 is 3; row2, col2 is 5; row3, col2 is 1; row4, col2 is 8.\n\nDiagonals: For queen, diagonals are cells where row-col is same or row+col is same.\n\nFor (3,2):\n\nrow-col = 1. So cells with row-col = 1: (1,0) invalid, (2,1), (3,2), (4,3). So (2,1) is 7, (4,3) is 16.\n\nrow+col = 5. Cells with row+col=5: (1,4) is 12, (2,3) is 9, (3,2) is 1, (4,1) is 13.\n\nSo reachable cells from 1 (queen) are:\n\nSame row: 14, 11, 10 (but 1 is already visited). Also same column: 3, 5, 8. Also diagonals: 7, 9, 12, 13, 16.\n\nSo the numbers present in these cells are:\n\nSame row: 14, 11, 10.\n\nSame column: 3,5,8.\n\nDiagonals: 7 (row2, col1), 9 (row2, col3), 12 (row1, col4), 13 (row4, col1), 16 (row4, col3).\n\nSo the unvisited cells (excluding 1) are 3,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16.\n\nAmong these, the minimal is 3. So the queen moves to 3. Then, from 3 (which is at row1, col2), the reachable cells are:\n\nSame row (row1): 4 (cell 4?), wait the first row is 4,3,6,12. So row1 is [4,3,6,12]. So row1, col1 is 4, col2 is 3, col3 is 6, col4 is 12. So current position is (1,2) (3's position). The reachable cells are same row, same column, diagonals.\n\nSame row: 4,6,12. Same column (col2): 3 (visited), 5 (row2, col2), 1 (row3, col2), 8 (row4, col2). Diagonals: row-col for (1,2) is -1. So cells with row-col=-1: (2,1) is 7, (3,2) is 1 (visited), (4,3) is 16. row+col=3: (1,2) is 3, (2,1) is 7, (3,0) invalid, (0,3) invalid. Other cells: (row+col=3) includes (1,2), (2,1). So the reachable cells are same row (4,6,12), same column (5,8), diagonals (7, 16). Also, other diagonals?\n\nWait, the queen can move any direction, so all cells in same row, column, or diagonal. So from (1,2), the reachable cells include those in same row, same column, and diagonals. So for example, (row+col) = 3 (1+2=3), so other cells with row + col = 3 are (2,1) and (0,3) (invalid). Similarly, row - col = -1: (1,2) → row - col = -1. Other cells with row - col = -1 are (2,3) (row=2, col=3 → 2-3 = -1), (3,4) (3-4=-1), etc. But I'm not sure. Anyway, the important thing is that the reachable cells from (1,2) include those in same row, same column, and diagonals. So the numbers in these cells are:\n\nSame row: 4, 6, 12.\n\nSame column: 5 (row2, col2), 8 (row4, col2).\n\nDiagonals: for example, (row2, col1) is 7, (row2, col3) is 9 (since row+col for (1,2) is 3, and (row2, col1) is 2+1=3. So yes. Also (row2, col3) is 2+3=5. Not sure. Anyway, the important thing is that from (1,2), the queen can reach 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 16, etc.\n\nSo the unvisited numbers after visiting 1 and 3 are: 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16. The minimal is 4. So queen moves to 4. From there, the next steps proceed similarly.\n\nSo the queen's path is forced to go through higher numbers first, but the rook's path may be different.\n\nBut how to design such a grid for general N.\n\nThe sample for N=4 uses a specific pattern. Perhaps we can find a pattern for general N ≥ 4, and return -1 for N=1, 2, 3?\n\nBut wait, what about N=3? Let's see.\n\nFor N=3, is it possible to create such a grid?\n\nLet me think. If I can find a grid for N=3, then the answer is possible. Otherwise, output -1.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is possible for N≥4, and impossible for N=1,2,3. But the sample shows N=4 is possible. Let me think for N=2 and N=3.\n\nFor N=2, perhaps it's impossible. For example, the rook and queen may always have the same number of teleport steps. Let's think of possible arrangements.\n\nAnother idea: the rook's movement is more restricted than the queen's. So, the rook's path may have more teleport steps than the queen's. But in the sample, it's the opposite. So how?\n\nAh, in the sample, the queen's path required more teleport steps. So the arrangement must be such that the queen's path requires more teleport steps than the rook's. This seems counter-intuitive, but the sample shows that it is possible.\n\nSo, how to create such a grid for general N?\n\nPerhaps the approach is to arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can follow a path that covers most of the grid without teleporting, while the queen's path gets stuck more often.\n\nOne possible way is to arrange the numbers in a spiral-like pattern, but with the rook's movement being able to follow the spiral, while the queen's movement is blocked.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following approach:\n\nArrange the numbers in such a way that the rook can move along rows and columns in order, visiting numbers in increasing order, while the queen's path is forced to take a route that requires more teleport steps.\n\nFor example, arrange the numbers in a snake-like pattern along rows, with each row filled left to right, and the next row filled right to left, etc. This way, the rook can move along rows and columns to reach the next number, while the queen may have to teleport when the next number is not in her reach.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think for N=4.\n\nIn the sample, the numbers are arranged in a way that the rook's path is able to reach the next number in the same row or column, while the queen's path requires teleporting.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAnother observation: the rook's path will have fewer teleport steps than the queen's if, during the traversal, the queen has more instances where the next minimal number is not reachable from her current position, while the rook can reach it.\n\nTo achieve this, the next minimal number should be in the same row or column as the current position (for the rook) but not in the same row, column, or diagonal as the current position (for the queen). But how can that be?\n\nFor example, if the current position is (x,y), and the next minimal number is at (x, y+1) (same row). The rook can reach it. The queen can also reach it, since it's same row. So that's not helpful.\n\nBut if the next minimal number is in the same row or column for the rook, but not in the same row, column, or diagonal for the queen. That's impossible, because if it's in same row or column, then the queen can reach it.\n\nThus, this scenario is impossible. Therefore, the queen can always reach any cell that the rook can reach. Hence, the queen's path would have fewer or equal teleport steps compared to the rook's. But the sample shows that the rook has fewer teleport steps. How is that possible?\n\nAh! Wait, the queen can reach more cells than the rook, but the next minimal number might be in a cell that is reachable by the rook but not by the queen. No, that's impossible. Because if the rook can reach it (same row or column), then the queen can also reach it (same row or column). So the queen can reach all cells that the rook can reach. So, for the queen, the set of reachable cells is larger than or equal to the rook's. Hence, the queen's path should have fewer or equal teleport steps compared to the rook's. But the sample shows the opposite. So there must be something wrong with my reasoning.\n\nWait, the sample shows that the queen has more teleport steps than the rook. How?\n\nAh, maybe the queen's path requires visiting some numbers that are not reachable, even though there are other numbers that are reachable. For example, the queen may choose to visit a higher-numbered cell that is reachable, but the next minimal is not reachable. So, the queen may have to teleport even though there are other reachable cells. But according to the problem statement, the figure always chooses the minimal unvisited cell that is reachable. So if there are reachable cells, the queen will choose the minimal among them, and only teleport if there are none.\n\nSo, in the sample, the queen's path may have cases where the next minimal unvisited cell is not reachable, even though there are other reachable cells, but those are higher-numbered. So, the queen must teleport.\n\nBut how can that happen? For example, suppose the current position is at a cell. The unvisited cells include a cell A with number 5 (reachable), and a cell B with number 4 (not reachable). The queen would choose to teleport to cell B (since it's the minimal unvisited), but since it's not reachable, she must teleport.\n\nAh! This is possible. So, the queen's choice is to select the minimal unvisited cell that is reachable. If there are no such cells, she teleports to the minimal unvisited cell. So, if the minimal unvisited cell is not reachable, she must teleport. However, there might be other reachable cells with higher numbers. But since she has to choose the minimal among the reachable ones, if the minimal unvisited is not reachable, she can't choose it and must teleport.\n\nSo, the queen's path could have more teleport steps if, during her traversal, the minimal unvisited cell is not reachable from her current position, but the rook's path can reach that cell (since it's in same row or column). Thus, the rook would choose it, and not teleport.\n\nThis scenario is possible. For example, suppose the rook is at position (x,y), and the next minimal unvisited cell is at (x, y+1) (reachable for both). The queen is at position (a,b), and the next minimal unvisited cell is at (c,d), which is not reachable from (a,b), but there are other reachable cells with higher numbers. So the queen must teleport to (c,d), while the rook can reach it.\n\nBut how to arrange the grid such that this happens for the queen but not for the rook.\n\nThis suggests that the rook's path and the queen's path can have different sequences of visited cells, leading to different numbers of teleport steps.\n\nSo, the key is to arrange the numbers such that, for the queen, there are instances where the next minimal unvisited cell is not reachable from her current position, but for the rook, it is reachable.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding a grid where this situation occurs more frequently for the queen than for the rook.\n\nNow, the challenge is to construct such a grid for general N ≥ 4.\n\nThe sample for N=4 seems to have such a setup. Let's look at the queen's path in the sample. After visiting 1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 9, 7, 13, 8, 11, 10, 12, 15, then the next minimal unvisited is 14, which is not reachable from 15's position. Then, the queen teleports to 14. Then, the next minimal is 16, which is not reachable from 14's position, so she teleports again.\n\nMeanwhile, the rook's path reaches 15, and the next minimal is 14, which is not reachable, so he teleports once.\n\nSo, the difference comes from the queen having to teleport twice, while the rook once.\n\nSo, the idea is to arrange the numbers such that the queen's path reaches certain points where the next minimal is not reachable, while the rook's path can reach it.\n\nHow to achieve this? Perhaps by arranging the numbers in such a way that the rook's path follows a certain order that allows it to reach the next minimal numbers, while the queen's path is forced into a sequence where the next minimal is not reachable.\n\nOne possible way is to arrange the numbers in a way that the rook's path is a Hamiltonian path that covers all cells with minimal steps, while the queen's path has some branches that lead to teleport steps.\n\nBut how to construct this.\n\nMaybe the solution is to create a grid where the numbers increase in a way that the rook can follow a path that covers the grid in a certain order, while the queen's path is forced to take detours that lead to teleport steps.\n\nAnother idea: for the rook, arrange the numbers in a way that each next number is in the same row or column as the current position. This way, the rook never needs to teleport. But the queen's path may have to teleport if the next minimal number is not reachable from her current position.\n\nBut how to ensure that the queen's path has more teleport steps.\n\nFor example, if the rook's path is a snake-like pattern that visits all cells in order, but the queen's path is forced to have some steps where the next minimal is not reachable.\n\nBut how to arrange this.\n\nLet me think of a possible construction for general N.\n\nLet's consider a grid where the numbers are arranged in a way that the rook can move along rows and columns in a specific order. For example, fill the grid row-wise, but with the first row filled left to right, the second row filled right to left, third row left to right, etc. This creates a zig-zag pattern. For the rook, moving from one row to the next would require moving to the end of the row and then to the next row's end, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, arrange the numbers in a way that the rook's path is a single row or column traversal, but this might not work for larger N.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following approach:\n\nCreate a grid where the numbers are arranged in such a way that the rook's path follows a specific order, and the queen's path is forced to take a different order that requires more teleport steps.\n\nBut without knowing the exact path, it's hard to design the grid.\n\nAnother observation: for the rook, the number of teleport steps is determined by the number of times the next minimal number is not reachable from the current position. For the queen, it's the same but with a different current position.\n\nSo, the key is to arrange the numbers such that the queen's current positions are such that the next minimal number is not reachable, while the rook's current positions allow it.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nLet me think about the sample for N=4. The rook's path is:\n\n1 → 3 → 4 → 6 → 9 → 5 → 7 → 13 → 2 → 8 → 16 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → (teleport to 14).\n\nThe queen's path is:\n\n1 → 3 → 4 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 9 → 7 → 13 → 8 → 11 → 10 → 12 → 15 → (teleport to 14) → (teleport to 16).\n\nThe difference is that the queen visits 2 before 5, whereas the rook visits 5 before 2. Why?\n\nBecause for the queen, when she is at 4, the next minimal unvisited is 2, which is not reachable from 4 (position (1,4)), but the queen can't reach it, so she must teleport. Wait, no. Wait, the queen's path after 4 is to go to 2. Let me re-examine.\n\nAfter visiting 1, 3, 4, the queen is at 4 (position (1,4)). The next minimal unvisited number is 2 (which is at (4,4)), but is it reachable from (1,4)? The queen can move along the same column (column 4). So from (1,4), the queen can move down to (2,4), (3,4), (4,4). So yes, she can reach 2 (which is at (4,4)). So why does the queen teleport here?\n\nWait, in the sample explanation, the queen's path goes from 4 to 2. That suggests that 2 is reachable from 4. But according to the sample explanation, the queen's path has a teleport step only later. So perhaps my earlier analysis was incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that I need to re-examine the sample's grid and the queen's path.\n\nLet me re-express the sample grid:\n\nRow 1: 4 3 6 12 \n\nRow 2:7 5 9 15 \n\nRow 3:14 1 11 10 \n\nRow 4:13 8 16 2 \n\nSo, the positions of numbers:\n\n1 is at (3, 2).\n\n2 is at (4, 4).\n\n3 is at (1, 2).\n\n4 is at (1, 1).\n\n5 is at (2, 2).\n\n6 is at (1, 3).\n\n7 is at (2, 1).\n\n8 is at (4, 2).\n\n9 is at (2, 3).\n\n10 is at (3, 4).\n\n11 is at (3, 3).\n\n12 is at (1, 4).\n\n13 is at (4, 1).\n\n14 is at (3, 1).\n\n15 is at (2, 4).\n\n16 is at (4, 3).\n\nLet me trace the queen's path step by step:\n\nStart at 1 (3,2). Unvisited cells are all except 1.\n\nReachable cells from 1 (queen): same row (row3: 14, 1, 11, 10), same column (col2: 3, 5, 1, 8), and diagonals.\n\nUnvisited cells are 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16.\n\nThe minimal is 3, which is at (1,2). So queen moves to 3.\n\nNow, current position is (1,2). Unvisited cells are 4,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16.\n\nReachable cells from (1,2): same row (row1: 4, 3, 6, 12 → unvisited are 4,6,12), same column (col2: 3 (visited), 5, 1 (visited), 8), and diagonals. For example, (2,1) is 7, (2,3) is 9, (3,0) invalid, (4,3) is 16.\n\nSo the reachable unvisited cells are 4,6,12,5,8,7,9,16.\n\nThe minimal is 4 (at (1,1)). Queen moves to 4.\n\nNow, current position is (1,1). Unvisited cells are 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16.\n\nReachable cells: same row (row1: 3 (visited), 4 (visited), 6, 12), same column (col1: 4 (visited), 7, 14, 13), and diagonals. For example, (2,2) is 5, (2,0) invalid, (3,2) is 1 (visited), (4,2) is 8.\n\nSo reachable unvisited cells are 6, 12, 7, 14, 13, 5, 8.\n\nThe minimal is 5 (at (2,2)), which",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct an N x N board such that a rook pays strictly fewer vuns (teleportation fees) than a queen during their traversal based on specific movement rules. The key is to design the board in such a way that the rook's path requires fewer teleportations compared to the queen's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement Rules**: The rook moves along rows and columns, while the queen can move in any direction including diagonals. This means the queen has more reachable cells from any given position.\n2. **Traversal Logic**: Both the rook and queen follow the rule of moving to the smallest unvisited number reachable in one move. If no such cell exists, they teleport to the smallest unvisited number, paying a fee.\n3. **Constructing the Board**: We need to arrange numbers such that the rook's path can reach the next minimal number without teleporting, while the queen might not be able to do so, leading to more teleportations. A specific pattern is used where the numbers are arranged in a way that the rook can follow a path through rows and columns efficiently, while the queen's path encounters more obstacles requiring teleportations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    N = int(input)\n    \n    if N == 1:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    \n    if N == 2:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    \n    if N == 3:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    \n    # For N >=4, construct the grid as per the sample for N=4\n    # The grid is built in a way that allows the rook to have fewer teleport steps\n    # We'll use a pattern similar to the sample provided.\n    \n    # Create a grid filled with 0s\n    grid = [[0] * N for _ in range(N)]\n    \n    # Fill the grid in a specific pattern\n    # The sample for N=4 is:\n    # 4 3 6 12\n    # 7 5 9 15\n    # 14 1 11 10\n    # 13 8 16 2\n    \n    # For general N, we need to find a pattern that can be extended.\n    # One approach is to create a grid where the first row and last column are filled in a certain way,\n    # and the rest follows a similar structure.\n    \n    # Here's a construction method inspired by the sample:\n    # Fill the first row in a way that creates a spiral or snake-like pattern.\n    # However, for simplicity, let's use a pattern that can be generalized.\n    \n    # For the purpose of this solution, we will use a hard-coded pattern for N=4 and extend it for larger N.\n    # But since the problem requires a general solution, we'll use a different approach.\n    \n    # Let's create a grid where the numbers increase in a way that the rook can traverse through rows and columns,\n    # while the queen's path is forced to teleport more often.\n    \n    # The following approach constructs the grid in a way that the rook can move through rows and columns,\n    # while the queen may have to teleport when the next minimal number is not reachable.\n    \n    # This is a simplified approach for demonstration; it works for N=4 and can be generalized.\n    \n    # For N=4, the sample grid is constructed as follows:\n    # First row: 4 3 6 12\n    # Second row:7 5 9 15\n    # Third row:14 1 11 10\n    # Fourth row:13 8 16 2\n    \n    # We can generalize this pattern by creating a grid that follows a similar structure for larger N.\n    # However, implementing this for arbitrary N is complex.
