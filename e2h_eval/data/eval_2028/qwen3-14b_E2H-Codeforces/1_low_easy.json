The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, for the i-th ring. So for each ring, we need to calculate the perimeter of that rectangle and sum them all up.\n\nWait, but how do you calculate the number of cells in a rectangular border? For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. Like, for example, a rectangle of 3x3, the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (the corners) = 8, which matches the first example input where output is 8. So yes, the formula would be 2*(w + h - 2) for each ring.\n\nBut wait, for each ring, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1))? Wait, the first ring is the edge. So for i=1, the rectangle is w x h. Then the next ring is 2 cells away, so the rectangle is (w - 4*(1)) and (h - 4*(1))? Wait, no. Wait the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, for example, the first ring (i=1) is the border of the original rectangle. So for i=1, the rectangle is w × h. Then the second ring (i=2) is the border of a rectangle that's (w - 4*(2-1)) × (h - 4*(2-1)) = (w-4) × (h-4). But wait, that's because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side. So for each ring, the next one is 2 cells inward on each side. So for the first ring, the rectangle is w x h. The next ring is (w-4) x (h-4), since you remove 2 from each side (left and right, top and bottom). So the perimeter for each ring is 2*( (width) + (height) - 2 ), where width and height are the dimensions of the rectangle for that ring.\n\nSo the total number of cells is the sum for each i from 1 to k of 2*( (w_i) + (h_i) - 2 ), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1).\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that for each i, the rectangle is valid. For example, if the original w and h are 3, then for k=1, it's okay. But if k is larger, then maybe the dimensions would become less than 3? But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. The problem says that k is up to floor( (min(n,m)+1)/4 ), which probably ensures that each ring can be formed.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum all perimeters.\n\nSo let's take the first example input: 3 3 1. The first ring is 3x3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4 = 8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. The perimeter is 2*(7 + 9 - 2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. First ring is 7x9: perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Second ring is (7-4)=3, (9-4)=5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the formula seems correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize total = 0\n\n- For each i in 1..k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2",
