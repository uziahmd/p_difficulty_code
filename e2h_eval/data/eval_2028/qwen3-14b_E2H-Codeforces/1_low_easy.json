The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, the second is two cells in, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle. For example, the first ring is the perimeter of the entire plate. The second ring would be the perimeter of a rectangle that's 2 cells in from the edges, which would be (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), but wait, for i-th ring. Wait, the description says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but for the first ring, i=1, so it's (w - 0) × (h - 0), which is the original size. Then the perimeter of that rectangle is calculated. Then for the second ring, i=2, so the rectangle is (w - 4*(1)) × (h - 4*(1)), and then take its perimeter. But wait, how do you calculate the perimeter of a rectangle in terms of cells?\n\nWait, the perimeter of a rectangle with width W and height H (in cells) would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because, for example, a rectangle that's 3x3 cells: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (since the corners are counted twice). Wait, no. Let me think again. The perimeter in terms of cells: imagine a rectangle that's m rows high and n columns wide. The number of cells in the perimeter is 2*m + 2*(n-2). Because the top and bottom rows contribute m cells each, and the left and right columns contribute (n-2) each (since the top and bottom are already counted). Alternatively, it's 2*(m + n) - 4, since each side contributes m or n, but the four corners are counted twice. So 2*(m + n) - 4 = 2m + 2n -4. Which is same as 2*(m + n - 2). So yes, for a rectangle of size m x n, the perimeter is 2*(m + n - 2) cells.\n\nBut for each ring, we need to compute that perimeter. However, there's a catch: for each subsequent ring, the dimensions of the rectangle decrease by 4 in each direction. Wait, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side. So for example, the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. Then the next ring is the perimeter of a rectangle that's 2 cells smaller in each direction. Wait, but the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for i=1, it's w × h. For i=2, it's (w-4) × (h-4). For i=3, (w-8) × (h-8), etc. But wait, that's only possible if the dimensions are large enough. So for each ring i, we need to check that the dimensions are at least 3, since otherwise the rectangle can't exist. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. So the input ensures that for all i up to k, the dimensions are valid.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but let me check the sample input.\n\nFirst example input is 3 3 1. So the first ring is perimeter of 3x3. Which is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the sample output of 8.\n\nSecond example input is 7 9 1. So perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThird example is 7 9 2. So first ring is 7x9: 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Second ring is (7-4) × (9-4) = 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample. So yes, this approach seems correct.\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with given dimensions and a specified number of rings. Each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle that decreases in size with each subsequent ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the perimeter of a rectangle of size `m x n` is calculated as `2 * (m + n - 2)`. This formula accounts for the top and bottom rows and the left and right columns, subtracting the corners which are counted twice.\n2. **Iterate Over Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle adjusted for the current ring. The dimensions of the rectangle for the i-th ring are adjusted by reducing both width and height by `4 * (i - 1)` to account for the previous rings.\n3. **Summing Perimeters**: Sum the perimeters of all the rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The input values for width (`w`), height (`h`), and number of rings (`k`) are read and split into integers.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, adjust the width and height of the rectangle by subtracting `4 * (i - 1)` from both dimensions.\n3. **Perimeter Calculation**: Calculate the perimeter of the adjusted rectangle using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)`.\n4. **Summing Values**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing their perimeters, ensuring correctness and optimal performance within the given constraints.",
