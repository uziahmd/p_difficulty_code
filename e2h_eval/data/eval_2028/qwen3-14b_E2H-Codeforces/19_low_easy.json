The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to maximize the sum. Since each district's value is 2^i, which increases exponentially with i, we want to keep as many higher-numbered districts as possible. But we also have to make sure that the remaining districts are connected.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure connectivity? Because removing certain districts might disconnect the graph. So the challenge is to choose which districts to remove so that the remaining ones are connected, and we keep the ones with the highest possible numbers.\n\nLet me think. Since the districts form a tree (as there's exactly one path between any two), removing some nodes will leave a subtree. We need to select a subtree with n - k nodes, which is connected, and the sum of their 2^i is maximum.\n\nBut how to find this subtree?\n\nThe maximum sum would be achieved by keeping the districts with the largest possible numbers. However, we can't just remove the first k smallest districts because their removal might disconnect the tree. So we need to find a way to choose which districts to remove so that the remaining ones are connected and include as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to consider that the optimal subtree must include the highest-numbered districts possible. So maybe we can start by trying to keep the largest districts and then check if they form a connected subtree. If not, we need to remove some lower-numbered districts that are necessary for connectivity.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as choosing which districts to remove. Since the sum is maximized when we keep the largest possible districts, perhaps we can perform a greedy approach where we remove the smallest districts that are not part of the necessary structure.\n\nWait, but how to model this. Let's think of the problem as selecting n - k districts to keep. These must form a connected subtree. The sum of their values is maximized when we keep the districts with the largest possible numbers. However, if those districts are not connected, we need to include some lower-numbered ones to connect them.\n\nBut how can we find which districts to remove?\n\nAnother idea: since the value of each district is 2^i, which is exponentially larger than the sum of all smaller districts. For example, 2^5 is larger than 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^4. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to keep all the districts from some high number down, but ensuring they are connected.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the largest possible subset of districts with the highest numbers that form a connected subtree. Then, if we have more than n - k districts in that subset, we can remove the smallest ones (but that's probably not needed). Wait, but how to find that subset.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a tree where we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. So, perhaps we can start by considering the largest district (district n) and then include as many higher-numbered districts as possible, making sure that the subtree is connected.\n\nBut how to do that? Maybe using a priority queue approach. Wait, perhaps a better way is to think of the problem as selecting which districts to remove. Since the districts with higher numbers are more valuable, we want to avoid removing them. So the districts that are removed should be the ones with the smallest numbers, but only if they are not necessary for the connectivity of the higher-numbered districts.\n\nBut how to determine that. This seems tricky.\n\nAnother approach: The optimal solution is to keep the districts with the highest numbers, but possibly excluding some of the lower ones. However, since the tree is connected, if we take all districts from m to n (for some m), but that might not be connected. So we need to find the minimal set of districts that connects all the high-numbered ones.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a tree where the nodes kept are the ones with the highest possible numbers. So, perhaps we can perform a process where we start with the highest-numbered node, and then add the next highest-numbered nodes that are connected to the existing subtree. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a reverse process. We need to remove k districts. Since we want to keep the ones with the largest numbers, we can try to remove the smallest possible ones, but only if they are not necessary for the connectivity of the higher-numbered districts.\n\nBut how to decide which ones to remove. Here's an idea: the districts that are not in the subtree of the highest-numbered districts can be removed. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, here's a thought. The districts are numbered from 1 to n. The value of 2^i is",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. The districts are connected in a tree structure, and each district's fan count is exponentially increasing with its number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure and Connectivity**: Since the districts form a tree, removing certain nodes might disconnect the tree. We need to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected component.\n2. **Maximizing Fan Count**: The fan count for each district is $2^i$, which increases exponentially with the district number. Therefore, we should prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Greedy Strategy**: Start from the highest-numbered district and iteratively build a connected subtree by including the highest possible districts. This ensures that we maximize the sum of fans while maintaining connectivity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    # We want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible\n    # So we start from the highest node and try to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible\n    # We can use a priority queue (max heap) approach, but since Python's heapq is min-heap, we can invert the values\n    \n    # We'll use a set to track which nodes are kept\n    kept = [False] * (n + 1)\n    # We'll use a priority queue (max heap) of nodes to process, starting with node n\n    import heapq\n    heap = []\n    heapq.heappush(heap, -n)\n    kept[n] = True\n    count = 1\n    \n    # We need to keep (n - k) nodes\n    target = n - k\n    \n    while count < target and heap:\n        current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n        for neighbor in edges[current]:\n            if not kept[neighbor]:\n                kept[neighbor] = True\n                count += 1\n                heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n    \n    # Now, collect all the nodes not kept\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not kept[i]:\n            result.append(i)\n    \n    # Sort the result and output\n    result.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Tree Traversal**: Starting from the highest-numbered district (node `n`), we use a max-heap (implemented using a min-heap with inverted values) to prioritize processing higher-numbered districts first.\n2. **Connectivity Check**: As we process each node, we ensure that all its neighbors are considered for inclusion in the connected component. This ensures that the subtree remains connected.\n3. **Result Collection**: After ensuring we have the required number of districts (`n - k`), we collect the districts that were not included in the connected component and sort them to meet the output requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that we maximize the sum of fans by prioritizing higher-numbered districts while maintaining the connectivity of the remaining districts.",
