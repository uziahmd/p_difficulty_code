The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about selecting k districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. The output should be the k district numbers in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key points here are:\n\n- The districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair. So the initial structure is a tree.\n- When we remove k districts, the remaining n - k districts must form a connected subtree.\n- We need to maximize the sum of 2^i for the kept districts. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute more. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure connectivity? Because even if we want to keep the highest possible districts, they might not be connected. So perhaps we need to find a subtree that includes the highest possible districts, but with the minimal number of lower-numbered districts needed to connect them.\n\nBut how to approach this?\n\nLet me think: Since the value of 2^i increases with i, the best strategy is to keep the largest possible districts. However, they must be connected. So the problem reduces to selecting a subtree of size (n -k) that includes as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nBut how to find which districts to remove?\n\nAn alternative approach: Think of it as choosing which districts to keep. We need to choose (n -k) districts that form a connected subtree, and maximize the sum. Since the sum is determined by the districts kept, and higher numbers are better, we need to keep the largest (n -k) districts possible, but ensuring they are connected.\n\nWait, but maybe some of the largest districts are not connected. For example, if the tree is structured such that the largest districts are in separate branches. Then we need to include some lower-numbered districts to connect them.\n\nBut how can we find the optimal set?\n\nLet me think of a way to model this. Since the districts are numbered from 1 to n, and higher numbers have higher values, perhaps the optimal solution is to keep all districts from some number m upwards, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. But how to find m?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem where we need to select a subtree with (n -k) nodes, and the sum is maximized. Since the sum is maximized when we have the largest possible nodes, perhaps we can greedily select the largest nodes, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAnother thought: Since the tree is connected, and we need to keep a connected subset. Let's consider that the optimal set will include the highest possible nodes, but we need to find which ones can be connected with minimal loss.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe need to select (n -k) districts. Let's think of the problem as removing k districts. The districts to remove are those with the smallest numbers, but only if they are not necessary for the connectivity of the higher-numbered districts.\n\nWait, but how to determine which ones to remove?\n\nMaybe we can model this as a priority-based selection. Start with the highest-numbered node, and then include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, making sure that the subtree remains connected.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. The idea is that we can perform a traversal starting from the highest-numbered node, and greedily include other nodes that are connected and have high numbers.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think about the structure of the tree. Since the tree is arbitrary, but the districts are numbered from 1 to n. Let me think of the tree as rooted at node n (the highest number). Then, we can perform a traversal to collect as many nodes as possible, but we need to decide which nodes to include.\n\nBut wait, the problem is that we need to select exactly (n -k) nodes. So perhaps we need to find a subtree of size (n -k) that contains the maximum possible sum. Since the sum is maximized by including as many high-numbered nodes as possible, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes all nodes from some value up, but connected.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: The optimal set of districts to keep is the set of districts with numbers in a certain subset S, where S has size (n -k), and S is connected. To maximize the sum, S should contain the largest possible numbers.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to include all districts with numbers greater than or equal to some value, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. However, this might not be possible, so we",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and the total number of fans is maximized. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we should prioritize keeping them while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, which means there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since the number of fans for district `i` is `2^i`, we should aim to keep the highest-numbered districts possible.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected subtree. To do this efficiently, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach starting from the highest-numbered node and traversing through the tree, prioritizing higher-numbered nodes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        tree[a].append(b)\n        tree[b].append(a)\n    \n    # We need to keep (n - k) districts.

So, taking any subset of these nodes would not necessarily form a connected component. So this approach is incorrect.\n    \n    # Hmm, so this approach is flawed. How else can we proceed?\n    \n    # Another idea: The optimal set of nodes to keep is the set of nodes with the largest numbers, but they must form a connected component. So, we can start with the largest node and perform a BFS/DFS to collect as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but ensuring that the total count is (n -k).\n    \n    # Let me think of the following approach:\n    # 1. We need to keep (n -k) nodes. We can start with the largest node (n), and then greedily add the next largest nodes that are connected to the current component.\n    # 2. To do this, we can use a priority queue (max-heap) that contains nodes that are adjacent to the current component. Initially, the component contains node n, and the priority queue contains its neighbors.\n    # 3. At each step, we select the node with the highest number from the priority queue that is not yet in the component. We add it to the component and add its neighbors to the priority queue (if not already in the component or the queue).\n    # 4. Repeat until the component has (n -k) nodes.\n    \n    # This approach ensures that we always add the highest possible node that can be connected to the current component.\n    \n    # However, implementing this requires a priority queue and tracking visited nodes.\n    \n    # Let's try this approach.\n    \n    import heapq\n    \n    kept_nodes = set()\n    kept_nodes.add(n)\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    visited[n] = True\n    # Priority queue (max-heap simulation using negative values)\n    heap = []\n    for neighbor in tree[n]:\n        heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n    \n    count = 1\n    while count < (n - k):\n        if not heap:\n            break  # shouldn't happen as per problem constraints\n        neg_curr, curr = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if visited[curr]:\n            continue\n        # Add this node to the component\n        kept_nodes.add(curr)\n        visited[curr] = True\n        count += 1\n        # Add its neighbors to the heap\n        for neighbor in tree[curr]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n    \n    # Now, the kept_nodes contains the (n -k) nodes to keep. The rest are to be removed.\n    # We need to collect the nodes not in kept_nodes, sort them, and output them.\n    \n    to_remove = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in kept_nodes:\n            to_remove.append(i)\n    \n    to_remove.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, to_remove)))\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()",
