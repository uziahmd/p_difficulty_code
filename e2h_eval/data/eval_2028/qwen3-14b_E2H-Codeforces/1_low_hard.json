The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, for the i-th ring, right?\n\nSo for each ring from 1 to k, I need to calculate the perimeter of that rectangle and sum them all. But wait, how does the perimeter calculation work here? Because for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter in terms of cells would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes (length) cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a rectangle that's 3x3: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (the four corners counted twice) → 8, which matches the first example where input is 3 3 1, output is 8.\n\nYes, so the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle with width W and height H is 2*(W + H - 2). Because for each of the two dimensions, you have the top and bottom (each of length W) and the left and right (each of length H), but subtracting 4 because the four corners are counted twice. Alternatively, the formula can be written as 2*(W + H) - 4, which simplifies to 2*(W + H - 2). So that's the formula for each ring.\n\nBut for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), the dimensions of the rectangle are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but for the first ring, i=1, so it's w and h. Then for the second ring, i=2, subtract 4*(1) from each dimension. So for each ring, we compute the perimeter of that rectangle and sum them all.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. For each ring, the rectangle must be at least 3x3? Or maybe the problem ensures that the parameters are valid. Because the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3 + 1)/4 is 1, so floor is 1. So k can be 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3 plate, you can only have one ring. For a 7x7 plate, min is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2, so floor is 2. So k can be up to 2. Let's check for i=2: the rectangle would be 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4=3. So 3x3. Which is valid. So the formula works.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle with dimensions (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), then sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but how do I compute that? Let's take the first example:\n\nInput is 3 3 1. So for i=1, the dimensions are 3 and 3. Perimeter is 2*(3 + 3 - 2) = 2*4 = 8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input is 7 9 1. So the first ring is 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example input is 7 9 2. So first ring is 7x9 → 28. Second ring is 7-4*(2-1) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1)=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6 = 12. Total sum is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the sample output. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the plan is to loop from i=1 to k, compute for each i the current width and height, then compute the perimeter, add to the total.\n\nNow, the code. Let's think about the steps.\n\nRead the input: three integers w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h",
