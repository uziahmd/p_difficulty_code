The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away. Wait, the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so for each ring, the next one is 2*2 = 4 less in each dimension. Because for example, the first ring is the outermost layer. Then the next ring would be inside, so the width and height are reduced by 4*(i-1) for each step. Wait, for i=1, it's the original size. For i=2, the rectangle is (w-4(1)) × (h-4(1))? So for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and the ring is the perimeter of that rectangle. Wait, but the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4, because each side contributes (width or height) but the corners are counted twice. Wait, for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the perimeter cells would be 2*(m + n) - 4. Because each side has m or n cells, but the four corners are counted twice. So subtracting 4 gives the correct count.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w' × h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for each ring, we need to check if the rectangle is valid. Because if the dimensions are too small, maybe the ring can't be formed. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's possible. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ), which probably ensures that each ring can be formed.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but let me check the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So the first ring is the perimeter of 3x3. Which is 2*(3+3) -4 = 8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1. The perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 32-4=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So first ring is 7x9, perimeter 28. Second ring is (7 -4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and 9-4=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the formula for each ring is 2*(current_width + current_height) -4. And current_width is w - 4*(i-1), current_height is h - 4*(i-1). So for each i from 1 to k, compute that.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read w, h, k.\n\n2. For each i in 1..k:\n\n   a. compute current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   b. compute current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   c. compute perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n   d. add to total.\n\nBut wait, what if current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. For example, the minimum between w and h is at least 3. For k being up to floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). Let's see: for example, if min(w,h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 = 1, floor is 1. So k can be 1. For that case, the first ring is 3x something. For i=1, current",
