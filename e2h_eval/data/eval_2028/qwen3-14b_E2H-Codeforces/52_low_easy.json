Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Vasily and his candles. So he starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The thing is, every 'b' used candles can be turned into a new one. And this new one can be used again, which in turn becomes another used candle when it's done. The question is to find out the total number of hours he can keep the room lit.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break that down. Initially, he uses 4 candles, so 4 hours. Then, those 4 used ones are turned into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 are used, so he can make 2/2 = 1 new. That adds 1 hour. Now, that one is used, but 1 is less than 2, so no more. Total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Oh right, but wait, when he makes the new candles, each time he uses them, they contribute to the total hours.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the total hours and the number of used candles. Let me think of the steps:\n\nStart with 'a' candles. Each time you burn them, you add to the total hours. Then, the used candles can be converted into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of variables. Let's have total_hours = 0. And current_candles = a. Also, used_candles = 0. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps we can model it as:\n\nInitially, you have 'a' candles. Each time you burn them, you get some used candles. Then, you can convert those into new ones. But the process is like:\n\n- Burn all available candles. Add the count to total hours. Then, collect the used ones. Then, make as many new candles as possible from them. Then, repeat the process with the new candles.\n\nWait, but how do you handle the cycle? Let's take the first example:\n\nInitial a=4, b=2.\n\nFirst step: burn 4 candles. total_hours +=4. Now, used_candles =4. Then, make 4//2 = 2 new candles. Now, the used_candles is 0, but we have 2 new ones. Then, burn those 2, total +=2. Now, used_candles is 2. Make 2//2=1 new. Burn that 1, total +=1. Now used_candles is 1. Can't make any more. So total is 4+2+1=7.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Initial 6. Burn them, total is 6. Used is 6. Make 6//3=2. Burn 2, total is 8. Now used is 2. 2 <3, so can't make. So total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the process is:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nused_candles = 0\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. Maybe the way to model it is:\n\nWe have a variable for the total hours. Then, we have the number of candles that can be burned. Each time, we burn all available candles, add that to the total, then collect the used ones. Then, convert those used ones into new candles. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\ncurrent = a\n\nwhile current > 0:\n\n    total += current\n\n    # now, after burning, the current becomes used_candles\n\n    # so, used_candles = current\n\n    # then, new_candles = used_candles // b\n\n    # but then, current becomes new_candles ?\n\n    current = (current) // b \n\nWait, but that would be incorrect. Because in the first step, for example, when current is 4, after burning, you have 4 used candles. Then, you can make 4//2 = 2 new. So the next current is 2. Then, you burn those 2, add to total. Then, used is 2, which gives 1 new. Burn that, add to total. Then, used is 1, which gives 0. So the loop stops. So the total is 4 + 2 + 1 =7.\n\nBut how to model that? Because the code would be:\n\ncurrent = a\n\ntotal =0\n\nwhile current >0:\n\n    total += current\n\n    current = current // b \n\nWait, but that would give for a=4, b=",
    "response": "To solve the problem of determining how many hours Vasily can illuminate his room with candles, we need to account for both the initial set of candles and the possibility of recycling used candles into new ones. The key insight is that each time a candle burns out, it can be used to create a new one if enough are collected.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with `a` candles.\n2. **Burn Candles**: Each candle burns for exactly 1 hour.\n3. **Recycle Used Candles**: After burning all available candles, collect the used ones and convert them into new ones. This is done by dividing the number of used candles by `b`, which gives the number of new candles that can be made.\n4. **Repeat**: Continue the process of burning and recycling until no more new candles can be made from the used ones.\n\nThis can be implemented using a loop that continues as long as there are candles to burn or recycle. In each iteration:\n- Add the number of currently available candles to the total hours.\n- Update the number of candles to the number of new candles that can be made from the used ones (i.e., integer division by `b`).\n\n---\n\n### **Solution Code**\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    \n    a = int(input[0])\n    b = int(input[1])\n    \n    total = 0\n    current = a\n    \n    while current > 0:\n        total += current\n        current = current // b\n    \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation**\n\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads two integers from standard input, representing the initial number of candles (`a`) and the number of used candles needed to make a new one (`b`).\n- **Loop Logic**:\n  - `total` keeps track of the total number of hours the room is illuminated.\n  - `current` holds the number of candles available to burn in the current iteration.\n  - In each iteration, the number of current candles is added to `total`, and then `current` is updated to the number of new candles that can be made from the used ones.\n- **Termination Condition**: The loop stops when `current` becomes zero, meaning no more candles can be made or burned.\n\nThis approach ensures optimal usage of all available candles and their recycled counterparts, achieving the maximum possible illumination time.",
