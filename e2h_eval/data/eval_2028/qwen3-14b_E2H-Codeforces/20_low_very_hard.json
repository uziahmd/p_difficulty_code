For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem statement is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to count the number of ways to assign c_s values (each between 0 and k) for all binary strings s of lengths 1 to n, such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to output this count modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the example given, a beautiful multiset must satisfy that for every prefix s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of binary strings of exactly length n.\n\nThe key here is that the maximum size of such a multiset is exactly f. So, we need to find all possible assignments of c_s values such that when you choose the c_s's, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think about the constraints on the c_s's. For the maximum size of the beautiful multiset to be exactly f, there must be at least one way to construct a multiset of size f that meets all the constraints, and no way to construct a multiset larger than f.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the maximum possible size is exactly f. So, the assignment of c_s's must allow for a maximum of f, and not higher than that.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to model the problem in terms of the constraints on the c_s's that ensure that the maximum possible size of the multiset is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute that? Let's think about the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset given the c_s's. How is that determined?\n\nThis seems similar to some kind of tree structure. Each binary string can be thought of as a node in a trie, where each node is a prefix. For example, the root could be the empty string (but maybe not, since our strings start from length 1). Wait, the problem says that the strings are of length from 1 to n. So, for each string s of length l (1 ≤ l ≤ n), the c_s is a constraint on how many times s can appear as a prefix in the multiset.\n\nBut the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n. So, for each string in the multiset, it contributes to the count of all its prefixes. For example, the string '101' (length 3) would contribute to the count of prefixes '1', '10', and '101'.\n\nThe maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the maximum number of strings we can select such that for every prefix s, the number of selected strings that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis feels like a problem where we need to model the constraints as a flow or something similar, but perhaps there's a way to model it with a hierarchical structure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a tree where each node represents a binary string, and each node has two children (appending 0 and 1). The root is the empty string, but since our strings are of length ≥1, maybe we don't consider that. But perhaps the hierarchy is important here.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a node s (a binary string). The number of times s can be a prefix in the multiset depends on the constraints of s and its ancestors. However, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is constrained by the minimum of the c_s's along the paths.\n\nWait, but for each string in the multiset (which is of length n), it contributes to all its prefixes. Therefore, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is limited by the constraints of all prefixes of all the strings in the multiset.\n\nTo maximize the size of the multiset, we want to choose as many strings as possible without violating any of the constraints. This seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements in a set where each element is a binary string of length n, and for each prefix s, the count of elements that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis problem resembles the problem of finding the maximum number of nodes in a trie, given constraints on the number of times each node can be passed through. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of assigning capacities to each node (the c_s's) and then finding the maximum number of paths (each path being a string of length n) such that for each node, the number of paths passing through it does not exceed its capacity. Then, the maximum number of such paths is the value we want.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum given the capacities? It seems like a problem that can be modeled with dynamic programming on",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to assign values $ c_s $ to all binary strings $ s $ of lengths from 1 to $ n $ such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $ f $. The constraints on $ c_s $ are that each $ c_s $ must be between 0 and $ k $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: For each binary string $ s $, the value $ c_s $ limits how many times $ s $ can appear as a prefix in the multiset. The challenge is to ensure that the maximum size of such a multiset is exactly $ f $.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use a DP approach where we compute the number of valid configurations for each possible depth (length of binary strings). We maintain two DP arrays:\n   - `dp[i][j]`: Number of ways to assign $ c_s $ values for strings of length up to $ i $ such that the maximum possible multiset size is at most $ j $.\n   - `cnt[i][j]`: Number of ways to assign $ c_s $ values for strings of length up to $ i $ such that the maximum possible multiset size is exactly $ j $.\n\n3. **Transition Between States**: For each length $ i $, we update the DP arrays considering the constraints from the previous length. This involves iterating over possible values of $ c_s $ and updating the counts accordingly.\n\n4. **Modulo Operations**: Since the results can be very large, we use modulo $ 998244353 $ throughout the calculations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    cases = []\n    for i in range(0, len(data), 3):\n        n = int(data[i])\n        k = int(data[i+1])\n        f = int(data[i+2])\n        cases.append((n, k, f))\n    \n    results = []\n    for n, k, f in cases:\n        max_len = n\n        \n        # dp[i][j]: number of ways to assign c_s for strings up to length i with max size <= j\n        # cnt[i][j]: number of ways to assign c_s for strings up to length i with max size == j\n        # We'll use two 2D arrays: dp and cnt\n        # But given n is up to 15, and f up to 2e5, we need to manage space efficiently\n        \n        # Initialize dp and cnt for length 0 (no strings)\n        dp = [ [0]*(f+2) for _ in range(n+2) ]\n        cnt = [ [0]*(f+2) for _ in range(n+2) ]\n        \n        # Base case: for length 0, there are no strings.

Instead, we use the following approach:\n            # For each length, the number of ways to assign c_s values such that the maximum multiset size is <= j is equal to the product for each node at this level of the number of choices for c_s that are <= min(c_parent, ...), but this seems too vague.\n            \n            # Another way: For each node (binary string of length l), the capacity c_s must be >= the number of times it is used in the multiset. However, since we are trying to find the maximum possible size of the multiset, which is constrained by the minimum capacities along the paths.\n            \n            # Let's consider that for each node, the capacity c_s must be at least the number of times it's used.

It initializes DP arrays to track the number of ways to assign capacities such that the maximum multiset size is within certain bounds. The transitions between states are based on the constraints of the problem, though the exact details of the transitions are complex and require deeper analysis for a complete solution.
