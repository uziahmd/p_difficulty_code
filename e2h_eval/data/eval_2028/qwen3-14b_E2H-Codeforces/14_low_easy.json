He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the trailing zero count is exactly m. Let's think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros. This function is non-decreasing as n increases. So for example, when n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases by 1 or more.\n\nWait, but when you go from n to n+1, the count can increase by 0 or 1. Wait, no. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, adding 1 to n would add another 5. But if n is a multiple of higher powers like 25, then adding 1 would add more. Wait, no. Let me think again. The count of trailing zeros for n is calculated as sum_{i=1}^∞ floor(n/(5^i)). So when you increase n by 1, the count increases by the number of times 5 divides into (n+1). For example, if n+1 is divisible by 5 but not 25, then the count increases by 1. If it's divisible by 25 but not 125, then it increases by 2, etc. So the function f(n) is non-decreasing, and can sometimes jump by more than 1. \n\nThis implies that for some m, there may be no n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. For example, if m is 5, then maybe there's a jump from 4 to 6, so there are no numbers with exactly 5 zeros. Wait, but the sample input shows that for m=1, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Let me check that. For example, 5! has one trailing zero. 6! is 720, also one. 7! is 5040, one. 8! is 40320, one. 9! is 362880, one. Then 10! is 3628800, which has two zeros. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. So for m=1, there are 5 numbers. So the sample makes sense.\n\nBut what about m=5? Let's see. Let's compute f(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. Then 25//5 is 5, 25//25 is 1, total 6. So f(25) is 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. Therefore, there are no numbers n where f(n) is 5. So for m=5, the answer would be zero. So that's why in the sample input, when m=5, the output is 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where f(n) equals m. But how to find them?\n\nThe approach I can think of is:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count. But since the function f(n) can jump by more than 1, there might be cases where there are no n's for a given m.\n\nBut how to find if there exists any n with f(n) = m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers. Wait, no. Let me think. For example, when m is 2, let's see:\n\nLooking for n where f(n)=2. Let's see:\n\nn=10: f(10) is 2. Then 11, 12, 13, 14: each of these will have f(n) = 2. Then",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in a factorial are formed and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight:\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5, every multiple of 25 contributes an additional 5, and so on. The formula to calculate the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is:\n\n$$\n\\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n$$\n\nThis function is non-decreasing as $ n $ increases, but it can sometimes jump by more than one (e.g., when $ n $ is a multiple of higher powers of 5). Therefore, for some values of $ m $, there may be no $ n $ such that $ \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = m $.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy:\n\n1. **Binary Search**:\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = m $. If no such $ n $ exists, return `0`.\n   - Once the minimum $ n $ is found, check how many consecutive numbers after it also have $ m $ trailing zeros.\n\n2. **Edge Case Handling**:\n   - If the count of trailing zeros jumps over $ m $, then there are no valid $ n $'s.\n   - For example, if the trailing zero count jumps from $ m-1 $ to $ m+1 $, then $ m $ has no corresponding $ n $.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation:\n\nWe'll use a helper function to compute the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $, and a binary search to find the lower bound of $ n $ that gives exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. Then, we'll count how many consecutive values starting from that lower bound yield exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_with_m_trailing_zeros(m):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    left = -1\n\n    # Binary search to find the smallest n with trailing_zeros(n) == m\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        tz = trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if tz < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n    left = low\n\n    # Check if trailing_zeros(left) is not equal to m\n    if trailing_zeros(left) != m:\n        return []\n\n    # Find the rightmost n with trailing_zeros(n) == m\n    right = left\n    while trailing_zeros(right) == m:\n        right += 1\n\n    return list(range(left, right))\n\ndef main():\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input_line)\n    results = find_n_with_m_trailing_zeros(m)\n    print(len(results))\n    if results:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, results)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation:\n\n- The `trailing_zeros` function computes the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ using the standard formula.\n- The `find_n_with_m_trailing_zeros` function uses binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ \\text{trailing\\_zeros}(n) = m $. It then checks how many consecutive numbers from that point onward also have exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n- The `main` function reads input, calls the helper function, and prints the result in the required format.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently search for valid $ n $ values and handle all edge cases, including when no such $ n $ exists.",
