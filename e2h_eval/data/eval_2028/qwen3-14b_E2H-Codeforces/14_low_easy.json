He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo, for a given m, we need to find all n's where this count equals m. But how?\n\nThe first thing I need to do is find for a given m, what possible n's satisfy the condition. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the sample input where m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. For 5!, the count is 1 (5/5=1). For 6! it's still 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1). Similarly for 7,8,9. But when you get to 10, the count becomes 2 (10/5=2, plus 10/25=0, so total 2). So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Hence those 5 numbers.\n\nSo the key idea is that for a given m, there can be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. However, sometimes there might be no such n. Like in the sample input where m=5, the output is 0. Wait, no, the sample input shows that when m=5, the output is 0. Wait, the example input is ['1', '5'], and the outputs are '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' and '0'. Oh right, for m=5, there's no n such that n! has exactly 5 trailing zeros. Let me check that. Let's compute for some numbers.\n\nFor example, let's compute the trailing zeros for 24: 24/5=4, 24/25=0. Total 4. 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So between 25 and 24, there's a jump from 4 to 6. So for m=5, there's no n. Hence the output is 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given m, the possible n's. But how?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are other numbers that also give the same count.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the lower and upper bounds of n where the count is m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach is to perform a binary search to find the smallest n where the count is >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the range of n's that give exactly m.\n\nWait, but how do we find the range?\n\nLet me think. For example, the count of trailing zeros increases as n increases. However, when n crosses a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1 or more. So for example, when n is 25, the count increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So for some m, there might be no n that gives exactly that m. For example, when m is 5, as in the example.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- For a given m, find the minimal n such that the count of trailing zeros is m. Then check if there are numbers after that which also have the same count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, find the lower and upper bounds of n where the count is exactly m. Let's think about the possible values of n. For example, for a given m, the count function is non-decreasing. So once the count exceeds m, all higher n's will have counts higher than m. Therefore, the possible n's that give exactly m must be in a contiguous range. So if there exists any n with count m, then there is a range of numbers from some low to high where the count is m. But how to find that range?\n\nLet me think. For example, for m=1, the count is 1 for n from 5 to 9. So the lower bound is 5, upper bound is 9. How do I find these?\n\nThe way to find the lower bound is to find the smallest n where the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. Additionally, we must output these integers in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is calculated using the formula:\n   $$\n   \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n   $$\n   This sum continues until the division result is zero.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Bounds**: To find the range of $ n $ values that produce exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we use binary search. We first find the smallest $ n $ (lower bound) and the largest $ n $ (upper bound) such that $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = m $.\n\n3. **Check Validity**: If no such $ n $ exists for the given $ m $, we return 0. Otherwise, we generate all integers between the lower and upper bounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * m\n    lower = -1\n    # Find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) >= m\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z >= m:\n            right = mid - 1\n            if z == m:\n                lower = mid\n        else:\n            left = mid + 1\n    if lower == -1:\n        return []\n    \n    left = 0\n    right = 5 * m\n    upper = -1\n    # Find the largest n where count_zeros(n) <= m\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        z = count_zeros(mid)\n        if z <= m:\n            left = mid + 1\n            if z == m:\n                upper = mid\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    if upper == -1:\n        return []\n    \n    if count_zeros(lower) != m or count_zeros(upper) != m:\n        return []\n    \n    return list(range(lower, upper + 1))\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m_values = [int(x) for x in input]\n    results = []\n    for m in m_values:\n        n_list = find_n_values(m)\n        results.append(str(len(n_list)))\n        if len(n_list) > 0:\n            results.append(' '.join(map(str, n_list)))\n        else:\n            results.append('')\n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by powers of 5 and summing the quotients.\n\n2. **find_n_values Function**: This function uses binary search to determine the smallest and largest values of $ n $ such that $ \\text{count\\_zeros}(n) = m $.
