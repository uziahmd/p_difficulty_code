She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the task is to find the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the [l, r] range. Let's break down what's needed here.\n\nFirst, let's understand the operations. Each second, she can either move the cursor left or right (but within the current open tabs' boundaries) or close all tabs to the left or right of the current position. The goal is to minimize the time.\n\nSo, the initial state is that all tabs are open. But after closing some tabs, the a and b (the min and max indices of open tabs) change. But since we need to end up with only [l, r], maybe we can think about the steps required to reach that state.\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios. For example, if the current position is already within [l, r], and the entire [l, r] is already open, then maybe no steps are needed. But that's only if l <= pos <= r and the initial tabs are already in that range. Wait, but the initial state has all tabs open. So if l and r are the entire range, then nothing to do. But the third example shows that when l=1 and r=5 and n=5, the answer is 0.\n\nBut the problem is when there are tabs outside [l, r] that need to be closed. So, the plan is to close all tabs left of l and right of r.\n\nBut how to do that optimally? Let's think about the steps needed.\n\nLet me consider the case where Luba needs to close tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. So, for example, if l is 2 and r is 4, and the current position is 3, then maybe she can close all tabs to the left (from 1 to 1) by moving to position 2 and closing left. Then move to position 4 and close right. But how many steps?\n\nWait, but each closing operation takes one second, and moving takes one second per step. So, the movement steps plus the closing steps.\n\nBut the problem is to find the minimal steps. Let's think of the steps required for each possible scenario.\n\nFirst, determine which tabs need to be closed. Tabs to the left of l (i.e., < l) and tabs to the right of r (i.e., > r). So, Luba needs to close those.\n\nNow, to close the left part, she must be at some position in the current open tabs. But initially, all tabs are open. So, for example, to close all tabs to the left of l, she needs to be at position l, and then close to the left. But perhaps she can also be at any position in the current open tabs, but that depends on the steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal way is to first close all tabs to the left of l, then close all tabs to the right of r. Or vice versa. Or maybe do them in a way that minimizes steps.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the two possible cases: closing left first or closing right first.\n\nLet's take the first example from the input:\n\nInput is 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. So the desired tabs are 2,3,4. So tabs 1,5,6 need to be closed.\n\nThe optimal steps according to the example are:\n\nMove to 2 (from 3), which takes 1 second. Close left (tabs 1) — 1 second. Then move to 3 (already there?), then to 4 (another second). Then close right (tabs 5,6) — 1 second. So total steps: 1 (move) + 1 (close left) + 1 (move to 4) + 1 (close right) = 4? But the example says output is 5. Wait, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait the example's explanation says: move to tab 2 (1 sec), close left (1 sec). Then move to tab 3 (1 sec?), then to 4 (another sec?), then close right (1 sec). So that's 1+1 + 1+1 + 1 = 5 steps. Oh right, because moving from 2 to 3 is one step, then 3 to 4 another step. So that's two steps. So total steps: 1 (move to 2) + 1 (close left) + 2 (moves to 4) + 1 (close right) = 5 steps. That's correct.\n\nSo, the idea is that to close the left and right parts, you have to move to the correct positions and perform the closing operations. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified range [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos`. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right and closing all tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Determine which tabs need to be closed. These are tabs with indices less than `l` (left side) and greater than `r` (right side).\n2. **Determine Movement and Closing Steps**:\n   - If there are tabs to the left of `l`, Luba must move to the leftmost tab in the desired range (i.e., `l`) and close all tabs to its left.\n   - Similarly, if there are tabs to the right of `r`, Luba must move to the rightmost tab in the desired range (i.e., `r`) and close all tabs to its right.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Moves**:\n   - Calculate the time required to move from the initial position `pos` to the positions where closing operations can be performed.\n   - Each movement step takes 1 second, and each closing operation also takes 1 second.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    pos = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    r = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n\n    # If the current tabs are already the desired range, do nothing\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n        print(0)\n        return\n\n    # Determine whether we need to close left and/or right\n    close_left = l > 1\n    close_right = r < n\n\n    total_time = 0\n\n    # Handle closing left\n    if close_left:\n        # Need to move to l, then close left\n        move_steps = abs(pos - l)\n        total_time += move_steps + 1  # move steps + 1 sec to close\n        pos = l  # After closing, the new a is l, so the cursor is at l\n\n    # Handle closing right\n    if close_right:\n        # Need to move to r, then close right\n        move_steps = abs(pos - r)\n        total_time += move_steps + 1  # move steps + 1 sec to close\n\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`.\n- **Immediate Check**: If the desired range [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., `l == 1` and `r == n`), no operations are needed.\n- **Closing Left Tabs**: If there are tabs to the left of `l`, calculate the steps needed to move from the current position to `l` and close the left tabs.\n- **Closing Right Tabs**: Similarly, if there are tabs to the right of `r`, calculate the steps needed to move from the current position (after closing left tabs) to `r` and close the right tabs.\n- **Total Time Calculation**: Sum the movement steps and closing operations for both left and right sides to get the total time required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal steps required by focusing on moving directly to the necessary positions for closing operations, minimizing unnecessary movements.",
