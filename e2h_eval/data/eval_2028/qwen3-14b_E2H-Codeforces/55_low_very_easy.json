Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0 and 2 directly. Hmm.\n\nSo the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). So what does that mean for the order of characters?\n\nLet me think about the possible rearrangements. Since 0 can be swapped with 1, and 1 can be swapped with 2, but 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. However, maybe through some steps? Like, if I have a 0 and a 2 separated by some 1s, can I move them past each other?\n\nWait, suppose I have 0 1 2. Then I can swap the 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then swap the 0 and 2? No, because they are not adjacent. Wait, but 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. So maybe the 0 can't pass through the 2. Wait, but maybe the 1 can be moved around?\n\nWait, let's think about this. If I have a sequence like 0 2, I can't swap them. But if there's a 1 in between, maybe I can move them. For example, 0 1 2. Let's see: swap 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then swap 0 and 2? No, because they are not adjacent. So no. Alternatively, maybe swap the 1 and 2 first. So original is 0 1 2. Swap 1 and 2 to get 0 2 1. Then swap 0 and 2? Again, no. So seems like 0 and 2 can't be swapped even with 1s in between. Because you can't get them adjacent.\n\nTherefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because you can't swap them directly, and you can't get them adjacent via 1s. Wait, but what if there's a 1 between them? Let me think of a longer example. Suppose I have 0 1 1 2. Can I move the 0 past the 2? Let's see. The 0 can move right through the 1s. So 0 can be moved to the right of the 1s. But the 2 can be moved left through the 1s. So maybe the 0 and 2 can be swapped via moving the 1s around?\n\nWait, for example: 0 1 1 2. Let's try to move the 0 to the end. Let's do:\n\nOriginal: 0 1 1 2. Swap 0 and 1: 1 0 1 2. Then swap 0 and 1 again: 1 1 0 2. Then swap 0 and 2? No. So the 0 can't get past the 2. Because the 2 can't be moved to the left of the 0 unless there's a 1 next to it. So in this case, the 0 can't get to the right of the 2. So the relative positions of 0 and 2 can't be changed. So the order of 0s and 2s in the original string must be preserved. Because you can't swap them. So the 0s and 2s can't cross each other. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: arrange the 0s and 1s as much as possible, and arrange the 1s and 2s as much as possible, but the 0s and 2s can't cross each other. \n\nSo how can we model this? Let me think. The key idea is that 0s can be moved past 1s, and 2s can be moved past 1s. But 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. Therefore, the relative order of 0s and 2s in the original string must remain the same. \n\nSo the approach would be: process the string, and for each group of characters, arrange the 0s and 1s as much as possible, and the 1s and 2s as much as possible, but ensuring that the 0s and 2s are in their original order.\n\nWait, but how to do that? Let me think of the following: the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So, for example, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, the 0 must come before the 2. Similarly, if the original string has",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing specific adjacent swaps on a ternary string (composed of '0', '1', and '2'). The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. However, '0' and '2' cannot be directly swapped. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Constraints**: \n   - '0' and '1' can be swapped freely.\n   - '1' and '2' can be swapped freely.\n   - '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly or indirectly through other characters.\n\n2. **Key Insight**: \n   - The relative order of '0's and '2's in the original string must remain unchanged because they cannot be swapped directly or indirectly. This means that any '0' that appears before a '2' in the original string must still appear before it in the final string.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - Traverse the string while maintaining the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n   - For each segment between '0's and '2's, rearrange the '1's to be as far left as possible to minimize the lexicographical order.\n   - Similarly, for segments between '2's and '0's, rearrange '1's to be as far right as possible.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    result = []\n    # We need to keep track of the positions of 0s and 2s\n    # and arrange 1s between them appropriately\n    # Split the string into parts separated by 0s and 2s\n    # Then process each part to arrange 1s optimally\n\n    # First, collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order\n    zeros_and_twos = []\n    parts = []\n    current_part = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c in ('0', '2'):\n            zeros_and_twos.append(c)\n            if current_part:\n                parts.append(current_part)\n                current_part = []\n        else:\n            current_part.append(c)\n    if current_part:\n        parts.append(current_part)\n\n    # Now, build the result\n    # Start with the first part\n    if parts:\n        # For the first part, we can sort the 1s to be as left as possible\n        # But since there is no 0 before, we can arrange them in ascending order\n        result.extend(sorted(parts[0]))\n    for i in range(len(zeros_and_twos)):\n        result.append(zeros_and_twos[i])\n        if i + 1 < len(parts):\n            # For the next part, between 0 and 2 or 2 and 0, we need to arrange 1s\n            # If the previous character is 0, then the next part's 1s should be as left as possible\n            # If the previous character is 2, then the next part's 1s should be as right as possible\n            prev_char = zeros_and_twos[i]\n            part = parts[i+1]\n            if prev_char == '0':\n                # Arrange 1s to be as left as possible\n                result.extend(sorted(part))\n            else:  # prev_char == '2'\n                # Arrange 1s to be as right as possible\n                result.extend(sorted(part, reverse=True))\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input and output the results\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    inputs = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in inputs:\n        print(min_ternary_string(line))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Splitting the String**: The string is split into segments separated by '0's and '2's. These segments contain only '1's and can be rearranged.\n- **Rearranging Segments**: \n  - Segments following a '0' are sorted in ascending order to place '1's as left as possible.\n  - Segments following a '2' are sorted in descending order to place '1's as right as possible.\n- **Maintaining Order**: The relative positions of '0's and '2's are preserved, ensuring that the lexicographical order is minimized while respecting the constraints of allowed swaps.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the string in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 characters.",
