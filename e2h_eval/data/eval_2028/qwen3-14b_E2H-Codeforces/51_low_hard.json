Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters from the first two lines (guest and host), they should exactly match the letters in the third line (the pile). If there are any extra letters in the pile or missing letters, the answer is NO.\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the combined letters of the first two strings are exactly equal to the third string in terms of character counts. That is, the count of each character in the concatenation of the guest and host names must match exactly with the count in the pile.\n\nHow to do this in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to take the first two strings, concatenate them, then create a frequency dictionary for each character. Then, do the same for the third string. Then compare the two dictionaries. If they are the same, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think. For example, for the first sample input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS, Host: DEDMOROZ. Combined, their letters should be SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Then the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me check if the counts match.\n\nAnother example: in the second input, guest is PAPAINOEL, host is JOULUPUKKI. The combined letters would be PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's see: the guest and host combined have two P's? Let me count.\n\nWait, guest is PAPAINOEL: letters are P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L. So two P's. Host is JOULUPUKKI: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I. So one P. So total P's in combined is 3. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the letters here. Let's see, the pile has 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'. Let me count the P's. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the pile: J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. But according to the note, there's a missing P and an extra L. So the combined counts of guest and host would have 3 P's, but the pile has 2? Or maybe the other way around. Anyway, the code needs to check that the combined count of guest and host equals exactly the pile's count.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read three lines of input.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Check if the concatenated string's character counts match exactly with the third line's character counts.\n4. If yes, output YES; else, NO.\n\nHow to implement this in Python?\n\nWe can use the collections.Counter class. However, since Counter is a subclass of dict, we can compare the two Counters directly.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, because Counter objects compare equality based on the counts of each element. So, if the counts are the same, the Counters are equal.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Combine the first two strings into s = guest + host.\n- Create Counter(s) and Counter(pile).\n- Compare these two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the lengths are different? For example, if the combined length of guest and host is not equal to the pile's length. Then, even without checking the counts, we can immediately return NO. Because if the total number of letters is different, it's impossible.\n\nSo adding that check first could save some time, but even if we don't, the Counter comparison would catch that. Because if the total counts are different, the Counters would not be equal.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps checking the length first is better. However, given that the maximum length is 100 + 100 + 100 = 300, it's negligible. So perhaps proceed with the Counter approach.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead three lines: guest, host, pile.\n\nThen, combined = guest + host.\n\nIf Counter(combined) == Counter(pile), then output YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the Counter is from collections. So need to import that.\n\nBut how to handle the input?\n\nThe input is three lines. So, for example, in the first example input, the first line is 'SANTACLAUS', second 'DEDMOROZ', third",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the front door can be rearranged to form the combined names of the guest and the host. This involves checking if the character counts in the pile exactly match the combined character counts of the guest and host names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Character Counting**: Use Python's `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each character in the combined string of the guest and host names, and also in the pile of letters.\n3. **Comparison**: Compare the character counts from the combined names with those from the pile. If they match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the three lines from input\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Combine guest and host names\n    combined = guest + host\n    \n    # Create counters for combined and pile\n    counter_combined = Counter(combined)\n    counter_pile = Counter(pile)\n    \n    # Compare the counters\n    if counter_combined == counter_pile:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `sys.stdin.readline()` to ensure compatibility with standard input methods.\n- **Combining Strings**: The guest and host names are concatenated into a single string to aggregate their characters.\n- **Character Counting**: Using `Counter` from the `collections` module allows efficient counting of character occurrences in both the combined string and the pile.\n- **Comparison**: By comparing the two `Counter` objects, we check if the character counts match exactly. If they do, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of the guest and host, resulting in \"YES\". Otherwise, it results in \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for exact character matches using Python's built-in functionalities, making the solution both concise and effective.",
