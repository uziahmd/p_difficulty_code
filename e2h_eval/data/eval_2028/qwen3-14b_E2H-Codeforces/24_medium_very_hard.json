She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The browser has n tabs. The cursor is at position pos. She needs to close all tabs not in [l, r]. Each second, she can move left or right (but within the current active tabs' range) or close tabs to the left or right of the current position.\n\nThe key here is to figure out the optimal sequence of moves and closes to minimize time.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. The target is to have only the tabs from l to r open. So, any tabs outside this range must be closed. But how?\n\nFirst, we need to determine which tabs are to be closed. For example, if l is 2 and r is 4, then tabs 1 and 5,6 (if n is 6) need to be closed.\n\nBut closing tabs can be done by moving the cursor to a certain position and then closing left or right. However, each close operation can eliminate a bunch of tabs. But the order in which you close them affects the movement steps needed.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases. Let's consider the positions of l and r relative to the initial position pos.\n\nWait, but the problem is that when you close tabs, the a and b (the current min and max indices of open tabs) change. So, for example, if you close tabs to the left of the cursor, then the new a becomes the current position's index (since the left side is now closed). Or maybe not? Wait, the a and b are the min and max of the unclosed tabs. So, when you close tabs to the left of the current position, the new a is the current position's index (since those tabs are closed, and the remaining tabs start from current position onwards). Similarly for closing to the right.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to first close all tabs to the left of l, and then close all tabs to the right of r. But how to do that efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: Close the left part first, then the right part.\n\nCase 2: Close the right part first, then the left part.\n\nWe need to calculate the time for both options and choose the minimum.\n\nBut how to compute the time for each case?\n\nLet me think. Let's take the first example:\n\nInput is 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The target is to have tabs 2-4 open. So tabs 1,5,6 need to be closed.\n\nIn the example explanation, the steps were:\n\nMove to 2 (from 3), close left (which closes tab 1). Then move to 3, then 4, then close right (closing 5 and 6). That took 1 move (to 2) + 1 close (left) + 2 moves (to 3, then 4) + 1 close (right) = total 5 seconds.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nSo, for closing the left part first:\n\nWe need to move the cursor to the position l (so that closing left would close all tabs before l). Wait, no. Because when you close all tabs to the left of the current position, that would close all tabs from a to current position -1. So, if the current position is l, then closing left would close tabs from a to l-1. But if a is initially 1, then closing left would close all tabs up to l-1. So, if l is 2, then moving to 2 and closing left would close tab 1. Then, after that, the a becomes 2, and the current position is 2.\n\nThen, for closing the right part, we need to move to r (position 4), and close right. Which would close all tabs from 5 to 6. But how much movement is needed?\n\nSo, in this case, the movement steps for the first part (closing left) would be moving from pos to l (3 to 2: one step). Then close left (1 sec). Then, moving from l (2) to r (4): two steps. Then close right (1 sec). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5. Which matches the example.\n\nBut what if the initial pos is already in the correct position?\n\nAnother example: input 6 3 1 3. The output is 1. Because she can just close all tabs to the right (since pos is 3, and the target is l=1, r=3. So closing right would close tabs 4-6. So that's one operation.\n\nSo, the idea is that depending on where the current position is, and the positions of l and r, we need to find the minimal steps.\n\nSo, the general approach could be:\n\nFirst, determine whether the current pos is already within [l, r]. If not, then we need to move to a position where we can close the tabs outside. Also, depending on whether l is greater than the initial a (which is 1) or not, and similarly for r.\n\nBut perhaps the problem can be broken down into considering the required actions to close the left and right parts.\n\nLet me think about the left and right parts. The left part is all tabs less than l. The right part is all tabs greater than r.\n\nSo, to close the left part, we need to have the cursor at l (so that closing left will remove all tabs before l). Similarly, to close the right part, we need to have the cursor at r (so that closing right will remove all tabs after r).\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. For example, if the cursor is already at l, then closing left would remove all tabs before l. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo, the steps required would be:\n\n- Move to l (if necessary) and close left.\n\n- Move to r (if necessary) and close right.\n\nBut the order of these two steps may affect the movement steps needed.\n\nFor example, if the cursor is at pos, and l is to the left of pos, and r is to the right of pos. Then, moving to l, closing left, then moving to r (which is now in the same range as l, since after closing left, the a is l, and the current position is l. So moving from l to r would take (r - l) steps. Then closing right. So total steps would be (steps to move to l) + 1 (close left) + (steps from l to r) + 1 (close right).\n\nAlternatively, if we first move to r and close right, then move to l and close left. How does that compare?\n\nLet me think with an example. Suppose pos is 3, l is 2, r is 4. So moving to l (2) takes 1 step. Then moving from 2 to 4 is 2 steps. Total steps for moving: 1+2 = 3. Then two closes: 2 steps. Total 5 steps. Which matches the example.\n\nIf we first close the right part. To do that, we need to move to r (4). From pos 3, that's one step. Close right (tabs 5-6). Now, the current position is 4, and the a is 1, b is 4. Then, to close the left part (tabs 1), we need to move to l (2). But the current position is 4. So moving from 4 to 2: 2 steps. Then close left. That would take 2 steps. So total steps: 1 (move to r) + 1 (close right) + 2 (move to l) + 1 (close left) = 5 steps. Same as before.\n\nSo the order doesn't matter here. But in some cases, it might. For example, if l is to the left of pos, and r is to the left of pos. Then, perhaps the order of closing left and right matters. Wait, but if r is to the left of pos, then l is also to the left of pos. So the target is [l, r], which is a segment to the left of pos. So, perhaps in this case, we need to close tabs to the right of r, but since r is already in the target, maybe not. Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nSuppose n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=2. So the target is tabs 1 and 2. So we need to close tabs 3,4,5. How?\n\nTo close those, we can move to r (2) and close right (which would close tabs 3-5). So steps: moving from 3 to 2 (1 step), then close right (1 sec). Total 2 steps.\n\nAlternatively, if we first close left, but that's not needed here. Because the left part is l=1, so no tabs to the left of l. So the only thing to close is the right part.\n\nBut in this case, the order isn't an issue. So perhaps the optimal steps are to handle the left and right parts in either order, but the movement steps depend on the positions.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCalculate the steps required for both possible orders (close left first, then right; or close right first, then left), and take the minimum between them.\n\nBut how to calculate each scenario?\n\nLet me formalize:\n\nScenario 1: Close left part first, then close right part.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Move from current pos to l (if needed). The time taken is |pos - l| steps.\n\n- Then, close left (takes 1 second).\n\n- Now, the current position is l (since after moving there). Now, we need to move from l to r. Time taken is |r - l| steps.\n\n- Then, close right (1 second).\n\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + 1 + |r - l| + 1 = |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nScenario 2: Close right part first, then close left part.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Move from current pos to r. Time: |pos - r| steps.\n\n- Close right (1 second).\n\n- Now, current position is r. Need to move to l. Time: |r - l| steps.\n\n- Close left (1 second).\n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nSo the minimal between the two scenarios is min( (|pos - l| + |r - l| + 2), (|pos - r| + |r - l| + 2) ) ?\n\nWait, but what if l is equal to r? Then, |r - l| is zero. So, for example, when l = r, then after closing left or right, nothing else is needed. So, perhaps the formula is not correct in all cases.\n\nWait, but in the case where l = r, then the target is a single tab. So, the steps required would be to close left and right. But perhaps that's not necessary. For example, if the current pos is already at l (which is equal to r), then no steps are needed. Because all other tabs are already closed? No, wait. The initial state is all tabs open. So, the problem is to close all tabs outside [l, r]. So, if l = r, then we need to close all tabs except that one. But how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose n=5, l=3, r=3. So, the target is to have only tab 3 open. So, we need to close tabs 1,2,4,5.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nWell, perhaps the optimal way is to move to tab 3, then close left (which closes tabs 1 and 2) and close right (which closes 4 and 5). But each close operation can be done once. So, if you are at position 3, you can close left (closing all tabs to the left) and then close right (closing all tabs to the right). That would take 2 seconds. But moving to position 3 may take steps.\n\nBut according to the previous formula, if l = r, then |r - l| is zero. So scenario 1 would be |pos - l| + 0 + 2. Scenario 2 would be |pos - r| + 0 + 2. Which is same as 2* (|pos - l| + 1) ?\n\nWait, no. For example, if pos is already at l (which is same as r), then scenario 1 would be |pos - l| = 0, then + 0 + 2 → 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 seconds. Which is correct. Because you need to perform two operations: close left and close right.\n\nBut in reality, when you are at the position l (which is r), closing left would close all tabs to the left (i.e., 1-2), and closing right would close all tabs to the right (i.e., 4-5). So yes, that's two operations. So the formula seems to account for that.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range? For example, in the third sample input: 5 2 1 5. The output is 0. Because the current tabs are already [1,5], so no need to close anything. So, the code must check if the current l and r are already covering all tabs. Wait, no. The problem says that the initial state is all tabs open. So, the target is to have tabs [l, r] open. So, if l=1 and r=n, then no action is needed. So, in this case, the answer is 0.\n\nSo, the first thing the code should check is whether l=1 and r=n. If so, then output 0.\n\nBut that's a special case. However, the code must also check whether the current [l, r] is already the entire set of tabs. So, in general, if l == 1 and r == n, then output 0.\n\nBut how to handle that in the general formula. Let's see.\n\nBut in the formula above, for example, when l=1 and r=n, then the left part (tabs < l) is none. The right part (tabs > r) is none. So, no need to close anything. So, the steps would be zero. But according to the formula, scenario 1 would be |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2 = |pos - 1| + (n-1) + 2. Which would be wrong. So, the formula is not applicable in this case.\n\nAh, right! So the formula assumes that there are tabs to close on the left and right. But if l=1 and r=n, then there are no tabs to close. So, the steps required is zero. So, the code must first check if the current l and r are already covering all the tabs. If so, then output 0.\n\nSimilarly, if l=1 and r is less than n. Then, the right part (tabs > r) must be closed. But the left part (tabs < l) is none. So, in this case, the scenario 1 would be to close left (but there's nothing to close) and then close right. But that's not correct. So, the formula needs to be adjusted.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is incomplete. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem requires closing all tabs outside [l, r]. So, the left part is tabs < l, and the right part is tabs > r.\n\nSo, if there are no left tabs (l=1), then we don't need to close the left part. Similarly, if there are no right tabs (r = n), then we don't need to close the right part.\n\nSo, the steps required depends on whether we need to close the left and/or right parts.\n\nSo, the code should first check whether l > 1 (need to close left) and/or r < n (need to close right). Then, based on that, calculate the steps.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nCase 1: Need to close left and right parts.\n\nThen, the formula is as discussed earlier, choosing between the two scenarios.\n\nCase 2: Need to close only left part (r = n). Then, steps are |pos - l| + 1 (move to l and close left).\n\nCase 3: Need to close only right part (l = 1). Then steps are |pos - r| + 1 (move to r and close right).\n\nCase 4: No need to close anything (l=1 and r=n). Steps is 0.\n\nSo, how to handle these cases in code?\n\nFirst, check if l == 1 and r == n. Then output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if l > 1 and r < n. Then, need to close both left and right. So compute the two scenarios and take the minimum.\n\nElse, if l > 1 (need to close left) and r == n. Then, steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nElse, if r < n (need to close right) and l == 1. Then steps is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut wait, what about if l is 1 and r is less than n. Then, need to close right. So, the steps is moving to r and closing right. But what if the current position is already at r? Then steps is 1 (only the close operation).\n\nSo, the code needs to check whether l and r are in the correct positions.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nLet me outline the steps for the code:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    need_left = (l > 1)\n\n    need_right = (r < n)\n\n    if need_left and need_right:\n\n        # compute both options\n\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + abs(r - l) + 2\n\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + abs(r - l) + 2\n\n        result = min(option1, option2)\n\n    elif need_left:\n\n        # only need to close left\n\n        result = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif need_right:\n\n        # only need to close right\n\n        result = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # impossible? because l and r are not 1 and n, but need_left and need_right are both false? That would imply l=1 and r=n. Which is handled in the first condition.\n\n        # So this case is not possible.\n\n    print(result)\n\nWait, but let's test this with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. So need_left (2>1) and need_right (4<6). So compute option1 and option2.\n\noption1: |3-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 → correct.\n\noption2: |3-4| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. So min is 5. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. So need_left is false (l=1), need_right is true (3 <6). So result is |3-3| +1 → 0 +1 = 1. Correct.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n5 2 1 5 → l=1 and r=5 (n=5). So first condition is true. Output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=2. So need_right is true (r=2 <5). So steps: |3-2| +1 → 1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=3, r=5. So need_left is true (l=3>1), need_right is false (r=5 =n). So steps: |3-3| +1 = 0 +1=1. Which is correct (close left, which closes tabs 1 and 2).\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=3, n=5. So need_right is true. So steps are |pos - r| +1. Suppose pos is 3: |3-3| +1 =1. Which is correct (close right).\n\nBut what if the current pos is already in the correct place?\n\nFor example, n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5. Then, since l=1 and r=5, output is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=3. So need_right is true (r=3 <5). So steps are |2-3| +1 = 1+1=2. Which is correct: move to 3 (1 step), close right (1 sec). Total 2.\n\nBut what if the user is already at r?\n\nLike, n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=3. So need_right is true (r=3 <5). So steps are |3-3| +1 = 1. Which is correct: close right.\n\nBut in that case, the code would output 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, when you are at r (3), closing right would close all tabs to the right of 3 (i.e., 4 and 5). So that's correct. So the code works.\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=4, n=6, pos=4. So need_left (yes) and need_right (yes). So compute option1 and option2.\n\noption1: |4-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.\n\noption2: |4-4| + (4-2) +2 → 0 + 2 + 2 = 4. So min is 4.\n\nWhich would be: move to r (4) (0 steps), close right (1 sec). Then move from 4 to l (2) (steps 2) and close left (1 sec). Total steps 0+1 + 2 +1 = 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut wait, what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range?\n\nFor example, n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The code computes option1 and option2 as 5 and 5. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at l?\n\nLike, n=6, pos=2, l=2, r=4. So need to close left (no, l=2>1, so need to close left? Wait, need_left is (l>1). Yes, 2>1. So need to close left (tabs <2, which is tab 1). So steps: |pos - l| is 0, plus 1. Then, need to close right. So the code would compute the option1 and option2.\n\nWait, in this case, the code is in the need_left and need_right scenario. So:\n\noption1: |2-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 0 + 2 + 2 = 4 steps.\n\noption2: |2-4| + (4-2) + 2 → 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 steps. So min is 4.\n\nWhich would be: move to l (2) (already there), close left (1 sec). Then move to r (4) (2 steps), close right (1 sec). Total 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 steps. Correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut wait, what about when the current position is already in the [l, r] range and we need to close both left and right. For example, pos is in the middle of l and r.\n\nBut the code handles that.\n\nNow, what about when l is 1 and r is less than n. For example, l=1, r=3, n=5. So need_right is true (r=3 <5). So steps are |pos - r| +1. So if pos is 3, steps is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: l=1 and r=3, n=5, pos is 1. Steps is |1-3| +1 = 2+1=3. Which is moving from 1 to 3 (two steps) and closing right (1 sec). Total 3. Correct.\n\nSo, this formula seems to work.\n\nBut what about when the current pos is already to the left of l?\n\nFor example, n=6, pos=1, l=2, r=4. So need to close left (tabs <2, which is tab 1) and right (tabs >4). So steps:\n\noption1: |1-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 steps.\n\noption2: |1-4| + (4-2) + 2 → 3 + 2 + 2 =7. So min is 5.\n\nWhich would be: move to l (2) (1 step), close left (1 sec). Then move to r (4) (2 steps), close right (1 sec). Total 5 steps.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: l = r = 1, n=1. Then, output is 0. Because l and r are 1 and n=1. So the code returns 0.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=2. Then, output is 0.\n\nEdge case 3: n=2, pos=1, l=1, r=1. Then, need to close right (tabs >1). So steps is |1-1| +1 = 1. Which is correct: move to r=1 (already there) and close right (which closes tab 2).\n\nAnother edge case: l=1, r=2, n=3. pos=3. So need to close right (r=2 <3). So steps is |3-2| +1 = 1+1=2. Which is correct: move from 3 to 2 (1 step), close right (1 sec). So total 2 steps.\n\nAnother case: l=3, r=3, n=5. pos=1. So need to close left (tabs <3) and right (tabs >3). So, scenario:\n\noption1: |1-3| + (3-3) + 2 → 2 + 0 + 2 =4.\n\noption2: |1-3| + (3-3) + 2 → same. So min is 4.\n\nWhich steps: move to 3 (2 steps), close left (1 sec). Then move to 3 (no steps), close right (1 sec). Total 2+1+0+1=4 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    need_left = l > 1\n\n    need_right = r < n\n\n    if need_left and need_right:\n\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n\n    elif need_left:\n\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n\n    elif need_right:\n\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        print(0)\n\nWait, but why is (r - l) used in the option1 and option2? Because |r - l| is r - l since r >= l.\n\nYes, since l <= r.\n\nSo, the code can be written as such.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. need_left and need_right. option1 is |3-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. option2 is |3-4| + 2 + 2 → 1+2+2=5. min is 5. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. need_right is true (3 <6). So steps is |3-3| +1 → 0 +1=1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 2 1 5 → l=1, r=5, which equals n=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=5. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=3. So need_left (2>1) and need_right (3 <5). So option1: |3-2| + (3-2) +2 → 1 + 1 +2=4. option2: |3-3| + (3-2) +2 → 0 +1 +2=3. So min is 3. Which would be: move to r (3) (0 steps), close right (tabs 4-5). Then move from 3 to l (2) (1 step), close left (tabs 1). So steps: 0+1 (close right) + 1 (move) + 1 (close left) → total 3 steps. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about when l is 1 and r is less than n, but pos is already at r?\n\nFor example, n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=3. Then, need_right is true. So steps is |3-3| +1 → 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: pos is to the right of r. Like, n=5, pos=4, l=1, r=3. So steps is |4-3| +1 = 1+1=2. Which is correct: move to 3 (1 step), close right (1 sec). Total 2 steps.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nRead the input: the input is four integers. But the input is given as a list of test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is a single line with four integers. But the sample input shows something different. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input is:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is the only line of input. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines. But perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects one line per test case. However, the user's instruction says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. But perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each line is a separate test case. But the code needs to process one test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nSo, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single line. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\nSo the input is one line with four integers. But the sample input shows three lines. Which suggests that perhaps the user provided multiple test cases for the example. But in the actual programming problem, the code is expected to read one line of input and output one line of output.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user shows three test cases. However, the code should read one line of input. So, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each line is a test case. But the code should read one line.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So, the code should read one line of input, split into four integers, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input seems to be multiple test cases. However, the problem's note says that the sample input is given as a list of inputs, but the actual code should process one input per run.\n\nTherefore, the code should read one line of input, split into four integers, and output the answer.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into n, pos, l, r.\n\nBut the sample input seems to have multiple lines. However, in the problem statement, the sample input is written as a list of test cases. But for the actual code, the input is one line. So, the code should read one line.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input formatting. But regardless, the code should process one line of input.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead the input as a single line, split into four integers.\n\nThen compute as per the logic above.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    need_left = l > 1\n\n    need_right = r < n\n\n    if need_left and need_right:\n\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n\n    elif need_left:\n\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n\n    elif need_right:\n\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        print(0)\n\nBut wait, what if l=1 and r <n? Then need_left is false, need_right is true. So code prints abs(pos - r) +1.\n\nBut what if l=1 and r is less than n, but the current pos is already at r? Then steps is 0 +1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=3. So need_right is true. steps is |5-3| +1 = 2 +1 =3. Which would be: move from 5 to 3 (two steps), close right (1 sec). Total 3 steps. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when l=1, r=3, and pos is 4. Then steps is |4-3| +1 = 1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: 6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. need_left and need_right. option1 is 1 + 2 + 2 =5. option2 is 1 + 2 + 2=5. min is 5. Correct.\n\nSample input 2: 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. need_right is true. steps is |3-3| +1 = 1. Correct.\n\nSample input 3: 5 2 1 5 → l=1 and r=5 (n=5). So output 0. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works for the samples.\n\nBut what about when l is 1 and r is 2, and n is 3, and pos is 3. Then need_right is true. steps is |3-2| +1 = 1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: l=2, r=3, n=4. pos=1. So need_left (2>1) and need_right (3<4). option1 is |1-2| + (3-2) + 2 → 1 +1 +2=4. option2 is |1-3| + (3-2) +2 → 2+1+2=5. min is 4. Which would be move to 2 (1 step), close left (tabs 1). Then move to 3 (1 step), close right (tabs 4). Total steps 1+1+1+1=4. Correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle this.\n\nNow, what about when the current position is already in the correct spot for both left and right?\n\nFor example, l=2, r=4, n=6, pos=2. Then need_left and need_right. option1 is |2-2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified range [l, r] while starting from a given cursor position. The solution involves efficiently moving the cursor and closing tabs either to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the range [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no action is needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Determine Needs**: Check if there are tabs to close on the left (l > 1) and/or on the right (r < n).\n3. **Calculate Minimum Steps**:\n   - **Both Left and Right Tabs to Close**: Calculate the steps required for two scenarios: closing left first then right, and closing right first then left. Choose the minimum of these two.\n   - **Only Left Tabs to Close**: Move the cursor to l and close all tabs to the left.\n   - **Only Right Tabs to Close**: Move the cursor to r and close all tabs to the right.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    need_left = l > 1\n    need_right = r < n\n    if need_left and need_right:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n    elif need_left:\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    elif need_right:\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n    else:\n        print(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the range [l, r] is already the entire set of tabs, no actions are needed.\n- **Need Left and Right**: When both sides need closing, we compute the steps for moving to either end of the target range and closing from there, considering both possible orders (left first or right first).\n- **Single Side Closing**: If only one side needs closing, the cursor is moved directly to the relevant end of the target range and the close operation is performed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we minimize the number of movements and operations required, leveraging the constraints and properties of the problem efficiently.",
