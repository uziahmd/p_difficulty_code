For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, let me understand the definitions again. \n\nA major triad has X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3. So total X to Z is 7. But since the notes are cyclic, I need to calculate the distances properly.\n\nSimilarly, a minor triad has X to Y as 3 semitones and Y to Z as 4. \n\nBut since the triad is unordered, I need to check all permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies either condition.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Convert each note to its position in the 12-note scale. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H (which is B in some notations, but according to the problem statement, the list is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait. Wait the problem says the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, but in the list given, after B comes H? Or maybe there's a typo here. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh, so H is the 12th note. But then the order is cyclic. So the order is:\n\nLet me list them with indexes:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H\n\nThen, after H comes C again. So the distance between two notes is calculated as (target - start) mod 12, but since the distance is measured from lower to upper, perhaps the way to compute it is that for two notes, if you arrange them in order, the distance is (y - x) if y > x, else (y + 12 - x). Wait, but the problem says that the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones from X to Y along the scale. For example, between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's check:\n\nC is 0, E is 4. So 4-0 = 4. Correct. Between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because if you go from E (4) to C, you can go up by 8 steps (since 4 + 8 = 12, which is H, then next is C again. So 4 to 0 is 8 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but if the result is negative, add 12? Or perhaps it's (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y + 12 - X). So for example, distance from E (4) to C (0) is (0 -4) mod 12? Wait no. Because the distance is measured as the number of semitones from the lower note to the higher. So when you have two notes, you need to find the distance in the direction that goes upwards. So for example, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y + 12 - X). So for example, between E and C, the distance is (0 + 12 -4) = 8.\n\nSo the way to compute the distance between two notes is (y - x) if y >= x, else (y + 12 -x). But since the notes are arranged in a cycle, another way to compute this is (y - x) % 12. Wait, no. Because (y -x) mod 12 gives the difference in the positive direction. For example, if x is 4 (E) and y is 0 (C), then (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (y - x) mod 12. But wait, in the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is taken from the lower to upper. So the distance between X and Y is (y - x) if y > x, else (",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves converting the notes into numerical positions, checking all permutations of the triad, and verifying if they meet the criteria for major or minor chords.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Notes to Numerical Positions**: Each note is mapped to a numerical value based on its position in the 12-note scale.\n2. **Check Permutations**: Since the triad is unordered, we need to check all permutations of the three notes to see if any permutation satisfies the conditions for a major or minor chord.\n3. **Calculate Distances**: For each permutation, calculate the distances between consecutive notes using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Determine Chord Type**: Check if the distances match the criteria for a major or minor chord. If none match, classify the chord as strange.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X to Y is 4 semitones, Y to Z is 3\n    dist_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X to Y is 3 semitones, Y to Z is 4\n    dist_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    indices = [note_to_index(note) for note in notes]\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Conversion**: The `note_to_index` function maps each note to its corresponding position in the 12-note scale.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The functions `is_major` and `is_minor` check if the distances between consecutive notes in a permutation match the criteria for major or minor chords using modular arithmetic.\n3. **Permutations Check**: The `classify_chord` function checks all permutations of the input notes to determine if they form a major, minor, or strange chord.\n4. **Main Function**: Reads input from standard input, processes the notes, and prints the result based on the classification.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the triad are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.",
