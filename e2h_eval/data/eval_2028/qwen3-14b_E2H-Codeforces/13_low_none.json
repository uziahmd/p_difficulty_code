For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, let me understand the note order and distances. The notes are in a cyclic order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it loops back to C. Each consecutive pair is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. But the problem mentions that the distance between two notes is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the higher. For example, C to E is 4 semitones. Wait, let me think: between C and C# is 1 semitone. Then C to D is 2, C to D# is 3, C to E is 4. Yes. So the distance between X and Y is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12, but since the order is cyclic, but when moving upwards. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance is from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones because if you go up from E to C, you have to wrap around. But how is that calculated?\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured along the musical scale. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones between them. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance would be (Y's position + 12 - X's position)? Or maybe the distance is computed as (Y - X) mod 12, but considering that the distance is always positive. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So the distance between X and Y is the number of steps you take moving upward from X to reach Y. For example, between C and E, moving up, there are 4 semitones. Between E and C, moving up, you have to go E->F (1), F->F# (2), F#->G (3), G->G# (4), G#->A (5), A->B (6), B->H (7), H->C (8). So 8 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12, but if the result is negative, add 12? Wait, no. Because if Y is after X, then the distance is Y - X. If Y is before X, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). But since the notes are arranged in a cycle, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y + 12 - X). But how do I compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for any two notes, the distance from X to Y is (y_pos - x_pos) % 12, but that's not correct. Wait, let's take an example. Let's say X is C (position 0), Y is E (position 4). Then the distance is 4. If X is E (4), Y is C (0), then (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12. But wait, how does that work? Because if Y is before X, then (y -x) would be negative. For example, if X is E (4), Y is C (0), then (0-4) = -4. Mod 12 gives 8, which is correct. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is taken from the lowest to the upper. So for example, if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. If Y is lower than X, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is equivalent to (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12. Because if Y is lower than X, then (y - x) is negative, and mod 12 will give the correct value.\n\nSo, for any two notes, the distance from X to Y is (y_pos - x_pos) mod 12. However, in the problem's examples, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Which matches with that calculation. Similarly, E to C would",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they fit the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: Map each note to its corresponding position in the cyclic sequence of musical notes. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between any two notes using their positions. The distance is determined as `(y_pos - x_pos) % 12`, which gives the number of semitones from the lower note to the upper note.\n3. **Check Permutations**: For the given three notes, check all possible permutations to see if any permutation fits the criteria for a major or minor chord:\n   - A **major chord** requires the distances between the first and second note to be 4 semitones and between the second and third note to be 3 semitones.\n   - A **minor chord** requires the distances between the first and second note to be 3 semitones and between the second and third note to be 4 semitones.\n4. **Determine Result**: If any permutation matches the criteria for a major or minor chord, return the corresponding result. If none match, return \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_position(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    return d1 == 4 and d2 == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    return d1 == 3 and d2 == 4\n\ndef classify_chord(notes):\n    positions = [note_to_position(note) for note in notes]\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(positions):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            return \"major\"\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            return \"minor\"\n    return \"strange\"\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input_line.split()\n    result = classify_chord(notes)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Note Mapping**: The `note_to_position` function converts each note to its index in the list of musical notes, facilitating distance calculations.\n- **Distance Calculation**: Using modulo arithmetic ensures that the distance calculation wraps around the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n- **Permutations Check**: By generating all permutations of the three notes, we ensure that all possible orderings are checked against the criteria for major and minor chords.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently checks all permutations (only 6 for three notes) and uses modular arithmetic for quick distance calculations, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
