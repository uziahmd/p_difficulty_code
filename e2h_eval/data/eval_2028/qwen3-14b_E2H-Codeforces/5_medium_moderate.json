Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. The problem is about pairing left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. The colors can be letters or question marks, which act as wildcards. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs and output them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the compatibility rules. Two specific colors (non-?) are compatible if they are the same. A ? can pair with any color, including another ?. So, for example, a left boot with 'a' can pair with a right boot with 'a' or '?'. A left boot with '?' can pair with any right boot, regardless of its color.\n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of pairs. How do I approach this?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the steps needed. Let's consider that each pair uses one left and one right boot. So, the problem is similar to bipartite matching, but with specific compatibility rules. However, since n can be up to 150,000, we can't use standard algorithms like maximum bipartite matching (like Hungarian algorithm) which would be too slow.\n\nSo, we need a greedy approach here. Let's think about how to pair optimally.\n\nLet me break it down into parts. Maybe first pair the specific colors that match, then handle the wildcards.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the following:\n\nFor each color c (from a-z), count the number of left boots with color c, and the number of right boots with color c. Then, the maximum possible pairs for that color is the minimum of the two counts. But since a ? can act as any color, maybe we need to first pair the non-? boots, and then use the ?s to fill in the remaining.\n\nWait, but the ? can be used either as a left or right boot. For example, a left ? can pair with a right 'a', or a right ? can pair with a left 'a'.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Pair all left non-? with right non-? where the colors match. For each color c, take min(left[c], right[c]) pairs. Then subtract those from left and right counts.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which include ?s), pair the ?s with the remaining non-?s. For example, left ? can pair with right non-? (if there are any left), and vice versa.\n\nBut how to track which ones are left and which are used?\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea:\n\nWe can first process the specific color matches. For each color c (not ?), we can pair as many left c with right c as possible. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which include ?s), we can pair the ?s with the remaining non-?s. Also, the ?s can pair with each other.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAnother way: Let's think about the problem in terms of counts.\n\nLet me create two dictionaries:\n\nleft_count: counts of each color (excluding ?) in left boots.\n\nright_count: counts of each color (excluding ?) in right boots.\n\nThen, for each color c, the number of pairs between left c and right c is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). We can sum these up, and subtract those counts from left_count and right_count.\n\nBut wait, after that, we have some left and right boots that are either ? or have colors that couldn't be matched (because the other side didn't have enough).\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots, we can pair the ?s with the non-?s. For example, any left ? can pair with any right non-? (if there are any). Similarly, any right ? can pair with left non-?.\n\nBut how to track which ones are available.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can:\n\n- First, pair all specific color matches. That's straightforward.\n\n- Then, collect all left ? and right ?. The number of pairs between them is min(number of left ?, number of right ?). But also, the remaining non-? boots on left and right can be paired with ?s.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAfter the first step, there may be some left non-? boots (with colors that don't have matching right non-? boots) and same for right. For example, suppose left has 3 'a's, and right has 2 'a's. Then after step 1, left has 1 'a' left. Now, this 'a' can be paired with a right ?.\n\nSimilarly, the right non-? boots that couldn't be paired with left non-? can be paired with left ?s.\n\nSo the second step is to pair the remaining non-? boots with ?s.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nStep 1: Pair as many as possible between left non-? and right non-? with same color.\n\nStep 2: For the remaining left non-? boots, pair them with right ?s.\n\nStep 3: For the remaining right non-? boots, pair them with left ?s.\n\nStep 4: Pair the remaining left ?s and right ?s.\n\nBut how to track which ones are available?\n\nBut how to do this in practice, given that we have to track individual positions (since the output requires indices)?\n\nAh, right. Because we need to output the actual indices of the boots used. So the problem isn't just about counting, but also about selecting which specific boots to pair.\n\nSo the initial approach of counting is helpful for figuring out the maximum possible, but we need to track individual elements.\n\nSo, perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each color c (excluding ?), we can collect the list of indices of left boots with color c, and similarly for right boots. Then, for each color, pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, for color c, take min(len(left[c]), len(right[c])) pairs, and mark those as used.\n\nBut then, after that, the left and right lists for color c will have some leftover elements.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (including ?s), we can process them.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the data structures. Let's create for left and right:\n\n- For left boots, a dictionary mapping color to a list of indices. Similarly for right.\n\nThen, for each color c (non-?), we can process the pairs between left and right of same color. Once that's done, the remaining left and right boots (those that couldn't be paired) can be processed with ?s.\n\nBut how to process the ?s.\n\nFor example, after step 1, there are some left non-? boots (say, color a) that couldn't find a matching right non-? boot. These can be paired with right ?s. Similarly, right non-? boots that couldn't be paired can be paired with left ?s.\n\nAdditionally, the left ?s and right ?s can be paired with each other.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Pair left and right non-? with same color.\n\n2. For the remaining left non-? boots, pair them with right ?s.\n\n3. For the remaining right non-? boots, pair them with left ?s.\n\n4. Pair the remaining left ?s with the remaining right ?s.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps in code.\n\nFirst, for each color (excluding ?), collect left and right indices.\n\nFor example:\n\nleft_colors = defaultdict(list)\nfor i, c in enumerate(l):\n    if c != '?':\n        left_colors[c].append(i+1)  # assuming 1-based indices\n\nSimilarly for right_colors.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_colors and right_colors, we can pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nSo for each color c:\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_colors[c]), len(right_colors[c]))\n\nAdd these pairs to the result.\n\nThen, subtract those from left_colors and right_colors. For example, if left_colors[c] has m elements, and we take k pairs, then we can remove the first k elements from left_colors[c], and same for right_colors[c].\n\nBut wait, perhaps we can take the first elements from both lists and pair them. For example, for each c, we can pair the first k elements of left and right.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining elements in left_colors[c] and right_colors[c] are not paired yet.\n\nThen, after processing all colors, we have some left non-? boots (those in left_colors) and some right non-? boots (those in right_colors). Also, we have left_question and right_question lists, which are the indices of ? in left and right.\n\nNow, for the next step: pair the left non-? with right ?.\n\nSo for each left non-? boot (i.e., in any left_colors[c] where c is not ?), we can pair them with right ?s.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWe can collect all the remaining left non-? boots into a list, say left_remain. Similarly, collect all the remaining right non-? boots into right_remain.\n\nWait, no. After step 1, the left_remain would be all left boots that are not ? and were not paired in step 1. Similarly for right_remain.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nPerhaps, after step 1, for each color c in left_colors, if the list is not empty, those are left boots that couldn't be paired. Similarly for right_colors.\n\nBut then, for the left_remain, we can collect all the left non-? boots that are not yet paired. Same for right_remain.\n\nSo:\n\nleft_remain = []\nfor c in left_colors:\n    left_remain.extend(left_colors[c])\n\nSimilarly for right_remain.\n\nBut wait, after step 1, the left_colors for each c would have the remaining elements. For example, suppose for color 'a', we had 5 left and 3 right. Then after pairing 3, the left_colors['a'] would have 2 elements left.\n\nSo left_remain is the list of all left non-? boots that are not paired yet.\n\nSimilarly for right_remain.\n\nNow, we can pair these left_remain with right_question.\n\nHow? For each element in left_remain, we can pair it with a right ?.\n\nBut how to track which right ?s are available.\n\nWe can collect all right_question as a list. For example, right_question = [indices of right boots with '?'].\n\nThen, for each left_remain element, take the first available right ?.\n\nSimilarly, for each right_remain element, take the first available left ?.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining ?s (both left and right) can be paired with each other.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nCollect left_remain (all left non-? not paired), right_remain (all right non-? not paired).\n\nCollect left_question (list of left ? indices), right_question (list of right ? indices).\n\nNow:\n\nStep 2: Pair left_remain with right_question.\n\nFor each left_boot in left_remain:\n\n   if there are any right_question left, pair them.\n\nSo, take as many as possible, up to min(len(left_remain), len(right_question)).\n\nSimilarly, for step 3: pair right_remain with left_question.\n\nTake as many as possible.\n\nThen, step 4: pair remaining left_question and right_question.\n\nThe total pairs is the sum of all steps.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut how to track which elements have been used. Because once a left boot is paired, it can't be used again. Similarly for right.\n\nSo, perhaps during the steps, we can process the lists, and pop elements as they are used.\n\nBut for large n, using lists and popping from front (like using deque) might be efficient.\n\nBut for the problem, the order in which we pair doesn't matter as long as the maximum is achieved. So, for example, when pairing left_remain with right_question, we can take any left_remain and any right_question.\n\nSo, here's a possible approach:\n\nFor step 1:\n\nProcess each color c (not ?) and pair left and right.\n\nFor example:\n\nFor each color c in left_colors and right_colors:\n\n   take the min of the lengths of left and right lists for c.\n\n   for i in 0 to min-1:\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n   then, remove the first min elements from left_list and right_list.\n\nBut how to do this in code.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c, we can pair as many as possible. So, for each color c:\n\nleft_list = left_colors[c]\n\nright_list = right_colors[c]\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n\n   pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\nthen, the remaining left_list is left_list[num_pairs:], and similarly for right_list.\n\nBut to do this, we need to modify the left_colors and right_colors data structures.\n\nBut perhaps, for code, we can use deque for each list, so that we can pop elements from front.\n\nBut for the initial processing, perhaps using lists and keeping track of the current index.\n\nBut for code simplicity, perhaps we can use lists and track the current index.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to collect all the possible pairs for each color, then for the rest, proceed.\n\nBut how to manage the data structures.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each color c, we can process the left and right lists and pair them. For example:\n\nWe can create a list for left_non_question and right_non_question.\n\nBut maybe the better approach is to collect all the possible pairs for each color, then process the remaining.\n\nNow, moving to code structure.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nCreate left_color_dict, which maps color to list of indices (1-based) for left boots.\n\nSimilarly for right_color_dict.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_dict and right_color_dict:\n\n   if c is not '?', then process the pairs between left and right.\n\n   for example, for c in left_color_dict:\n\n       if c is not '?', and c is in right_color_dict:\n\n           take min(len(left_color_dict[c]), len(right_color_dict[c])) pairs.\n\n           add those pairs to the result list.\n\n           then, remove the first k elements from left_color_dict[c] and right_color_dict[c].\n\nBut how to do this? Well, perhaps for each color c, we can iterate through the possible colors and pair them.\n\nBut perhaps, for code, we can do the following:\n\nInitialize a list of pairs.\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   if c is present in both left_color_dict and right_color_dict:\n\n       num_pairs = min(len(left_color_dict[c]), len(right_color_dict[c]))\n\n       for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n           left_idx = left_color_dict[c].pop(0)\n\n           right_idx = right_color_dict[c].pop(0)\n\n           pairs.append( (left_idx, right_idx) )\n\nBut this way, after processing, the left_color_dict[c] and right_color_dict[c] will have the remaining elements.\n\nBut note that the left_color_dict and right_color_dict may have entries for colors that are not present in the other. For example, if left has color 'a' and right doesn't, then we can't pair them.\n\nOnce this step is done, we have the pairs for same-color non-? boots.\n\nNow, collect all the remaining non-? left boots (those left in left_color_dict for colors other than ?) and the same for right.\n\nThen, collect all the left ? and right ?.\n\nNow, for step 2: pair left_remain (non-? left boots) with right_question (right ?).\n\nFor this, we can take the remaining left_remain and right_question.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nleft_remain = []\nfor c in left_color_dict:\n    if c != '?':\n        left_remain.extend(left_color_dict[c])\n\nSimilarly for right_remain.\n\nBut then, for the left_remain and right_remain, we can process them.\n\nNow, for step 2:\n\nTake the left_remain and pair them with right_question.\n\nSo, for each left in left_remain:\n\n   if there are any right_question left, pair them.\n\nSimilarly, for step 3, take the right_remain and pair with left_question.\n\nSo:\n\nWe can collect:\n\nleft_question = left_color_dict.get('?', [])\n\nright_question = right_color_dict.get('?', [])\n\nThen, for step 2:\n\nWe can take as many as possible pairs between left_remain and right_question.\n\nHow? For example:\n\ni = 0\n\nj = 0\n\nwhile i < len(left_remain) and j < len(right_question):\n\n   pair left_remain[i] with right_question[j]\n\n   i += 1\n\n   j += 1\n\nSimilarly for step 3: pair right_remain with left_question.\n\nThen, for step 4: pair the remaining left_question and right_question.\n\nAgain, take min(len(left_question_remaining), len(right_question_remaining)) pairs.\n\nBut how to track which elements are used in these steps.\n\nBut in code, perhaps after step 2 and step 3, the left_remain and right_remain would be processed, and the left_question and right_question would have some elements left.\n\nBut how to manage that.\n\nLet me think of code steps.\n\nOnce we have:\n\nleft_remain = [all non-? left boots not paired in step 1]\n\nright_remain = [all non-? right boots not paired in step 1]\n\nleft_q = left_color_dict['?'] (the list of left ? boots not used yet)\n\nright_q = right_color_dict['?'] (the list of right ? boots not used yet)\n\nThen:\n\nStep 2: Pair left_remain with right_q.\n\nWe can take the first min(len(left_remain), len(right_q)) elements.\n\nFor example:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_remain), len(right_q))):\n\n   pair left_remain[i] with right_q[i]\n\nThen, remove those elements from left_remain and right_q.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can loop through and pop elements.\n\nBut since we need to track the indices, perhaps we can use pointers.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(left_remain) and i < len(right_q):\n\n   pairs.append( (left_remain[i], right_q[i]) )\n\n   i += 1\n\nThen, left_remain is now left_remain[i:] and right_q is right_q[i:].\n\nBut since we can't modify the lists during iteration, perhaps we can take the first k elements and pair them, then truncate the lists.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_remain), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n\n   pairs.append( (left_remain[i], right_q[i]) )\n\nleft_remain = left_remain[num_pairs:]\n\nright_q = right_q[num_pairs:]\n\nSimilarly for step 3: pair right_remain with left_q.\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(right_remain), len(left_q))\n\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n\n   pairs.append( (left_q[i], right_remain[i]) )\n\nWait, no. Because the left_q is the left ? boots. So, for each right_remain element, we pair with a left_q.\n\nWait, the right_remain is a list of right non-? boots that couldn't be paired. So for each of them, we can pair with a left ?.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n\n   pairs.append( (left_q[i], right_remain[i]) )\n\nBut wait, the left_q is the list of left ? indices. So, the left_q[i] is the index of the left boot, and right_remain[i] is the index of the right boot.\n\nYes.\n\nThen, after that, we have left_q and right_q with remaining elements.\n\nNow, step 4: pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nThe number of pairs is min(len(left_q), len(right_q)).\n\nFor each i in range of that number, pair left_q[i] with right_q[i].\n\nBut in this case, since they are both ?s, they are compatible.\n\nSo, adding all these pairs.\n\nBut how to collect all these steps.\n\nNow, the problem is that the left_remain and right_remain are collected as lists. But how to collect them.\n\nWait, after step 1, the left_color_dict contains for each color (including ?) the remaining elements.\n\nBut in step 1, we processed all colors except ?, so for left_remain, we can collect all non-? entries in left_color_dict.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nleft_remain = []\nfor c in left_color_dict:\n    if c != '?':\n        left_remain.extend(left_color_dict[c])\n\nSimilarly for right_remain.\n\nBut then, after step 2, the left_remain is modified. Wait, no. Because in the code above, after collecting left_remain as a list, we process it by taking the first num_pairs elements and pairing them with right_q, and then the left_remain is left_remain[num_pairs:].\n\nBut in code, how to manage that.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the code steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize left_color_dict and right_color_dict as defaultdict(list).\n\nFor each index i in 0..n-1:\n\n   left_char = l[i]\n\n   if left_char != '?':\n\n       left_color_dict[left_char].append(i+1)  # 1-based index\n\n   else:\n\n       left_color_dict['?'].append(i+1)\n\nSame for right_color_dict with r[i].\n\nThen, process same-color pairs:\n\npairs = []\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   if c in left_color_dict and c in right_color_dict:\n\n       left_list = left_color_dict[c]\n\n       right_list = right_color_dict[c]\n\n       num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n       for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n           pairs.append( (left_list[i], right_list[i]) )\n\n       # Remove the paired elements from the lists\n\n       left_color_dict[c] = left_list[num_pairs:]\n\n       right_color_dict[c] = right_list[num_pairs:]\n\nWait, but in Python, modifying the lists inside the defaultdict would require that we have references to them. However, if we are using a defaultdict(list), then for each c, left_color_dict[c] is a list. So, for example, if we have left_color_dict['a'] = [1,2,3], and we take the first two elements, then left_color_dict['a'] becomes [3].\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nWait, for example, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   if c is present in both left and right:\n\n       left_list = left_color_dict[c]\n\n       right_list = right_color_dict[c]\n\n       num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n       for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n           pairs.append( (left_list[i], right_list[i]) )\n\n       # Now, we need to remove those elements from the lists. Since we have already taken the first num_pairs elements, we can set the lists to the remaining elements.\n\n       left_color_dict[c] = left_list[num_pairs:]\n\n       right_color_dict[c] = right_list[num_pairs:]\n\nBut this approach is not correct because for example, if the original left_list was [1,2,3], and num_pairs is 2, then after pairing, the left_list becomes [3], but in the code above, we are replacing left_color_dict[c] with left_list[num_pairs:], which is [3].\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut in Python, lists are mutable. So, if we do left_color_dict[c] = left_list[num_pairs:], then the original list is replaced with a new list. However, in this case, the left_list is a reference to left_color_dict[c], so modifying it would affect the dictionary.\n\nWait, no. Because left_list is a copy of the list. For example, if left_list = left_color_dict[c], which is a list. Then, left_list is a reference to that list. When you assign left_color_dict[c] = left_list[num_pairs:], you are replacing the entry in the dictionary with a new list (the slice). So the original list is not modified, but the dictionary entry is updated. However, this is okay, because in the next steps, we are not going to process the same color again.\n\nWait, but in the code above, we are looping over all colors from 'a' to 'z'. So, for example, if we process color 'a', and then later process color 'a' again (but that's not the case here). So, the code is processing each color once, and for each, we take the min of the left and right lists, pair them, and then update the lists in the dictionary.\n\nBut this approach would work.\n\nWait, but what if a color is not present in the left or right? For example, if c is not in left_color_dict, then the code skips it.\n\nBut in the code, the for loop is for c in 'a' to 'z'? Or perhaps, we can loop through all possible colors that are present in left or right? But that would be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should check if the color exists in both left and right.\n\nBut the code above loops through all 26 letters (from 'a' to 'z'), and for each, checks if it is present in both left and right.\n\nBut how to loop through all 26 letters in Python? Well, we can do something like:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nfor c in map(chr, range(ord('a'), ord('z')+1)):\n\nBut that's manageable.\n\nOnce that is done, we have the pairs from step 1.\n\nThen, collect left_remain and right_remain.\n\nleft_remain = []\nfor c in left_color_dict:\n    if c != '?':\n        left_remain.extend(left_color_dict[c])\n\nright_remain = []\nfor c in right_color_dict:\n    if c != '?':\n        right_remain.extend(right_color_dict[c])\n\nThen, collect the left_q and right_q:\n\nleft_q = left_color_dict.get('?', [])\nright_q = right_color_dict.get('?', [])\n\nNow, step 2: pair left_remain with right_q.\n\nWe can do:\n\ni = 0\nwhile i < len(left_remain) and i < len(right_q):\n    pairs.append( (left_remain[i], right_q[i]) )\n    i += 1\n# Now, truncate the lists\nleft_remain = left_remain[i:]\nright_q = right_q[i:]\n\nWait, but in Python, lists are mutable. So, how to modify them? Well, perhaps, in code, we can take the first min(len(left_remain), len(right_q)) elements and pair them. So, the code can be:\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_remain), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    pairs.append( (left_remain[i], right_q[i]) )\nleft_remain = left_remain[num_pairs:]\nright_q = right_q[num_pairs:]\n\nSimilarly for step 3:\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(right_remain), len(left_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i], right_remain[i]) )\nright_remain = right_remain[num_pairs:]\nleft_q = left_q[num_pairs:]\n\nThen, step 4: pair remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i], right_q[i]) )\n\nBut wait, in step 3, the code pairs left_q (left ?) with right_remain (right non-?).\n\nYes, because right_remain is the list of right non-? boots not paired yet.\n\nSo, the code for step 3 is:\n\nfor each of the first num_pairs elements of left_q and right_remain, pair them.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i], right_remain[i]) )\n\nBut in code, the left_q is the list of left ? boots, and right_remain is the list of right non-? boots. So, each pair is (left ?, right non-?).\n\nYes, which is valid.\n\nOnce all these steps are done, the pairs list contains all the possible pairs.\n\nNow, the problem is that the code for steps 2, 3, 4 modifies the left_remain, right_remain, left_q, right_q variables. However, in Python, lists are passed by reference, but in the code above, after the steps, the variables are re-assigned to slices, which creates new lists. But in code, this is acceptable.\n\nBut how to collect all the pairs.\n\nOnce all steps are done, the pairs list will contain all the pairs.\n\nBut what about the order in which we process the steps? For example, in step 2, pairing left_remain with right_q, then step 3, pairing right_remain with left_q.\n\nThis approach should cover all possible pairs.\n\nNow, testing this approach with the sample input.\n\nLet's take the first example from the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nSample Output 1 is 5 pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the code would generate that.\n\nBut I'm not going to test that now.\n\nNow, possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All boots are ?.\n\nIn this case, all pairs can be formed. The maximum is n pairs.\n\nEdge case 2: All left boots are 'a', and all right boots are 'b'. Then, no pairs can be formed.\n\nAnother edge case: left has some 'a's and some '?', and right has some 'a's and some '?'. The code should pair the 'a's first, then use ?s.\n\nNow, what about the order in which the pairs are generated?\n\nThe problem says that any valid answer is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code needs to output the pairs, with unique indices.\n\nNow, the code above uses the order in which the elements were added to the left_color_dict and right_color_dict. For example, for a color c, the left boots are added in the order of their occurrence in the string l. Similarly for right.\n\nBut when pairing, the code takes the first elements of the lists, which corresponds to the earliest indices. This is acceptable, as the problem allows any valid pairing.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle the data structures properly.\n\nNow, in Python, for large n (up to 150,000), using lists and slicing is acceptable? Because for each step, the code is O(n) time.\n\nYes, because all steps are O(n) in total.\n\nNow, code structure.\n\nBut in Python, for the initial processing of the colors, the code loops through all 26 letters, and for each, checks if they are in the left and right color dicts.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nImplementing that:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn = int(input())\nl = input().strip()\nr = input().strip()\n\nleft_color = defaultdict(list)\nright_color = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    c = l[i]\n    if c != '?':\n        left_color[c].append(i+1)\n    else:\n        left_color['?'].append(i+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    c = r[i]\n    if c != '?':\n        right_color[c].append(i+1)\n    else:\n        right_color['?'].append(i+1)\n\npairs = []\n\n# Step 1: pair same color non-? boots\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    if c in left_color and c in right_color:\n        left_list = left_color[c]\n        right_list = right_color[c]\n        num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n            pairs.append( (left_list[i], right_list[i]) )\n        # Update the lists in the dict\n        left_color[c] = left_list[num_pairs:]\n        right_color[c] = right_list[num_pairs:]\n\n# Collect left_remain and right_remain\nleft_remain = []\nfor c in left_color:\n    if c != '?':\n        left_remain.extend(left_color[c])\n\nright_remain = []\nfor c in right_color:\n    if c != '?':\n        right_remain.extend(right_color[c])\n\nleft_q = left_color.get('?', [])\nright_q = right_color.get('?', [])\n\n# Step 2: pair left_remain with right_q\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_remain), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    pairs.append( (left_remain[i], right_q[i]) )\nleft_remain = left_remain[num_pairs:]\nright_q = right_q[num_pairs:]\n\n# Step 3: pair right_remain with left_q\nnum_pairs = min(len(right_remain), len(left_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i], right_remain[i]) )\nright_remain = right_remain[num_pairs:]\nleft_q = left_q[num_pairs:]\n\n# Step 4: pair remaining left_q and right_q\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(num_pairs):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i], right_q[i]) )\n\nprint(len(pairs))\nfor a, b in pairs:\n    print(a, b)\n\nWait, but in the code above, after step 1, when we process the same color, we are modifying left_color[c] and right_color[c] by assigning them to the sliced lists. However, in Python, when you do left_color[c] = left_list[num_pairs:], you are replacing the list in the defaultdict with a new list. But for the next steps, when collecting left_remain and right_remain, we are iterating through all keys in left_color and right_color. However, for example, if a color c was processed in step 1 and left_color[c] is now an empty list, then when collecting left_remain, it would be extended with the empty list, which is fine.\n\nBut what about the 'a' to 'z' loop in step 1? For example, if a color is not present in left_color or right_color, then the code skips it.\n\nBut the code for step 1 loops through all 26 letters. For each, it checks if it is present in left_color and right_color. If yes, then process.\n\nBut in Python, checking if a key is in a defaultdict is possible. For example, even if the defaultdict has a key, but the list is empty, then the code would process it. However, for example, if a color c is present in left_color but not in right_color, then the code skips processing.\n\nBut in that case, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing this code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\nInput: ['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree']\n\nBut the actual input is:\n\nn=10\n\nl = 'codeforces'\n\nr = 'dodivthree'\n\nLet me compute the pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the code would generate the correct output.\n\nBut I'm not going to simulate that now.\n\nAnother thing to note: the code uses the same order for the left and right lists. For example, for the same color, the first elements of left and right are paired. Which is correct.\n\nNow, possible error: in step 1, when we process the color c, the code uses left_color[c] and right_color[c], but after processing, the code replaces them with the remaining elements. However, in the code, after processing, the left_color and right_color are modified. But in the code, when collecting left_remain and right_remain, it iterates through all keys in left_color and right_color, including those that may have been processed in step 1.\n\nBut that is correct. For example, after step 1, the left_color for color 'c' may have some elements left, which are added to left_remain.\n\nAnother possible error: in the step 1, the code loops through all 26 letters, but for each, it checks if they are present in left and right. However, the defaultdict may have entries for colors not present in the original strings. For example, if a color 'x' is not present in l or r, but the defaultdict has it as an empty list. However, in that case, the code checks if c is in left_color and right_color. But for a defaultdict, checking if c is in the keys is not the same as checking if the list is non-empty. Because defaultdict automatically creates entries when accessed. Wait, no. The code adds entries to left_color and right_color only when the character is processed. For example, for each character in l and r, if it's not '?', it is added to the corresponding list in left_color or right_color. So, for example, if a color 'x' is not present in l or r, then left_color does not have a key for 'x' (unless it was added during processing). Wait, no. The defaultdict is initialized as defaultdict(list). So, when you check if 'x' is in left_color, it will return True if the key exists, even if the list is empty. But in our code, for the first part, when we process the l and r strings, we only add entries to left_color and right_color for the characters that are present. For example, if a color 'x' is not present in l, then left_color does not have a key for 'x' unless it was added during the processing of l. Wait, no. Because for the code:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    c = l[i]\n    if c != '?':\n        left_color[c].append(i+1)\n    else:\n        left_color['?'].append(i+1)\n\nSo, for example, if l has no 'x' characters, then left_color does not have a key for 'x'. Because the code only adds to left_color[c] when c is not '?'. However, the defaultdict will create an empty list for any key accessed. But in the code, when we check if c is in left_color, it's checking whether the key is present. However, in Python, the 'in' operator for a defaultdict checks if the key is present in the dictionary, regardless of whether the value is empty. So, for example, if a color 'x' was never added to left_color (because there were no 'x's in l), then left_color does not have the key 'x', and thus the code in step 1 will not process it.\n\nBut this is correct.\n\nAnother possible mistake is that in step 1, the code is looping through all 26 letters, but the code uses 'c in left_color and c in right_color' to check. However, the code may have a color c that is present in left_color but not in right_color, and vice versa. So the code correctly skips those.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut let's think about the sample input where the output is 5",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to pair left and right boots such that their colors are compatible. A color is compatible if both are the same specific color or if one of them is a wildcard ('?'). The goal is to maximize the number of such pairs and output them.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Color Matching**: First, we pair left and right boots with the same specific color (excluding wildcards).\n2. **Wildcard Matching**: After pairing specific colors, we use wildcards to pair remaining boots.
