Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color, which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The goal is to pair as many left-right boots as possible such that their colors are compatible. Compatibility rules: same specific color, or one of them is a question mark. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nThe output is the maximum number of pairs and their indices.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, think about how to maximize the pairs. Let's consider different cases.\n\nIdea: We can first pair the left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots that have the same specific color. Then, handle the remaining question marks.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. For each color (excluding ?), count how many left boots have that color, and how many right boots have that color. For each color c, the number of pairs we can form here is min(left[c], right[c]). But since each boot can be used once, we need to track which ones are used.\n\nBut wait, maybe we should first pair the left and right boots with specific colors, then use the remaining question marks to pair with any remaining boots.\n\nBut how to handle the question marks? Because they can be paired with any other boots, but we need to maximize the total.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is:\n\n- First, pair all left and right boots with specific colors (non-?), matching same colors. For example, for each color c, pair as many as possible between left[c] and right[c].\n\n- Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which are either ? or have no match in the first step), pair them using the ?s. Since ? can be matched with any, including other ?s.\n\nBut how to track which boots are already used?\n\nBut given that the problem allows any valid pairing as long as it's maximum, perhaps we can process the specific colors first, then handle the ?s.\n\nBut let's think about the data structures. For example, for each color c (a-z), we can collect the indices of left boots with that color and the indices of right boots with that color. Then, for each color, we can pair them up, and mark those boots as used.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining left and right boots are those that are either ? or couldn't be paired in the first step. Then, we can pair the remaining ?s with any available boots (either ? or specific colors, but only if they are not already paired).\n\nWait, but after the first step, the remaining boots could be:\n\nLeft boots that are ? or have a color that had no matching right boots (or vice versa). Similarly for right boots.\n\nBut how to pair the remaining ones optimally?\n\nAnother idea: For the ?s, they can be used to pair with any unpaired boots. So, perhaps we can pair as follows:\n\nAfter handling the specific color pairs, collect all remaining left boots (including ?s) and remaining right boots (including ?s). Then, pair them in any way possible, but ensuring that each is used once.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose after the first step, there are some left boots with ?, and some right boots with ?. Also, there might be some left boots with color 'a' that couldn't find a right 'a' (because right 'a's were all used in the first step, but maybe there are more left 'a's than right 'a's). Wait, no. Because in the first step, for each color c, we pair min(left[c], right[c]) pairs. So, for example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's, we pair 2 of them. The remaining left 'a' would be left unpaired. But then, that left 'a' can't be paired with anything except a right 'a' or a right '?'. However, the right 'a's are already used up. So, if there are any right ?s, we can pair that left 'a' with a right '?', but that would require that the right '?' is not used yet.\n\nSo, the second step is to pair the remaining left and right boots. How to do this optimally?\n\nMaybe, for the remaining left boots and right boots, we can pair them by using the ?s as flexible elements.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- First, create two lists:\n\n   - For left boots, collect all the indices where the color is not '?'. These are the ones that can only be paired with a right boot of same color, or with a '?'.\n\n   - Similarly for right boots.\n\nBut perhaps the better way is to process the specific colors first, then the ?s.\n\nLet me outline the steps again:\n\nStep 1: Pair left and right boots with specific colors (non-?).\n\nFor each color c in a-z:\n\n   Take the list of left boots with color c (not used yet) and the list of right boots with color c (not used yet). Pair them as much as possible, say, min(len(left_c), len(right_c)) pairs. For each pair, mark them as used.\n\nBut how to track which boots are used? Maybe using arrays of booleans for left and right.\n\nBut for large n (up to 150,000), we need an efficient way to process this.\n\nAlternatively, for each color c, collect all the positions (indices) of left and right boots with color c, then pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut how to pair them? For example, for color 'a', if there are 5 left and 3 right, pair the first 3 left with the first 3 right.\n\nBut in practice, we can process each color, and for each, take the first min(left_count, right_count) elements from both lists, and pair them.\n\nBut how to collect these lists?\n\nLet me think. For the left boots, create a dictionary mapping each color (excluding ?) to a list of indices. Similarly for the right boots. Then, for each color, process the pairs.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left and right boots are those that are either ? or have colors that couldn't be matched (like left 'a' when there are no right 'a's left).\n\nThen, for the second step, we need to pair the remaining left and right boots.\n\nNow, the remaining left boots can be:\n\n- Those with color ? (can pair with any remaining right boot)\n\n- Those with specific colors, but no corresponding right boots left (so, they can only be paired with right ?s)\n\nSimilarly for the remaining right boots.\n\nSo, the second step is to pair the remaining left and right boots. How?\n\nWe can collect all remaining left boots (including ?s) and all remaining right boots (including ?s), and pair them as follows:\n\nFor each left boot (that is not used yet), if it's a ?, pair it with any unused right boot. If it's a specific color, pair it with a right ?.\n\nBut how to efficiently do that?\n\nAnother idea: collect all remaining left boots (including ?s) into a list, and all remaining right boots (including ?s) into another list. Then, pair them as follows:\n\nFor each left boot in the remaining list:\n\n   if it's a ?, then pair it with the first available right boot (any, even ?).\n\n   else, if there's a right ? available, pair with that.\n\nIf that's not possible, then the left boot can't be paired.\n\nBut how to manage that?\n\nAlternatively, collect all the left boots that are not ?, and have a specific color. For each such left boot, check if there's a right ? that hasn't been paired yet. If yes, pair them. Then, pair the remaining left ?s with the remaining right ?s.\n\nBut how to track which are used.\n\nLet me think of this as two groups:\n\nGroup A: left boots with specific colors (non-?).\n\nGroup B: left boots with ?.\n\nGroup C: right boots with specific colors (non-?).\n\nGroup D: right boots with ?.\n\nAfter step 1, group A and group C may have some elements left (those that couldn't be paired with their same color).\n\nSo for group A, each element can only be paired with a right ? (group D). For group D, each element can be paired with any left boot (group A or B).\n\nSimilarly, group B can be paired with any right boot (group C or D). But group C can only be paired with left boots that have same color (but those were already processed in step 1). Wait, no. Because in step 1, group C (right boots with specific colors) were already paired with same color left boots. Any remaining in group C would be those that couldn't find a matching left boot (for example, if there were more right boots of color 'a' than left ones). So, those can't be paired with any left boots except if there's a left ?.\n\nSo, during step 2:\n\nProcess group A (left non-? that couldn't be paired) and group D (right ?). For each left in group A, pair with a right ? if possible.\n\nThen, process group B (left ?) and group C (right non-? that couldn't be paired). For each right in group C, pair with a left ? if possible.\n\nThen, process group B and group D. Pair the remaining left ?s with the remaining right ?s.\n\nThis seems like a good approach.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Pair same-colored non-? boots.\n\n   For each color c in a-z:\n\n      left_list = list of left indices with color c, not used yet.\n\n      right_list = list of right indices with color c, not used yet.\n\n      for i in 0 to min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) -1:\n\n          pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n          mark them as used.\n\n2. Now, collect all remaining left and right boots.\n\n   For the remaining left boots, collect those that are not used and have color ? (group B) and those that are not used and have specific color (group A).\n\n   Similarly for the right boots, collect those that are not used and have color ? (group D) and those that are not used and have specific color (group C).\n\n3. Now, for group A (left non-? unpaired) and group D (right ?):\n\n   For each left in group A, try to pair with a right ? in group D. So, pair as many as possible.\n\n   For example, iterate through group A and group D, and pair them.\n\n4. Then, for group C (right non-? unpaired) and group B (left ?):\n\n   For each right in group C, try to pair with a left ? in group B.\n\n5. Finally, pair the remaining group B and group D (left ? and right ?) as much as possible.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nBut how to collect these groups?\n\nFirst, we need to track which boots are used. Let's have two arrays, left_used and right_used, of size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for step 1, we can process each color, and for each color, collect the indices of left and right boots that are not used, have that color, and pair them.\n\nOnce that is done, for step 2:\n\nCollect all left boots not used, and their color.\n\nSimilarly for right boots.\n\nThen, group A is left boots not used with color != '?'\n\ngroup B is left boots not used with color == '?'\n\ngroup C is right boots not used with color != '?'\n\ngroup D is right boots not used with color == '?'\n\nThen, process:\n\nFirst, pair group A (left non-?) with group D (right ?):\n\nFor each left in group A:\n\n   if there's a right in group D not used yet, pair them.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, take the first available right in group D.\n\nSo, perhaps, for group D, we can have a list of indices. Then, for each left in group A, take the first element from group D's list, pair them, and remove that element from group D.\n\nSimilarly for group C and group B.\n\nBut how to collect these groups.\n\nAlternatively, for group A, we can collect all left indices (not used) with color != '?'. For group D, collect all right indices (not used) with color '?'.\n\nThen, for each left in group A, we can pair it with a right in group D. So, for example, take the first element from group D, pair with this left, and remove that right from group D.\n\nBut how to manage this in code.\n\nSimilarly for group C and group B.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining group D and group B can be paired together.\n\nSo, for example:\n\npairing_group_A_D:\n\nfor each left in group A:\n\n   if group D is not empty:\n\n       pair left with first element in group D.\n\n       remove that element from group D.\n\nThen, pairing_group_C_B:\n\nfor each right in group C:\n\n   if group B is not empty:\n\n       pair right with first element in group B.\n\n       remove that element from group B.\n\nFinally, pairing_group_B_D:\n\nthe remaining elements in group B and group D can be paired in any way. Since both are ?, they can be paired with each other.\n\nSo, for each i in 0 to len(group B) -1 (assuming len(group B) == len(group D)), pair group B[i] with group D[i].\n\nBut what if the lengths are different? Well, since group B and group D are the remaining after previous steps, the maximum possible pairs is min(len(group B), len(group D)).\n\nSo, the total pairs from this step is that.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code structure.\n\nFirst, read n, l, r.\n\nThen, create left_used and right_used arrays.\n\nThen, for step 1:\n\nWe can create a dictionary for left colors (excluding ?) and right colors (excluding ?).\n\nFor each color in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = list of indices (i) where l[i] == color and not used.\n\n   right_list = list of indices (i) where r[i] == color and not used.\n\n   for i in range(min(len(left_list), len(right_list))):\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n       mark left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut how to collect these lists?\n\nWait, but for each color, we can pre-process the indices.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps we can create for each color, a list of indices for left and right.\n\nBut for n up to 1.5e5, that's manageable.\n\nSo, for example, in Python, for the left string, we can have a dictionary, left_colors, where left_colors[c] is a list of indices (starting from 0 or 1?) where the color is c.\n\nSimilarly for right_colors.\n\nBut note that the problem says that the indices in the output are 1-based. So, during processing, we need to collect the indices as 1-based.\n\nSo, for example, for l string, for each i from 0 to n-1, the index is i+1.\n\nSo, during processing, for each color c in a-z, we can collect the indices (1-based) of left and right boots with that color.\n\nOnce that is done, for step 1, for each color c, we can take the left list and right list, and pair as much as possible.\n\nBut during this process, once a pair is made, those indices are marked as used, so they cannot be used again.\n\nBut how to track that? Because the lists for each color are precomputed, but after some pairs are made, the same color's lists may have elements that are already used.\n\nWait, no. Because during step 1, we process each color once. For example, suppose for color 'a', we have left list [1,2,3], right list [4,5]. Then, we pair 1 with 4, 2 with 5. The left indices 1 and 2 are now used, and right indices 4 and 5 are used. So, when we process color 'a' again (which we don't, since we process each color once), but the problem is that for other steps, the used flags are tracked.\n\nBut during step 1, for each color, we process the left and right lists, but the initial lists may include elements that have already been used. Wait, no. Because during step 1, for each color, the initial lists are built before any pairing. So, during the step 1 processing, the initial lists are all the left and right boots with that color, regardless of whether they have been used. But that's not correct. Because during step 1, we process all colors, but once a boot is used in a pair, it can't be used again.\n\nSo, perhaps the initial approach is wrong. Because, for example, if a left boot is part of color 'a' and is paired in step 1, then when processing color 'b', it's already used and shouldn't be considered again.\n\nSo, the problem is that during step 1, the left and right lists for each color are built once, and then processed, but they may contain elements that have already been used in previous color processing.\n\nTherefore, the approach of pre-building all lists for each color and then processing them is incorrect. Because, for example, a left boot with color 'a' is processed when handling color 'a', but if during that processing, some of the left boots are used, then when processing other colors, they should not be included again.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct approach is to process the colors in some order, and for each color, collect the left and right boots that are not yet used.\n\nBut for that, during step 1, for each color c, we need to collect the current left and right boots (not used yet) with color c.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nOne approach is to have for each color, a queue (or list) of indices. Initially, for each color, we add all the indices (left and right) with that color. Then, during step 1, when processing color c, we take the left and right queues, and pair as much as possible, and remove those elements from the queues.\n\nBut for example, for left boots, we can have for each color c, a list of indices. Initially, for each left boot, we add to the corresponding color's list. Then, when processing color c, we take the left and right lists, and pair them. But once paired, those elements are no longer available for other colors.\n\nBut how to manage that? Because during processing, when you pair a left boot with a right boot, you need to remove them from all color queues.\n\nBut that's complicated. Alternatively, during step 1, for each color c, we can collect the current list of available left and right boots (not used yet) with color c, and then pair them.\n\nBut for that, for each color c, during step 1 processing, we can loop through the left and right arrays, and collect the indices that are not used and have color c. But for n up to 1.5e5, and 26 letters, that would be O(26n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to precompute for each color, the list of indices, and then during processing, track which indices are used. For example, for each color c, the left list is a list of indices. Then, during processing, we iterate through the list, and for each index, if it's not used, we can consider it. But how to track that.\n\nAlternatively, during step 1, for each color c:\n\n   left_available = [i for i in left_colors[c] if not left_used[i]]\n\n   right_available = [i for i in right_colors[c] if not right_used[i]]\n\n   then pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut for each color c, this is O(k) where k is the number of elements in the color list. For all 26 colors, this is O(n) time.\n\nBut for large n, this could be acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, for n=1.5e5, and 26 letters, this would be manageable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as arrays of False.\n\nFor each color in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices (1-based) where l[i-1] == color (since the input strings are 0-based in code, but the indices in output are 1-based).\n\n   collect all right indices (1-based) where r[i-1] == color.\n\n   then, for these lists, find the number of pairs possible (min(len(left_list), len(right_list))).\n\n   for i in 0 to min(...) -1:\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n       mark left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut wait, the problem is that the left_list and right_list for color c may include indices that were already used in previous steps. Because for example, suppose color 'a' was processed first, and some left and right boots were used. Then, when processing color 'b', the left_list for 'b' may include some boots that were already used in color 'a'? No, because during the processing of color 'a', the left_used and right_used arrays are updated. So, when processing color 'b', the left_list for 'b' is built from the original left_colors['b'] list, but when checking for left_available, we need to filter out the ones that are already used.\n\nWait, no. The code above, as written, would collect all left indices with color c (original list), but not check if they are used. That's a mistake. Because, for example, a left boot with color 'a' may have been used in pairing with another right boot of color 'a' (processed earlier). So, during processing color 'a', the left_list would include all indices with color 'a', but some may have already been used in previous steps. Hence, the code would attempt to pair them again, which is wrong.\n\nAh, so this approach is incorrect. Because the code for step 1 would process each color, but the left and right lists for that color may include indices that were already used in previous steps.\n\nSo, the correct way is to, for each color, collect the current available left and right boots (not used yet) with that color.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAlternative approach: For each color c, process the left and right boots in a way that ensures that they are not already used.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nAn alternative idea is to precompute for each color c, the list of left and right indices. Then, during step 1 processing, for each color c, we process the left and right lists in order, but only take those that are not used yet.\n\nBut how to track which elements are used. For example, for the left list of color c, we can have a pointer that tracks up to which index we've checked. But that's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for each color, during step 1 processing, we can generate a list of available left and right boots (not used yet) with that color, then pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut for each color, this requires iterating through all left and right indices with that color and checking if they are used. Which is O(n) per color, but acceptable for 26 colors.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, 26*1.5e5 is 3.9e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, for step 1, for each color c in a-z:\n\n   left_list = [i for i in left_colors[c] if not left_used[i]]\n\n   right_list = [i for i in right_colors[c] if not right_used[i]]\n\n   min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in range(min_len):\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n       mark left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut this would work, but for each color, generating left_list and right_list by checking each element. However, for large n, this may be slow in Python.\n\nBut given that n is up to 1.5e5, and for 26 colors, this would be O(26n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to precompute the left_colors and right_colors?\n\nYes. For example, in Python:\n\nleft_colors = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    c = l[i]\n\n    if c != '?':\n\n        left_colors[c].append(i+1)  # 1-based index\n\nSimilarly for right_colors.\n\nOnce that is done, during step 1 processing, for each color in 'a' to 'z', we process as described.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, then step 2.\n\nNow, for step 2, collect all left boots not used and their color, and same for right.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nWe can create:\n\nremaining_left = []\n\nremaining_right = []\n\nfor i in 1..n:\n\n    if not left_used[i]:\n\n        remaining_left.append( (i, l[i-1]) )\n\n    if not right_used[i]:\n\n        remaining_right.append( (i, r[i-1]) )\n\nBut then, group A is those in remaining_left with color != '?'\n\ngroup B is those in remaining_left with color == '?'\n\ngroup C is those in remaining_right with color != '?'\n\ngroup D is those in remaining_right with color == '?'\n\nOnce grouped, proceed as discussed.\n\nThen, for group A and group D:\n\nfor each left in group A:\n\n   if group D is not empty:\n\n       pair left with first element of group D.\n\n       remove that element from group D.\n\nSimilarly for group C and group B.\n\nThen, pair the remaining group B and D.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ngroup_A = [ (i, color) for (i, color) in remaining_left if color != '?' ]\n\ngroup_B = [ (i, color) for (i, color) in remaining_left if color == '?' ]\n\ngroup_C = [ (i, color) for (i, color) in remaining_right if color != '?' ]\n\ngroup_D = [ (i, color) for (i, color) in remaining_right if color == '?' ]\n\nThen, for group_A and group_D:\n\nWe can take the list of group_A's indices and group_D's indices.\n\nFor each left in group_A:\n\n   if group_D is not empty:\n\n       take the first element in group_D (say, d_index, '?')\n\n       pair left_index with d_index.\n\n       add to the result.\n\n       remove the d_index from group_D.\n\nSimilarly for group_C and group_B:\n\nfor each right in group_C:\n\n   if group_B is not empty:\n\n       take first element in group_B (say, b_index, '?')\n\n       pair right_index with b_index.\n\n       add to result.\n\n       remove the b_index from group_B.\n\nThen, pair the remaining group_B and group_D.\n\nFor example, take the first len(group_B) elements from group_D (if possible), and pair them.\n\nBut since group_B and group_D are lists of indices with '?', they can be paired in any way.\n\nSo, for i in range( min(len(group_B), len(group_D)) ):\n\n   pair group_B[i] with group_D[i]\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nNow, the problem is that during these steps, we need to collect the indices and pair them, and track which are used.\n\nWait, but during step 2, the group_A, group_B, group_C, group_D are built from the remaining_left and remaining_right, which are already not used. So, when we pair them, we need to mark them as used. However, since the group_A, group_B, etc., are built from the remaining boots, which are not used, and during the pairing steps, they are added to the result and thus marked as used. But how to track that?\n\nWait, no. Because during step 1, the left_used and right_used arrays are already filled. But during step 2, the group_A, group_B, etc., are built from the remaining_left and remaining_right, which are not used. So, when pairing them, we need to mark them as used. However, the code above does not do that. So, perhaps during step 2, when pairing, we need to mark them as used.\n\nBut in the code steps above, after step 1, the left_used and right_used arrays are already filled. So, during step 2, when we pair the group_A and group_D, we need to mark the left and right indices as used.\n\nBut how? Because during the group_A and group_D processing, the code is just collecting the indices, and then pairing them. So, for example, when pairing a left index (from group_A) with a right index (from group_D), we need to mark both as used.\n\nBut since the group_A and group_D are built from the remaining_left and remaining_right, which are already not used, we can safely mark them as used during this step.\n\nSo, during step 2, after building group_A, group_B, group_C, group_D, we can proceed:\n\nresult_pairs = list of pairs from step 1.\n\nThen:\n\ngroup_A = list of left indices (not used) with color != '?'\n\ngroup_D = list of right indices (not used) with color '?'\n\nfor i in range(len(group_A)):\n\n    if group_D is not empty:\n\n        left_idx = group_A[i][0]\n\n        right_idx = group_D[0][0]\n\n        result_pairs.append( (left_idx, right_idx) )\n\n        group_D.pop(0)\n\n        # mark as used? Well, since the group_A and group_D are built from the remaining boots, which are not used, but once paired, they are used. However, the left_used and right_used arrays are already set during step 1. But during step 2, they are not modified. Wait, but during step 1, the left_used and right_used arrays are marked as True for the pairs made in step 1. The group_A and group_D are built from the remaining boots (left_used[i] is False). So, during step 2, when we pair them, we need to mark them as used. But the code above does not do that. However, since the problem requires that each boot is used in at most one pair, and the code is generating the pairs, we must ensure that once paired, they are not used again. However, since the group_A and group_D are built once, and during pairing, they are processed in order, and once paired, they are removed from the group, so they are not processed again. Thus, the left_used and right_used arrays are not modified during step 2. But that's not a problem, since during the step 2 processing, the group_A and group_D are built from the remaining boots (which are not used), and once paired, they are not used again. But the left_used and right_used arrays are not modified, which could cause issues if another step tries to use them again. However, since step 2 is the last step, and the groups are built once, this is not a problem.\n\nWait, but the code for step 2 is generating the pairs, but the left_used and right_used arrays are not updated. However, since the group_A and group_D are built from the remaining boots (not used), and during step 2 processing, they are paired once and then not processed again. So, there's no problem. But the code for step 2 must not reuse any boots that are already used. However, since the groups are built once, and the pairing steps are done in order, this is ensured.\n\nBut perhaps the code should not rely on this, but instead, during step 2, mark the left_used and right_used arrays as True for the newly paired boots. Because, for example, if there is a bug in the code that causes a boot to be paired multiple times, but that's unlikely in this approach.\n\nBut in practice, during step 2, the group_A, group_B, etc., are built from the remaining boots (not used), and during processing, the code pairs them once and removes them from the group. So, they are not processed again. Therefore, the left_used and right_used arrays are not needed during step 2. However, during step 2, the code is generating the pairs, and they are added to the result_pairs. The problem is that the code must not generate duplicate pairs. But since the groups are built from the remaining boots, and during processing, the pairs are generated once, this is ensured.\n\nThus, the code for step 2 can proceed as follows:\n\nCollect group_A, group_B, group_C, group_D as lists of indices (without considering used status, since they are built from the remaining boots not used).\n\nThen, process group_A and group_D:\n\nfor each left in group_A:\n\n   if group_D is not empty:\n\n       pair left with group_D[0]\n\n       add to result_pairs.\n\n       remove group_D[0]\n\nSimilarly for group_C and group_B.\n\nThen, pair the remaining group_B and group_D.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nBut in Python, for group_A, group_D, etc., they are lists of tuples (index, color). But during this step, the color is not needed except for grouping.\n\nSo, perhaps group_A is a list of indices (since the color is known to be non-?).\n\nSimilarly, group_D is a list of indices (since color is ?).\n\nThus, during step 2 processing:\n\ngroup_A = [i for i, color in remaining_left if color != '?']\n\ngroup_B = [i for i, color in remaining_left if color == '?']\n\ngroup_C = [i for i, color in remaining_right if color != '?']\n\ngroup_D = [i for i, color in remaining_right if color == '?']\n\nThen:\n\n# Pair group_A (left non-?) with group_D (right ?)\nfor i in range(len(group_A)):\n    if group_D:\n        left_idx = group_A[i]\n        right_idx = group_D[0]\n        result_pairs.append( (left_idx, right_idx) )\n        group_D.pop(0)\n\n# Pair group_C (right non-?) with group_B (left ?)\nfor i in range(len(group_C)):\n    if group_B:\n        right_idx = group_C[i]\n        left_idx = group_B[0]\n        result_pairs.append( (left_idx, right_idx) )\n        group_B.pop(0)\n\n# Pair remaining group_B and group_D\nmin_len = min(len(group_B), len(group_D))\nfor i in range(min_len):\n    left_idx = group_B[i]\n    right_idx = group_D[i]\n    result_pairs.append( (left_idx, right_idx) )\n\nBut wait, group_B and group_D are lists of left and right indices. So, the third step pairs group_B (left ?) with group_D (right ?). So, for each pair, the left index is from group_B, and the right index is from group_D.\n\nBut in the code above, group_B is a list of left indices (with ?), and group_D is a list of right indices (with ?). So, pairing them as (left, right) is correct.\n\nThus, the code for step 2 would generate the pairs.\n\nNow, the question is how to collect the remaining_left and remaining_right.\n\nIn code:\n\nremaining_left = []\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    if not left_used[i]:\n        remaining_left.append( (i, l[i-1]) )\n\nSimilarly for remaining_right.\n\nBut in Python, the left_used and right_used arrays are 1-based? Well, assuming that the indices are 1-based.\n\nBut in code, the left_used is a list of size n+1 (for 1-based indices), or perhaps 0-based. Let me think.\n\nIn code:\n\nn = int(input())\nl = input().strip()\nr = input().strip()\n\nleft_used = [False] * (n + 1)  # indexes 1..n\nright_used = [False] * (n + 1)\n\nThen, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   left_used[i+1] is False initially.\n\nSo, during step 1, for each color c in a-z:\n\n   left_list = [i for i in left_colors[c] if not left_used[i]]\n\nBut left_colors[c] is a list of 1-based indices.\n\nSo, during step 1, for each color, we generate left_list and right_list as the available indices not used yet.\n\nOnce that is done, the code proceeds.\n\nNow, the code for step 1:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    left_list = []\n    for idx in left_colors.get(c, []):\n        if not left_used[idx]:\n            left_list.append(idx)\n    right_list = []\n    for idx in right_colors.get(c, []):\n        if not right_used[idx]:\n            right_list.append(idx)\n    min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for i in range(min_len):\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n        result_pairs.append( (left_idx, right_idx) )\n        left_used[left_idx] = True\n        right_used[right_idx] = True\n\nBut this is O(26n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, for n=1.5e5, and 26 letters, this may be slow. However, perhaps we can optimize it by precomputing the left_colors and right_colors.\n\nBut let's proceed.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, collect the remaining_left and remaining_right.\n\nThen proceed with step 2.\n\nNow, the code for the entire problem.\n\nBut how to handle multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the example input, it seems that the user provided multiple test cases, but the original problem says that the input is a single case. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains n...\n\nSo, the input is for a single test case. But the example shows multiple inputs, perhaps for multiple test cases. However,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each boot can be either a specific color or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). A pair is considered compatible if both boots are the same specific color or one of them is an indefinite color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Pairing of Specific Colors**: First, we pair left and right boots that have the same specific color. This is done by iterating through each possible color (from 'a' to 'z') and matching available left and right boots of that color.\n2. **Handling Indefinite Colors**: After pairing all specific color boots, we handle the remaining boots that are either indefinite or could not find a match.
