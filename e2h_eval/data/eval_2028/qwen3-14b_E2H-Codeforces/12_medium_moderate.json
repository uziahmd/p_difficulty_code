The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem is about calculating the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are n houses arranged in a circle. Xenia starts at house 1. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The movement between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. The goal is to find the total minimum time required to complete all tasks.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the time taken to move from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement. But since the tasks have to be done in order, we need to process them sequentially.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are [3,2,3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. The distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps clockwise. So that's 2 units of time. Then she does the task. Then the next task is at 2. But since she's at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around: 3 →4 →1 →2. That's 3 steps. So adding 3 to the total (total becomes 2+3=5). Then the third task is at 3 again. She's at 2, so moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total becomes 5+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is that for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the time to move from the previous position to the current task's position, considering the circular nature.\n\nBut how to compute the time between two positions?\n\nLet's say Xenia is currently at position prev, and the next task is at position curr. How do we compute the steps needed?\n\nSince the movement is clockwise, the number of steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) mod n if moving clockwise. Wait, no. Wait, if prev is 3 and curr is 2, and n is 4, then moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require 3 steps: 3→4→1→2. Which is (2 - 3 + n) % n? Let's see: (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the formula for steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Which can be written as (curr - prev) % n if we take into account that when curr is less than prev, the modulo gives the correct positive value. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. For example, (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. So yes, (curr - prev) % n gives the correct number of steps. But wait, what if prev is 1 and curr is 1? Then the steps are zero. So, for each consecutive task, we need to calculate the steps between the previous position and the current task's position, and add that to the total.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given in order. So for the list of a_i's, we need to process them in order, and for each a_i, compute the steps from the previous position (which is the previous a_i's position) to the current a_i's position. But wait, the previous position is not necessarily the previous a_i's position. Because, for example, if the previous task was at position x, and the current task is at y, then Xenia has to move from x to y. So the initial position is 1. Then, for the first task, she moves from 1 to a_1. Then, for the second task, she moves from a_1 to a_2, etc. So the total time is the sum of the steps between consecutive positions, including the first step from 1 to a_1.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nFor each task in the list a:\n\n    steps = (current_position - task) % n ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the steps needed to move from current_position to task's position. Let me think again. If current_position is prev, and the next is curr, then steps is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Which is equivalent to (curr - prev) % n if the modulo is computed correctly. Wait, no. Because (curr - prev) could be negative. For example, prev is 3, curr is 2, n is 4. (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So steps is (curr - prev) % n. But in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So yes, that formula would work.\n\nWait, but for prev = 1, curr = 3, n =4. (3-1) is 2, mod 4 is 2. Correct. So steps is 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the formula for steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) % n.\n\nBut wait, what if the prev is 3 and curr is 3? Then steps is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each ai in the list of tasks:\n\n    steps = (ai - current_position) % n\n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current_position = ai\n\nSo, for the first example:\n\nn=4, m=3, tasks [3,2,3]\n\nInitial current_position is 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: steps is (3-1) mod 4 = 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3. total is 2+3=5. current is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total is 5+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example given is input 4 3, tasks [2,3,3]. Output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: steps is (2-1) mod 4 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: steps 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo that seems to work. So the approach is to iterate through the list of tasks, and for each, compute the steps from the previous position to the current task's position, add to the total, and update the current position.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then the steps between them is zero. So the code handles that correctly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's (m elements).\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nLoop through each a in the list:\n\n   compute steps = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n   add steps to total_time.\n\n   set current_pos to a.\n\nFinally, print total_time.\n\nBut wait, why is that correct? Because each time, we are moving from the previous position to the current a_i, and the steps are calculated correctly.\n\nYes. So that's the approach.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All tasks are in the same house. For example, n=5, m=3, tasks [1,1,1]. Then total steps is (1-1) + (1-1) + (1-1) = 0. Which is correct.\n\nCase 2: Tasks require moving around the circle multiple times.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, tasks [1,2]. Steps: first from 1 to 1 (steps 0), then from 1 to 2: (2-1) mod 2 = 1. Total is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, tasks [2,1]. Steps: first from 1 to 2: (2-1) mod 2 = 1. Then from 2 to 1: (1-2) mod 2 = -1 mod 2 = 1. Total is 1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the input.\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line has n and m. The second line has m integers.\n\nIn Python, we can read the input as:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the list a has exactly m elements.\n\nOnce we have that, process as per the algorithm.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what about when n is 1? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 2. Because the first line says 2 ≤ n ≤ 1e5. So no problem.\n\nTesting the first example:\n\nInput is 4 3, and the list is [3,2,3].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nFirst num is 3: (3-1) mod 4 = 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond num is 2: (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod 4 = 3. total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total is 6. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input 4 3, [2,3,3]. The steps are:\n\ncurrent =1.\n\nFirst num 2: (2-1) mod4=1. total 1. current 2.\n\nSecond num 3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. total 2. current 3.\n\nThird num 3: 0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo the Python code would be straightforward.\n\nNow, what about the data types? Since n and m can be up to 1e5, and each step is O(1), the code will run in O(m) time, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current = 1, total = 0.\n\nLoop over each element in a:\n\n   compute (num - current) % n, add to total.\n\n   update current.\n\nPrint total.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test some other cases.\n\nAnother example: n=5, m=2, tasks [5, 1]. So starting at 1.\n\nFirst step: 5 -1 =4 mod5 is 4. total is 4. current is 5.\n\nNext step: 1 -5 = -4 mod5 is 1. So total is 4+1=5. Which is correct. Because moving from 5 to 1 is one step (clockwise, 5→1).\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, tasks [1,5]. First step is 0 (current is 1, num is 1). Then steps from 1 to 5: (5-1) mod5 =4. So total is 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the code should be written as follows.\n",
