The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Xenia moving around a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement. But how?\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are at 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise, that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Time taken is 2.\n- Then, the second task is at 2. But since she's currently at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around. From 3 to 4 (1 step), then 4 to 1 (another), then 1 to 2 (another). That's 3 steps. So total time now is 2 + 3 = 5?\nWait, but the example says the total is 6. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the example again. The example says the total steps are 6. Let me recount:\n\nThe sequence is 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. Let's count the steps between each move:\n\n- From 1 to 2: 1 step (time 1)\n- 2 to 3: 1 step (total 2)\n- 3 to 4: 1 (total 3)\n- 4 to 1: 1 (total 4)\n- 1 to 2: 1 (total 5)\n- 2 to 3: 1 (total 6). Oh right! So the total is 6 steps. But how does that relate to the tasks?\n\nWait, the first task is at 3. So Xenia starts at 1, moves to 3. That's two steps. Then the second task is at 2. So from 3 to 2: moving clockwise, which is 3 → 4 → 1 → 2. That's 3 steps. Then the third task is at 3 again. From 2 to 3 is one step. So total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Oh right. So the total steps are the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks, considering that each movement is clockwise.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks, where each distance is the minimal steps needed to move clockwise from the current position to the next task's house.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose Xenia is currently at position current. The next task is at position next. How much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the movement is clockwise, the distance is (next - current) mod n if next is greater than current. Wait, no. Wait, for example, if current is 3 and next is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - current + next) steps? Let me see. For example, n=4, current=3, next=2. The steps are 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Which is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4? Well, (2 - 3) is -1, adding 4 gives 3. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between current and next (when moving clockwise) is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Or equivalently, (next - current) % n if the mod is handled properly. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator can return negative results. Wait, no. Let me think. If next is less than current, then (next - current) is negative. Adding n to that would give the correct positive steps. So the formula is (next - current) if next >= current else (next - current + n). Alternatively, (next - current + n) % n. Because for example, when next is 2 and current is 3, (2-3 +4) = 3, which is correct. For next=3 and current=2, (3-2) =1, which is correct. So the distance between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which can be written as (next - current + n) % n. Because if next >= current, then (next - current) is positive, and adding n and mod by n would give the same value. For example, if next is 3, current is 2, (3-2 +4) mod 4 is (1 +4) mod4 = 5 mod4=1. Which is correct. So yes, the formula is (next - current + n) % n.\n\nWait, but in the case where next is current, the distance is zero. Which is correct. So for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute this distance and sum them all.\n\nBut what about the initial position? Xenia starts at house 1. So the first task's position is a_1. So the first movement is from 1 to a_1. Then from a_1 to a_2, etc.\n\nBut the problem says that the tasks must be done in order. So for the list of tasks a_1, a_2, ..., a_m, Xenia must do them in order. So the total time is the sum of the distances between consecutive positions, starting from 1, then a_1, then a_2, etc.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first task is a_1. So Xenia starts at 1. She must move to a_1. Then, from a_1 to a_2. Then from a_2 to a_3, etc. So the total time is the sum of the distances from 1 to a_1, plus the distance from a_1 to a_2, plus the distance from a_2 to a_3, etc.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize current = 1.\n\nFor each task in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m:\n\n   add the distance from current to a_i (using the formula above)\n\n   set current = a_i\n\nSo the total sum is the answer.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple tasks in the same house? Like, if a_i and a_{i+1} are the same. Then the distance between them is zero. So that's handled automatically.\n\nSo the problem reduces to processing the list of a_i's, and for each consecutive pair (including the initial position 1 and the first a_1), compute the distance and accumulate the sum.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward. Now, the challenge is to process this efficiently, given that n and m can be up to 1e5, which is manageable in O(m) time.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput is n=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent = 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Distance from 1 to 3: (3-1) = 2. Sum is 2.\n\ncurrent is now 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Distance from 3 to 2: (2 -3 +4) = 3. Sum is 2+3=5.\n\ncurrent is now 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Distance from 2 to 3: 1. Sum is 5+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nSecond example input is 4 3, a is [2,3,3].\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent = 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: distance is 1. Sum is 1.\n\ncurrent is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: distance is 1. Sum is 2.\n\ncurrent is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: distance is 0. Sum remains 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase 1: All tasks are in the same house. For example, n=5, m=3, a = [1,1,1]. The sum would be (distance from 1 to 1) + (distance from 1 to 1) + (distance from 1 to 1) = 0 + 0 + 0 = 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when moving around the ring multiple times.\n\nFor example, n=2, m=2, a = [1,2]. The steps are:\n\ncurrent starts at 1. First task is 1: distance is 0. Then from 1 to 2: distance is 1. Total is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=3, a = [2,1,2]. The steps:\n\nstart at 1. First task is 2: distance is 1 (since 2-1=1). current is 2. Second task is 1: distance is (1-2 + 2) = 1. sum is 2. Then from 1 to 2: distance 1. sum is 3. So total is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the approach is solid.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nWe need to read n and m, then the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current = 1.\n\nsum_time = 0.\n\nfor each ai in the list:\n\n   compute the distance between current and ai.\n\n   add to sum_time.\n\n   current = ai.\n\nreturn sum_time.\n\nBut how to compute the distance?\n\nIn Python, for each pair (current, ai):\n\ndistance = (ai - current) % n if (ai - current) % n != 0 else 0 ?\n\nWait, no. Because (ai - current) could be negative. Let me think. For example, if ai is 2 and current is 3, n=4. Then (ai - current) is -1. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So (ai - current + n) % n would give the correct value. But in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So for example, (-1) % 4 is 3. So the formula can be written as (ai - current) % n.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\ncurrent = 3, ai = 2. (ai - current) = -1. -1 % 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\ncurrent = 2, ai = 3. (3-2) =1. 1%4=1. Correct.\n\ncurrent = 1, ai = 1. (1-1) =0. 0%4=0. Correct.\n\nSo the distance is (ai - current) % n.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, when current is 1 and ai is 3, (3-1) is 2 mod 4 is 2. Correct. So yes, the formula is (ai - current) % n.\n\nBut wait, what if ai is 1 and current is 3, n=4. Then (1-3) is -2. mod 4 is 2. Which is correct (3 →4 →1: 2 steps). So yes.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nsum_time = 0\n\ncurrent = 1\n\nfor ai in a_list:\n\n    delta = (ai - current) % n\n\n    sum_time += delta\n\n    current = ai\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nBut wait, let me check the second example:\n\nSample input 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2. (2-1) mod 4 is 1. sum is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: (3-2) mod4=1. sum is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-3) mod4=0. sum remains 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. The sum is:\n\ncurrent=1, first ai=2: (2-1) mod2=1. sum=1. current=2.\n\nsecond ai=1: (1-2) mod2= -1 mod2= 1. sum is 2. Which is correct. Because moving from 2 to 1 is one step (clockwise: 2→1? Wait, no. Wait, the houses are arranged in a circle. For n=2, the houses are 1 and 2. Moving clockwise from 2, the next house is 1. So moving from 2 to 1 is 1 step. So the code correctly adds 1. So the total is 1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nRead the input:\n\nFirst line is n and m.\n\nSecond line is m integers.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is given as two lines. The first line has n and m. The second line has m integers.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is given as two separate examples, but perhaps that's part of the problem description. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user provided an example input as ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3'] and outputs ['6', '2'].\n\nWait, but that's probably a mistake. Because the actual problem says that the input is one case. Maybe the user intended to show two test cases, but the actual problem is for a single test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is two lines. So the code should read two lines: first line is n and m, second line is m integers.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, split into n and m, then the list of a's.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m. Then read the second line as list of integers.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading from stdin, the input may have leading or trailing spaces. So splitting on whitespace is safe.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na_list = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor ai in a_list:\n\n    delta = (ai - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = ai\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check for the first example. The first example's a_list is [3,2,3]. The code would process:\n\ncurrent = 1.\n\nai=3: (3-1) mod4 = 2. total is 2. current becomes 3.\n\nai=2: (2-3) mod4 = (-1) mod4 = 3. total is 5. current becomes 2.\n\nai=3: (3-2) mod4=1. total is 6. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code works.\n\nAnother test case: the second example's a_list is [2,3,3]. The code:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nai=2: (2-1) mod4=1. total=1. current=2.\n\nai=3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. total=2. current=3.\n\nai=3: (3-3)=0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. The code would compute:\n\ncurrent=1. ai=2: (2-1) mod2=1. total=1. current=2.\n\nai=1: (1-2) mod2= -1 mod2= 1. total=2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about when the list is empty? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. Because the input says 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nNow, what about when the list has multiple same elements?\n\nLike n=5, m=3, a=[1,1,1]. The code would process:\n\ncurrent=1. first ai=1: (1-1) mod5=0. total 0. current=1. Then next ai=1: same. total remains 0. Then again. So total is 0. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, a=[3, 5]. So current starts at 1.\n\nFirst step: 3-1=2 mod5=2. total is 2. current=3.\n\nSecond step: 5-3=2 mod5=2. total is 4. So total time is 4. Which is correct: moving from 3 to 5 is 2 steps (3→4→5).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nThus, the Python code is as described.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the time required to move between consecutive tasks in a clockwise direction.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes one unit of time.\n2. **Circular Movement**: Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise from a house to another might involve wrapping around the end of the list. The distance between two houses can be computed using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the next task's house using the formula `(next_house - current_house) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses. This formula ensures that we correctly handle both direct and wrap-around movements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a_list = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    \n    for ai in a_list:\n        delta = (ai - current) % n\n        total += delta\n        current = ai\n    \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line contains the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line contains the list of house numbers where each task needs to be completed.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1, and initialize the total time to 0.\n3. **Iterating Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current house to the task's house using modulo arithmetic to handle circular movement. Update the total time and adjust the current position to the task's house after each move.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the accumulated total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that each movement is calculated efficiently in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(m), which is optimal given the constraints.",
