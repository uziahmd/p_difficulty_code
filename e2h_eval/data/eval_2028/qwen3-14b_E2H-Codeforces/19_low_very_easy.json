The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the districts with the highest possible values of 2^i, which are the ones with higher indices. Because 2^i grows exponentially. So ideally, we want to keep the districts with the largest numbers possible. But there's a catch: the districts must form a connected component. So even if we want to keep district n, we have to make sure that it's connected to the others.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure connectivity? Let me think. The tree structure is given. So the districts form a tree. We need to select a connected subtree (since the districts must be connected) with (n - k) nodes, and maximize the sum of 2^i for those nodes.\n\nBut since 2^i increases with i, the optimal strategy would be to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, while ensuring they are connected. However, the problem is that if we just take the top (n -k) districts, they might not be connected. So how can we find which ones to remove?\n\nAn alternative approach: think of the problem as choosing which nodes to keep. The best way is to keep the nodes with the highest possible numbers, but ensuring they form a connected subtree.\n\nSo perhaps the solution is to start from the highest-numbered node and perform some kind of traversal, selecting nodes that are connected to the current set. But how?\n\nWait, here's an idea. Since the tree is connected, and we need to keep a connected component. Let's think of the problem as selecting the nodes to keep. The maximum sum will be achieved by keeping the nodes with the largest numbers possible, but connected. So perhaps we can model this as a priority-based selection where we greedily select the largest nodes first, but ensure that they are connected.\n\nBut how to do that? One possible way is to consider that the optimal set will include the node with the highest number, and then include as many high-numbered nodes as possible connected to it.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as building a tree where we want to keep the nodes with the highest values. So, perhaps the optimal solution is to keep the nodes with the largest numbers, but if they are not connected, we have to remove some lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to efficiently compute which nodes to remove?\n\nAnother thought: since the sum is based on the node numbers, the optimal solution is to keep the nodes with the largest possible numbers. So the problem reduces to finding a connected subtree of size (n -k) that contains as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nLet me think of the example given. For the first sample input, n=6, k=3. So we need to keep 3 districts. The sample output is removing 1,3,4. The kept districts are 2,5,6. Their sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. But why not keep 5,6, and 2? Well, because that's exactly what they did. But why not keep 6,5, and 4? Because 4 is not connected to 6? Let me check the tree structure.\n\nThe input for the first sample is:\n\n6 3\n\nEdges:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3\n\nSo the tree structure is like:\n\nDistrict 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. District 6 is connected to 5. So the tree looks like:\n\n2 is the central node connected to 1, 3, 4, 6. 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo if we want to keep 5,6, and 4, then 4 is connected to 2, but 2 is not in the kept set. So 4 and 6 are not connected. So that's not allowed. Hence, the kept districts must be connected. So the best is to keep the nodes that are connected through the highest possible nodes.\n\nSo the idea is to start with the highest-numbered node (say, 6) and then include as many high-numbered nodes as possible that are connected to it. But how?\n\nAnother approach: since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible numbers, the optimal solution is to keep the nodes with the largest numbers, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. Therefore, the problem reduces to selecting the (n -k) nodes with the highest numbers, but ensuring they are connected. If they are not connected, we need to remove some lower-numbered nodes to make",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. The districts are connected in a tree structure, and the number of fans for a district $i$ is $2^i$. Therefore, we aim to keep the districts with the highest indices while ensuring they remain connected.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, so there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since $2^i$ grows exponentially, we prioritize keeping districts with higher indices.\n3. **Connected Component**: We need to ensure that the remaining districts form a connected component. This can be achieved by starting from the highest index and traversing the tree to include as many high-index districts as possible while maintaining connectivity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    # We want to keep the largest (n - k) nodes, but connected.\n    # Start from the largest node and do a BFS or DFS to collect as many high nodes as possible.\n    # The idea is to select the largest nodes, and then check if they are connected.\n    # However, since the tree is connected, we can greedily select the largest nodes, but need to ensure connectivity.\n    # Another approach: think of it as building a subtree starting from the largest node and including all possible larger nodes.\n    \n    # The optimal strategy is to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, but we need to ensure they are connected.\n    # To do this, we can start from the largest node and perform a traversal, collecting nodes in decreasing order.\n    # The nodes to keep will be those with the highest numbers that are connected to the largest node.\n    \n    # So we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the largest node, and collect the nodes in order of their value.\n    # Then, we take the first (n -k) nodes from this list, and remove the rest.\n    \n    # Let's do a DFS starting from node n, and collect all nodes in a list sorted in descending order.\n    # But since the tree is undirected, we need to track visited nodes.\n    \n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    result = []\n    \n    def dfs(u):\n        visited[u] = True\n        result.append(u)\n        for v in edges[u]:\n            if not visited[v]:\n                dfs(v)\n    \n    dfs(n)\n    # Now, result contains all nodes in the tree in the order of traversal starting from n.\n    # However, the order might not be sorted in descending order.

We need to collect all nodes, then sort them in descending order.\n    # Then, we take the first (n -k) nodes, and remove the rest.\n    \n    # Wait, no. Because the traversal from n may not collect all nodes. For example, if the tree is like 1-2-3-4-5-6, and we start at 6, then we get all nodes. But if the tree is more complex, the traversal would collect all nodes. But since it's a tree, any traversal from a node will collect all nodes.\n    # So, after the traversal, we have all nodes in the list. But the order is arbitrary. So we need to sort them in descending order, then pick the first (n -k) nodes.\n    # But wait, the problem is that even if we sort them, the nodes may not be connected. However, since the entire tree is connected, the nodes we collect in the traversal are all connected. So if we sort all nodes in descending order, the first (n -k) nodes will be the ones with the highest values, and since the entire tree is connected, they are connected through the tree structure. Wait, no. If we take the top (n -k) nodes, they may not be connected. For example, if the tree is a chain 1-2-3-4-5-6, and we need to remove k=3, then the top 3 nodes are 6,5,4. These are connected. But if the tree is different, say, 6 connected to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Then taking 6,5,4 is connected. So maybe the approach is to collect all nodes, sort them in descending order, and then take the first (n -k) nodes. Then the districts to remove are the rest, sorted in increasing order.\n\n    # Wait, but how can we be sure that the first (n -k) nodes in the sorted list are connected? Because they may not be. For example, suppose the tree is like this: node 6 is connected to node 1, and node 5 is connected to node 1. Then, if we sort all nodes as 6,5,4,3,2,1. Suppose we need to take 4 nodes. The first four are 6,5,4,3. But 6 and 5 are connected through 1, but 4 and 3 are not connected to 6 or 5 unless there's a path. So this approach would be wrong.\n\n    # Therefore, the previous idea is incorrect. So what's the correct way?\n\n    # The correct approach is to find the subtree that contains the highest possible nodes and is connected. One way to do this is to start from the highest node and perform a traversal, collecting nodes in order of their value. However, we need to prioritize keeping higher-numbered nodes.\n\n    # Here's a better approach:\n    # 1. Start with the highest-numbered node (n).\n    # 2. Use a priority queue (max-heap) to process nodes in order of their value. For each node, add its neighbors to the heap if not already processed.\n    # 3. This ensures that we collect the highest-numbered nodes first, ensuring connectivity.\n\n    # However, since we need to collect exactly (n -k) nodes, we can use a greedy approach where we always keep the highest possible nodes, ensuring connectivity.\n\n    # Another idea: the optimal set of nodes is the set of (n -k) nodes with the highest indices that form a connected subtree. To find this, we can perform a BFS/DFS starting from the highest node and collect nodes in order of their value, but only keep the necessary nodes to maintain connectivity.\n\n    # But how to do that?

Since the sum of 2^i is maximized by keeping the largest nodes, the optimal solution is to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, provided they are connected. If they are not connected, we need to include some smaller nodes to connect them. However, this seems complex.\n\n    # However, considering the structure of the tree, the following approach can be used:\n    # - The optimal set must include the node with the highest index (n). Otherwise, we could replace any node in the set with n to get a higher sum.\n    # - Then, recursively include the next highest nodes that are connected to the current set.\n\n    # Therefore, the approach is to build a subtree starting from the highest node and greedily include the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\n    # To implement this, we can use a priority queue (max-heap) that stores nodes based on their value. We start with node n, and then add its neighbors to the heap. We keep track of visited nodes. We continue this process until we have collected (n -k) nodes.\n\n    # However, the problem is that this approach may not work because the order in which we add nodes affects the selection. For example, adding a lower-numbered node early might prevent us from adding higher-numbered nodes later.\n\n    # Alternatively, here's a correct approach:\n    # We need to select (n -k) nodes. To maximize the sum, we want to select the largest (n -k) nodes, but they must be connected. So the problem reduces to selecting the largest (n -k) nodes that form a connected subtree.

Once we have collected (n -k) nodes, we stop.\n\n    # However, this requires that during the traversal, we prioritize visiting higher-numbered nodes first.

Then pop 2 (next highest), add its neighbors (1,6,4,3). Now the selected nodes are 6,5,2. Total of 3 nodes. So the kept nodes are 6,5,2. Which matches the sample output (removing 1,3,4).

The nodes not collected are the ones to be removed.\n\n    # Now, implementing this in Python:\n\n    import heapq\n\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    heap = []\n    heapq.heappush(heap, -n)  # using max-heap via negation\n    selected = []\n\n    while len(selected) < (n - k):\n        current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if visited[current]:\n            continue\n        visited[current] = True\n        selected.append(current)\n        for neighbor in edges[current]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\n    # Now, the nodes not in selected are to be removed.\n    to_remove = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            to_remove.append(i)\n    to_remove.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, to_remove)))\n\n# Run the main function\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()",
