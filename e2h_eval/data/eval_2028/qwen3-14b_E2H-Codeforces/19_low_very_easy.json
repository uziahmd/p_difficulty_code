The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts to remove in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is that the sum of 2^i is maximized. Since each district's value is 2^i, which grows exponentially with i, we want to keep as many higher-numbered districts as possible. Because higher i means larger values. So the priority is to keep the largest possible districts, but ensuring that they are all connected.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that the remaining districts are connected? Because if we just take the top (n -k) districts, they might not be connected. So the challenge is to select a subset of (n -k) districts that form a connected subtree, and which includes as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nBut how to approach this?\n\nLet me think. Since the districts form a tree (since there's exactly one path between every pair), we need to find a connected subtree with (n -k) nodes, such that the sum of 2^i is maximum. But since the sum is maximized by keeping the highest possible i's, perhaps the optimal strategy is to keep the highest possible nodes, but ensuring that they form a connected component.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAn idea: Let's consider that the highest-numbered districts are the most valuable. So we need to include as many of them as possible. However, they might not be connected. So maybe we need to find a way to select the highest nodes, and then connect them through lower-numbered nodes, but those lower ones would be the ones we remove.\n\nWait, but since the problem requires us to remove exactly k districts, and the remaining must be connected, perhaps we can model this as choosing a subtree of size (n -k), and we want to maximize the sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes kept, which are the ones not removed.\n\nBut how to choose which nodes to keep?\n\nAnother thought: Since the value of each node is 2^i, which is exponentially increasing, the optimal solution will include the largest (n -k) nodes, provided that they form a connected subtree. However, if they don't, we need to replace some lower nodes with higher ones that can connect them.\n\nWait, but maybe the optimal way is to select all nodes except for the smallest k nodes. But that's only possible if those nodes are not part of the connected component. But that's not necessarily the case.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: To maximize the sum, we want to keep the districts with the highest possible numbers. However, the districts must form a connected subtree. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, and remove the lower-numbered ones that are not necessary for connectivity.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is to start with the largest districts and build a subtree, making sure that it's connected. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by Krusky's algorithm. Let's think of the tree as a graph where each node has a weight of 2^i. We need to select a connected subtree with exactly (n -k) nodes, with maximum total weight. Since the weights are so large, the optimal solution would be to include the highest possible nodes. But how?\n\nAnother approach: The problem is equivalent to finding the maximum weight connected subtree with exactly (n -k) nodes. Since the weight is 2^i, which is strictly increasing with i, the maximum sum is achieved by including the (n -k) largest possible nodes, but ensuring they are connected.\n\nBut how to ensure that? Well, the largest (n -k) nodes are numbered from (k+1) to n. But are they connected? Probably not. So we need to find the minimal set of nodes (from the lower ones) to include so that the entire set is connected.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to include?\n\nWait, here's a different angle. Suppose we want to keep the districts with numbers from (some set S), which has size (n -k). To maximize the sum, S should contain as many high-numbered districts as possible. So perhaps the optimal S is the set of all districts except for the k smallest ones, but adjusted to ensure connectivity.\n\nWait, but the problem is that if you remove the k smallest districts, the remaining districts may not be connected. So we need to find a way to remove k districts such that the remaining is connected, and the removed districts are the ones with the smallest numbers possible (so that the kept ones are the largest possible).\n\nBut how to determine which districts to remove?\n\nLet me think of the example given. In the first sample input, n=6, k=3.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans (sum of $2^i$ for each district) is maximized. The key insight here is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we should prioritize keeping them while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximize Fans**: Since the fan count for district $i$ is $2^i$, we want to keep the highest-numbered districts possible.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the remaining districts after removal form a connected subtree. This can be achieved by starting from the highest-numbered district and performing a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to include as many high-numbered districts as possible, while marking the districts that are not included for removal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    tree = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        tree[a].append(b)\n        tree[b].append(a)\n    \n    # We need to keep (n - k) districts, which are the largest possible.\n    # Start from the highest node and perform BFS/DFS to collect as many high nodes as possible.\n    # The ones not collected will be the ones to remove.\n\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    keep = [False] * (n + 1)\n    to_remove = []\n\n    def dfs(u, parent):\n        visited[u] = True\n        keep[u] = True\n        count = 1\n        for v in tree[u]:\n            if v == parent:\n                continue\n            if not visited[v]:\n                child_count = dfs(v, u)\n                count += child_count\n        return count\n\n    # Start from the highest node, which is n\n    # But we need to collect (n - k) nodes\n    # So we need to find a subtree of size (n -k), starting from the highest possible\n    # Let's try to collect as many high-numbered nodes as possible\n\n    # First, mark all nodes as not kept\n    keep = [False] * (n + 1)\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n\n    # We will start from the highest node and do a DFS, but only keep nodes until we have (n -k) nodes\n    # However, since the tree is connected, we need to select a subtree with maximum possible high nodes\n    # The optimal way is to start from the highest node and greedily include as many high nodes as possible\n\n    # To do this, we can use a priority queue approach, but here's an efficient way:\n\n    # We will perform a DFS starting from node n, and collect nodes in a way that prioritizes higher numbers\n    # But since the tree is connected, the first (n -k) nodes we can collect starting from the highest node will be the optimal ones\n\n    # However, this might not be sufficient.
