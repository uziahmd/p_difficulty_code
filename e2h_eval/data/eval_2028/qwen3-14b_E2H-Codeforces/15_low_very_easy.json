They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find all the winning integers x for a playoff tournament based on the given string s. The problem says that each phase of the tournament has certain rules: in phase i (starting from 1?), if s_i is 0, the lower skill level team wins; if it's 1, the higher one wins. And I have to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament works. For example, when n=3, there are 8 teams. The tournament has 3 phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. The first phase has 4 games, then 2, then 1.\n\nThe key here is to model the tournament structure and determine for each possible x, whether it's possible for x to be the winner given the rules of each phase.\n\nBut how do I model this? Since the permutation p is arbitrary except that it's a permutation of 1..2^n, but the tournament's outcome depends on the rules of each phase. Wait, but the problem says that we can choose any permutation p as long as the tournament results in x being the champion. So for x to be a winning integer, there must exist some arrangement of the teams in the bracket such that, following the rules of each phase, x comes out as the winner.\n\nSo the approach is to find for each x, whether there's a way to arrange the teams such that x can win through each round according to the rules.\n\nBut how do I model the rounds? Let's think recursively. Each round is a series of matches. For example, in the first round (phase 1), each match is between two teams. The winner is determined by the rule of phase 1. Then, in the next phase (phase 2), the winners of the first phase are paired again, and so on.\n\nThe challenge is to find for each x, what's the minimal or maximal required skill level in each round.\n\nWait, perhaps for each round, depending on the rule (0 or 1), the x needs to be either the maximum or minimum in its bracket. But since the permutation can be arranged, maybe we can model the possible ranges of x's value in each round.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a binary tree. Each node represents a match. The leaves are the initial teams. Each internal node represents a match between the winners of its two children. The root is the final champion.\n\nBut how to model the constraints for x to reach the root.\n\nLet me think for each round. Let's say that during phase i (the i-th phase, which is the i-th level of the tournament tree). For example, phase 1 is the first round, phase 2 is the second, etc.\n\nIn each phase, the matches are determined by the previous winners. For x to be the champion, it must win all phases. So for each phase, depending on the rule (0 or 1), x must be the minimum or maximum in its current bracket.\n\nBut how to model the brackets? Because the structure of the tournament is fixed. For example, in the first phase, the teams are paired as (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), etc. But the permutation p can arrange the teams in any order. Wait, no. Wait, the initial arrangement of the teams in the bracket is part of the permutation. Wait, the problem says that the permutation p is given, but we can choose any permutation. So the initial positions of the teams in the bracket can be arranged as needed. But the structure of the bracket is fixed: for example, in the first round, the first two teams are paired, then the next two, etc. But the actual teams in those positions can be chosen as per the permutation.\n\nSo the idea is that we can arrange the teams in the bracket such that x can win each round according to the rules of the phases.\n\nSo for x to be the champion, in each phase, during that phase's matches, x must be able to win according to the rule of that phase. But how?\n\nLet me think recursively. For each round (phase), the number of teams is halved. Let's consider the tournament as a binary tree. For x to be the champion, in each round, it must be the winner of its match. The way it's structured depends on the rules of each phase.\n\nLet me consider the phases in order. For example, phase 1 (the first round) has the rule s[0] (assuming 0-based index). Then phase 2 has s[1], etc.\n\nLet me think about the required conditions for x to be the winner.\n\nLet's think for each phase i (from 1 to n). In phase i, there are 2^{n - i} games. Each game is between two teams that have advanced from the previous rounds.\n\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which integers can be the winning team in a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase. The tournament structure is such that each phase halves the number of teams until only one champion remains. The rules for each phase dictate whether the team with the higher or lower skill level wins each match.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured as a binary tree where each round halves the number of teams. For `n` rounds, there are `2^n` teams initially.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase (from 1 to n) has a rule (either '0' for lower skill level winning or '1' for higher skill level winning).\n3. **Determine Winning Ranges**: For each integer `x` to be a potential winner, it must be possible for `x` to win all matches according to the rules of each phase. This involves determining the minimum and maximum possible values `x` can have at each phase based on the rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    # For each x in 1..2^n, determine if it can be the champion\n    # We need to find the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have in each round\n    # Based on the rules in s\n    \n    size = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    \n    # For each x, determine if it can be the champion\n    result = []\n    \n    for x in range(1, size + 1):\n        min_val = 1\n        max_val = size\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(n):\n            # phase i+1 (0-based in s)\n            rule = s[i]\n            # In this phase, the number of rounds is 2^{n - (i+1)} games\n            # For x to pass this phase, depending on the rule, it must be min or max in its group\n            # The group size doubles each round towards the root\n            # So for each phase i (starting from 0), the group size is 2^{i+1}\n            # So the number of teams in the group that x is in is 2^{i+1}\n            # So the required min and max for x depends on the rule\n            if rule == '0':\n                # x must be the minimum in its group of size 2^(i+1)\n                # So the max_val for x is the current max_val, but the min_val is x's value\n                # Wait, no.

Thus, the maximum possible value of x is the current max_val, and the minimum possible is the current min_val.\n                # Wait, perhaps we can track the minimal and maximal possible value that x can have to satisfy the constraints up to phase i.\n                # Initially, min_val = 1, max_val = 2^n\n                # For each phase i (starting from 0), we adjust min and max based on the rule.\n                # For example, if the rule is '0', then in this phase, x must be the minimum in a group of size 2^{i+1}, so there must be (2^{i+1} - 1) teams with higher values than x. Therefore, the maximum possible value of x is such that there are enough higher values available.
