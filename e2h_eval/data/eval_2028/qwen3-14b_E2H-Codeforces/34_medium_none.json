And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. For each consecutive k-day period, I need to compute the average and then find the overall average of all those averages.\n\nHmm. Wait, the problem says that the answer is the sum of all the weeks' averages divided by the number of weeks. Or wait, no. Wait, the example note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. Oh right, because each week's average is (sum of k days)/k. Then the overall average is the sum of all those averages divided by the number of weeks. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that Polycarp is going to consider each week's average and then take the average of all those. So for example, if there are m weeks, each with average s_i, then the final answer is (sum of s_i) / m.\n\nBut wait, each s_i is (sum of a_i for that week) divided by k. So the total sum of s_i is (sum of all the weekly sums) divided by k. Then dividing by m gives (sum of all weekly sums) / (k * m). But m is (n -k +1). So maybe there's a way to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut how do I compute the sum of all the weekly sums? Because each week is a consecutive k days. So for example, the first week is days 1..k, the next is 2..k+1, etc. So the sum of all these weekly sums is equal to the sum of each a_i multiplied by the number of weeks it's included in. For example, each a_i is part of some number of weeks. For instance, the first element is only in the first week. The second element is in the first and second week. Wait, no. Let me think. For a given day i, how many weeks include it?\n\nThe number of weeks that include a_i is equal to the number of weeks that start at positions from max(1, i -k +1) to min(i, n -k +1). Wait, perhaps another approach. For a day at position i (starting from 1), the earliest week that includes it is the week starting at position (i -k +1) if that's >=1. Wait, no. Let me think. Each week starts at position s, and ends at s +k -1. So for a given day i, the weeks that include it are those where s ≤ i ≤ s +k -1. Which can be rewritten as s ≤ i and s ≥ i -k +1. Also, since the week has to be within the array, s can be from 1 to n -k +1. So the valid s's are from max(1, i -k +1) to min(n -k +1, i). Wait, but s must be such that s +k -1 <=n. So for s, the maximum is n -k +1. So for day i, the number of weeks that include it is the number of possible s's such that s ≤ i and s +k -1 >=i. Which simplifies to s ranges from s_min to s_max, where s_min is max(1, i -k +1) and s_max is min(n -k +1, i). Wait, maybe there's a simpler formula. For example, the first day (i=1) can be included in exactly 1 week (the first week). The second day can be in 2 weeks if k is large enough. Wait, for example, if n=3, k=2. Then the weeks are [1-2], [2-3]. So day 2 is in both weeks. So for i=2, the number of weeks it's included in is 2. Similarly, for day i, the number of weeks that include it is min(i, n -k +1) - max(1, i -k +1) + 1? Or perhaps there's a formula that for each day i, the number of weeks that include it is equal to the number of possible starting positions s such that s <= i and s +k -1 >=i. Which is equivalent to s <=i and s >= i -k +1. But s also must be >=1 and <=n -k +1. So the number of weeks that include a_i is the number of s's in the range [max(1, i -k +1), min(n -k +1, i)].\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, the number of weeks that include a_i is equal to the number of weeks that start at s where s ranges from (i -k +1) to i, but adjusted to fit within the valid s range. Wait, but for a_i to be included in a week starting at s, the week must start at s such that s ≤ i ≤ s +k -1 → s ≤ i and s ≥ i -k +1. So the possible s's are from s_start = max(1, i -k +1) to s_end = min(n -k +1, i). The number of such s's is s_end - s_start +1. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, considering that each a_i is in exactly (number of weeks) that is equal to the number of weeks that can start before or at i, and end after or at i. For example, for a_i, the earliest week that includes it is when the week starts at s = max(1, i -k +1). The latest week that includes it is when the week starts at s = min(n -k +1, i). But how many weeks is that?\n\nAlternatively, for each day i, the number of weeks that include it is:\n\nIf the day is in the first k-1 days, then the number of weeks that include it increases by 1 each day. For example, day 1 is in 1 week, day 2 is in 2 weeks, etc., up to day k, which is in k weeks. Wait, no. Wait, if n is large enough. Let me think. Suppose n is very large, and k is fixed. For day i, the earliest week that includes it is the week starting at s = i -k +1, but if that's less than 1, then s starts at 1. The latest week that includes it is the week starting at s = i. But that's only possible if s +k-1 <=n. So for example, if i is in the first k days, then the earliest week is 1, and the latest is i. So the number of weeks is i. But if i is in the middle of the array, then the number of weeks that include it is k. Wait, no. Let me think again. For example, if i is somewhere in the middle, such that there are enough days before and after. For example, n is large, k is 3. For i=5, the weeks that include it are the weeks starting at 3, 4, 5. Because:\n\nWeek starting at 3: days 3,4,5.\n\nWeek starting at 4: days 4,5,6.\n\nWeek starting at 5: days 5,6,7.\n\nSo for day 5, it's included in 3 weeks. Which is exactly k. So in general, for days i where i is between k and n -k +1, the number of weeks that include it is k. But for days near the edges, it's less.\n\nSo the number of weeks that include a_i is:\n\nmin(i, n -k +1) - max(1, i -k +1) + 1 ?\n\nWait, for example, when i is 1, then:\n\nmax(1, 1 -k +1) = max(1, 2 -k). Since k ≥1, 2 -k could be 1 (if k=1) or 0 (if k=2). So for i=1 and k=2, it's max(1, 1-2+1) = max(1, 0) = 1. And min(n-k+1, 1). Assuming n ≥k, then n -k +1 is ≥1. So min is 1. So the count is 1-1 +1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: i=2, k=2, n=3. Then:\n\nmax(1, 2-2+1)=max(1, 1)=1. min(3-2+1=2, 2) is 2. So 2-1 +1= 2. Which is correct, as in the first example.\n\nSo the formula is correct. So for each a_i, the number of weeks that include it is (s_end - s_start +1), where s_start = max(1, i -k +1), s_end = min(n -k +1, i).\n\nBut calculating this for each a_i might be computationally expensive if done naively. However, given that n can be up to 2e5, we need an O(n) solution.\n\nBut here's the thing: the total sum of all the weekly sums is the sum of all a_i multiplied by the number of weeks they are included in. So if I can compute for each a_i the count of weeks that include it, then multiply by a_i, sum all those, then divide by (k * m), where m is the number of weeks (m = n -k +1). Because each week's sum is summed once, and then divided by k for the average, then divided by m for the overall average. So total sum of averages is (sum of weekly sums) / k. Then divide by m to get the average of averages.\n\nSo the overall answer is (sum_{i=1}^n (a_i * c_i )) / (k * m), where c_i is the number of weeks that include a_i, and m = n -k +1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating for each a_i the value c_i, then sum all a_i * c_i, then divide by (k * m).\n\nSo how do I compute c_i for each i?\n\nLet me think about the formula for c_i. Let me denote m_weeks = n -k +1.\n\nFor each i, the number of weeks that include a_i is:\n\nc_i = min(i, m_weeks) - max(1, i -k +1) + 1 ?\n\nWait, no. Because the s_start is max(1, i -k +1) and s_end is min(m_weeks, i). Then c_i is s_end - s_start + 1.\n\nBut how can I compute that for each i?\n\nLet me think of i as ranging from 1 to n.\n\nLet me think about the possible ranges for i:\n\nCase 1: i is in the first (k-1) days. For example, i ≤k-1. Then, the earliest week that includes i is s=1 (since i -k +1 = i -k +1. For i ≤k-1, i -k +1 ≤0. So max(1, ...) is 1. The latest week that includes i is s=i. Because s can't be larger than i, since the week starts at s and includes day i. So s_end is min(m_weeks, i). But since m_weeks = n -k +1. If i is small, say i is in the first part of the array, then m_weeks is likely larger than i. So s_end is i. So c_i is i -1 +1 = i.\n\nWait, for example, i=2, k=3. Then s_start is max(1, 2 -3 +1) = max(1, 0) =1. s_end is min(m_weeks, 2). Assuming m_weeks is big enough (n is big enough), then s_end is 2. So c_i is 2-1 +1= 2. Which is correct. For example, for i=2, k=3, the weeks that include it are the ones starting at 1 (days 1,2,3) and 2 (days 2,3,4). So 2 weeks. Which matches c_i=2.\n\nCase 2: i is in the middle, such that i -k +1 ≥1 and i ≤ m_weeks. Then, s_start = i -k +1, s_end = i. So c_i is i - (i -k +1) +1 = k.\n\nWhich makes sense. For example, when i is in the middle, it's included in exactly k weeks.\n\nCase 3: i is in the last (k-1) days. For example, i ≥ (n -k +1) +k -1 - (k-1) ? Wait, perhaps more straightforwardly, when i is such that i -k +1 is larger than m_weeks. Wait, no. Let me think. For example, m_weeks = n -k +1. So for i, the latest possible week that includes it is s_end = min(m_weeks, i). But when i is large, like i = n, then the latest week that includes it is s_end = min(m_weeks, i) = m_weeks. Because s can't be larger than m_weeks. So for i in the last (k-1) days, the s_start is i -k +1. But i -k +1 may be larger than m_weeks? No. Because m_weeks = n -k +1. So for i = n, i -k +1 = n -k +1 = m_weeks. So s_start = m_weeks. s_end is min(m_weeks, i) = m_weeks. So c_i = 1. Which is correct. Because for i =n, it's included in exactly one week: the last week, which starts at s = m_weeks.\n\nSo putting this together, for each i, the c_i can be calculated as follows:\n\ns_start = max(1, i -k +1)\n\ns_end = min(m_weeks, i)\n\nc_i = s_end - s_start + 1\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently for all i?\n\nWell, for each i, compute s_start and s_end, then compute the difference.\n\nBut for n up to 2e5, this is O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem:\n\n1. Read n and k.\n\n2. Read the list a of n integers.\n\n3. Compute m_weeks = n -k +1.\n\n   If m_weeks is zero, but according to constraints, k ≤n, so m_weeks is at least 1.\n\n4. For each i from 1 to n (assuming 1-based index?), compute c_i as above.\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of numbers, which in Python is zero-based. So need to adjust for that. But the code can treat the array as 1-based for easier calculation.\n\nBut in code, it's easier to loop through the array elements, and for each element's index (0-based or 1-based?), compute the corresponding i.\n\nLet me think: in code, the array is 0-based. So for the ith element (0-based), the actual day is i+1. So for example, for i in 0..n-1, the day is i+1.\n\nSo for each element in the array, the day number is i+1.\n\nSo for each element, compute:\n\nday = i+1\n\ns_start = max(1, day -k +1)\n\ns_end = min(m_weeks, day)\n\nc_i = s_end - s_start +1\n\nThen, multiply a[i] by c_i, sum all these, then divide by (k * m_weeks).\n\nYes.\n\nOnce that sum is computed, the answer is total_sum / (k * m_weeks).\n\nBut let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput: 3 2\n\na = [3,4,7]\n\nm_weeks = 3 -2 +1 = 2.\n\nFor each element:\n\ni=0, day=1.\n\ns_start = max(1, 1 -2 +1) = max(1, 0) =1.\n\ns_end = min(2, 1) =1.\n\nc_i =1-1+1=1.\n\ncontribution: 3 *1 =3.\n\ni=1, day=2.\n\ns_start = max(1, 2-2+1)=1.\n\ns_end = min(2, 2) =2.\n\nc_i=2-1+1=2. contribution 4*2=8.\n\ni=2, day=3.\n\ns_start = max(1, 3-2+1)=max(1,2)=2.\n\ns_end = min(2,3)=2.\n\nc_i= 2-2+1=1. contribution 7*1=7.\n\nTotal sum is 3+8+7=18.\n\nDivide by (k * m_weeks) = 2 * 2 =4. 18/4 =4.5. But the sample output is 9.0... Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait wait, the sample input says for the first case, the output is 9.0. Let me check again.\n\nWait the first example input is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output is 9.000...\n\nWait according to the note, the result is ( (3+4)/2 + (4+7)/2 ) / 2 = (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 9/2 =4.5. But the sample output is 9.0. Wait this is conflicting. Oh wait no! Wait the note says that the first example's output is 9.0. But according to this calculation, it's 4.5. So something is wrong here.\n\nWait the sample input in the problem says:\n\nIn the first example, the input is '3 2\\n3 4 7', and the output is '9.0000000000'.\n\nWait that can't be right. Wait let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the example in the problem description says that the result is ( (3+4)/2 + (4+7)/2 ) / 2 ?\n\nNo, the problem says that the result is (sum of all weeks' averages) divided by the number of weeks. Wait the example in the problem says that for the case of k=2, n=3, a=[3,4,7], the result is ... Well the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So perhaps the problem requires that the answer is the average of all the weekly averages, which would be (sum of weekly averages) divided by the number of weeks.\n\nBut according to the first example, the two weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their averages are 3.5 and 5.5. The average of those is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 =4.5. But the sample output says 9.0. That's impossible. So there must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"You should write a program which will calculate average sleeping time of Polycarp over all weeks.\"\n\nThe note says:\n\n\"In the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\"\n\nWait, that suggests that the answer is the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the weekly averages. Because the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks is the average of the weekly sums. But the note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Which would be the average of the weekly sums. But the problem says that Polycarp is considering the average of the weekly averages.\n\nWait this is conflicting. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nThe note says that in the third example, the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7. Which implies that the answer is the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the weekly averages. So perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is ...\"\n\nBut the problem says that Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there are n-k+1 weeks. For each week, he calculates the average. Then he wants the average of all those averages.\n\nBut the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Which would be the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the weekly averages. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output: 9.0000000000\n\nLet me compute the average of the weekly averages. There are two weeks:\n\nWeek 1: (3+4)/2 = 3.5\n\nWeek 2: (4+7)/2 = 5.5\n\nAverage of these is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 =4.5. So the output would be 4.5, but the sample output says 9.0. So clearly, my previous understanding is wrong.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the correct answer is 9.0. So how?\n\nAh! Oh wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the averages. Let me check the note again.\n\nIn the note for the third example, it says:\n\n\"In the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\"\n\nSo the answer is the average of the weekly sums. Which is (sum of all weeks' sums) divided by the number of weeks.\n\nIn that case, for the first example, the two weeks' sums are 3+4=7 and 4+7=11. The average is (7+11)/2 = 18/2=9. Which matches the sample output of 9.0. Oh! So the problem is not asking for the average of the weekly averages, but the average of the weekly sums. Which is the same as the sum of all weekly sums divided by the number of weeks. Which is different from the average of the weekly averages. \n\nSo the problem statement says:\n\n\"For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nWhich in that example, the result is 9.0, which is the average of the weekly sums. So the problem is to compute the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the averages. So my previous approach was wrong. \n\nThis changes everything. So the correct approach is to compute the sum of all the weekly sums, then divide by the number of weeks (m_weeks). \n\nSo the formula is (sum of all weekly sums) / m_weeks.\n\nEach weekly sum is the sum of k consecutive days. So the sum of all weekly sums is the sum of all the sliding window sums of size k. \n\nSo how to compute this sum efficiently?\n\nWell, the initial approach of calculating for each a_i how many times it is included in the weekly sums is correct. Because each weekly sum is the sum of k elements, and the total sum of all weekly sums is sum_{each week} (sum of its elements) = sum_{each element} (number of weeks it appears in) * a_i.\n\nSo the previous approach was correct, but the mistake was in thinking that the answer required dividing by k*m_weeks, but actually, it's sum_total_weekly_sums / m_weeks.\n\nSo in the first example, the sum_total_weekly_sums is 7+11=18. Divided by 2 weeks gives 9. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the correct formula is (sum_total_weekly_sums) / m_weeks.\n\nAnd sum_total_weekly_sums is the sum of a_i multiplied by c_i, where c_i is the number of weeks that include a_i.\n\nSo the correct calculation is to compute sum_total_weekly_sums = sum(a_i * c_i) for each i, then divide by m_weeks.\n\nSo the previous mistake was in the denominator. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute m_weeks = n -k +1.\n\nCompute for each element a_i, the count c_i of how many weeks include it.\n\nsum_total_weekly_sums = sum( a_i * c_i )\n\nanswer = sum_total_weekly_sums / m_weeks\n\nSo in the first example, sum_total_weekly_sums is 3*1 +4*2 +7*1 = 3 +8 +7 =18. Divided by 2 gives 9. Correct.\n\nSo now, the code needs to compute this sum.\n\nNow, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCompute m_weeks = n -k +1.\n\nFor each element in a, compute the count c_i as described earlier.\n\nSum all a[i] * c_i.\n\nDivide by m_weeks.\n\nOutput with enough decimal digits.\n\nSo the code needs to handle this.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute c_i for each element.\n\nLet me think again about the formula for c_i.\n\nFor day i (1-based), the number of weeks that include it is:\n\ns_start = max(1, i -k +1)\n\ns_end = min( m_weeks, i )\n\nc_i = s_end - s_start + 1\n\nBut for example, for i=2, k=2, m_weeks=2:\n\ns_start = max(1, 2-2+1) = 1.\n\ns_end = min(2, 2) =2.\n\nc_i =2-1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nfor each element in the array (0-based index i), the day is i+1.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nm_weeks = n -k +1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    day = i +1\n\n    s_start = max(1, day -k +1)\n\n    s_end = min(m_weeks, day)\n\n    c_i = s_end - s_start +1\n\n    total += a[i] * c_i\n\nresult = total / m_weeks\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nBut let's test this with the first example.\n\nn=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\nm_weeks=3-2+1=2.\n\nFor i=0, day=1:\n\ns_start = max(1, 1-2+1) = max(1, 0) =1.\n\ns_end = min(2, 1) =1. c_i=1-1+1=1. 3*1=3.\n\ni=1, day=2:\n\ns_start = max(1, 2-2+1)=1. s_end = min(2,2)=2. c_i=2. 4*2=8.\n\ni=2, day=3:\n\ns_start = max(1, 3-2+1) = max(1, 2) =2. s_end = min(2,3) =2. c_i=1. 7*1=7. Total is 3+8+7=18. 18/2=9. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 1 1, a is [10].\n\nm_weeks =1-1+1=1.\n\nfor i=0, day=1.\n\ns_start = max(1, 1-1+1) = max(1,1)=1.\n\ns_end = min(1, 1)=1. c_i=1. total is 10*1=10. divided by 1 is 10. Correct.\n\nThird example: input is 8 2, a is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]. m_weeks = 8-2+1=7.\n\nWe need to compute for each day from 1 to 8:\n\nLet's compute c_i for each day.\n\nFor day 1:\n\ns_start = max(1, 1-2+1) = max(1, 0) =1.\n\ns_end = min(7, 1) =1. c_i=1.\n\nday 2:\n\ns_start = max(1, 2-2+1) =1. s_end = min(7,2)=2. c_i=2-1+1=2.\n\nday3:\n\ns_start = max(1, 3-2+1)=2. s_end = min(7,3)=3. c_i=3-2+1=2.\n\nWait, no. Wait for day3, s_start is 3-2+1=2. s_end is min(7,3) =3. So 3-2 +1=2. So c_i=2.\n\nSimilarly for day4: s_start =4-2+1=3. s_end = min(7,4)=4. 4-3 +1=2. So c_i=2.\n\nSame for days 5,6,7: s_start is 5-2+1=4, s_end is min(7,5)=5. 5-4+1=2. So c_i=2.\n\nFor day 8: s_start = 8-2+1=7. s_end = min(7,8) =7. c_i=7-7+1=1.\n\nSo the days 1 to 8:\n\nc_i for each day is [1,2,2,2,2,2,2,1].\n\nSo the sum_total_weekly_sums is:\n\na[0]*1 + a[1]*2 + a[2]*2 + a[3]*2 + a[4]*2 + a[5]*2 + a[6]*2 + a[7]*1.\n\nThe a array is [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1].\n\nSo:\n\nsum_total_weekly_sums = 1*1 + 2*2 +4*2 +100000*2 +123*2 +456*2 +789*2 +1*1.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n1 + 4 + 8 + 200000 + 246 + 912 + 1578 + 1.\n\nAdding up:\n\n1+4=5; +8=13; +200000=200013; +246=200259; +912=201171; +1578=202749; +1=202750.\n\nThen divided by 7 weeks.\n\nSo 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample output of 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle this correctly.\n\nNow, in Python, for large n (up to 2e5), this code is O(n) and should be efficient enough.\n\nNow, handling the input. The problem says that the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait the sample input shows:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\nBut the sample input shows three inputs, which seems to be multiple test cases. However, looking back at the problem statement, perhaps the user made a mistake. Wait the original problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nBut the sample input shows:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWhich seems to be three separate test cases. However, the problem's input format is not clear. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k ...\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Which suggests that the user may have provided multiple test cases in the sample, but the actual problem expects a single test case.\n\nBut looking back, the problem says:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo the code should read a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple lines, perhaps indicating that the code should process multiple test cases. But the original problem's sample input may have been formatted incorrectly.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nThis suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description says that the input is for a single test case. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines for each test case. However, the sample shows three test cases. Therefore, it's possible that the problem expects the code to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut the original problem statement says:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k ... The second line contains n integer numbers.\n\nSo it's a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. Or perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. For example, in the first example, the input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nand output is 9.0000000000.\n\nBut the sample input shows three separate test cases. This suggests that perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases, but the code should process them all. But the problem statement does not mention this. This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nOutput:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nWhich indicates that the code should read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. However, the original problem's input description says that the input is for a single test case. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original statement, the input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo the code should process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code should read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases. But how?\n\nThis is a critical point. For example, in programming contests, sometimes the problem expects to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input description says nothing about this. But the sample input shows three test cases, which suggests that the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original sample input and output:\n\nThe first example input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThe output is 9.000...\n\nThe second example input is:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nOutput is 10.000...\n\nThird example input:\n\n8 2\n\n1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week is defined as a consecutive sequence of `k` days from a list of `n` days. The goal is to compute the average of the sums of these weekly sleep times efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to consider all possible consecutive sequences of `k` days (weeks) from the given list of `n` days and compute the average of their sums.\n2. **Efficient Calculation**: Directly computing the sum for each week would be inefficient for large `n`. Instead, we can determine how many times each day contributes to the sum of all possible weeks.\n3. **Contribution Count**: For each day in the list, determine how many weeks it is part of. This count helps in efficiently calculating the total sum of all weekly sums.\n4. **Summing Contributions**: Multiply each day's sleep time by the number of weeks it contributes to, sum these values, and then divide by the total number of weeks to get the final average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx].strip() == '':\n        idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input):\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, k = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx].strip() == '':\n            idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx].strip().split()))\n        idx += 1\n        m_weeks = n - k + 1\n        total = 0\n        for i in range(n):\n            day = i + 1\n            s_start = max(1, day - k + 1)\n            s_end = min(m_weeks, day)\n            c_i = s_end - s_start + 1\n            total += a[i] * c_i\n        result = total / m_weeks\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing multiple test cases.\n2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, read the values of `n` (number of days) and `k` (length of each week).\n3. **Calculating Contributions**: For each day in the list, compute how many weeks it is part of using the formula derived from the start and end positions of the weeks that include the day.\n4. **Total Sum Calculation**: Multiply each day's sleep time by its contribution count and accumulate these values.\n5. **Final Average**: Divide the accumulated total by the number of weeks to get the average sleep time, ensuring the result is formatted to 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required average with a time complexity of O(n) per test case, making it suitable for large inputs up to the constraint limits.",
