The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The problem is about a frog jumping on a number line. The frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But the frog can't jump outside the interval [0, x], and we need to find for each x from 0 to m the number of distinct positions it can reach, then sum all those f(x) values.\n\nHmm. So the challenge is to compute this sum efficiently, especially since m can be up to 1e9, which suggests that any O(m) approach is impossible. We need a mathematical formula or pattern here.\n\nLet me think about what positions the frog can reach. The frog can only reach positions that are reachable via some combination of adding a and subtracting b. But since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, the available positions depend on x.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to model this as a linear Diophantine equation. Let's think: any position the frog can reach is of the form k = a * p - b * q, where p and q are non-negative integers. However, since the frog can make multiple jumps, perhaps the positions are all numbers that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients such that the total steps are valid. Wait, but since the frog can jump forward and backward, maybe the positions are all numbers congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b), but that's only if there are no constraints on the jumps. However, the constraints here are that during the journey, the frog can't go beyond [0, x]. So maybe the reachable positions are limited by the maximum x.\n\nWait, but for a given x, the frog can reach any position that is reachable through some sequence of jumps that never steps outside [0, x]. So even if a number is in the set {k | k = a*p - b*q}, but to reach it, the frog might have to go through positions outside [0, x], which would be invalid.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's look at the example given:\n\nIn the first example, m=7, a=5, b=3. For x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and maybe others? Wait the note says f(5)=3. So positions 0, 5, and 2? Because 5-3=2. But how?\n\nWait, let's think about how the frog can reach positions. Starting at 0, the frog can jump +5 to 5. From 5, it can jump -3 to 2. From 2, can it jump +5 to 7, but if x is 5, then 7 is outside. So for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2. So that's three positions. Hence f(5)=3.\n\nSo the positions are not just all numbers that are combinations of a and b, but also must be reachable without stepping out of [0, x].\n\nBut how do we model this? Maybe for a given x, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of gcd(a,b), but within certain ranges. Wait, but the frog can't jump beyond x. So perhaps the problem reduces to finding the number of positions reachable under the constraint that they are between 0 and x, and that the path to reach them doesn't go outside [0, x].\n\nAlternatively, maybe the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, where d is gcd(a,b), and is within some range. But how?\n\nLet me think about the case where the frog can move freely. The positions reachable are all numbers that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with integer coefficients. But since the frog can only add a or subtract b, the coefficients for a and b must be non-negative. Wait, no. Because each jump adds +a or subtracts b. So the total displacement is (number of +a jumps)*a - (number of -b jumps)*b. So the total displacement is (p*a - q*b), where p and q are non-negative integers. So the positions reachable are all numbers of that form, but the problem is that during the journey, the frog can't step outside [0, x]. So even if a position is reachable in theory, if the path requires stepping outside [0, x], then it's not counted.\n\nThis seems really tricky. However, perhaps for large enough x, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (d = gcd(a,b)) and within some range. Let me think about the case when x is large enough that the frog can reach all positions in the allowed range.\n\nFor example, if a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any integer that is a multiple of 1 (so any integer). But how?\n\nBut wait, the frog can only move forward by a steps or backward by b steps. So, for example, if a=5 and b=3, which are coprime. Then, the frog can reach positions like 0, 5, 2 (5-3), 7 (5+5-3?), but only if during the path it doesn't go outside [0, x]. But if x is big enough, then the frog can reach all numbers that are congruent to 0 mod d, where d is the gcd of a and b. Since in this case, d=1, so all integers. But how?\n\nWait, but for example, can the frog reach 1? Let's see. Suppose a=5 and b=3. How can the frog reach 1? Well, maybe using some combination. Let's see:\n\nIf the frog makes two forward jumps (5*2=10) and then subtracts 3 three times (10 - 3*3 = 1). But during the process, the frog would have to pass through positions like 10, 7, 4, 1. If x is at least 10, then yes. So the frog can reach 1. But how about 1 is in the allowed range.\n\nSo for x >= 10, the frog can reach 1. But for x=5, the frog can't reach 1 because during the jumps, it would have to go to 10, which is outside the allowed range.\n\nSo, the problem is that for small x, the frog can't reach all possible positions that are in the allowed range, but for larger x, it can.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to find for each x, the set of positions that are reachable given that the frog can't go beyond x. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (where d = gcd(a, b)), and are within [0, x], provided that x is large enough. Then, the number of such positions is floor(x / d) + 1. But this is only true when x is large enough. For smaller x, this may not hold.\n\nBut how do we determine when x is large enough?\n\nLet me think about the case when a and b are coprime. Then, the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions in [0, x] that are multiples of 1 (i.e., all integers) is when x is at least a + b - 1. Wait, maybe this is similar to the coin problem. The largest number that cannot be formed with coins of denominations a and b (assuming they are coprime) is ab - a - b. But that's when you can use any combination of coins, but here the frog's movement is different. However, perhaps there's a similar concept here.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think again. Let me take the example of a=5, b=3. The frog can reach 0, 5, 2, 7, 4, etc. But for x=7, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5, 7, 4 (from 5-3=2, then 2+5=7, then 7-3=4). Also, 4+5=9, which would require x to be at least 9. So for x=7, the frog can reach 0,2,4,5,7. That's 5 positions. But according to the example, f(7) is 8. Wait, the example says f(7)=8. Wait, that contradicts my previous thought. Oh, the example says that the sum is 19, and for x=7, f(7)=8. So there must be more positions reachable than I thought.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing some positions. Let me think again. How can the frog reach other positions?\n\nStarting at 0:\n\nJump +5 → 5.\n\nFrom 5, jump -3 → 2.\n\nFrom 2, jump +5 → 7.\n\nFrom 7, jump -3 → 4.\n\nFrom 4, jump +5 → 9 (but for x=7, that's not allowed).\n\nFrom 4, jump -3 → 1.\n\nAh! So from 4, the frog can jump -3 to reach 1. But for x=7, that's allowed. So 1 is in the allowed range. Then, from 1, can it jump +5 to 6 (allowed). Then from 6, jump -3 to 3. So now we have 3. Then from 3, jump +5 to 8 (not allowed). Or jump -3 to 0. So for x=7, the frog can reach 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. That's 8 positions. Which matches the example.\n\nSo, for x >= 7, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. Wait, but why? Because once the frog can reach 1, then adding a's and subtracting b's allows it to reach all numbers. Wait, but in this case, a=5, b=3. So if the frog can reach 1, then it can reach 1+5=6, 6+5=11 (but if x is large enough), etc. Also, subtracting 3 steps. So for example, 1, 6, 3 (from 6-3), 8 (from 3+5), etc. So once the frog can reach 1, then it can reach all numbers greater than or equal to 1 (given that x is large enough). But how?\n\nThis suggests that once the frog can reach a certain number of consecutive positions, then it can reach all positions beyond that. For example, if the frog can reach positions 0, 1, 2, 3, then adding a steps (say 5) would allow reaching 5,6,7,8, etc. But this depends on a and b. But in this case, since a=5 and b=3, and the frog can reach 1, then adding 5 steps gives 6, which is 1+5. Then, subtracting 3 steps from 6 gives 3. Then subtracting 3 again gives 0. So maybe the frog can reach all numbers once it can reach a certain range.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. Once x is beyond that, the number of positions is x+1 (since all positions are reachable). But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given x, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (the gcd of a and b) and are in [0, x], provided that x is large enough. But how to find this threshold?\n\nLet me think about the general case. Let d = gcd(a, b). Let's denote a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Then, since a and b are multiples of d, the problem reduces to considering the case where a' and b' are coprime.\n\nIn this case, the positions the frog can reach are all multiples of d. So for the problem, the number of positions is determined by how many multiples of d are in [0, x], and whether those positions are reachable under the constraints of the frog's jumps.\n\nSo the problem can be split into two parts: handling the positions that are multiples of d, and figuring out for each x how many of them are reachable.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's consider the case when a and b are coprime. Then, d=1, and the frog can reach any integer that is reachable given the constraints. Now, for x sufficiently large, the frog can reach all integers from 0 to x. But how large is sufficiently large?\n\nIn the example with a=5 and b=3, the minimal x where all positions are reachable is 7. Because once x is 7, the frog can reach 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. So for x >=7, the number of positions is x+1.\n\nBut how to find that minimal x?\n\nThis seems similar to the Frobenius problem, where the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative integers is ab - a - b. However, in our case, the frog's movement is different. The frog can add a or subtract b, but the path must not go out of [0, x]. So the Frobenius number may not directly apply here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps once x is greater than or equal to a + b, the frog can reach all positions. But in the example, a + b = 8, but x=7 was sufficient. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal x is (a -1) * (b -1) - something. Not sure.\n\nBut perhaps the key insight here is that once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d, and for x < that threshold, the number of positions is less.\n\nBut how to find this threshold and compute the sum?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFirst, compute d = gcd(a, b). If a and b are not coprime, then the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of d. So, for any x, the maximum possible number of positions is floor(x / d) + 1. However, this is only achievable if the frog can reach all those positions. Otherwise, for x less than some value, the number of positions is less.\n\nBut how to find when the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x?\n\nLet me assume that once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. Then, for x >= some value T, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nThen, the sum from i=0 to m of f(i) can be split into two parts:\n\n1. For i < T, compute f(i) individually.\n\n2. For i >= T, compute f(i) as floor(i/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps T is (a + b) * something. Let's think again about the example where a=5, b=3. Here, d=1. The threshold T is 7. For x >=7, f(x) = x+1.\n\nBut how to find T for general a and b?\n\nLet me think of the case when the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, provided that x is large enough. For that, the minimal x would be (a' -1)*(b' -1) where a' and b' are coprime. Wait, that's the Frobenius number. For example, when a=5, b=3, the Frobenius number is 5*3 -5 -3 = 7. Which is exactly the threshold in the example. So for x >= Frobenius number + 1, the frog can reach all positions. But how?\n\nWait, the Frobenius number is the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative integers. But in our case, the frog can reach positions that are combinations of adding a and subtracting b. So the reachable positions are different. However, the Frobenius number seems to be connected here.\n\nIn the example, the Frobenius number is 5*3 -5 -3 = 7. And the threshold T is 7, which is exactly the Frobenius number. So for x >= Frobenius number + 1 (which is 8), the frog can reach all positions. Wait, but in the example, x=7 allows all positions up to 7. So perhaps the threshold is the Frobenius number. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions up to x is the Frobenius number. Then, for x >= Frobenius number, the frog can reach all positions. But how to confirm this?\n\nLet's take another example. Suppose a=3 and b=2. Then, the Frobenius number is 3*2 -3 -2 = 1. So for x >=1, the frog can reach all positions. But for x=1, the frog can reach 0 and 1? How?\n\nThe frog starts at 0. Can it reach 1? Let's see. To reach 1, the frog could do:\n\nFrom 0, jump +3 (to 3), then jump -2 (to 1). But if x is at least 3, then yes. But if x is 1, then the frog can't jump to 3, which is outside the allowed range. So for x=1, the frog can't reach 1. Thus, the Frobenius number is 1, but for x=1, the frog can't reach 1. So the threshold is higher than Frobenius number.\n\nHmm. This suggests that my previous idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the threshold is (a + b) - 1. For the example of a=5, b=3, that would be 7, which matches the example. For a=3 and b=2, (3+2)-1=4. Let's see. For x=4, can the frog reach all positions from 0 to 4?\n\nLet's see:\n\n0 is always reachable.\n\nTo reach 1: the frog can do 0 +3 (to 3) then -2 (to 1). Since x=4 >=3, allowed. So yes.\n\nTo reach 2: 0 +3 -2 = 1, then +3 to 4, then -2 to 2. But during the path, the frog must not go beyond x=4. So yes.\n\nTo reach 3: directly jump +3.\n\nTo reach 4: 3 + 1? Or 0 +3 +3 -2 = 4. So yes.\n\nThus, for x=4, the frog can reach all positions. So for x >= (a + b -1), the frog can reach all positions. But for a=3, b=2, the Frobenius number is 1, and (a + b -1) is 4. So perhaps the threshold is a + b -1.\n\nIn the first example, a=5, b=3: 5+3-1=7, which matches the example. So for x >= a + b -1, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x.\n\nBut how to prove this?\n\nAssume that a and b are coprime. Let's say the frog can reach all positions from 0 to a + b -1. Then, for any position x >= a + b -1, the frog can reach it. But how?\n\nWell, if the frog can reach all positions up to a + b -1, then for any x >= a + b -1, the frog can reach x by adding a steps. For example, if the frog can reach x - a, then adding a steps gets to x. Since x - a >= (a + b -1) - a = b -1 >=0 (since b >=1). So x - a is in the range [b-1, ...]. But since the frog can reach all positions up to a + b -1, and x -a is <= a + b -1 (if x is a + b -1 + a, then x -a is a + b -1, which is covered). So this suggests that once the frog can reach all positions up to a + b -1, then it can reach all positions beyond that.\n\nBut how to show that the frog can reach all positions up to a + b -1?\n\nThis seems plausible, but I need to think of a way to verify it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x is (a-1)*(b-1). Wait, but that's the Frobenius number. However, in the first example, (5-1)*(3-1) = 4 * 2 = 8. But the threshold was 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the threshold is (a-1)*(b-1) - something. Not sure.\n\nBut given that in the first example, the threshold is a + b -1, which is 7, and for the a=3, b=2 case, threshold is 4 (a + b -1), which seems to work, perhaps this is the correct approach.\n\nSo, assuming that for a and b coprime, once x >= a + b -1, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. Then, for x < a + b -1, the number of positions is less.\n\nBut how to compute f(x) for x < a + b -1?\n\nBut for large m (up to 1e9), we need an efficient way to compute the sum. So perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b). Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, since a' and b' are coprime.\n\n2. The frog can reach positions that are multiples of d. So for any x, the maximum possible number of positions is floor(x/d) + 1. But this is only achievable if x >= T, where T is some threshold.\n\n3. For x < T, the number of positions is less. However, the threshold T is (a' + b' - 1) * d ?\n\nWait, for the original a and b (coprime), the threshold is a + b -1. So for the general case, where a and b are multiples of d, then the threshold would be (a' + b' -1)*d ?\n\nYes. Because a = a'*d, b = b'*d. So the original problem reduces to a' and b' being coprime. The threshold for a' and b' is a' + b' -1. Then, for the original problem, the threshold is (a' + b' -1)*d. Because each step is multiplied by d.\n\nSo, for example, in the first case, a=5, b=3, d=1, a'=5, b'=3. Threshold is (5 +3 -1)*1 =7, which matches.\n\nFor a=3, b=2, d=1, threshold is 3+2-1=4.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=4. Then d=2, a'=3, b'=2. Threshold is (3+2-1)*2 =4*2=8. So for x >=8, the frog can reach all multiples of 2 up to x. So for x=8, the positions are 0,2,4,6,8 → 5 positions. Which is floor(8/2)+1 =5. So that works.\n\nBut what about for x=7, which is less than 8. The frog can reach 0, 2, 4, 6. So 4 positions. But what about other positions? Like 0+6=6, then subtract 4 → 2. Then add 6 → 8 (but x is 7, so can't). So for x=7, the frog can reach 0, 2, 4, 6. So f(7) is 4, which is floor(7/2)+1 = 3+1=4. So that works. So even though x is less than the threshold, the number of positions is floor(x/d) +1. Wait, but according to this, maybe the threshold is not needed, and the number of positions is always floor(x/d) +1?\n\nBut that contradicts the first example. Because in the first example, when x=5, the number of positions is 3, which is floor(5/1) +1 = 6. Which is not matching. So clearly, that's not the case.\n\nAh, right. Because the frog can't reach all multiples of d up to x. For example, in the first example, d=1, x=5. The frog can reach 0, 2, 5. So 3 positions, but floor(5/1)+1 =6. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nSo what's wrong with my reasoning?\n\nAh, because the threshold is when the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. For x < threshold, the number of reachable positions is less than floor(x/d)+1. So, the threshold is important.\n\nSo, for the general case, the number of positions is:\n\nIf x < T (threshold), then it's the number of multiples of d that are reachable.\n\nIf x >= T, then it's floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nSo, how to compute the sum from i=0 to m of f(i)?\n\nThe plan is:\n\nFor each i, f(i) is the number of multiples of d in [0, i] that are reachable given the constraints of the frog's jumps.\n\nBut how to compute the number of reachable multiples of d up to x, for x < T.\n\nBut how to compute T?\n\nAs discussed earlier, T = (a' + b' -1)*d, where a' = a/d, b' = b/d.\n\nOnce we have T, then for x >= T, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nFor x < T, we need to find how many multiples of d are reachable.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, for x < T, the number of reachable positions is equal to the number of positions reachable in the reduced problem (with a' and b') multiplied by d. Because the original problem is scaled by d.\n\nSo, let's think of the problem in terms of a' and b', which are coprime. For the reduced problem, the frog can jump +a' or -b'. The positions reachable in the reduced problem (without multiplying by d) are the ones that can be reached with these jumps, and the original problem's positions are those multiplied by d.\n\nSo, for the reduced problem, the number of positions reachable up to x' (where x' = floor(x/d)) is f'(x'), and the original f(x) is f'(x').\n\nThus, the problem reduces to solving the reduced problem (with a' and b' coprime) for x' up to floor(m/d), and then multiply accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute f'(x') for the reduced problem?\n\nIn the reduced problem, for x' < T', where T' = a' + b' -1, the number of reachable positions is not x'+1, but something else. But for x' >= T', it's x'+1.\n\nSo, for the reduced problem, the sum over x' from 0 to X_max (X_max = floor(m/d)) of f'(x') is needed.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think about the reduced problem where a and b are coprime. For x' >= T' = a + b -1, f'(x') = x'+1. For x' < T', it's the number of positions reachable in the reduced problem.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for x' < T'?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, since T' is a' + b' -1, and since a and b are up to 1e5, then T' can be up to 2e5. Which is manageable for precomputing.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor the reduced problem (coprime a' and b'):\n\nCompute for all x' from 0 to T' (which is up to 2e5), the value of f'(x').\n\nThen, for the original problem, the sum for x from 0 to m is:\n\nsum_{x=0}^m f(x) = sum_{x=0}^m [f'(floor(x/d))] \n\nBecause for each x, the original f(x) is equal to f'(floor(x/d)).\n\nBut how?\n\nYes, because in the original problem, the reachable positions are multiples of d. So for each x, the number of reachable positions is equal to the number of reachable positions in the reduced problem for x' = floor(x/d). Because each position k in the reduced problem corresponds to k*d in the original problem. And since the original x is such that k*d <= x, then k <= floor(x/d). Therefore, the count is f'(floor(x/d)).\n\nTherefore, the overall sum can be computed as follows:\n\nCompute for the reduced problem (coprime a' and b') the prefix sums up to T' = a' + b' -1.\n\nThen, for the original problem, the sum is:\n\nsum_{x'=0}^{X_max} [number of times x' appears as floor(x/d) for x in 0..m] * f'(x') \n\nWhere X_max = floor(m/d).\n\nBut how to compute the number of times x' appears as floor(x/d) for x in 0..m?\n\nLet me think: For a given x', the values of x that satisfy floor(x/d) = x' are x in [x'*d, (x'+1)*d -1]. However, x cannot exceed m.\n\nSo, for each x', the count is the number of integers x in [0, m] such that floor(x/d) = x'.\n\nWhich is:\n\nif x'*d <= m:\n\n   lower = x'*d\n\n   upper = min( (x'+1)*d -1, m )\n\n   count = upper - lower + 1\n\nelse:\n\n   count = 0\n\nSo, the sum becomes:\n\nsum_{x'=0}^{X_max} [count(x')] * f'(x')\n\nWhere X_max is floor(m/d).\n\nBut X_max can be up to m/d, which for m=1e9 and d=1 is 1e9. Which would be impossible to compute directly. However, for x' >= T', the f'(x') is x'+1. So we can split the sum into two parts:\n\n1. x' < T': compute count(x') * f'(x') for each x' in 0..T'-1.\n\n2. x' >= T': compute count(x') * (x'+1).\n\nBut how to compute the second part?\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet X_max = floor(m/d).\n\nLet T' = a' + b' -1.\n\nFor the second part, x' ranges from max(T', 0) to X_max.\n\nBut since T' is a' + b' -1, which is up to 2e5, and X_max can be up to 1e9, we need to compute the sum for x' in [T', X_max] of count(x') * (x'+1).\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the count(x') for x' >= T':\n\nFor x' >= T', count(x') is the number of x in [x'*d, min( (x'+1)*d -1, m ) ].\n\nSo, the sum over x' >= T' of count(x')*(x'+1) can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{x'=T'}^{X_max} [ (min( (x'+1)*d -1, m ) - x'*d + 1 ) * (x'+1) ]\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me find the range of x' where (x'+1)*d -1 <= m. Let me denote that x' can be up to X_max = floor(m/d). Let me find the maximum x' where (x'+1)*d -1 <= m. Let's solve:\n\n(x'+1)*d -1 <= m → x'+1 <= (m +1)/d → x' <= (m +1)/d -1 → x' <= floor( (m +1)/d -1 )\n\nBut since X_max = floor(m/d), then for x' = X_max, (x'+1)*d -1 = X_max*d +d -1. But since X_max = floor(m/d), then X_max*d <= m < (X_max +1)*d. So (X_max +1)*d -1 = m + (d - (m - X_max*d)) -1. Which is larger than m. Hence, for x' >= T', the upper bound for x' is min( (x'+1)*d -1, m ) = min( ... , m ). So for x' in [T', X_max], the upper bound is min( (x'+1)*d -1, m ), which is m if (x'+1)*d -1 > m.\n\nBut for x' >= X_max, this is not possible, since X_max = floor(m/d). So for x' <= X_max, (x'+1)*d -1 >= m ?\n\nNo. For x' = X_max, (x'+1)*d -1 = (X_max +1)*d -1. But since X_max = floor(m/d), then X_max*d <= m < (X_max +1)*d. So (X_max +1)*d -1 = m + (d - (m - X_max*d)) -1. Which is m + (d - (m - X_max*d)) -1 = m + d - m + X_max*d -1 -1 ? No, perhaps I should compute:\n\nLet me denote m = q*d + r, where 0 ≤ r <d. Then, X_max = q.\n\nThen, (x'+1)*d -1 for x'=q is (q+1)*d -1 = q*d +d -1 = m + (d - (m - q*d )) -1 ?\n\nWait, m = q*d + r. So (q+1)*d -1 = q*d +d -1 = m + (d - r -1). Since r is between 0 and d-1, d - r -1 is between 0 and d-1. So (q+1)*d -1 = m + (d - r -1) = m + (d - r -1). Which is greater than m. So for x'=q (X_max), the upper bound is m.\n\nThus, for x' in [T', X_max], the count(x') is:\n\nif x' < X_max: then upper = (x'+1)*d -1, which is less than m?\n\nNo, for x' < X_max, then x' +1 <= X_max. So (x'+1)*d -1 <= X_max*d +d -1 = (X_max +1)*d -1. Which is larger than m. So for x' < X_max, the upper bound is (x'+1)*d -1. But since x'*d <= m, because x' <= X_max.\n\nWait, for x' < X_max, x' is at most X_max -1. Then x'*d <= (X_max -1)*d. Since X_max = floor(m/d), then (X_max -1)*d <= m -d < m. So (x'+1)*d -1 = x'*d +d -1. Which is (X_max -1)*d +d -1 = X_max*d -1. Which is less than m (since X_max*d is larger than m). Wait, no. For example, m=7, d=1. X_max=7. For x'=6 < X_max=7, (x'+1)*d -1 = 7*1 -1 =6, which is less than m=7. So the upper bound is 6, and the count is 6 -6 +1 =1. Which is correct.\n\nSo for x' < X_max, the upper bound is (x'+1)*d -1, which is less than m. Thus, count(x') = (x'+1)*d -1 - x'*d +1 = d.\n\nFor x'=X_max, the upper bound is m. So count(x') = m - X_max*d +1.\n\nSo the sum for x' >= T' can be split into two parts:\n\nA. x' ranges from T' to X_max-1: each contributes d * (x'+1).\n\nB. x'=X_max: contributes (m - X_max*d +1) * (X_max +1).\n\nSo the total sum for part 2 is:\n\nsum_{x'=T'}^{X_max-1} d*(x'+1) + (m - X_max*d +1) * (X_max +1)\n\nBut how to compute sum_{x'=T'}^{X_max-1} (x'+1) ?\n\nThat's the sum from k = T'+1 to X_max of k. Because x'+1 ranges from T'+1 to X_max.\n\nSo the sum is (sum_{k = T'+1}^{X_max} k) * d.\n\nThe sum from a to b inclusive is (b(b+1)/2 - (a-1)a/2).\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe overall steps are:\n\nCompute d = gcd(a, b).\n\nCompute a' = a/d, b' = b/d.\n\nCompute T' = a' + b' -1.\n\nCompute X_max = floor(m/d).\n\nCompute the sum for the reduced problem (coprime a', b'):\n\nsum_part1 = sum_{x'=0}^{",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints and then compute the sum of these values for all positions from 0 to a given integer $ m $. The solution involves leveraging mathematical properties of greatest common divisors (GCD) and efficient range summation techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the GCD of the two jump distances $ a $ and $ b $. This simplifies the problem by reducing it to considering positions in terms of their GCD.\n2. **Threshold Calculation**: For sufficiently large values of $ x $, the frog can reach all multiples of the GCD within the range [0, x]. This threshold is determined by the formula $ T = (a' + b' - 1) \\times d $, where $ a' $ and $ b' $ are the values of $ a $ and $ b $ divided by their GCD.\n3. **Efficient Summation**: For values of $ x $ below the threshold, precompute the number of reachable positions using dynamic programming.
