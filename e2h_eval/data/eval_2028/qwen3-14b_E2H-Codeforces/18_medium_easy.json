The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where a frog jumps on a number line, and calculate the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m. The function f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the frog moves. The frog starts at 0. From position k, it can jump to k+a or k-b. But it can't go outside [0, x]. So for each x, I need to find all positions reachable by the frog under these constraints.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we can't compute each f(i) individually for large m. We need a mathematical formula or pattern that allows us to compute the sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the possible reachable positions. The frog can move forward by a steps (k+a) or backward by b steps (k-b). But since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, the movement is constrained.\n\nLet me think about the problem in terms of linear combinations. The frog can reach positions that are combinations of adding a and subtracting b. But since the frog can make multiple jumps, maybe the positions reachable are those that can be expressed as some combination of a and b steps. However, since the frog can't go beyond x, the actual reachable positions depend on x.\n\nWait, but the frog can only move forward by a or backward by b. Let's think about the possible positions. For example, if the frog can reach position k, then it can reach k+a (as long as k+a <=x) and k -b (as long as k -b >=0). So the reachable positions form a set that depends on x.\n\nBut how do we model this? Maybe the key is to find all positions that are reachable via some sequence of a steps and b steps, but considering that the frog can't go beyond x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b), but that's only if there's no restriction on the range. However, with the restriction that positions must be between 0 and x, the reachable positions would be those that are multiples of d (where d is gcd(a,b)) and within the range [0, x], but also reachable through the allowed moves.\n\nBut wait, the frog can only add a or subtract b. So the total displacement after some steps is (number of a steps)*a - (number of b steps)*b. Let's denote the number of a steps as p and the number of b steps as q. Then the position is p*a - q*b. But since the frog starts at 0, the position is p*a - q*b. However, the frog can't go beyond x or below 0. But when considering all possible p and q such that the path doesn't go out of bounds, it's complicated.\n\nBut maybe the key is that the reachable positions are those that are congruent to 0 mod d, where d = gcd(a, b). Because any combination of a and b steps would have a total displacement that is a multiple of d. So the positions reachable are those that are multiples of d, but also can be achieved through some sequence of steps that don't go out of the allowed range.\n\nBut even if a position is a multiple of d, it's not guaranteed to be reachable because the frog might not have a way to reach it without going out of the allowed range. For example, if x is small.\n\nHmm. Let's take the first example: m=7, a=5, b=3. The gcd(5,3)=1, so all positions are possible. But in that example, f(5) is 3. Let's see: when x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and 5-3=2. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think about the first example. When x is 5, the frog can reach positions:\n\nStarts at 0. From 0, can jump to 0+5=5 (since 5 <=5). Also, can't jump to 0-3=-3 which is invalid. So 5 is reachable. From 5, can jump to 5+5=10 (invalid) or 5-3=2 (valid). So 2 is reachable. From 2, can jump to 2+5=7>5 (invalid), or 2-3=-1 (invalid). So no new positions. Also, from 0, can you reach other positions? Like, maybe if you do some other steps. Wait, but the frog can only move forward or backward. So, for example, can you reach 5-3=2, then from 2 you can't go further. So the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. That's three positions. Hence f(5)=3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo even though the gcd is 1, which allows all positions, but due to the constraints of x, the frog can't reach all positions. So the problem is more complex than just counting multiples of d.\n\nSo, how can we model the reachable positions for a given x?\n\nAnother approach: think of the frog's movement as being able to reach any position that can be written as (some number of a steps forward) minus (some number of b steps backward), but such that during the path, the frog never goes outside [0, x].\n\nBut this seems difficult to model directly. Maybe there's a way to find the maximum reachable position and then count how many positions are reachable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (d = gcd(a, b)), and are within [0, x], and also satisfy certain conditions based on the ability to reach them via the allowed steps.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following:\n\nThe frog can move forward by a steps, or backward by b steps. So, if the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k+a (if k+a <=x) and k -b (if k -b >=0). So the reachable positions form a graph, and the problem is to find the size of the connected component containing 0 in this graph, with the constraint that all positions are between 0 and x.\n\nBut for large x, this is impractical to compute directly. So we need a pattern or formula.\n\nLet me consider the case where a and b are coprime (d=1). For example, in the first sample, a=5, b=3, which are coprime. For x sufficiently large, the frog can reach any position between 0 and x. But when x is small, like 5, it can't reach all positions.\n\nWait, but how does the frog reach positions beyond a certain value?\n\nFor example, suppose a=5 and b=3. Once the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k + 5 (if allowed), and k-3 (if allowed). So if the frog can reach 0, 2, 5, then from 5, it can reach 2 again, but also 5+5=10. But if x is 10, then 10 is allowed. Then from 10, you can subtract 3 to get 7, then subtract 3 again to get 4, subtract 3 to get 1. So once you can reach 10, you can reach positions 7,4,1. Then from 1, you can add 5 to get 6, which is allowed. Then from 6, subtract 3 to get 3, add 5 to get 11 (if allowed). So for x >= 10, perhaps the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x, provided that x is large enough.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (in this case, d=1, so all positions) and within [0,x].\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is between 0 and x, and also satisfies that the position can be reached by moving forward and backward steps without exceeding the boundaries. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of BFS. For each x, perform BFS and count the reachable positions. But for x up to 1e9, this is impossible. So there must be a pattern that allows us to compute f(x) quickly.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of when x is large enough. Suppose x is large enough that the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (d = gcd(a,b)) and within [0, x]. Then, the number of reachable positions would be floor(x / d) + 1. But how to find when x is \"large enough\".\n\nBut what determines whether x is large enough?\n\nLet me think of the case where a and b are coprime. Then, for x >= a + b, perhaps the frog can reach all positions. Or maybe there's a certain threshold.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample, a=5, b=3. Let's say x is 8. Let's see:\n\nAt x=8, the frog can reach positions:\n\nStart at 0. Jump to 5. From 5, jump to 2. From 2, can't jump forward (2+5=7 ≤8). So 7 is reachable. From 7, can jump to 7-3=4. From 4, can jump to 4+5=9 (invalid) or 4-3=1. From 1, can jump to 1+5=6 (allowed). From 6, can jump to 6-3=3. From 3, can jump to 3+5=8. From 8, can jump to 8-3=5. So the positions are 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3,8. That's 9 positions. So for x=8, f(x) is 9. Which is 8+1=9. So in this case, when x is large enough (like 8), the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. But for x=5, it could reach only 3 positions.\n\nSo, the question is: for a given x, what is the minimal number of positions that can be reached, and how does it grow as x increases.\n\nSo, perhaps there's a certain threshold X such that for x >= X, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1, where d is gcd(a, b). And for x < X, it's less than that.\n\nIf that's the case, then the problem reduces to finding X, and then for each x in 0..m, compute f(x) as either the small value (for x < X) or the large value (for x >= X).\n\nBut how to find X?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the problem in terms of the maximum distance the frog can reach. If the frog can reach a position that is at least (a + b), then it can reach all positions beyond that. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and once the frog can reach a position k such that k >= b, then it can subtract b steps to reach k - b, and so on. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the general case. Let d = gcd(a, b). Let's divide a and b by d. Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Now, since a' and b' are coprime.\n\nThe problem becomes, the frog can move forward by a' steps (each step is multiplied by d) or backward by b' steps. But since the original problem is about positions, the positions must be multiples of d. So, the problem reduces to the case where d=1, and the frog can move forward a steps or backward b steps, with a and b coprime.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be simplified by considering the case when d=1, and then multiply by d in the end.\n\nBut for now, let's assume d=1, and a and b are coprime.\n\nIn this case, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of 1 (so any integer), but only if it can be reached through the allowed steps and without violating the x limit.\n\nNow, for x large enough, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. What's the minimal x where this is true?\n\nThis seems similar to the coin problem. For two coprime denominations a and b, the largest amount that cannot be formed is ab -a -b. But this is for non-negative combinations. However, in our case, the frog can move both forward and backward. So perhaps once x is larger than a certain value, the frog can reach all positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For example, if a=5 and b=3. The largest unattainable number is 5*3 -5 -3 = 7. So according to the coin problem, numbers larger than 7 can be formed. But in our case, the frog can reach any position that is a combination of adding a steps and subtracting b steps. So for example, 8 can be formed as 5 + 3 (but that's not exactly the same as the coin problem). Wait, but in the coin problem, you can only add coins. Here, the frog can add a steps (like adding coins) and subtract b steps (like taking away coins). So perhaps the reachable positions are all integers beyond a certain value.\n\nBut in the example where a=5, b=3, when x=8, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 8, as shown earlier. For x=7, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2, 7. Wait, but according to the sample input, when x=7, f(7) is 8. Wait, in the first example, for x=7, the sum is 8. How?\n\nWait the first example says f(7) is 8. Let me check that again. The note says for the first example, f(5)=3, f(6)=3, f(7)=8. So when x=7, the frog can reach 8 positions. How?\n\nEarlier analysis for x=7:\n\nFrom 0, the frog can reach 5. From 5, reach 2. From 2, reach 7 (2+5=7). From 7, subtract 3 to reach 4. From 4, subtract 3 to reach 1. From 1, add 5 to reach 6. From 6, subtract 3 to reach 3. From 3, add 5 to reach 8 (but x is 7, so invalid). So the positions are 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3. That's 8 positions. So yes, for x=7, the frog can reach all positions except 8 (which is beyond x). So for x=7, the frog can reach positions 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. Wait, but according to the list, the positions are 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3. Oh right, those are all positions from 0 to 7. So for x=7, which is equal to the coin problem's largest unattainable value (7), the frog can reach all positions. So perhaps the threshold is when x is greater than or equal to a + b? Or maybe when x is greater than or equal to a certain value.\n\nIn this case, the coin problem's largest unattainable number is 7, but the frog can reach all positions up to 7. So maybe the threshold is when x is >= (a + b) - 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps once the frog can reach a position that is at least b, then it can generate all positions beyond that. For example, in the case where a=5, b=3. Once the frog reaches position 5, then from there it can subtract 3 to reach 2, and then add 5 to reach 7. From 7, subtract 3 to reach 4, etc. So once the frog can reach a position >= b, then it can generate all positions down to (position - k*b) until they are within the range. But how to ensure that all positions are covered.\n\nAlternatively, the key is that the frog can reach all positions once x is large enough. For example, in the case of a and b being coprime, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions between 0 and x. The minimal x for this is (a + b) - 1. But I'm not sure.\n\nIn the example of a=5, b=3, the minimal x where all positions are reachable is 7. Which is (5+3)-1 = 7. So that seems to fit. Let's see another example. Let a=3, b=2. Then the largest unattainable number is 3*2 -3 -2= 1. So for x >=2, the frog can reach all positions. Let's see:\n\nFor x=2, the frog can reach 0, 3 (invalid), so only 0. Wait, but that's not right. Wait, the frog starts at 0. Can it reach 2?\n\nWait, the frog can jump forward by a=3 steps. But 0+3=3 > x=2, so invalid. So can't. So the frog can't reach 2. Hmm. But according to the coin problem, 2 can be formed by 0*3 +1*2. But the frog can't reach it here. So perhaps my previous assumption is incorrect.\n\nWait, but the frog can only move forward by a or backward by b. So to reach 2, the frog would need to do something like: start at 0, jump forward by a=3 steps (invalid), or jump backward by b=2 steps (invalid). So no. So the frog can't reach 2. So in this case, even though x is larger than the coin problem's largest unattainable number (which is 1), the frog can't reach 2. So my previous idea is wrong.\n\nSo what's the difference here? The coin problem allows you to use any combination of a and b steps (all positive), but the frog can use both forward and backward steps. So the reachable positions are different.\n\nSo maybe the correct approach is to think of the problem in terms of the frog being able to reach any position that is congruent to 0 modulo d, and for which there exists some k such that the position can be expressed as (k*a - l*b), where k and l are non-negative integers. But again, this is under the assumption that the frog can reach that position without going out of bounds.\n\nBut how to find for a given x, the number of positions that are reachable.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of the frog being able to reach all positions that are congruent to 0 modulo d (d = gcd(a, b)) and are in [0, x], provided that x is large enough.\n\nBut for x being large enough, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1. So the sum over i from 0 to m of f(i) would be sum_{i=0}^m (floor(i/d)+1) if i >= X, where X is some threshold. But for i < X, f(i) is less than floor(i/d)+1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding X, the minimal x where for all x >= X, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nOnce we find X, then the sum can be split into two parts: the sum for i < X, and the sum for i >= X.\n\nSo how to find X?\n\nLet me think about the case when d = 1. Then, the frog can reach any position that is reachable through the steps. For example, with a and b coprime.\n\nAssume that the frog can reach all positions from some value onwards. Let me think of the minimal x where this is true.\n\nSuppose the frog can reach a position k such that k >= b. Then, from there, the frog can subtract b steps to reach k - b, then again subtract b to reach k - 2b, etc., until reaching a position less than b. Then, from that position, the frog can add a steps to reach higher positions. Since a and b are coprime, this suggests that once the frog can reach a position >= b, it can reach all positions beyond some point.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where this is possible.\n\nAlternatively, think of the minimal x where the frog can reach x - b, then add a to reach x -b + a. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's imagine that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and that once the frog can reach a position that is >= b, then it can generate all positions beyond that. So the minimal x where this is possible is the minimal x such that x >= a and x >= b. Or perhaps something else.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. The frog can reach any position that can be expressed as (some number of a steps forward) minus (some number of b steps backward). But the path must not go outside [0, x] at any time. However, this seems too vague.\n\nLet me think of the problem for the case where a and b are coprime. For example, a=3 and b=2. Let's try to find for various x what f(x) is.\n\nx=0: only 0. So f(0)=1.\n\nx=1: can't jump anywhere. So f(1)=1.\n\nx=2: can reach 0, 3 (invalid), or -2 (invalid). So only 0. So f(2)=1.\n\nx=3: can reach 0, 3 (valid). From 3, subtract 2 to get 1. So positions 0,3,1. So f(3)=3.\n\nx=4: from 0, can reach 3. From 3, subtract 2 to get 1. From 1, add 3 to get 4 (valid). From 4, subtract 2 to get 2. From 2, can't go further. So positions are 0,3,1,4,2. So f(4)=5.\n\nx=5: from 0, reach 3. From 3, reach 1 and 6 (invalid). From 1, reach 4. From 4, reach 2 and 7 (invalid). From 2, reach 5. So positions are 0,3,1,4,2,5. So f(5)=6.\n\nx=6: from 5, add 3 to get 8 (invalid). From 5, subtract 2 to get 3. From 3, subtract 2 to get 1. From 1, add 3 to get 4. From 4, add 3 to get 7 (invalid). Subtract 2 to get 2. From 2, add 3 to get 5. So positions are 0,3,1,4,2,5,6 (from 5+1? Wait, no. How to get 6?\n\nWait, when x=6, can the frog reach 6?\n\nYes. Let's see: Starting from 0, can we reach 6?\n\nWe can do 0 → 3 → 6 (adding 3 again). But 3 + 3 = 6, which is allowed. So yes. So positions include 0,3,6, 1,4, 2,5. So 7 positions. So f(6)=7.\n\nSo for x=6, which is larger than a=3 and b=2, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 6. So for x >= 3, but in this case, x=3 gives 3 positions (0,1,3), but x=4 gives 5 positions (0,1,2,3,4), and so on. So for x >= 3, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x? No. For example, for x=3, the positions are 0,1,3. Missing 2. So no. But for x=4, it can reach 0,1,2,3,4. For x=5, can reach 0,1,2,3,4,5. For x=6, all positions. So the threshold here is x >= 4?\n\nWait, but why can't the frog reach 2 for x=3?\n\nBecause to reach 2, you need to go from 3 (which is reachable) to 3-2=1, then from 1 to 1+3=4 (which is beyond x=3, so invalid). So the frog can't reach 2 when x=3. But for x=4, it can reach 2.\n\nSo in this case, the threshold X is 4, after which all positions are reachable.\n\nSo how to find X?\n\nIt seems that X is the minimal value such that X >= a and X >= b, and X is such that X - a is reachable. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for the case where a and b are coprime, the threshold X is (a * b) - a - b + something. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal x where the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x is when x is at least (a + b). For example, in the first case, a=5, b=3, x=8 (which is 5+3=8). For x=8, the frog can reach all positions. In the second example, a=3, b=2, x=5 (which is 3+2=5). For x=5, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 5.\n\nBut in the second example, when x=4, it can reach all positions from 0 to 4. So maybe the threshold is max(a, b) ?\n\nNo. For a=3, b=2, max(a,b) is 3. At x=3, the frog can't reach 2. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, the threshold is the maximum between a and b. But that doesn't hold.\n\nAnother idea: For the frog to be able to reach all positions from 0 to x, it must be able to reach every position from 0 to x. This requires that for any position k in 0..x, there exists a way to reach it using forward and backward steps, without going out of bounds.\n\nBut how to find this x?\n\nMaybe the minimal x is (a + b) - 1. For example:\n\nIn the first case, a=5, b=3, x=7 (5+3-1=7). And in that case, the frog can reach all positions up to x=7.\n\nIn the second example, a=3, b=2, x=3+2-1=4. And indeed, for x=4, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 4.\n\nSo perhaps the threshold X is a + b - 1. Once x >= X, then f(x) = x + 1 (since d=1).\n\nBut for x >= X, the number of reachable positions is x+1. But for x < X, it's less than that.\n\nSo this seems promising. Let me check another example.\n\nTake a=4, b=5. They are coprime. Then X = 4+5-1=8. For x=8, can the frog reach all positions from 0 to 8?\n\nLet's see. Let's try to reach position 1.\n\nFrom 0, jump to 4. From 4, subtract 5 → -1 (invalid). So can't reach 1 that way. Alternatively, can we reach 1 via other steps?\n\nWait, but maybe the frog can reach 1 by jumping forward multiple times and backward. Let's think:\n\nWe need to find integers p and q such that 4p -5q = 1. Since 4 and 5 are coprime, there are solutions. For example, p=4, q=3: 4*4 -5*3 = 16 -15 = 1. So yes. But how to reach that without going out of bounds.\n\nBut to reach this, the frog would have to make 4 forward jumps and 3 backward jumps. However, during this process, the frog might have gone out of the allowed range. For example, let's simulate:\n\nStart at 0.\n\nJump forward to 4 (valid).\n\nJump forward to 8 (valid).\n\nJump forward to 12 (invalid if x=8). So this path isn't possible.\n\nSo maybe the frog can't reach 1 when x=8.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the threshold X may not be a + b - 1. So this contradicts the earlier hypothesis.\n\nSo what's wrong here? Well, the equation 4p -5q = 1 has solutions, but the path to reach it may require steps that go beyond x.\n\nSo the problem is not just about whether the position is reachable via some combination of steps, but also whether the path to reach it stays within [0, x].\n\nThis makes the problem much more complex.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's consider that the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (where d = gcd(a, b)) and are between 0 and x, provided that x >= some value. But how to find this value?\n\nPerhaps the key is to realize that once the frog can reach a position that is at least b, then it can generate all positions down to 0 by subtracting b steps. But for that, the frog must be able to reach at least b.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nLet's think of the case where a and b are coprime. To reach a position >= b, the frog needs to have made enough forward jumps. For example, if a=4 and b=5, then the frog can jump forward once to reach 4 (which is less than b=5). Then forward again to 8 (which is >=5). So for x >= 8, the frog can reach 8. From there, subtracting 5 steps gives 3. From 3, can't subtract 5 (would be -2). So how to reach other positions.\n\nBut 3 is less than b=5. So from 3, the frog can add a steps to reach 3+4=7. From 7, subtract 5 to get 2. From 2, add 4 to get 6. Subtract 5 to get 1. From 1, add 4 to get 5. Subtract 5 to get 0. So for x >= 8, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. Because once it reaches 8, it can generate positions 3,7,2,6,1,5,0. And from those positions, adding a steps can reach higher positions.\n\nBut for x=8, the positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8 are reachable. But what about 4?\n\nHow to reach 4?\n\nFrom 0, jump forward once to 4. So yes. So for x=8, the frog can reach 4. So all positions from 0 to 8 are reachable. Hence, the threshold X is a + b - 1.\n\nSo for a=4, b=5, X=8. And for x=8, all positions are reachable.\n\nSo earlier confusion was due to a mistake in thinking about the path. The frog can reach 4 directly by one forward jump.\n\nSo, in this case, the threshold seems to be a + b - 1. Once x >= a + b - 1, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x.\n\nSo, assuming that this is the case, then for the general case where d = gcd(a, b), the threshold X is (a + b - 1) / d ? Or perhaps (a/d + b/d - 1) * d ?\n\nWait, because after dividing a and b by d, they become coprime. So the threshold for the reduced a' and b' is a' + b' - 1. Then, multiplying back by d, the threshold would be (a' + b' - 1) * d. Which equals ( (a/d) + (b/d) - 1 ) * d = a + b -d.\n\nSo for the general case, the threshold X is a + b - d, where d = gcd(a, b).\n\nLet me test this with previous examples.\n\nFirst example: a=5, b=3, d=1. X = 5+3-1 =7. Which matches the first case. And for x=7, the frog can reach all positions.\n\nSecond example: a=3, b=2, d=1. X=3+2-1=4. Which matches the earlier example.\n\nThird example: a=4, b=5, d=1. X=4+5-1=8. Which works.\n\nAnother example: a=2, b=2, d=2. Then a'=1, b'=1. Threshold X is (1+1-1)*2 = 2. For x >= 2, the frog can reach all multiples of d=2 in [0, x]. So for x=2, positions are 0 and 2. For x=3, positions are 0 and 2. For x=4, positions are 0, 2, 4. So yes, once x >= 2, the frog can reach all multiples of 2 up to x. So the threshold is indeed 2.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nThus, the general formula is: For a given x, if x >= X, where X = a + b - d (d = gcd(a, b)), then f(x) = floor(x / d) + 1. Otherwise, f(x) is less than that.\n\nSo now, the problem becomes:\n\nCompute for each i from 0 to m, f(i), where f(i) is:\n\nif i >= X: floor(i / d) + 1\n\nelse: the number of positions reachable under the constraints.\n\nBut how to compute the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m.\n\nBut for large m (up to 1e9), we need to compute this efficiently.\n\nThe challenge is to compute the sum of f(i) for i < X, and then add the sum for i >= X.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n2. Compute X = a + b - d.\n\n3. For i < X, compute f(i) and sum them.\n\n4. For i >= X, f(i) = floor(i/d) + 1. Sum this from i = X to m.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for i < X?\n\nBut X could be up to a + b - d. Since a and b are up to 1e5, X could be up to 2e5. So for m up to 1e9, this part is manageable.\n\nSo, for example, if m is 1e9 and X is 2e5, then we can precompute f(i) for i from 0 to min(m, X-1), and sum those, then compute the sum for the rest.\n\nBut how to compute f(i) for i < X?\n\nTo compute f(i) for each i < X, we can model it as a BFS or dynamic programming problem. Since X is up to 2e5, this is feasible.\n\nBut how to model the reachable positions for each i?\n\nWait, for each i, f(i) is the number of positions reachable with the constraint that during the journey, the frog never goes outside [0, i].\n\nBut for each i, the reachable positions are different. So computing f(i) for all i up to X-1 might be expensive if done naively.\n\nBut since X is up to 2e5, we can precompute for all i up to X, the reachable positions. However, doing this for each i separately is O(X^2), which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: For each position k, determine the minimal x where k is reachable. Then, for all i >= x, k is counted in f(i). But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternative idea: For all i up to X, compute the reachable positions using BFS with the constraint that the frog can't go beyond i. But this would be O(X * (X)) in the worst case, which for X=2e5 is 4e10 operations. Not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Since X is up to 2e5, and for each i up to X, the maximum possible reachable positions is i+1, perhaps we can precompute for all positions up to X, the reachable positions, using a dynamic programming approach.\n\nLet me think: For each position k, we can mark whether it is reachable for the maximum x = X. Then, for each i, f(i) is the number of positions reachable up to i.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think of it as follows: the frog can reach certain positions, and for each position k, the minimal x required to reach it is the maximum between k and the positions it came from. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for the entire range up to X, the frog can reach certain positions. Once we know which positions are reachable when x is X, then for any i >= k (where k is a reachable position), f(i) will include k if i >= k. But this is only true",
