He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that matches the assignments.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the main idea is that for the correct string s, the prefixes and suffixes must match. For example, the prefix of length k is the first k characters of s, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters.\n\nBut since the input strings are all the prefixes and suffixes (but not knowing which is which), we need to find an assignment where for the chosen s, the set of prefixes and suffixes matches the input.\n\nBut how do I find such an s? Because the input could be in any order, and we have to assign P and S labels.\n\nAn approach could be:\n\nFor each possible candidate string s (of length n), check if all the input strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s. Then, once we find such an s, we can assign P and S accordingly.\n\nBut since n can be up to 100, the number of possible s is huge (26^100 possibilities). That's impossible to check directly.\n\nSo we need another approach.\n\nAlternative idea: The correct s must have all the prefixes and suffixes given in the input. But how can we reconstruct s?\n\nAnother observation: The longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be such that their combination gives the full string. For example, suppose the longest prefix is P and the longest suffix is S. Then, the full string s would be P + last character of S (but wait, the longest prefix is length n-1, so the full string is that prefix plus one character. Similarly, the longest suffix is length n-1, so the full string is one character plus that suffix. Therefore, combining the two, the full string must be the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1. But also, the suffix of length n-1 must be the last n-1 characters of s, which would be the last character of the prefix (since the prefix is length n-1) plus the rest?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. Suppose the full string is s. Then the longest prefix (length n-1) is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix (length n-1) is s[1..n-1]. So, the first n-1 characters and the last n-1 characters. Therefore, the full string s is the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Wait, no. Because the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So the first character of the full string is s[0], and the last character is s[n-1]. The longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, combining these two, the full string s is equal to (longest prefix) + (last character of the longest suffix). But the longest prefix is length n-1, and the longest suffix is also length n-1. So, the full string is the longest prefix plus the last character of the longest suffix. However, the last character of the longest suffix is s[n-1], which is the last character of the full string. But the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], so the full string is s[0..n-2] + s[n-1]. But the longest suffix is s[1..n-1], so s[0] is the first character of the full string, and the longest suffix starts at position 1.\n\nTherefore, if we have the longest prefix (P) and the longest suffix (S), then the full string s must be P + (last character of S). Also, the full string s must be (first character of S) + S. Because S is the suffix of length n-1, which is s[1..n-1]. So the first character of S is s[1], and the full string is s[0] + S. So combining these two equations:\n\ns = P + (last character of S)\ns = (first character of S) + S\n\nTherefore, the first character of S must be equal to the first character of P. Because P is the first n-1 characters of s, and the first character of S is s[1], which is the second character of P. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the full string is \"ababa\" (from the first example). Then the longest prefix (n-1=4) is \"abab\", and the longest suffix is \"baba\". So the full string is \"abab\" + 'a' (the last character of the suffix). Also, the full string is (first character of the suffix) is 'b' plus the suffix \"baba\" gives \"bbaba\"? No, that's not right. Wait, the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\", which is s[1..4] (assuming 0-based indices). The full string is s[0] + s[1..4] = s[0] + \"baba\". So for s to be \"ababa\", s[0] is 'a', so the full string is \"a\" + \"baba\" = \"ababa\", which matches. Also, the longest prefix is \"abab\" (the first 4 characters), and the full string is \"abab\" + 'a' (the last character of the suffix \"baba\").\n\nSo, combining the two, the first character of the suffix (S) is s[1], and the full string is s[0] + S. Also, the full string is P + (last character of S). So, the last character of S is s[n-1], which is the same as the last character of the full string.\n\nSo, for the full string s, the longest prefix (P) and the longest suffix (S) must satisfy:\n\ns = P + (last character of S)\ns = (first character of S) + S\n\nTherefore, combining these two equations:\n\nP + last_char(S) = first_char(S) + S.\n\nBut since P is of length n-1 and S is of length n-1, then:\n\nLet me denote the length of S as m = n-1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nP + last_char(S) = first_char(S) + S.\n\nBut since S has length m, then the first_char(S) is the first character of S. Let me think about the lengths. The left side is length m + 1 (since P is length m, and adding one character), which equals the right side (length m + 1). So, the entire string is equal to both expressions.\n\nLooking at the first m characters of the left side: P. The first m characters of the right side is first_char(S) followed by the first m-1 characters of S. So for these to be equal, we have:\n\nP = first_char(S) + S[0..m-2]\n\nBut P is the first m characters of s, which is s[0..m-1]. And S is the last m characters of s, which is s[1..m]. Therefore, the first m characters of s is P, which is s[0..m-1], and the first character of S is s[1], and the next m-1 characters of S are s[2..m].\n\nSo, the equation P = first_char(S) + S[0..m-2] implies that:\n\ns[0..m-1] = s[1] + s[2..m]\n\nWhich implies that s[0] = s[1], s[1] = s[2], ..., s[m-1] = s[m] ?\n\nWait, no. Let's look at the first character of P: s[0] must equal the first character of the right side, which is first_char(S) = s[1]. Therefore, s[0] = s[1]. Then, the second character of P is s[1], which must equal the second character of the right side, which is S[0], which is s[2]. So s[1] = s[2]. Similarly, third character of P is s[2], which must equal the third character of the right side, which is S[1], which is s[3]. So s[2] = s[3], etc. Continuing this way, we get that s[0] = s[1] = s[2] = ... = s[m] = s[n-1]. Which implies that the entire string s is made of the same character. But this is only true if the string is all the same letters, like \"aaa\".\n\nBut in the first example, the string is \"ababa\", which is not all same letters. So this suggests that my previous reasoning is wrong. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh! Because in the example, the longest prefix (length 4) is \"abab\", and the longest suffix (length 4) is \"baba\". Let's check the equation:\n\nP is \"abab\", and S is \"baba\". Then, according to the equation, P + last_char(S) = \"abab\" + 'a' = \"ababa\". On the other hand, first_char(S) is 'b', and adding S gives \"b\" + \"baba\" = \"bbaba\". Which is not equal to \"ababa\". So clearly, my previous assumption that combining those two equations gives equality is incorrect. So what's wrong here?\n\nAh, because in this case, the S is not the longest suffix. Wait, the longest suffix is of length n-1 = 4, which is the last 4 characters of s. For the string \"ababa\", the last four characters are \"baba\". So the full string is s = \"ababa\" = \"abab\" (prefix) + 'a' (last character of S). Also, s = first character of S (which is 'b') + S (\"baba\") would be \"bbaba\", which is not equal to \"ababa\". So this suggests that my earlier approach was wrong. Therefore, my previous line of thinking is invalid.\n\nSo, what's the correct way to relate the longest prefix and suffix?\n\nLet me think again. The full string s has the longest prefix P (length n-1) and the longest suffix S (length n-1). Therefore, P is s[0..n-2], S is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the full string is s = P + s[n-1], and also s = s[0] + S.\n\nSo, combining these two expressions, we have:\n\nP + s[n-1] = s[0] + S.\n\nBut since S is s[1..n-1], and P is s[0..n-2], substituting:\n\ns[0..n-2] + s[n-1] = s[0] + s[1..n-1]\n\nWhich is obviously true. Because the left side is s[0] s[1] ... s[n-2] s[n-1], and the right side is s[0] s[1] ... s[n-1]. So they are the same. Therefore, this equation is always true, and doesn't give us any new information. So that approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternative idea: For the correct string s, all the given strings in the input must be either a prefix or a suffix of s. Therefore, for each input string, it must be a prefix or a suffix of s. So, if we can find a candidate s such that all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s, then we can assign P and S accordingly.\n\nBut how do we find such an s?\n\nBut considering that the input includes all prefixes and suffixes of s, except the full string. So for example, for each length k (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings in the input: one is the prefix of length k, the other is the suffix of length k. However, the problem says that the input is given in arbitrary order, and we have to assign which is which.\n\nBut the problem allows any assignment that is compatible with at least one s. So perhaps the way to proceed is to find the possible candidates for s, and for each candidate, check if all the input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s, and then assign the labels accordingly.\n\nBut how to find possible candidates for s?\n\nLet me think. The full string s must have the following properties:\n\n- For each length k from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings in the input: one is the prefix of length k, and the other is the suffix of length k.\n\nSo, for example, the input contains the prefix of length 1 (s[0]), and the suffix of length 1 (s[-1]). So, the input must contain two strings of length 1: one is s[0], and the other is s[-1]. Similarly for other lengths.\n\nBut how can we find s? Well, for the full string s, the first character is the prefix of length 1, and the last character is the suffix of length 1. But in the input, there are two strings of length 1. So, one of them is the first character, and the other is the last character. So, for example, in the third sample input, the input is:\n\nn=2, and the two strings are 'a' and 'c'. So the possible s could be 'ac' (with prefix 'a' and suffix 'c') or 'ca' (prefix 'c' and suffix 'a'). Hence the output can be PS or SP.\n\nSo, for the general case, the first character of s must be one of the two strings of length 1, and the last character must be the other. Then, for the longer lengths, we can try to build the string.\n\nBut how can we find s?\n\nAn alternative approach is to consider that the full string s must have the following properties:\n\n- The prefix of length n-1 is present in the input (as one of the strings of length n-1). Similarly, the suffix of length n-1 is present in the input.\n\nMoreover, the full string s can be constructed as follows:\n\ns = prefix of length n-1 + last character of s.\n\nBut the last character of s is the suffix of length 1. So, if we can find the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length 1, then we can construct s as prefix + suffix_char.\n\nSimilarly, s can also be constructed as first_char + suffix of length n-1. So, the first character is the prefix of length 1, and the suffix of length n-1 is present in the input.\n\nSo, here's an idea: for each possible pair of strings (one of length n-1, and one of length 1), we can try to construct s as the prefix of length n-1 + the last character (the length 1 string). Then, check if this candidate s satisfies that all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nBut how many possibilities are there for this pair?\n\nFor the length n-1 strings, there are exactly two options. For each of these, and for each of the two length 1 strings, we have 2*2=4 possibilities. For each such possibility, we can generate a candidate s, and then check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nOnce we find such an s, we can assign the labels accordingly.\n\nThis seems feasible since for n up to 100, the number of possibilities is small (only 4 per candidate). Let's think about the steps:\n\n1. For the given input, collect all the strings grouped by their lengths. For example, for each length k, we have two strings.\n\n2. Take the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates_p (possible prefixes) and candidates_s (possible suffixes).\n\n3. For each possible candidate_p (the prefix of length n-1), and for each possible candidate_s (the suffix of length 1), construct the candidate s as candidate_p + last_char (the candidate_s). Then, check whether the suffix of length n-1 (which is s[1:]) is present in the input (as one of the strings of length n-1). Also, check if the prefix of length 1 (s[0]) is present in the input strings of length 1.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because for the candidate s, the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:], which must be one of the two strings of length n-1. Similarly, the prefix of length 1 is s[0], which must be one of the two strings of length 1.\n\nSo, for example, let's say we pick a candidate_p (a string of length n-1) and a candidate_s1 (a string of length 1). Then, s_candidate = candidate_p + candidate_s1. Then, the suffix of length n-1 of s_candidate is s_candidate[1:] = candidate_p[1:] + candidate_s1. This must be one of the two strings of length n-1 in the input. Also, the prefix of length 1 is candidate_p[0], which must be one of the two strings of length 1 in the input.\n\nIf that's the case, then this s_candidate may be a valid candidate.\n\nOnce we have such an s_candidate, we can check all the input strings to see if each is either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nIf yes, then this s_candidate is valid, and we can proceed to assign the labels.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- For each possible candidate_p (each of the two strings of length n-1):\n\n   - For each possible candidate_s1 (each of the two strings of length 1):\n\n      - Construct s_candidate = candidate_p + candidate_s1.\n\n      - Check if the suffix of length n-1 of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate[1:]) is present in the list of strings of length n-1 (excluding candidate_p? Or including? Well, since there are exactly two strings of length n-1, and one is the prefix, the other is the suffix. So, the suffix of length n-1 must be one of the two. So, check if s_candidate[1:] is one of the two strings of length n-1.)\n\n      - Also check if the prefix of length 1 (s_candidate[0]) is one of the two strings of length 1.\n\n      - If both conditions are met, proceed to check all the input strings to see if they are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate.\n\nOnce such a candidate s is found, then we can proceed to assign labels.\n\nOnce we have such an s_candidate, the next step is to assign for each input string whether it is a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. However, since there are two strings for each length, we need to make sure that for each length k, exactly one is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut how do we do that?\n\nFor example, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, then it's a P. Else, check if it's a suffix. If it's neither, then this s_candidate is invalid.\n\nBut since the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be valid (i.e., there exists at least one s), then once we find a valid s_candidate, the input strings must be exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate.\n\nSo, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, then for each input string, we can assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix? For example, in the second sample input, the string is \"aaa\", so for k=2, the prefix and suffix are both \"aa\". But in the input, there are two \"aa\" strings. So, in this case, both are prefixes and suffixes. But according to the problem statement, for each length, there are exactly two strings, which are the prefix and suffix. So, if the prefix and suffix are the same, then both of the input strings for that length must be assigned as either P or S. However, since the problem says that the answer can be any valid assignment as long as there exists at least one possible s, then for such cases, we can assign one as P and the other as S, even though they are the same string.\n\nSo, during the assignment phase, for each input string, we need to determine whether it is a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. However, for each length k, exactly one of the two input strings must be a prefix (and the other must be a suffix). But how to ensure that?\n\nWait, no. Because for each length k, the prefix and suffix are unique. So, for example, for a given k, there's exactly one prefix (the first k characters) and exactly one suffix (the last k characters). So, the input has two strings for each k. One of them must be the prefix, the other the suffix. But if the prefix and suffix are the same (like in the case of \"aaa\"), then both input strings for that length are the same. So, for the assignment, both can be marked as P and S, but the problem allows any assignment as long as there exists at least one s. So in that case, the assignment can be any combination as long as for each k, one of the two is P and the other is S.\n\nBut how do we assign the labels when multiple possibilities exist? Well, the problem allows any valid assignment. So, for example, in the case where two input strings for a certain length are the same, we can choose either to be P and the other S.\n\nBut during the assignment phase, for each input string, we need to check if it is a prefix or a suffix. However, for a given k, there's exactly one prefix and one suffix. So, for each input string, if it is the prefix, then assign P; else, if it is the suffix, assign S. However, if the input has two strings that are the same (for a particular k), then both are the same as the prefix and suffix. So, for that case, both can be marked as P or S, but we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that programmatically?\n\nOnce we have the s_candidate, for each input string, we can check whether it is a prefix of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate starts with the string) or a suffix (ends with the string). But since the input strings are all prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate, each input string must be either a prefix or a suffix.\n\nOnce that is determined, for each input string, we can assign 'P' or 'S'.\n\nBut for the same string appearing twice (for a certain k), we need to assign one as P and the other as S. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can just assign them as needed, perhaps by checking which one comes first in the input.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nOnce we have the s_candidate, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix or a suffix. However, there's a possibility that a string is both a prefix and a suffix (like in the case of \"aaa\"). For example, for the string \"aaa\", the prefix of length 2 is \"aa\" and the suffix of length 2 is \"aa\". So, for an input string \"aa\", it's both a prefix and a suffix. So, how to decide whether to assign it as P or S?\n\nIn this case, we need to make sure that for each length k, exactly one of the two input strings is marked as P and the other as S. However, since the input has two strings of length k, and for each k, exactly one is a prefix and one is a suffix, even if they are the same string, we need to assign one as P and one as S.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nWell, during the assignment process, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix. If it is, then assign P. Else, assign S. But in the case where the string is both a prefix and a suffix, we need to decide which one to assign.\n\nBut for the problem, since the answer can be any valid assignment, we can assign one of them as P and the other as S. However, during the assignment, we need to make sure that for each k, exactly one of the two strings is marked as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how can we do that? For example, if there are two identical strings for a certain k, and both are prefixes and suffixes, then we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to track which ones are which?\n\nOne approach is to collect for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix, but when there are duplicates, we need to ensure that for each k, exactly one is P and one is S.\n\nBut perhaps the easiest way is to process each input string, and for each, check if it is a prefix. If it is, mark it as P. Otherwise, mark as S. However, this may lead to cases where for a certain k, both strings are marked as P (if they are both prefixes). But that's not possible, since for each k, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix.\n\nWait, but the input has exactly two strings for each k. So, for a given k, there is exactly one prefix (the first k characters of s_candidate) and exactly one suffix (the last k characters of s_candidate). Therefore, among the two input strings of length k, exactly one is the prefix and one is the suffix. So, for each input string of length k, it is either the prefix or the suffix. Therefore, when checking each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix. So, for each input string, if it is the prefix, assign P, else assign S. However, in the case where the two input strings for a certain k are the same (i.e., the prefix and suffix are the same), then both will pass the check for being a prefix and a suffix. How to resolve that?\n\nIn this case, for example, if the input strings for k are both \"aa\", and the s_candidate is \"aaa\", then both strings are prefixes and suffixes. So, for each of these two strings, when we check if it is a prefix, it will be true. So, when we assign P to both, that would be wrong because for that k, there should be exactly one P and one S.\n\nSo, how to handle that?\n\nWe need to make sure that for each k, exactly one of the two input strings is marked as P and the other as S. Therefore, during the assignment, after checking for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix, we need to track for each k, how many P and S are assigned. But that may be complicated.\n\nAlternative idea: For each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If it is, then we can assign it as P, but we also need to ensure that for each k, there is exactly one P. However, this may not be possible if there are two input strings of the same k that are both prefixes. But since the input is generated from the prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate, this situation can only happen if the prefix and suffix of that k are the same. So, for that k, the two input strings are the same. In that case, we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do this programmatically?\n\nPerhaps, for each k, we can collect the two input strings. Then, for each of them, check if they are the prefix or suffix. For example, for k, the prefix is s_candidate[:k], and the suffix is s_candidate[-k:]. So, for each input string of length k, check if it's equal to the prefix or the suffix. Once we have that, we can assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. For each input string, we can check if it's equal to the prefix of s_candidate of that length. If yes, assign P. Else, check if it's equal to the suffix of that length. Assign S. However, if the input string is equal to both (i.e., the prefix and suffix are the same for that k), then we need to assign one as P and the other as S. But how to choose which one?\n\nBut since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S, or vice versa. However, since the input is given in arbitrary order, we need to make sure that for each k, exactly one of the two input strings is marked as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, here's an approach:\n\nOnce we have s_candidate, for each input string, we can check if it is the prefix of that length. For example, for a given input string of length k, check if it equals s_candidate[:k]. If yes, then assign P. Else, check if it equals s_candidate[-k:]. If yes, assign S. However, if the input string equals both (i.e., the prefix and suffix for k are same), then we can assign P to one and S to the other. But how to differentiate between the two?\n\nBut since the input has exactly two strings of length k, and they are the same, then both will pass the check for being prefix and suffix. So, for example, for the input strings, both are the same. We can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to decide which one?\n\nIn this case, during the assignment, for each k, we can check if the two input strings are the same. If they are, then assign one as P and the other as S. For example, in the input, for the two strings of length k, the first one can be assigned as P, and the second as S. Or vice versa.\n\nBut how to track which is which in code?\n\nPerhaps, for each k, we can collect the two input strings. Then, for each of them, check if it's the prefix. If both are the prefix (because they are the same as the prefix and suffix), then we can assign the first one as P and the second as S.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. However, if both are prefixes (same string), then both would be assigned P. Which is invalid. So, this approach would fail.\n\nThus, we need a way to ensure that for each k, exactly one of the two input strings is assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nFor each k (from 1 to n-1):\n\n   - Get the two input strings of length k.\n\n   - Check which one is the prefix (s_candidate[:k]) and which is the suffix (s_candidate[-k:]).\n\n   - Assign P to the one that is the prefix, and S to the one that is the suffix.\n\nBut since the two input strings may be same, but they are the prefix and suffix, we need to check which one is which.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, for each k, the prefix is s_candidate[:k], and the suffix is s_candidate[-k:]. So, for the two input strings of length k, one must be equal to the prefix, and the other equal to the suffix. Even if they are the same (prefix == suffix), then both input strings are equal to the prefix and suffix. So, in this case, both input strings are the same as the prefix and suffix, and we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, for each k, we can collect the two input strings. Then, for each of them, check if it's equal to the prefix. If exactly one of them is equal to the prefix, then assign P to that one and S to the other. If both are equal to the prefix (i.e., the prefix and suffix are same), then assign P to one and S to the other.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nIn code, for each k:\n\n   prefix_k = s_candidate[:k]\n\n   suffix_k = s_candidate[-k:]\n\n   for the two input strings of length k:\n\n      if string == prefix_k:\n\n         assign P\n\n      else:\n\n         assign S\n\nBut if both are equal to prefix_k (which is same as suffix_k), then both would be assigned P. Which is invalid. So, how to avoid that?\n\nAh, but in reality, for each k, the two input strings are the prefix and suffix of s_candidate. So, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. So, if they are same, then both are the prefix and suffix. So, for each of the two input strings, they are both the prefix and suffix. Therefore, in this case, we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, during the assignment, for each k, we can check which of the two input strings is the prefix, and which is the suffix. But since the input strings may be same, we need to find which one is which.\n\nBut how? Well, for example, the two input strings for k may be the same. So, both are the prefix and the suffix. So, in this case, we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that in code? Well, perhaps for each k, we can check if the two input strings are same. If they are, then assign the first one as P and the second as S. Else, check which one is the prefix and assign accordingly.\n\nBut how to track which input strings belong to which k?\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\nOnce we have s_candidate, we can generate for each k, the prefix and suffix strings. Then, for each input string, we can determine which k it belongs to (its length), and then compare it to the prefix and suffix of that k. Then, assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut the problem is that the input strings are given in arbitrary order. So, for each input string, we need to know its length and compare it to the corresponding prefix and suffix.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\nOnce s_candidate is determined, we can create a dictionary for each length k, storing the prefix and suffix strings. Then, for each input string, based on its length, check if it's equal to the prefix or suffix for that length. Then assign accordingly.\n\nBut for the case where the two input strings for a certain k are the same, and both are equal to the prefix and suffix, we need to assign one as P and the other as S. How?\n\nIn this case, for that k, the two input strings are same. So, when processing them, we can assign the first one as P and the second as S.\n\nBut how to track which input strings are processed first for each k?\n\nWell, perhaps for each k, collect all the input strings of that length. Then, for each of them, check if they are the prefix or suffix. For example:\n\nFor each k in 1..n-1:\n\n   collect all input strings of length k (there are exactly two)\n\n   for the first input string in this group:\n\n      if it equals prefix_k: assign P\n\n      else: assign S\n\n   for the second input string in this group:\n\n      if it equals prefix_k: assign P\n\n      else: assign S\n\nBut if the two strings are same, then both will be assigned P (if prefix_k is same as the string) or both S. Which is invalid.\n\nWait, but in that case, the two input strings are the same. But the prefix and suffix for that k are same. So, for the two input strings, one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. So, in reality, they are both the prefix and suffix. Therefore, we can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nMaybe, for each k, if the two input strings are same, then assign the first as P and the second as S. Otherwise, assign the one that matches the prefix as P, and the other as S.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each k in 1..n-1:\n\n   prefix_k = s_candidate[:k]\n\n   suffix_k = s_candidate[-k:]\n\n   input_strings_of_k = list of input strings of length k (in the order they were given)\n\n   for the first string in input_strings_of_k:\n\n      if it == prefix_k:\n\n         assign 'P'\n\n      else:\n\n         assign 'S'\n\n   for the second string in input_strings_of_k:\n\n      if it == prefix_k:\n\n         assign 'P'\n\n      else:\n\n         assign 'S'\n\nBut in the case where both strings are same as prefix_k, then both would be assigned 'P', which is invalid. But in reality, the two input strings are the same, but one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. So, in this case, we need to assign one as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\nSo, perhaps, for the two input strings of length k, if they are same, then assign the first as 'P' and the second as 'S'.\n\nBut how to check if they are same? Well, for each k, the two input strings of length k are same if input_strings_of_k[0] == input_strings_of_k[1].\n\nSo, modifying the code:\n\nfor each k in",
