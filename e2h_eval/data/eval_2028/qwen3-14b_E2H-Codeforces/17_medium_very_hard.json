He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign each input string as either a prefix (P) or suffix (S) such that there exists at least one string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The answer can be any valid possibility as long as there exists at least one possible s that fits.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to find a way to determine for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of some possible s. But since there are multiple possibilities, I need to find an assignment that works.\n\nBut how can I find such an assignment? Let's think about the possible candidates for the full string s.\n\nThe key observation here is that the correct string s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. However, since each of the input strings is either a prefix or suffix of s, the actual s can be determined by combining the longest possible prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample input, the correct s is \"ababa\". The longest prefix is \"abab\" (length 4), and the longest suffix is \"baba\" (length 4). But when you combine them, the overlapping parts must match. So for the full string s, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must overlap correctly. For example, the longest prefix of s is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the longest prefix and the longest suffix must share the first n-2 characters (if they are both of length n-1). Wait, no. The longest prefix is of length n-1, and the longest suffix is also of length n-1. So the full string s must be such that the prefix of length n-1 is s[0...n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1]. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of the prefix must equal the last n-2 characters of the suffix. So, for example, if the prefix is \"abab\" (length 4) and the suffix is \"baba\" (length 4), then the first 3 letters of the prefix (aba) must equal the last 3 letters of the suffix (aba). Which they do. Then the full string is the prefix plus the last character of the suffix. So in this case, the full string would be \"abab\" + 'a' = \"ababa\".\n\nSo, the approach could be:\n\n1. Find the possible candidates for the full string s. Each candidate can be constructed by taking one of the input strings of length n-1 as the prefix, and another of length n-1 as the suffix, and checking if they can be combined into a single string.\n\nBut how do I choose which ones to take?\n\nAlternatively, since the correct s must have exactly one prefix of each length from 1 to n-1, and same for suffixes. But since the input has two strings of each length, perhaps the correct s is such that for each length l, one of the two strings of length l is a prefix, and the other is a suffix.\n\nBut how to find which one is which?\n\nAnother idea: the correct s must be such that the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must overlap. So, for each pair of strings of length n-1, check if they can form a valid s. If they can, then that s is a candidate. Once we have such a candidate s, we can check all the other input strings to see if they are prefixes or suffixes of s. Then, assign P or S accordingly.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- For all possible pairs of input strings of length n-1, check if they can form a valid s. For example, take a string p (prefix) and s (suffix). The combined string would be p + (the last character of the suffix). But wait, the prefix is of length n-1, and the suffix is of length n-1. So the full string s must be such that the prefix is s[0...n-2], and the suffix is s[1...n-1]. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of the prefix must equal the last n-2 characters of the suffix. So, the prefix and suffix must agree on the overlapping part. So, for example, if the prefix is P and the suffix is S, then P[0...n-2-1] must equal S[1...n-1-1], i.e., P[0...n-2] is the first n-1 characters of s, and S[0...n-2] is the last n-1 characters. Wait, maybe I should think of the full string s as being formed by combining the prefix of length n-1 (say, p) and the suffix of length n-1 (say, s). Then, the first n-1 characters of s are p, and the last n-1 characters are s. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of p must be the same as the last n-2 characters of s. Because the first n-1 characters of s are p, and the last n-1 are s. So the first n-2 characters of p are the same as the last n-2 characters of s. Therefore, the full string s is p concatenated with the last character of s (which is the last character of the suffix). Wait, but the suffix is of length n-1. So the full string is p[0...n-2] followed by s's last character. But since the first n-1 characters of s are p, and the last n-1 are s, then the s is p[0...n-2] + s[-1].\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nFor example, let's take p as the prefix of length n-1 and s as the suffix of length n-1. Then, the full string s must be p + (s's last character). But also, the suffix of length n-1 of s is s. So the last n-1 characters of the full string s must be s. So the full string is p + (s's last character). Let's call this candidate string candidate_s. Then, the last n-1 characters of candidate_s must be equal to the suffix s. Let's check that.\n\nThe candidate_s is of length n. The last n-1 characters of candidate_s are the last n-1 characters of p + s[-1]. Since p is of length n-1, adding s[-1] makes it length n. So the last n-1 characters are p[1:] + s[-1]. So this must be equal to the suffix s. Therefore, p[1:] + s[-1] must equal s.\n\nSo, for example, if p is \"abab\" (length 4, n=5), and s is \"baba\" (length 4). Then p[1:] is \"bab\", and adding the last character of s (a) gives \"baba\", which is equal to s. So this is valid. Then candidate_s is p + s[-1] = \"abab\" + \"a\" = \"ababa\".\n\nSo the condition is that p[1:] + s[-1] == s. So for each pair of strings (p, s) of length n-1, we can check if this condition holds. If yes, then candidate_s is p + s[-1], and then we can check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of candidate_s.\n\nOnce we have such a candidate_s, we can then check all the input strings and assign them as P or S based on whether they are a prefix or suffix of candidate_s.\n\nBut how do I find which pair of (prefix, suffix) of length n-1 is the correct one? Because there could be multiple possibilities. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there's at least one such candidate.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible pairs of input strings of length n-1. For each pair (a, b), check if a is a possible prefix and b a possible suffix. That is, check if a[1:] + b[-1] == b. If so, then candidate_s = a + b[-1].\n\n2. Once a candidate_s is found, check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of candidate_s. If yes, then this candidate is valid. Then, assign P/S accordingly.\n\n3. Once such a candidate is found, we can proceed to generate the output.\n\nBut how do I handle cases where there are multiple possible candidates? Well, the problem says that any valid answer is acceptable, so once we find a valid candidate, we can proceed with it.\n\nBut how to find the candidate? Let's think about the steps again.\n\nFirst, collect all the input strings. Then, for each possible pair of strings of length n-1, check if they can form a candidate_s as described. Once we find such a candidate, we can check if all other input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n\nBut even if a candidate is generated, it's possible that some input strings are neither prefixes nor suffixes. However, the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so there must be at least one candidate that works.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- For each pair of input strings (p, s) of length n-1:\n\n   - Check if p[1:] + s[-1] == s. If so, then candidate_s = p + s[-1]\n\n   - Then check for all input strings if each is a prefix or suffix of candidate_s.\n\n   - If all input strings are either a prefix or suffix of candidate_s, then this candidate is valid. Then, we can assign the labels accordingly.\n\nOnce such a candidate is found, we can proceed to generate the output.\n\nBut how to handle the case when there are multiple candidates? For example, if there are two different candidate strings that satisfy the conditions. However, since the problem allows any valid answer, we can pick the first candidate that works.\n\nNow, how to implement this in code?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the next 2n-2 lines as the list of strings.\n\nCollect all the strings in a list, say 'strings'.\n\nNow, for the candidate generation:\n\nWe need to find all pairs of strings of length n-1. Since there are exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings of length n-1. So for n=5, there are two strings of length 4. So the possible pairs are (s1, s2) and (s2, s1), but perhaps not all of them are valid.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample input, the two strings of length 4 are 'abab' and 'baba'. So for the pair (abab, baba), check if abab[1:] + baba[-1] equals baba. abab[1:] is 'bab', and adding 'a' gives 'baba', which equals the suffix. So this pair is valid. The candidate_s is 'abab' + 'a' = 'ababa'.\n\nIf we take the pair (baba, abab), then check if baba[1:] + abab[-1] equals abab. baba[1:] is 'aba', adding 'b' gives 'abab', which equals the suffix. So this pair is also valid. Then the candidate_s would be 'baba' + 'b' = 'babab'.\n\nWait, but in this case, the original correct string is 'ababa'. So why would the pair (baba, abab) produce a candidate 'babab'? But that would be another possible candidate. However, according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid, but the output can be any valid assignment. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be such that there exists at least one possible s. But perhaps for some inputs, there are multiple possible s's. However, in such cases, the code needs to find any one of them.\n\nBut how to check if the candidate_s is valid? For example, for the candidate_s 'babab', we need to check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it. Let's see.\n\nIn the first sample input, the input strings include 'a', 'ba', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba'.\n\nFor the candidate_s 'babab', let's check the input strings:\n\nFor example, the string 'abab' is of length 4. The prefix of length 4 of 'babab' is 'baba', which is not equal to 'abab'. So 'abab' would not be a prefix or suffix of 'babab'. Therefore, this candidate would be invalid. Hence, the pair (baba, abab) would not generate a valid candidate. Therefore, only the pair (abab, baba) would generate a valid candidate.\n\nSo, the code must check for each candidate_s whether all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nLoop through all possible pairs (p, s) of the two strings of length n-1. For each pair, check if p[1:] + s[-1] == s. If yes, then create candidate_s = p + s[-1]. Then, check if all input strings are either a prefix or suffix of candidate_s. If yes, then proceed to assign labels.\n\nOnce such a candidate is found, we can generate the output.\n\nNow, how to check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of candidate_s.\n\nFor each input string in the list, check if it is a prefix of candidate_s (i.e., candidate_s starts with the string) or a suffix (ends with the string). If for all strings, this is true, then the candidate is valid.\n\nOnce a valid candidate is found, we can proceed.\n\nNow, the problem is that for some cases, there may be multiple possible candidates. For example, in the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nThe two strings of length 2 (since n=3) are 'aa' and 'aa'. So the possible pairs are (aa, aa). Check if p[1:] + s[-1] equals s. p is 'aa', s is 'aa'. p[1:] is 'a', s[-1] is 'a'. So combining gives 'a' + 'a' = 'aa' which equals s. So candidate_s is 'aa' + 'a' = 'aaa'. Now, check all input strings. The input strings are: 'a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a'. All of these are prefixes or suffixes of 'aaa'. So this is valid.\n\nAnother possible candidate? Well, since the two strings of length 2 are same, the pair (aa, aa) is the only option. So the candidate is valid.\n\nSo, the code would generate the output for that.\n\nOnce the candidate is determined, the next step is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string. For each input string, check if it is a prefix of the candidate. If it is, then it's a prefix. Otherwise, it's a suffix. However, note that a string can be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the sample input 2, the string 'a' is both a prefix and suffix of 'aaa'. But in this case, the problem allows any assignment as long as the count of P and S is correct (i.e., n-1 P's and n-1 S's). Wait, the output must have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's, since there are 2n-2 strings. But the problem says that the number of P's and S's must be equal. So for each input string, we have to assign either P or S, but in such a way that the total counts are correct. However, the problem says that the input is such that there exists at least one valid assignment. So once we have the candidate, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix. But some strings might be both. How to decide which to assign?\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's allowed to choose any valid assignment. For example, in the second sample input, the correct string is 'aaa'. The input strings are 'a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a'. The two 'aa's are both prefixes and suffixes. So for each of them, we can choose to assign P or S. However, the output must have exactly 2 P's and 2 S's (since n=3, 2n-2=4, and n-1=2, so 2 P and 2 S). So for the two 'aa's, we need to assign one as P and one as S. Similarly for the 'a's.\n\nBut how to do that in code? For each input string, we can check if it's a prefix. If it is, assign P. Otherwise, assign S. But what if it's both? Then we can assign P or S, but need to make sure that the total counts are correct.\n\nBut perhaps the code can assign 'P' if the string is a prefix, else 'S'. However, this may not work in cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the third sample input, the input is:\n\n2\n\na\n\nc\n\nThe candidate could be 'ac' or 'ca'. For example, if the candidate is 'ac', then the input strings are 'a' (prefix) and 'c' (suffix). So the output is 'PS'. Alternatively, if the candidate is 'ca', the output is 'SP'. However, the problem says that any valid answer is acceptable. So in this case, the code can choose either.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the sample input 2, the string 'a' is both a prefix and a suffix of 'aaa'. So for each occurrence of 'a', we can assign either P or S. But the code needs to ensure that the total number of P's and S's is equal. However, since the input is guaranteed to have exactly two strings of each length, and the candidate is valid, then the code can safely assign P for the first occurrence and S for the second, or vice versa. But how?\n\nWait, the code can assign for each string: if it's a prefix, assign P. If it's not a prefix, assign S. However, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, then it can be assigned as P or S. However, in that case, the code can choose either. However, the problem says that the answer is acceptable as long as there exists at least one possible s. So the code can assign P if it's a prefix, else S. Because in the case where the string is both, the code can choose to assign P. Then, the counts will be correct.\n\nBut how to ensure that the counts are correct? Because for each length l, there are two strings. For the candidate s, exactly one of the two strings of length l must be a prefix (the other is a suffix). Or wait, no. For example, for the candidate 'aaa', the string 'a' is a prefix and a suffix. But there are two occurrences of 'a' in the input. Both are prefixes and suffixes. So in this case, both can be assigned as P or S, but the code must assign exactly one P and one S for those two. But if the code assigns both as P, then the total number of P's would be more than n-1.\n\nWait, this suggests that the approach of assigning P if it's a prefix is not sufficient. Because for some strings, they can be both prefix and suffix, but the code must choose between P and S to balance the counts.\n\nBut how can this happen?\n\nLet's think. For a candidate s, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings. For each of those strings, they must be either a prefix or a suffix. But for some l, one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix. For example, in the first sample input, the two strings of length 1 are 'a' and 'a'. Both are prefixes and suffixes of 'ababa'. So for each of those, we can assign P or S, but the total number of P's and S's must be n-1 each.\n\nBut how can we ensure that? For example, if the code assigns all strings that are prefixes as P and others as S, then in the case where a string is both, it's counted as P. However, for the same length l, there are two strings. Suppose both are prefixes. Then, the code would assign both as P. But for the candidate s, there can be only one prefix of each length. So this is impossible. Wait, but the candidate s has exactly one prefix of each length. So for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is a prefix (and the other is a suffix).\n\nWait, this is important. Because the input strings are all the improper prefixes and suffixes of s. So for each length l (from 1 to n-1), exactly one of the two input strings of that length is a prefix of s, and the other is a suffix. Because s has exactly one prefix of each length l, and exactly one suffix of each length l. Therefore, for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for each input string, it is either a prefix or a suffix of s, but not both. Wait, but this is only true if the two strings of the same length are different. If they are same, then they are both prefixes and suffixes. But how?\n\nWait, for example, take s = 'aaa' of length 3. The prefixes of lengths 1 and 2 are 'a' and 'aa'. The suffixes of lengths 1 and 2 are 'a' and 'aa'. So for length 1, there are two input strings: 'a' and 'a'. Both are prefixes and suffixes. So for this case, for each of the two 'a's, they can be assigned as prefix or suffix. But since there is exactly one prefix of length 1, and one suffix of length 1, but both are same strings. So how can that be?\n\nAh, because the input is guaranteed to be such that the given strings are the prefixes and suffixes of some existing string. So in this case, the input for length 1 has two 'a's. So the actual string s has one prefix of length 1 (a) and one suffix of length 1 (a). But since they are the same string, the input contains two copies of it. So for the code, when processing this, for each of the two 'a's, one must be assigned as P and the other as S. So how to decide which?\n\nIn this case, the code must assign exactly one P and one S for the two 'a's. But how to do that programmatically?\n\nThis complicates the approach of just checking if the string is a prefix. Because if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, the code must choose to assign it as P or S, but ensuring that for each length, exactly one is assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems like a problem. Because for a given candidate s, for each input string, it is either a prefix or a suffix. However, when two strings of the same length are the same, they are both a prefix and suffix. So for those, the code must assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nOnce the candidate s is determined, for each input string, check if it's a prefix. If yes, then it's a prefix. If not, it's a suffix. However, for strings that are both, this method would assign P. But since there are two copies of the same string for a certain length, this would cause both to be assigned as P, leading to an imbalance.\n\nBut how can that be? For example, in the case where s is 'aaa', and the input has two 'a's. The code would check if 'a' is a prefix. It is. So both would be assigned as P, leading to two P's for length 1, but the correct assignment requires one P and one S. Hence, this approach would fail.\n\nSo, this suggests that the initial approach of assigning P if the string is a prefix is not sufficient. We need to ensure that for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nThus, the problem becomes more complex. How can we handle this?\n\nAlternative idea: For each length l, collect the two input strings. For each of them, check which one is a prefix of s. Since exactly one of them is a prefix (because the input is valid), and the other is a suffix. However, if the two strings are the same, then both are prefixes and suffixes, but we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, for each length l, we can process the two input strings. For each pair of strings (str1, str2) of length l, we can check which one is a prefix of s. If they are different, then the one that is a prefix is assigned as P, the other as S. If they are the same, then we need to assign one as P and the other as S. But how to decide which?\n\nBut since the two strings are same, and they are both prefix and suffix of s, we can assign one as P and the other as S. For example, in the sample input 2, for the two 'a's (length 1), we can assign the first as P and the second as S, or vice versa. But how to do this in code?\n\nThe problem is that when the two strings are the same, we have to assign one as P and the other as S. But how to track which one is which?\n\nSo, perhaps the code should:\n\nOnce the candidate s is determined, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), collect the two input strings. For each of them, check if they are a prefix of s. For the two strings, exactly one of them is a prefix (but if they are the same, both are prefixes). Then, for each length l:\n\n- if the two strings are different: the one that is a prefix is assigned as P, the other as S.\n\n- if the two strings are same: assign one as P and the other as S. How? Well, perhaps in the order they appear in the input. For example, for the first occurrence, assign P, the second S. Or vice versa. But how to know which is which?\n\nBut the problem allows any valid assignment. So for the same strings, we can assign the first as P and the second as S, or the other way around. However, the code must ensure that for each length, exactly one P and one S are assigned.\n\nSo, the code can process all the input strings, and for each string, check if it is a prefix. But for the same strings, we need to avoid assigning both as P. How?\n\nPerhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each input string, we can check if it is a prefix of s. But for those strings that are both prefix and suffix, we need to track how many have been assigned as P for their length. For example, for a given length l, if there are two identical strings, and both are prefixes, then we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nOnce we have the candidate s, for each input string, check if it is a prefix. If yes, then it's a prefix. Else, it's a suffix. However, for cases where both strings are same and are prefixes, this would lead to both being assigned as P, which is invalid. So, this approach would not work.\n\nThus, the problem is that the code must assign exactly one P and one S per length, even when the two strings are same.\n\nSo, perhaps the code can, for each length l, collect the two input strings. Then, for each of them, check if it's a prefix. If exactly one is a prefix, assign it as P and the other as S. If both are prefixes (i.e., same string), then assign one as P and the other as S. How to choose which one?\n\nFor example, in the case of two 'a's for length 1, we can assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S. But how to track which occurrence is which?\n\nBut the input strings are given in arbitrary order. So the code can't assume that the first occurrence is the one to be assigned as P. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, the code can choose arbitrarily. For example, for each pair of same strings, assign the first as P and the second as S. But how to track which is which?\n\nThe code can process all the input strings, and for each string, check if it is a prefix. However, for each length l, we need to track how many times we have assigned P. For example, for each length l, we can have a counter. If the two strings are same, and both are prefixes, then we assign one as P and the other as S. But how to know which one to assign?\n\nPerhaps, for each length l, we can check the two strings. If they are same, then one of them must be assigned as P and the other as S. But since they are same, how to decide which one to assign as P and which as S? Well, since the problem allows any assignment, the code can choose to assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S, or vice versa.\n\nBut how to track which is which in the input list?\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the candidate s is determined, create a dictionary mapping each string to a list of indices where it appears in the input list. For each length l, collect the two input strings. For each of the two strings, check if they are a prefix of s. If they are different, then exactly one of them is a prefix. Assign that one as P and the other as S. If they are the same, then we need to assign one as P and one as S. So for the two occurrences of the same string, assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S.\n\nBut how to track which is which in the input list?\n\nAlternatively, for each length l, iterate through all the input strings and for each of the two strings of length l, check if it's a prefix. But for same strings, we need to assign one as P and the other as S. To do this, for each length l, after collecting the two strings, we can check if they are same. If they are same, then assign one as P and the other as S. But how to choose which one?\n\nBut since the code is allowed to choose any valid assignment, perhaps for the same strings, we can assign the first one as P and the second as S. However, the code needs to know which of the two strings in the input list is which.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose the input list for the second sample is:\n\n['a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a']\n\nn=3. The two strings of length 1 are 'a' and 'a' (positions 0 and 3). The two strings of length 2 are 'aa' and 'aa' (positions 1 and 2).\n\nFor length 1, the two strings are same. So for the first occurrence (input[0]), assign P, and the second occurrence (input[3]) assign S.\n\nFor length 2, the two strings are same. Assign first occurrence (input[1]) as P, second (input[2]) as S.\n\nBut how to find which strings belong to which length and which are duplicates?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce the candidate s is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. For each length l, collect all the input strings of that length. For each such group, if the two strings are different, then exactly one is a prefix. Assign that one as P, the other as S. If they are same, then assign one as P and the other as S. However, since they are same, the code can assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S.\n\nBut how to track which is which in the input list? The code can process the input strings in order, and for each length, keep track of how many times we've assigned P for that length.\n\nSo, for example, for each input string, we can:\n\nCheck its length. For that length, check if the current string is a prefix. If it is, and we haven't assigned a P yet for this length, assign P. Else, assign S. But this may not work for cases where both are same.\n\nAlternatively, for each length l, process the two strings. For example:\n\nCreate a dictionary that maps length l to the two strings. For each l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   get the two strings of length l.\n\n   if the two strings are different:\n\n       for each string, check if it is a prefix of s.\n\n       the one that is a prefix is assigned as P, the other as S.\n\n   else:\n\n       assign the first occurrence as P, the second as S.\n\nBut how to know which occurrence is which in the input list?\n\nBut the code can't directly know which input strings are for which length, since the input is given in arbitrary order. So the code needs to process the input strings, and for each of them, determine their length and group them accordingly.\n\nSo, the code can first group the input strings by their lengths. For example, for each length l, store a list of the strings of that length. Since for each l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, the code can create a dictionary, say, len_to_strings, where len_to_strings[l] is a list of two strings.\n\nOnce this is done, for each l, process the two strings in the list. For each of them, determine whether they are a prefix or suffix of s.\n\nBut for the case where the two strings are same, how to assign P and S? Well, for the first string in the list, assign P, and for the second, assign S.\n\nBut how to map this back to the original input order? Because the code needs to assign P/S to the original input strings in order.\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because grouping by length loses the original order. So, the code can't directly assign P/S to the original input strings unless it knows which input string belongs to which group.\n\nSo, here's a revised plan:\n\nOnce the candidate s is determined, for each input string, determine whether it is a prefix of s. However, for cases where two strings of the same length are same, and both are prefixes, we need to ensure that exactly one is assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nTo handle this, the code can:\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. However, for each length l, track how many times we've assigned P. For example, for each l, if the two strings are same, and both are prefixes, then for the first occurrence, assign P, and for the second, assign S.\n\nBut how to track which input string is the first occurrence of a particular string for a given length?\n\nThis seems complicated. Another approach: for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s. If yes, and for its length, it's the first such string, assign P. Otherwise, assign S. But how to track this?\n\nPerhaps for each length l, maintain a count of how many P's have been assigned. For example, for each l, if the two strings are same, then the first one in the input list (for that length) is assigned P, and the second S. But how to know which input strings belong to which l?\n\nThis seems challenging. Perhaps the code can pre-process the input strings, grouping them by length and storing their indices. For example:\n\ngrouped = { }\n\nfor i, string in enumerate(strings):\n\n    l = len(string)\n\n    if l not in grouped:\n\n        grouped[l] = []\n\n    grouped[l].append( (i, string) )\n\nThen, for each length l in grouped:\n\n   process the two entries (i, string) in grouped[l].\n\n   for each of the two entries, determine if the string is a prefix of s. \n\n   for example, if the two strings are different, then one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. Assign P to the prefix and S to the suffix.\n\n   if the two strings are same, then assign P to the first entry and S to the second.\n\nOnce this is done, the code can build the result array, which is initialized as a list of empty characters. For each processed entry (i, string), assign 'P' or 'S' to result[i].\n\nThis way, the code can handle the cases where the two strings are same.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nOnce the candidate s is found, the code proceeds as follows:\n\nInitialize a list of size 2n-2, filled with empty strings.\n\nGroup the input strings by their lengths, storing their indices.\n\nFor each length l from 1 to n-1:\n\n   get the two entries (i1, s1) and (i2, s2) from grouped[l].\n\n   if",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, but their order is not specified. Our task is to assign each string as either a prefix ('P') or a suffix ('S') such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with this assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidate String**: The unknown string `s` can be determined by combining the longest possible prefix and suffix of length `n-1`. This is because the longest prefix and suffix of `s` must overlap correctly.\n2. **Validate Candidate String**: For each pair of strings of length `n-1`, check if they can form a valid candidate string `s` by ensuring their overlap is correct.\n3. **Check All Strings**: Once a valid candidate string `s` is identified, check all input strings to see if they are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n4. **Assign Labels**: Based on the valid candidate string `s`, assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string. If two strings of the same length are identical, ensure one is assigned as 'P' and the other as 'S'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Function to check if a string is a prefix of s\n    def is_prefix(s, candidate):\n        return candidate.startswith(s)\n    \n    # Function to check if a string is a suffix of s\n    def is_suffix(s, candidate):\n        return candidate.endswith(s)\n    \n    # Find the candidate s\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    len_to_strings = defaultdict(list)\n    for idx, s in enumerate(strings):\n        len_to_strings[len(s)].append((idx, s))\n    \n    # Generate all possible pairs of length n-1\n    candidates = []\n    for key in len_to_strings:\n        if key == n-1:\n            lst = len_to_strings[key]\n            # Check all possible pairs (since there are exactly two)\n            for i in range(2):\n                for j in range(2):\n                    if i == j:\n                        continue\n                    p = lst[i][1]\n                    sfx = lst[j][1]\n                    # Check if p[1:] + sfx[-1] == sfx\n                    if len(p) == n-1 and len(sfx) == n-1:\n                        if p[1:] + sfx[-1] == sfx:\n                            candidate_s = p + sfx[-1]\n                            candidates.append(candidate_s)\n                            break\n    \n    # Now check each candidate_s\n    for candidate in candidates:\n        valid = True\n        for s in strings:\n            if not is_prefix(s, candidate) and not is_suffix(s, candidate):\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            break\n    \n    # Now assign P/S based on the candidate\n    result = [''] * len(strings)\n    grouped = defaultdict(list)\n    for idx, s in enumerate(strings):\n        grouped[len(s)].append((idx, s))\n    \n    for l in range(1, n):\n        entries = grouped[l]\n        if len(entries) != 2:\n            continue\n        idx1, s1 = entries[0]\n        idx2, s2 = entries[1]\n        # Check if s1 is a prefix of candidate\n        is_p1 = is_prefix(s1, candidate)\n        is_p2 = is_prefix(s2, candidate)\n        \n        if s1 == s2:\n            # Assign first as P, second as S\n            result[idx1] = 'P'\n            result[idx2] = 'S'\n        else:\n            if is_p1:\n                result[idx1] = 'P'\n                result[idx2] = 'S'\n            else:\n                result[idx2] = 'P'\n                result[idx1] = 'S'\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Candidate String Identification**: We generate possible candidate strings by combining pairs of strings of length `n-1` that can form a valid string `s`.\n3. **Validation**: Each candidate string is validated by checking if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n4. **Label Assignment**: For each length group, we determine if the strings are prefixes or suffixes.
