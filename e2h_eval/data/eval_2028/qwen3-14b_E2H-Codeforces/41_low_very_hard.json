There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. For each house, the profit is a^2 where a is the height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that in the range l_i to r_i, the tallest house must be at most x_i. Our goal is to maximize the total profit under these constraints.\n\nHmm. So how to model this? Since n and h and m are all up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach with some optimizations could work. But even 50^50 possibilities is way too big for brute force. So we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model this as a constraint satisfaction problem where we need to assign heights to each house, ensuring that all restrictions are met, and then find the maximum sum of squares.\n\nBut how to efficiently check all possible assignments? Well, considering that n is small (up to 50), but even 50^50 is impossible. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: think of it as an optimization problem with constraints. Maybe we can model this using dynamic programming or some other method. But I'm not sure how to apply DP here.\n\nAnother thought: the constraints are about the maximum in certain intervals. For each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum height in that interval must be ≤ x_i. How can we model these constraints?\n\nLet me think about the constraints. For each restriction, the maximum height in [l_i, r_i] is ≤ x_i. So for any house in that interval, its height can't be more than x_i. Wait, no. Because if the maximum in that interval is ≤ x_i, then all houses in that interval must be ≤ x_i. Because if any house in the interval was higher than x_i, then the maximum would be higher than x_i. Therefore, each restriction implies that for all positions in [l_i, r_i], their heights must be ≤ x_i. Wait, no! Wait, that's not correct. Suppose the restriction says that the maximum in [l_i, r_i] is at most x_i. Then, each individual house in that interval must be ≤ x_i. Because if any house was higher than x_i, then the maximum would be higher than x_i, which violates the restriction. Therefore, each restriction is equivalent to imposing that for every position in [l_i, r_i], the height is ≤ x_i. Wait, but that's not true. Suppose you have a restriction that says the maximum in [1,3] must be ≤ 2. Then, each of the three houses can be at most 2. So yes, each individual house in that interval must be ≤ x_i. Therefore, the constraints can be transformed into per-house constraints. But how?\n\nWait, no. Suppose there are multiple restrictions. For example, one restriction says that [1,3] has max ≤ 2, another says [2,4] has max ≤ 3. Then, for house 2, it's allowed to be up to 2 (due to the first restriction) and up to 3 (due to the second). So the effective maximum for house 2 is 2. But for house 3, the first restriction says it can be up to 2, and the second allows up to 3. So the effective maximum for house 3 is 2. For house 4, the second restriction allows up to 3, but the first doesn't apply. So the maximum for house 4 is 3.\n\nSo, for each house, the maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that include that house in their [l_i, r_i] interval. Because each such restriction requires that the house's height is ≤ x_i. So the overall maximum for a house is the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that cover that house. Additionally, the global maximum h is also a constraint. So for each house, the maximum allowed height is min(h, min of x_i's from all restrictions that include the house in their interval).\n\nWait, that's a key insight. Because if that's the case, then the problem reduces to, for each house, determine its maximum allowed height, which is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that cover that house. Then, the optimal solution is to set each house to the maximum possible allowed height, since the square function is increasing. Because if you can set a house to a higher value, that gives a better profit. So for each house, set it to the maximum allowed height, and sum their squares.\n\nWait, but this seems too simple. Let me check the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1-1: x",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit from building houses on a street under specific zoning restrictions. Each house's height is constrained by a maximum value, and the goal is to maximize the total profit, which is calculated as the sum of the squares of the heights of the houses.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Constraints**: Each restriction imposes a maximum height on the tallest house within a specific range. This means that for each house, the maximum allowed height is the minimum value among all restrictions that cover that house and the global maximum height `h`.\n2. **Determine Maximum Heights**: For each house, compute the effective maximum height by considering all restrictions that apply to it. This is done by iterating through each restriction and updating the maximum height for each house in the affected range.\n3. **Calculate Profit**: Once we have the effective maximum height for each house, the optimal strategy is to set each house to its maximum allowed height, as the square function is increasing. Summing the squares of these heights gives the maximum profit.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if not line:\n            idx += 1\n            continue\n        n, h, m = map(int, line.split())\n        idx += 1\n        # Initialize max_heights array with h\n        max_heights = [h] * n\n        for _ in range(m):\n            l, r, x = map(int, input[idx].strip().split())\n            idx += 1\n            # Adjust the range to 0-based\n            for i in range(l-1, r):\n                if max_heights[i] > x:\n                    max_heights[i] = x\n        # Calculate total profit\n        total = 0\n        for height in max_heights:\n            total += height * height\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, parsing the number of spots `n`, maximum height `h`, and number of restrictions `m`.\n2. **Initialization**: An array `max_heights` is initialized with the global maximum height `h` for each spot.\n3. **Applying Restrictions**: For each restriction, the maximum height for each house in the specified range is updated to the minimum of its current value and the restriction's maximum height.\n4. **Calculating Profit**: After processing all restrictions, the profit is calculated by summing the squares of the effective maximum heights of each house.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that all constraints are respected while maximizing the profit by leveraging the properties of the square function and the constraints provided.",
