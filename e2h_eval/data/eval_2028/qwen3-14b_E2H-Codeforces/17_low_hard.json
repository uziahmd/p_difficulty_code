He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string s of length n. The output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's indicating for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix. The key is that there must be at least one possible string s that matches the assignments. And if there are multiple possibilities, any correct one is acceptable.\n\nFirst, let's think about the approach. The main idea is to find a way to assign each of the given strings as either a prefix or a suffix such that there exists a string s of length n that has all the assigned prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how do I find such an assignment?\n\nLet me think. For each possible candidate string s (but since n can be up to 100, trying all possibilities might not be feasible directly?), but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since the input strings are all the proper prefixes and suffixes of some s, perhaps we can find the correct s by checking which of the given strings could be the full string. Wait, no. Because the given strings are all the proper prefixes and suffixes. So the actual string s is not among them. But the proper prefixes and suffixes include all possible ones of lengths 1 to n-1.\n\nWait, for example, if s is \"ababa\" of length 5, then the prefixes are \"a\", \"ab\", \"aba\", \"abab\", and the suffixes are \"a\", \"ba\", \"aba\", \"baba\". But the input includes all of these. So the input contains 2n-2 strings (for n=5, 8 strings) which are all the proper prefixes and suffixes.\n\nSo the problem is to assign each of these 2n-2 strings as a prefix or suffix, such that there exists a string s of length n that has all the assigned prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how can we find such an assignment?\n\nAn important observation: The full string s must have a unique prefix of length n-1 (the entire string except the last character) and a unique suffix of length n-1 (the entire string except the first character). But since the input contains all proper prefixes and suffixes, there must be exactly two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. For example, for length n-1, there is exactly one prefix (the first n-1 characters of s) and exactly one suffix (the last n-1 characters of s). So in the input, for length n-1, there are two strings, one is the prefix and one is the suffix.\n\nSo, for the length n-1, we can find which of the two strings is the prefix and which is the suffix. But how? Because the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the two strings of length n-1 must be such that the prefix is the first n-1 characters of s, and the suffix is the last n-1 characters of s. Therefore, the two strings of length n-1 must differ in exactly one character. For example, in the first sample input, the two strings of length 4 are \"abab\" and \"baba\". Let's see: the correct s is \"ababa\". The prefix of length 4 is \"abab\", the suffix is \"baba\". These two differ in the first and last characters. So combining these two gives us that the full string is the combination of the prefix and the suffix's last character. Wait, perhaps the full string can be determined by taking the prefix of length n-1 and adding the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Or vice versa? Let me think.\n\nLet me take the example. For the prefix of length n-1, say P, and the suffix of length n-1, S. Then the full string s must be P + (last character of S), because the suffix S is s[1..n-1], so the last character of S is s[n-1], which is the last character of s. Similarly, the prefix P is s[0..n-2], so the full string is P + last_char_of_S. Also, the suffix S is s[1..n-1], which is the same as the last n-1 characters of s. So the first character of S is s[1], and the last character is s[n-1].\n\nBut how can we find the correct s? Well, for the two strings of length n-1, one is the prefix (P) and the other is the suffix (S). Then the full s would be P + last_char(S). Alternatively, if we",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes such that there exists at least one valid string `s` that matches these assignments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest proper prefix and suffix (of length `n-1`) can help reconstruct the original string `s`. These two strings must differ in exactly one character, allowing us to combine them to form the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct the Original String**: Using the identified longest prefix and suffix, we can construct the original string `s` by combining the longest prefix with the last character of the longest suffix.\n3. **Check Validity**: Once the original string is reconstructed, we validate each input string to determine if it is a prefix or suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Separate strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    len_to_strings = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        len_to_strings[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = len_to_strings[len_n_minus_1]\n    \n    # Try each pair as prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # Construct possible s\n            s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Check if the suffix_candidate is indeed a suffix of s\n            if s[-len_n_minus_1:] == suffix_candidate:\n                # Now check all other strings\n                result = []\n                for s_str in strings:\n                    if len(s_str) == len(prefix_candidate) and s_str == prefix_candidate:\n                        result.append('P')\n                    elif len(s_str) == len(suffix_candidate) and s_str == suffix_candidate:\n                        result.append('S')\n                    else:\n                        # Check if it's a prefix or suffix of s\n                        if s.startswith(s_str):\n                            result.append('P')\n                        elif s.endswith(s_str):\n                            result.append('S')\n                        else:\n                            # This shouldn't happen as per problem statement\n                            pass\n                # Output the result\n                print(''.join(result))\n                return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into lines. The first line gives the length `n` of the unknown string `s`, followed by the list of prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Grouping by Length**: The input strings are grouped by their lengths to easily access the longest proper prefixes and suffixes (length `n-1`).\n3. **Reconstructing the Original String**: By testing combinations of the two longest strings (of length `n-1`), we attempt to reconstruct the original string `s`. This is done by combining the prefix with the last character of the suffix.\n4. **Validation**: For each candidate string `s`, we check if all input strings are valid prefixes or suffixes. The result is constructed by marking each input string as 'P' (prefix) or 'S' (suffix) based on its position relative to the reconstructed string `s`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes while validating against the constraints provided in the problem statement.",
