He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that matches the assignments.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the main idea is that for the correct string s, the prefixes and suffixes must match. For example, the prefix of length k is the first k characters of s, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters.\n\nBut since we have all the prefixes and suffixes, but not knowing which is which, we need to find an assignment of P and S such that:\n\n- For each input string, if it's marked as a prefix, then there exists some s where that string is a prefix of s. Similarly for suffix.\n\nBut since we need to find any valid assignment, perhaps we can find the correct s first, and then check which of the input strings are prefixes and suffixes of it.\n\nBut how do we find s? Because there might be multiple possibilities, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid (i.e., there exists at least one s that matches the given set of prefixes and suffixes).\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\nFind the correct string s, and then for each input string, determine whether it is a prefix or suffix of s. Then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how to find s?\n\nWell, for the correct s, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be present in the input. Also, the full string s is not given, but the input contains all the proper prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut since the input includes all the prefixes and suffixes, perhaps the correct s can be determined by combining the longest possible prefix and suffix.\n\nWait, let's think. The correct s must have as its prefixes all the proper prefixes (each of length 1 to n-1), and similarly for suffixes. So for example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) is the first n-1 characters of s. Similarly, the longest suffix (of length n-1) is the last n-1 characters of s. But since the input has exactly two strings of each length, for length n-1, there are two strings. One of them must be the prefix of length n-1, and the other must be the suffix of length n-1.\n\nBut then, combining these two: the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must overlap in such a way that they form the entire string s. For example, suppose the prefix of length n-1 is P, and the suffix of length n-1 is S. Then, the full string s must be P + (last character of S). Wait, no. Let me think.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose s is \"ababa\" (from the first example). The length is 5. The longest prefix is \"abab\" (length 4), and the longest suffix is \"baba\" (length 4). The full string is \"ababa\". So the prefix of length 4 is \"abab\", and the suffix of length 4 is \"baba\". How do they combine? The first 4 letters are abab, and the last four are baba. So the full string is the prefix of length 4 plus the last character of the suffix of length 4. Wait, the full string's last character is 'a', which is the last character of the suffix of length 4 (which is 'a'). So the full string is the prefix of length n-1 (4) plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1 (which is the same as the last character of s). But how do we find s?\n\nAlternatively, for the correct s, the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must have their overlapping parts. For example, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, combining these two, the full string s is the prefix of length n-1 plus the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Wait, because the suffix of length n-",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct string `s` based on the given input and then classifying each input string as either a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest proper prefix and suffix (of length `n-1`) must be part of the input. These two strings can help reconstruct the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct the Original String**: By combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix, we can determine the original string `s`. This is done by taking the longest prefix and appending the last character of the longest suffix.\n3. **Classify Input Strings**: Once we have the original string `s`, we check each input string to determine if it is a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    strings = input[idx:idx + 2 * n - 2]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all possible combinations of the two candidates for prefix and suffix\n    for prefix_candidate in candidates:\n        for suffix_candidate in candidates:\n            if prefix_candidate == suffix_candidate:\n                continue\n            # Reconstruct s\n            s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Check if all prefixes and suffixes are present in the input\n            valid = True\n            for l in range(1, n):\n                prefix = s[:l]\n                suffix = s[-l:]\n                if prefix not in strings or suffix not in strings:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if valid:\n                # Now assign P and S\n                result = []\n                for s_str in strings:\n                    if s.startswith(s_str):\n                        result.append('P')\n                    elif s.endswith(s_str):\n                        result.append('S')\n                    else:\n                        # This should not happen as per problem statement\n                        pass\n                print(''.join(result))\n                return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into individual strings.\n2. **Finding Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Reconstructing the Original String**: By combining the longest prefix candidate with the last character of the longest suffix candidate, we attempt to reconstruct the original string `s`.\n4. **Validation**: We validate if all prefixes and suffixes of `s` are present in the input strings.\n5. **Classification**: Once a valid string `s` is found, each input string is checked to determine if it is a prefix or suffix of `s`, and the result is printed accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct classification of each input string as either a prefix or a suffix of the original string `s`.",
