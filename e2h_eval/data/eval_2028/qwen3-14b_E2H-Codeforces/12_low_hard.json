The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Xenia moving around a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement. But how?\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are at 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise, that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Time taken is 2.\n- Then, the second task is at 2. But since she's currently at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around. From 3 to 4 (1 step), then 4 to 1 (another), then 1 to 2 (another). That's 3 steps. So total time now is 2 + 3 = 5?\nWait, but the example says the total is 6. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the example again. The example says the total steps are 6. Let me recount:\n\nThe sequence is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's count the steps between each move:\n\nFrom 1 to 2: 1 step (time 1)\nThen 2→3: another step (time 2)\nThen 3→4: step 3\nThen 4→1: step 4\nThen 1→2: step 5\nThen 2→3: step 6. So total of 6 steps. Oh right, but how does that align with the tasks?\n\nThe first task is at 3. So she starts at 1, moves to 3 (steps 1→2→3: 2 steps). Then the second task is at 2. So she needs to go from 3 to 2. Since it's clockwise, she can't go backward. So she has to go 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. Then the third task is at 3 again. So she's already at 2, so moving to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Oh right. So the total is sum of the steps between consecutive tasks, considering the direction.\n\nSo the approach is: for each consecutive pair of tasks (previous and current), calculate the time needed to move from the previous position to the current position, considering the circular nature.\n\nBut how to compute that? Let's think: suppose Xenia is currently at position prev, and needs to go to position curr. Since the movement is clockwise, the number of steps is (curr - prev) mod n if curr >= prev? Wait, no. Because if curr is less than prev, then moving clockwise would require going all the way around. For example, if prev is 3 and curr is 2, then the steps are (n - prev + curr) steps. Because moving from 3 to 4 (1 step), then 4 to 1 (another), then 1 to 2 (another). So total steps is (n - prev + curr) steps. Alternatively, the formula could be (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). But since we need to take the positive steps, that's equivalent to (curr - prev + n) % n. Wait, but when curr is greater than prev, (curr - prev) is positive, and adding n and mod n would give the same as curr - prev. So yes, the formula for steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Which can be written as (curr - prev + n) % n. Wait, but if curr is 2 and prev is 3, then (2-3 +4) = 3, which is correct. For example, n=4, prev=3, curr=2: (2-3 +4) = 3 steps. So yes, that formula works.\n\nBut wait, what if prev is 1 and curr is 1? Then steps is zero. So that's correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n-",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a circular ringroad. The key challenge is efficiently calculating the time taken to move between consecutive tasks considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia moves clockwise around a ringroad with `n` houses. Moving from one house to an adjacent house takes 1 unit of time.\n2. **Task Order**: Each task must be completed in order, and Xenia can only start task `i` after completing all previous tasks (1 through i-1).\n3. **Circular Calculation**: The time to move from house `prev` to house `curr` clockwise is calculated as `(curr - prev + n) % n`. This formula ensures that moving from a higher-numbered house to a lower-numbered one wraps around the circle correctly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current_pos = 1  # Starting at house 1\n    \n    for ai in a:\n        # Calculate the steps needed from current_pos to ai\n        steps = (ai - current_pos + n) % n\n        total_time += steps\n        current_pos = ai\n    \n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Initialization**: We start at house 1, and initialize the total time to 0.\n3. **Iterate Over Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current position to the task's house using the formula `(ai - current_pos + n) % n`.\n4. **Update Position**: After each task, update the current position to the task's house.\n5. **Output Total Time**: Print the accumulated total time after processing all tasks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, resulting in an optimal O(m) time complexity where m is the number of tasks.",
