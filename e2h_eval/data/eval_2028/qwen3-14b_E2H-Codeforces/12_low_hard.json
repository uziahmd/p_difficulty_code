The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house ai, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. Moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the problem is about calculating the total time taken to perform all tasks in order, considering that each task must be done after the previous ones. Also, since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise, the direction is fixed.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement. For each task, Xenia has to move from her current position to the required house for that task. But since the tasks are processed in order, each subsequent task depends on the previous positions.\n\nLet me take the first example:\n\nInput is n=4, m=3, and the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6.\n\nThe explanation says she moves 1→2→3 (time 2), then from 3 to 4→1→2 (time 3) for the second task, then from 2 to 3 (time 1). Total 2+3+1 = 6? Wait, but how does that add up?\n\nWait, the first task is at 3. Starting from 1, moving clockwise. The distance from 1 to 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). Then, the second task is at 2. But since she's currently at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around: 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. Then the third task is at 3 again. From 2, moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. So total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. That's correct.\n\nSo the key is, for each task, calculate the distance from the previous position to the current task's house, moving clockwise. And accumulate all those distances.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between two houses?\n\nLet's think. Suppose current position is at pos, and the next task is at a_i. The distance is (a_i - pos) mod n? No, because if pos is 3 and a_i is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - pos + a_i) steps. Because moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would be going through 4, 1, 2. Which is (4-3) + (2-1) ? Or maybe (n - pos + a_i) ?\n\nWait, for general case, the distance from pos to a_i when moving clockwise is (a_i - pos) if a_i >= pos. Otherwise, (n - pos + a_i). So that's equivalent to (a_i - pos) if a_i >= pos, else (a_i - pos + n). But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, the distance can be calculated as (a_i - pos) % n if moving clockwise. Wait, no. Let's see:\n\nIf pos is 3, a_i is 2, n=4. The distance is 3 steps. (2 - 3) is -1. mod 4 gives 3. So yes. So (a_i - pos) mod n would give the correct distance. But wait, if pos is 1 and a_i is 3, then (3-1) mod 4 is 2, which is correct. So yes, the formula for the distance between pos and a_i (moving clockwise) is (a_i - pos) if a_i >= pos, else (a_i - pos + n). Which can be written as (a_i - pos) % n. But since in Python, modulo can return negative values, but perhaps we can use (a_i - pos) % n. Wait, for example, when a_i is 2 and pos is 3, (2-3) is -1. mod 4 would be 3, which is correct. So yes, using (a_i - pos) % n gives the correct distance.\n\nWait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns a result with the same sign as the divisor. So for example, (-1) % 4 is 3, which is correct. So yes, that formula works.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1.\n\nFor each task in the list a1, a2, ..., am:\n\n- compute the distance from current position to a_i, which is (a_i - current_pos) % n. But wait, no. Because (a_i - current_pos) could be",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n2. **Task Processing**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current position to the target house for the task. This movement is done clockwise.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two houses on a circular road can be computed using modular arithmetic. Specifically, moving from house `current_pos` to house `a_i` takes `(a_i - current_pos) % n` units of time if moving clockwise. This formula handles both cases where the target house is ahead or behind the current position in the clockwise direction.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Sum up the distances calculated for each task to get the total time required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + m]))\n    \n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for ai in a:\n        diff = (ai - current) % n\n        total_time += diff\n        current = ai\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1 and initialize the total time to zero.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the target house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road.\n- **Update Position**: After each task, update the current position to the target house for the next iteration.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
