    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is as small as possible. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest k.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. The LCM of two numbers x and y is (x*y)/gcd(x,y). So, for x = a +k and y = b +k. Since adding k to both, maybe I can express this in terms of their difference.\n\nLet me consider that the difference between the two numbers is (b +k) - (a +k) = b - a. So, the difference between the two numbers is fixed, regardless of k. Let's say d = |a - b|. Without loss of generality, assume a ≤ b. Then, the difference is b - a. So, the two numbers are x and x + d, where x = a +k. Then, their LCM is x*(x +d)/gcd(x, x +d). But since gcd(x, x +d) is the same as gcd(x, d). Because gcd(x, x +d) = gcd(x, d).\n\nSo, the LCM becomes x*(x +d)/g, where g is gcd(x, d). But since d is fixed, perhaps we can find x such that this value is minimized.\n\nWait, but x is a +k. So, since k is non-negative, x must be at least a (if a ≤ b). But if a is larger than b, then maybe I should swap them. So first, let me compute d = |a - b|. Let me assume that a ≤ b, so d = b - a. Then x = a +k, and y = x + d = a +k + (b -a) = b +k. So yes.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding x ≥ a (since k ≥ 0) such that the LCM of x and x +d is minimized. Then, once we find that x, the k is x - a.\n\nBut how do I find x?\n\nThe LCM of x and x +d is (x*(x +d))/gcd(x, x +d) = (x*(x +d))/g, where g is gcd(x, d). Because x and x +d differ by d, so their gcd is same as gcd(x, d).\n\nSo, the LCM is x*(x +d)/g. Since d is fixed, perhaps we can find x such that this expression is minimized.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, since x and x +d have a fixed difference, maybe the minimal LCM occurs when x is as small as possible, but that's not necessarily true. For example, in the first sample input: a=6, b=10. So d=4. So x = 6 +k. The original x is 6, but when k=2, x is 8. Then x +d is 12. Their LCM is 24. If we take x=6, then the numbers are 6 and 10. Their LCM is 30, which is bigger than 24. So here, increasing x gives a better result.\n\nSo, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x is a divisor of d, or something like that. Because when x divides d, then the gcd(x, d) is x. Then, the LCM would be x*(x +d)/x = x +d. Which is x +d = (a +k) + (b -a) = b +k. But that's only if x divides d.\n\nWait, but if x divides d, then x is a divisor of d. Let me think. Let me take the example where d is fixed. Suppose that x is a divisor of d. Then, the LCM of x and x +d is (x*(x +d))/x = x +d. So that's equal to x +d. But since x +d = (a +k) + (b -a) = b +k. But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, if x is a divisor of d, then the LCM is x +d. So, to minimize that, we want x +d as small as possible. Since x is a divisor of d, and x ≥ a (since k ≥ 0), then the minimal x +d would be when x is the smallest divisor of d that is ≥ a.\n\nBut perhaps that's not the case. For example, maybe there's a case where x is not a divisor of d but gives a smaller LCM. But maybe the minimal LCM occurs when x is a divisor of d. Because when x divides d, then the LCM is x +d, which is the minimal possible? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the LCM of x and x +d. Let me denote that as LCM(x, x +d) = LCM(x, d) * (x +d)/gcd(x, d) ? No, wait. Wait, earlier we said that LCM(x, x +d) = x*(x +d)/gcd(x, d). But since x and x +d differ by d, their gcd is the same as gcd(x, d). So, the LCM is x*(x +d)/g, where g is gcd(x, d).\n\nBut if x is a divisor of d, then g = x. So LCM becomes (x*(x +d))/x = x +d. So, that's a possibility.\n\nBut if x is not a divisor of d, then the LCM could be larger. So, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x is chosen such that the LCM is minimized. So, perhaps the optimal x is the one that makes x +d as small as possible, but also considering the gcd.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAnother approach: Let me note that since x and x +d have a difference of d, their LCM is minimized when they are as small as possible and have a large gcd. For example, if x and x +d are multiples of each other, then their LCM is the larger one. But if they share a large common divisor, then the LCM would be smaller.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal x is such that x is as small as possible, and the gcd(x, d) is as large as possible.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, since d is fixed, perhaps we can look for x such that x is a divisor of d. Because then the LCM is x +d. So, for example, if we can find x >= a (so that k is non-negative) that divides d, then the LCM would be x +d. Then, the minimal possible LCM in this case would be when x is the smallest possible divisor of d that is >= a. Then, the minimal x +d would be when x is the minimal such divisor.\n\nAlternatively, if there are no divisors of d >=a, then perhaps we need to find some other x.\n\nWait, but what if d is zero? Well, if a and b are equal, then d is zero. Then, the two numbers are x and x. Their LCM is x. So, to minimize this, we choose the smallest x possible. Since x is a +k, and k >=0. So the minimal x is a, so k=0. Which is the case for the third example in the input, where a=5, b=10? Wait, no, the third example input is 5 and 10. Oh wait, the third example's output is 0. Let's check that.\n\nIf a=5, b=10. Then d = 5. So x = 5 +k, and y = 10 +k. So the LCM of x and y. But since x = 5 +k, y = 5 +k +5 = 10 +k. So for k=0, x is 5, y is 10. LCM(5,10) is 10. If k is 1, x=6, y=11. LCM is 66. If k is 2, x=7, y=12. LCM is 84. So the minimal is 10, achieved when k=0. Hence the output is 0. Which matches the example.\n\nSo, when d is zero (a = b), then the optimal k is 0.\n\nSo, first, handle the case where a == b. Then, return 0.\n\nElse, let's proceed with d = |a - b|.\n\nAssuming a < b. Then, d = b -a. So, the problem is to find x >= a, such that the LCM of x and x +d is minimized. Then, k = x - a.\n\nSo, how to find x?\n\nLet me think that for x and x +d, the LCM is minimized when their GCD is maximized. Because the LCM is (x*(x +d))/gcd(x, x+d). So, for fixed x and x +d, the larger the gcd, the smaller the LCM.\n\nSo, perhaps we want to maximize the gcd(x, d), since that's the same as gcd(x, x +d).\n\nSo, the idea is to find x >= a such that gcd(x, d) is as large as possible. Then, among those x's, find the one that gives the minimal LCM.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the maximum possible value of g = gcd(x, d). Let's say that g is a divisor of d. So, for each possible divisor g of d, we can find the minimal x >=a such that g divides x, and then compute the LCM for that x.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal g is the largest possible. For example, if we can find x such that x is a multiple of the maximum possible divisor of d, then that would give us the maximum possible g, leading to the minimal LCM.\n\nSo, let's think. Let me take the maximum possible g, which is d itself. Then, x must be a multiple of d. So, the minimal x >=a is the first multiple of d that is >=a. Let's say that x is m*d. Then, the LCM of x and x +d is LCM(m*d, (m+1)*d) = (m*(m+1)*d^2)/ (d) ) = m*(m+1)*d. Which is m*(m+1)*d. But maybe this isn't the best choice.\n\nAlternatively, if we take x such that x is a multiple of d, then x +d is also a multiple of d. So their LCM is the larger of the two. Which is x +d. So, for example, if x is m*d, then x +d is (m+1)*d. Their LCM is (m+1)*d. So, the LCM is (m+1)*d. To minimize this, we need m as small as possible. So, the minimal m is the smallest integer such that m*d >=a. So m = ceil(a/d). Then, the LCM would be (ceil(a/d) +1)*d.\n\nBut how does this compare with other possibilities?\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, a=6, b=10. So d=4. So, the maximum possible g is 4. Then, m is ceil(6/4) = 2. So x = 2*4 =8. Then x +d = 12. Their LCM is 12. But in the sample, the correct answer is 24? Wait no. Wait the sample says that when k=2, the numbers are 8 and 12. Their LCM is 24. But according to this calculation, the LCM is 12. Wait, why?\n\nWait, because I made a mistake. Oh right, the LCM of 8 and 12 is 24, not 12. Because 8 and 12 have a GCD of 4. So LCM is (8*12)/4 = 24. So my previous reasoning was wrong. Where did I go wrong?\n\nAh! When x is m*d, and x +d is (m+1)*d. Then, the GCD of x and x +d is GCD(m*d, (m+1)*d) = d * GCD(m, m+1) = d * 1 = d. So the LCM is (x*(x +d))/d = (m*d * (m+1)*d)/d = m*(m+1)*d. Which is m*(m+1)*d. So for m=2, that's 2*3*4=24. Which matches the sample. So that's correct.\n\nSo, for x being a multiple of d, the LCM is m*(m+1)*d. So, to minimize that, we need to choose the smallest m such that m*d >=a. Which would be m = ceil(a/d). But then, perhaps there are other possibilities where the LCM is smaller.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal approach is to consider all possible divisors of d, and for each such divisor g, find the minimal x >=a such that x is congruent to 0 mod g. Then, compute the LCM for that x, and choose the minimal one.\n\nBut how to find all possible divisors of d?\n\nLet me think. Let's suppose that d is fixed. Then, for any divisor g of d, we can look for x such that x is congruent to - (d/g) * something. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nThe idea is that for x, the GCD(x, d) is g. Then, since g divides d, let me write d = g * k. Also, since GCD(x, d) = g, then x must be a multiple of g, but not a multiple of any larger divisor of d. But perhaps that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, for each divisor g of d, we can find the minimal x >=a such that x is a multiple of g. Then, the LCM of x and x +d is (x * (x +d)) / GCD(x, d) = (x * (x +d)) / g. Because GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d) = g.\n\nSo, since x is a multiple of g, let me write x = g * m. Then, d = g * k. So, x +d = g*m + g*k = g*(m +k). Then, the LCM is (g*m * g*(m +k )) / g = g * m * (m +k) = g * m * (m + (d/g)).\n\nSo, the LCM is g * m * (m + (d/g)).\n\nNow, the question is, for each possible divisor g of d, find the minimal m such that x = g*m >=a. Then compute the LCM for that m, and find the overall minimum.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Compute d = |a - b|. If d is zero, return 0.\n\n- Else, generate all the divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g of d, compute the minimal m such that g * m >= a. Then, compute the LCM for that m, which is g * m * (m + (d/g)).\n\n- Also, for each such g, we can compute the corresponding k as (g*m) -a.\n\n- Then, among all these possibilities, find the one with the minimal LCM. If there are multiple, choose the one with the smallest k.\n\nBut how to generate all the divisors of d?\n\nWell, generating all divisors of a number up to 1e9 is manageable if we factorize it. But for numbers up to 1e9, factorization can be done efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for the problem, since the code needs to be efficient, perhaps we can generate all the divisors of d by checking up to sqrt(d).\n\nOnce we have all the divisors of d, we can process them.\n\nBut wait, the divisors can be generated as follows. For example, for d, we can loop from 1 to sqrt(d), check if i divides d. If so, add i and d/i to the list of divisors. Then, after that, sort them.\n\nBut then, for each divisor, we need to process it.\n\nBut perhaps there's another way. Also, note that for the same g, even if it's a divisor of d, but different values of m can lead to different LCMs. However, for each g, the minimal m is the smallest possible m such that g*m >=a. Because that would minimize the value of m, and thus the LCM.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, compute the minimal m as ceil(a/g), but since m must be such that g*m >=a. So m_min = ceil(a / g). But since a and g are integers, m_min can be computed as (a + g -1) // g.\n\nOnce we have m_min, then the LCM is g * m_min * (m_min + (d/g)).\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, compute this value, and track the minimum.\n\nAdditionally, there's another possibility: what if x is not a multiple of any divisor of d? But that's not possible, because the GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. So for any x, the GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. Therefore, the optimal x must be such that its GCD with d is some divisor of d. Hence, considering all divisors of d is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\n- Generate all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g, compute m_min = ceil(a / g). Then compute the LCM as g * m_min * (m_min + (d/g)).\n\n- Also, compute the corresponding k for that x, which is x -a = g*m_min -a.\n\n- Find the minimal LCM, and among those, the minimal k.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where x is less than a? Because m_min is chosen to make x =g*m_min >=a. So that's handled.\n\nBut then, what about the case where there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM? For example, different g's may produce the same LCM. Then, among those, we have to choose the smallest k.\n\nBut how do I generate all the divisors?\n\nLet me think of the first sample input. a=6, b=10. d=4. Divisors of 4 are 1, 2, 4.\n\nFor each divisor:\n\nCase 1: g=1.\n\nm_min = ceil(6/1) = 6. So x = 6*1 =6. Then d/g =4/1=4. So LCM is 1 *6 * (6 +4) = 6*10=60.\n\nCase 2: g=2.\n\nm_min = ceil(6/2) = 3. x=3*2=6. d/g=4/2=2. LCM is 2 *3*(3 + 2) = 2 *3*5=30.\n\nCase3: g=4.\n\nm_min = ceil(6/4)=2. x=4*2=8. d/g=4/4=1. LCM is 4 *2*(2+1)=4*2*3=24.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 24, achieved when g=4. Then, the k is 8-6=2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: the third input is a=5, b=10. d=5. Divisors are 1,5.\n\nCase g=1: m_min =5. x=5. LCM is 1*5*(5 +5) = 5*10=50.\n\nCase g=5: m_min=ceil(5/5)=1. x=5*1=5. d/g=5/5=1. LCM is 5*1*(1+1) =5*2=10. Which is the minimal. So k is 5-5=0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: input '21 31' gives a=21, b=31. d=10. Divisors of 10 are 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each:\n\ng=1: m_min =21. x=21. LCM is 1*21*(21 +10) =21*31=651.\n\ng=2: m_min=ceil(21/2) =11. x=22. d/g=10/2=5. LCM is 2 *11 * (11+5) = 2*11*16= 352.\n\ng=5: m_min=ceil(21/5) =5 (since 21/5 is 4.2, ceil is 5). x=5*5=25. d/g=2. LCM is 5 *5 * (5+2) =5*5*7=175.\n\ng=10: m_min=ceil(21/10)=3. x=3*10=30. d/g=1. LCM is 10 *3*(3+1)= 10*3*4=120.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 120. But the sample output for this input is 9. Let me check what k is here. x is 30. k=30 -21 =9. Which matches the sample. So yes, this approach works.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = absolute difference between a and b. If d is zero, return 0.\n\n2. Else, generate all the divisors of d.\n\n3. For each divisor g of d, compute m_min = ceil(a/g). Then compute the LCM as g * m_min * (m_min + (d/g)).\n\n4. Also compute the corresponding k for this case (x =g*m_min -a).\n\n5. Among all these possibilities, select the one with the minimal LCM. If there are multiple, choose the one with the smallest k.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the optimal x is not a multiple of any divisor of d? But earlier analysis suggests that for any x, the GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. So the optimal x must be considered for some divisor of d. Therefore, this approach covers all possibilities.\n\nBut how do I generate all the divisors of d?\n\nLet me think of writing a function to generate all the divisors of a number. For example, for d, we can loop from 1 to sqrt(d), check if i divides d, and collect all divisors.\n\nBut for d up to 1e9, this is feasible. For example, the maximum number of divisors for a number up to 1e9 is around 1000 (but actually, much less). So generating them is manageable.\n\nSo, the steps for generating divisors:\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nfor i in 1 to sqrt(d):\n\n   if d %i ==0:\n\n      add i to the set\n\n      add d//i to the set\n\nOnce done, convert the set to a list.\n\nBut then, for each divisor, process as above.\n\nOnce all candidates are generated, select the best.\n\nBut also, what about when a is larger than b? For example, if a=10, b=6. Then d is 4. But since the code uses a and b, perhaps the code should first compute d as abs(a -b), and then proceed with a and b in any order. Wait, but in the code, when we compute m_min, it's based on a. So perhaps, the code should ensure that a is the smaller of the two. Or, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nSuppose a and b are given, and d is |a -b|. Let me assume that a is the smaller one. Because when you compute x = a +k, and the other number is b +k. So if a is larger than b, then the same logic applies. But in the code, perhaps it's better to swap a and b if necessary, so that a is the smaller one. Because in the code, when we compute m_min, it's based on a.\n\nWait, in the code, the current a and b are passed. So, for example, if a is larger than b, then d is a -b. Then, x = a +k, and y = b +k. But since a >b, then y = x - (a -b). So, the difference between x and y is still d. So the same logic applies. But in this case, the code would compute x = a +k, but since a is larger than b, the minimal x is a (when k=0). However, perhaps the code should process the case where a is smaller than b. So, perhaps the code should first swap a and b if necessary, so that a <=b. Because otherwise, in the code, when we compute m_min = ceil(a/g), but a could be larger than b. But since d is |a -b|, the code can proceed regardless. So, perhaps the code should first compute d as the absolute difference between a and b, and then proceed with a and b as given, but in the code, when generating x, it's a +k, but since the code is looking for x >=a (since k >=0), but if a is larger than b, then perhaps x is a +k, and the other number is b +k = x -d.\n\nBut regardless, the code's approach would work. So, perhaps the code should first compute d as the absolute difference between a and b, and then proceed.\n\nBut for the code, when we generate the divisors of d, and compute m_min as ceil(a/g), but if a is larger than b, then perhaps that's not the correct approach. Wait, no. Because when a is larger than b, then in the code's logic, the code would compute d = a -b. Then, the two numbers are x = a +k and y = x -d = b +k. So, the same formula applies. But the code's approach of considering x as a +k, and generating m_min based on a is correct. So, the code can proceed regardless of whether a is larger than b.\n\nBut perhaps, to avoid confusion, the code can first swap a and b if necessary, so that a is the smaller one. For example, if a >b, then swap them. Because then, the code can proceed with a being the smaller one. But in the code, the actual value of a and b doesn't matter, as long as d is computed correctly. So, perhaps it's better to proceed with a and b as given, and compute d as absolute difference.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nif a == b: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   d = abs(a -b)\n\n   generate all divisors of d.\n\n   for each divisor g in divisors:\n\n      compute m_min = ceil(a / g). How to compute that? Well, (a + g -1) // g.\n\n      x = g * m_min\n\n      k_candidate = x -a\n\n      compute the LCM value as g * m_min * (m_min + (d//g)).\n\n      add this candidate (LCM_value, k_candidate) to a list.\n\n   then, among all the candidates, select the one with the minimal LCM_value. If multiple, select the one with the smallest k_candidate.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the minimal LCM is achieved with a different g? For example, maybe there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM. But the code would find the minimal one.\n\nBut there's another possibility. What if there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM value, but different k_candidates? Then, the code selects the smallest k_candidate.\n\nBut how to generate all the divisors of d?\n\nLet me think of writing a function to generate all divisors of d. Let me think of code for that.\n\nFor example, in Python:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):\n\n        if n %i ==0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nBut for n=0? Well, in our code, d is the absolute difference between a and b, which is at least 1 (since a !=b). So, no problem.\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, we can proceed.\n\nBut then, for each divisor, we compute the candidate.\n\nOnce all candidates are generated, select the one with the minimal LCM value and minimal k.\n\nBut what about the case where there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM? For example, if two different divisors produce the same LCM but different k's. Then, the code must choose the smallest k.\n\nSo, in the code, after collecting all the candidates, we can sort them first by LCM value, then by k.\n\nBut how to handle that in code.\n\nOnce we have all the candidates, we can keep track of the best candidate (the one with minimal LCM, and minimal k in case of tie).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nInitialize min_lcm as a very big number, and min_k as a very big number.\n\nFor each candidate (lcm_val, k_candidate):\n\n   if lcm_val < min_lcm:\n\n       update min_lcm and min_k.\n\n   elif lcm_val == min_lcm:\n\n       if k_candidate < min_k:\n\n           update min_k.\n\nSo, after processing all divisors, the min_k is the answer.\n\nBut what about other possibilities? For example, what if there is an x that is not generated by any of the divisors of d? But earlier analysis shows that it's not possible. Because for any x, the GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. So, the optimal x must be generated by considering the divisors of d.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a case where considering a divisor g, but using a different m than the minimal m. For example, for a certain g, maybe choosing a larger m than m_min gives a better LCM. But that seems unlikely. Because m_min is the minimal possible m for that g, which would give the minimal x. But since the LCM for that g is g * m * (m + (d/g)), which increases as m increases, the minimal m would give the minimal LCM for that particular g.\n\nSo, for each g, the minimal m (i.e., the minimal x) gives the minimal LCM for that g.\n\nThus, considering all divisors and their minimal m is sufficient.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as described.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 10 → d=4, divisors [1,2,4]\n\nAs discussed earlier, the candidates are:\n\ng=1 → LCM 60, k=6-6=0? Wait, no. Wait, m_min for g=1 is (6 +1 -1)//1 =6. So x =1*6=6. k_candidate =6 -a (a is 6) → 0. So the LCM is 60. But in the sample, the correct answer is k=2. So, the code will compare all the candidates and find that the minimal LCM is 24, which comes from g=4, leading to k=2.\n\nSample Input 2: 21 31 → d=10. divisors are 1,2,5,10. As discussed, the best is g=10, leading to k=9.\n\nSample Input 3: 5 10 → d=5. divisors are 1,5. For g=5, m_min is ceil(5/5)=1. x=5*1=5. k_candidate=5-5=0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=5 → d=2. divisors are 1,2.\n\nFor g=1: m_min = ceil(3/1) =3. x=3*1=3. LCM is 1 *3*(3 + 2/1) → 3 * (3+2) = 3*5=15. k is 3-3=0.\n\nFor g=2: m_min = ceil(3/2) =2. x=2*2=4. LCM is 2 *2 * (2 + (2/2)) → 2*2*(2+1) = 2*2*3=12. k=4-3=1. So the minimal LCM is 12, which is better than 15. So the answer is k=1.\n\nBut let's check. For k=1, a+k=4, b+k=6. LCM(4,6)=12. Correct.\n\nAnother case: a=4, b=6. d=2. divisors 1,2.\n\ng=1: m_min=4 → x=4. LCM is 4*(4+2) = 4*6=24. k=0.\n\ng=2: m_min=ceil(4/2)=2. x=4. LCM is 2*2*(2 + 1) = 12. So k is 0. So the answer is k=0. Which is correct, since LCM(4,6) is 12.\n\nBut why is that? Because the code would generate for g=2, m_min=2. x=2*2=4. Which is a=4. So k=0. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code would select the minimal LCM between 24 and 12. So the answer is k=0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo, this approach seems to work.\n\nNow, code-wise, let's proceed.\n\nFirst, read a and b.\n\nThen, if a == b, print 0.\n\nElse, compute d = abs(a -b).\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g, compute m_min = ceil(a /g) → (a +g -1) //g.\n\nCompute x = g * m_min.\n\nk_candidate = x -a.\n\nCompute the LCM value as g * m_min * (m_min + (d//g)).\n\nNow, collect all these (LCM_val, k_candidate) pairs.\n\nThen, select the pair with the smallest LCM_val. If multiple, select the smallest k_candidate.\n\nBut how to generate all the divisors.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut for the case where d is 0, which is when a ==b, return 0.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut what about when a is larger than b? Let's see.\n\nSuppose a=10, b=6. d=4. Then, the code proceeds with a=10, and the code computes m_min = ceil(10/g) for each divisor g of 4.\n\nBut in this case, the code would generate for each g:\n\nFor example, for g=4: m_min = ceil(10/4)=3. x=3*4=12. k_candidate=12-10=2. Then, the numbers are 12 and 6+2=8. LCM(12,8)=24. Which is the same as in the first sample. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works regardless of which of a or b is larger.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as written.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the get_divisors function.\n\nBut in Python, for a given n, generate all divisors.\n\nBut for n=0? Well, since in our code, d is the absolute difference between a and b, which is zero only if a==b, which is handled separately.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n    divisors = set()\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(n)) +1):\n        if n %i ==0:\n            divisors.add(i)\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n    return divisors\n\nBut in Python, math.isqrt is available in Python 3.8+, which returns the integer square root.\n\nBut for the purposes of code submission, perhaps using int(math.sqrt(n)) is acceptable, but math.isqrt is better.\n\nBut assuming that the code is written with math.isqrt.\n\nOnce the divisors are generated, process them.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead a and b as integers.\n\nif a == b:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    d = abs(a -b)\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    best_k = float('inf')\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        m_min = (a + g -1) // g\n\n        x = g * m_min\n\n        k_candidate = x -a\n\n        # compute LCM_val\n\n        term = d // g\n\n        lcm_val = g * m_min * (m_min + term)\n\n        # compare with current min_lcm and best_k\n\n        if lcm_val < min_lcm:\n\n            min_lcm = lcm_val\n\n            best_k = k_candidate\n\n        elif lcm_val == min_lcm:\n\n            if k_candidate < best_k:\n\n                best_k = k_candidate\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but what about the case where multiple divisors generate the same lcm_val?\n\nBut the code handles that by checking for equality and updating best_k accordingly.\n\nBut let's test this",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized.
