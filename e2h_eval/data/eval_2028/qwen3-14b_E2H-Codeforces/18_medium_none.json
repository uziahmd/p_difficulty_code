The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about a frog jumping on a number line with certain constraints. We need to compute the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m, where f(x) is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. \n\nFirst, let me understand what f(x) represents. The frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But it can't go beyond 0 or x. So for each x, we need to find all positions reachable under these constraints.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we can't simulate this for each x directly. So there must be some mathematical pattern or formula here.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Let's consider that the frog can make any number of jumps, but the positions must be within [0, x]. \n\nThe key is to find all positions reachable by the frog's moves, considering that the frog can't go below 0 or above x. However, since the frog can make multiple jumps, perhaps we can model this as a linear combination problem.\n\nWait, the frog's movement is similar to steps of +a and -b. So the positions reachable without considering boundaries would be all numbers of the form k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. But with the constraints that the frog can't step outside [0, x].\n\nBut since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, maybe the reachable positions are those that are in the set {k*a - l*b | ...} and also between 0 and x. However, this seems too vague. How do we find all such positions?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the frog starts at 0. Let's think about the possible positions. Each jump adds a or subtracts b. So the frog can reach positions that are combinations of adding a's and subtracting b's. However, since the frog can't go negative, maybe the positions are constrained in some way.\n\nBut perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Let me recall that the set of all possible positions reachable without constraints (i.e., allowing any number of jumps) would be the set of all integers that are multiples of d, where d is gcd(a, b). Because any linear combination of a and b is a multiple of their gcd.\n\nSo if the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d. However, since the frog starts at 0, which is a multiple of d, then all reachable positions must be multiples of d. Therefore, for any x, the reachable positions are multiples of d that are between 0 and x. But wait, that's only if the frog can reach them. However, even if a position is a multiple of d, it may not be reachable due to the constraints of not stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut perhaps the problem reduces to considering the positions that are multiples of d, and then figuring out how many of them are reachable given the constraints of the jumps.\n\nWait, but even that might not be sufficient. Because the frog can't jump beyond x, so even if a position is a multiple of d, it may not be reachable if the frog can't reach it through the allowed steps without stepping outside the range. For example, suppose x is small, and the frog needs to take steps that would require going beyond x. But how can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and are in [0, x], provided that they are reachable via some sequence of jumps. But how to determine that?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: the frog can move forward by a or backward by b. So, the frog can reach any position that can be written as a*k - b*l, where k and l are non-negative integers, such that during the process of making these jumps, the frog never goes below 0 or above x. But this seems complicated.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to model this as a BFS problem. However, for large x (up to 1e9), that's impossible. Therefore, we need a mathematical approach.\n\nAnother angle: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (where d = gcd(a, b)), and also can be expressed as a combination of a and b steps. But since the frog can jump forward and backward, perhaps the positions that are reachable are those that are multiples of d and can be achieved by some combination of steps. However, the problem is that even if a position is a multiple of d, it may not be reachable because the frog can't get there without stepping outside the allowed range.\n\nBut perhaps for sufficiently large x, all multiples of d in [0, x] are reachable. Let's think about that. For example, suppose a and b are coprime. Then, for any position that is a multiple of 1 (so any integer), but how can the frog reach it? Well, for example, if a=5 and b=3, then the frog can reach 0, 5, 5-3=2, 5+5=10, 10-3=7, etc. So the positions are all numbers that can be formed by adding a's and subtracting b's. However, the question is whether there's a way to reach them without stepping outside the allowed interval.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's think of the problem in terms of the frog being able to reach any multiple of d that is >=0 and <=x, provided that x is large enough. For example, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Then, for smaller x, some of those positions may not be reachable.\n\nSo perhaps the problem can be split into two parts: when x is small, and when x is large enough.\n\nBut how to find the threshold where x is large enough?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >=0 and <=x, provided that x is at least some value. For example, if the frog can reach positions up to x, then for any multiple of d up to x, it can be reached.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. Since the frog can move forward by a, and backward by b. Suppose that the frog can reach some position k. Then, if k + a is <=x, then it can reach k +a. Similarly, if k -b >=0, then it can reach k -b. But since the frog can make any number of jumps, perhaps the reachable positions are all positions that are multiples of d and are in [0, x], and also satisfy some condition based on the steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and are in [0, x], provided that x is large enough. But what's the minimal x where this becomes true?\n\nLet me think of the case where a and b are coprime. Then d=1, so all integers are allowed. But can the frog reach every integer in [0, x]? For example, in the first sample input, a=5 and b=3. The sample says that for x=5, f(5)=3. The positions are 0, 5, and 2 (since 5-3=2). Wait, but 2 is less than 5. But why can't the frog reach other positions?\n\nAh, because the frog can't make jumps that would take it outside the allowed range. For example, to reach 5, the frog can jump +a once. To reach 2, it can jump +a once and then -b once. But to reach 0, it can jump back from 5 (but that would require that 5 is within the allowed range. So for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2. But why not others like 5-3*2= -1? That's invalid. So, the frog can't reach positions that would require going beyond the allowed range.\n\nBut for larger x, perhaps the frog can reach more positions. For example, when x is large enough, the frog can reach any multiple of d (since d is the gcd).\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where all multiples of d up to x are reachable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any multiple of d that is in [0, x], as long as x is >= some value. Let's think about the problem in terms of the frog being able to reach any multiple of d in [0, x] if x is sufficiently large. For example, once the frog can reach some position, then it can keep adding a's until it reaches x. But that depends on the parity of steps.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a position, and edges are the possible jumps. The frog starts at 0. The reachable positions are all nodes that can be reached from 0 through these edges, without stepping outside [0, x]. But again, for large x, this is not feasible to compute directly.\n\nSo, perhaps the problem can be broken down into two cases:\n\nCase 1: The frog can't move forward (a=0) or backward (b=0). But according to the input constraints, a and b are positive integers. So this case is not possible.\n\nCase 2: The frog can move both forward and backward. So, the reachable positions depend on the ability to generate multiples of d (the gcd of a and b) within the allowed range.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following steps:\n\nFirst, compute d = gcd(a, b). All reachable positions must be multiples of d. So for any x, the maximum number of positions is floor(x/d) + 1 (since 0 is included). However, this is only possible if all those positions are actually reachable. But maybe not all of them are reachable for small x.\n\nBut for large enough x, all multiples of d up to x are reachable. So the problem reduces to finding for each x, how many multiples of d are in [0, x], and also are reachable. However, how to find when that count equals floor(x/d)+1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all multiples of d that are in [0, x], provided that x is greater than or equal to some value. Let's call this value 'threshold'. Once x is >= threshold, all multiples of d in [0, x] are reachable. For x < threshold, some of them are not.\n\nBut how to find this threshold?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. Since the frog can move forward by a steps and backward by b steps, the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d. However, the frog can only reach positions that are reachable by some combination of these steps, but without stepping outside the allowed range.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >=0 and <=x, provided that x is >= a (or something like that). Let's think of an example.\n\nTake the first sample input where a=5, b=3. The d is 1. So all positions are possible. But in the sample, for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and 2. So that's 3 positions. However, floor(5/1)+1 = 6. So clearly, not all positions are reachable for small x.\n\nSo, the problem is that even though the positions are multiples of d, they may not be reachable due to the constraints on the jumps.\n\nThus, the initial idea that all multiples of d are reachable is incorrect. So, we need another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem as follows. The frog can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and b, with coefficients that are non-negative integers (for a) and non-negative integers (for b), but considering that the path taken to reach the position doesn't go outside the allowed range. However, this seems too abstract.\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a non-negative integer, and can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, such that during the process of jumping, the frog never steps outside [0, x]. But again, this is hard to model.\n\nBut perhaps we can think of the problem in terms of the frog's ability to reach positions once it can \"move freely\" within the range. For example, once the frog can reach some position, it can add a steps as long as it doesn't exceed x. Similarly, subtract b steps as long as it doesn't go below 0. So, for example, if the frog can reach a certain position, then it can reach all positions that are multiples of d, and are in the range [position - (some steps), position + (some steps)].\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog being able to reach all positions that are in the set generated by the steps, and which are in [0, x]. But how to model this set?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of BFS. For a given x, the frog can reach positions starting from 0. But since x can be up to 1e9, doing BFS for each x is impossible. Thus, we need to find a pattern or formula for f(x).\n\nBut perhaps the function f(x) can be determined based on some properties of a and b. Let's think of the following:\n\nIf a and b are such that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and within [0, x], then the answer for f(x) is floor(x/d) + 1. But in the first example, this is not the case for small x.\n\nBut maybe after some x, this becomes true. For example, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Then, the sum can be split into two parts: the part where x is below this threshold, and the part where x is above.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n2. Determine the threshold T such that for x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\n3. For x < T, compute f(x) individually.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the frog's ability to reach all positions once it can reach some base positions. For example, if the frog can reach a position from which it can generate all higher positions by adding a steps, then for x >= that position, all multiples of d up to x are reachable.\n\nBut how to find such a position?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. Once the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k + a, k + 2a, ..., up to x. Similarly, if it can reach a position m, then it can reach m - b, m - 2b, etc., down to 0. So if the frog can reach a position that is >= some value, then all higher multiples of d can be reached by adding a steps.\n\nBut what is the minimal value of k such that adding a steps allows the frog to reach all multiples of d >= k?\n\nThis seems related to the concept of the \"coin problem\" where you have coins of denominations a and b, and you want to find the largest amount that cannot be formed. But in this case, the frog can use any combination of adding a and subtracting b, but with the constraint that the frog can't go negative.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find the minimal x where all multiples of d >= x can be reached. Once that is found, then for x >= that value, all multiples of d up to x are reachable.\n\nLet me think of the case where a and b are coprime. Then, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients is ab - a - b. However, this is for the case where you can only add steps (like in the coin problem). But our problem allows subtracting steps, which complicates things.\n\nIn our problem, the frog can add a steps (which increases the position) and subtract b steps (which decreases the position). So the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, provided that it can reach it through some combination of steps.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following: since the frog can move forward by a and backward by b, the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d. So, once the frog can reach a position k, it can reach k + m*a - n*b for any m, n >=0, as long as the intermediate steps don't go out of bounds. However, this is not helpful for finding the reachable positions.\n\nAnother idea: Let's imagine that the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d, and are in the range [0, x], provided that x is at least some value. Let's say that the minimal x where this is true is T. Then, for x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients for a and any coefficients for b. But since the frog can subtract b steps, perhaps the problem becomes similar to the coin problem but with the possibility of subtracting coins.\n\nBut this seems unclear.\n\nLet me think of the following example. Take a=5, b=3. Then d=1. The frog can reach 0, 5, 2 (5-3), 7 (5+2?), no. Wait, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2, 5+5=10, 10-3=7, 7-3=4, 4-3=1, 1-3 is negative (invalid). Also, from 2, adding 5 gives 7, etc. So for x >= 7, can the frog reach all positions?\n\nFor example, x=7. Then, the positions are 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10 (but 10 is beyond x=7). So in this case, the positions are 0, 2,4,5,7. Which is 5 positions. But floor(7/1)+1 = 8, so not all positions are reachable. So even when x is larger, not all positions are reachable. Hence, my previous idea is wrong.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. So, perhaps there's no such T where for all x >= T, f(x) is floor(x/d) + 1. Then, how to proceed?\n\nAlternative approach: For the frog to reach a position k, there must exist some integer t such that k = t*a - s*b, where s and t are non-negative integers. Also, during the process of reaching k, the frog must not have stepped outside [0, x].\n\nBut this seems difficult to model.\n\nAnother idea: Since the frog can move forward by a steps, but can also move backward by b steps, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is >=0 and <=x, provided that x is large enough to allow the frog to reach that position through some sequence of steps. However, how to determine this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the following. The frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is >=0 and <=x, provided that there exists some integer c such that c*a - s*b = k, and during the jumps, the frog doesn't go out of bounds. But this is still too abstract.\n\nMaybe the key is to realize that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is in the range [0, x], provided that x is large enough to allow the frog to reach that position. For example, once the frog can reach some position, it can add a steps to reach higher positions, as long as they are within x.\n\nBut how to find if a position is reachable?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. Let's assume that the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and are in the range [L, x], where L is some lower bound. Then, for x large enough, L can be zero.\n\nBut how to find L?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of the minimal steps needed to reach a position. For example, to reach position k, the frog needs to have some combination of a's and b's. But since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps any multiple of d that is >=0 can be reached if the frog can \"jump\" to it using a combination of steps. However, the problem is that the frog can't go below zero or above x during the journey.\n\nBut how to ensure that during the journey, the frog doesn't go out of bounds?\n\nThis seems very complex. Perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the sample input again. In the first example, the output for f(7) is 8. The note says that for x=7, the frog can reach 8 positions. Let's see: the positions are 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 1, 3, 6? Or what?\n\nWait, according to the note, f(7) is 8. Let me think about how the frog can reach those positions.\n\nThe frog starts at 0. From 0, it can jump to 5 (0+5). From 5, it can jump to 5-3=2, or to 5+5=10 (but 10>7, so not allowed). From 2, it can jump to 2+5=7, or to 2-3=-1 (invalid). From 7, it can jump to 7-3=4, or 7+5=12 (invalid). From 4, it can jump to 4+5=9 (invalid) or 4-3=1. From 1, it can jump to 1+5=6, or 1-3=-2 (invalid). From 6, it can jump to 6+5=11 (invalid) or 6-3=3. From 3, it can jump to 3+5=8 (invalid) or 3-3=0. \n\nSo the reachable positions are 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 1, 3, 6. That's 8 positions. So the positions are all the numbers from 0 to 7 that are congruent to 0 mod 1 (all of them), but not all of them are reachable. Wait, why can't the frog reach 0? Oh, it starts there. So why isn't 0 counted? No, it's counted. The positions are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. But according to the note, f(7)=8, which suggests that all positions are reachable. But according to the earlier analysis, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. Yes, that's all 8 positions. So for x=7, all positions are reachable. So why is that possible?\n\nBecause the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7. But how? For example, position 1 is reached via 0 -> 5 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 1. So it requires multiple steps. So even though the frog can't reach all positions in one jump, it can reach them through multiple steps.\n\nSo, perhaps for x >= a + b, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. But in this example, a=5 and b=3. a + b = 8. But x=7 is less than 8, and the frog can reach all positions. So that hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This suggests that there's a different condition for when all positions are reachable. Perhaps the condition is that x is >= some value that depends on a and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is >=0 and <=x, as long as x is large enough to allow the frog to perform the necessary steps to reach it. For example, if the frog can reach position k, then it can reach k+a, as long as k+a <=x. So if the frog can reach some position, then it can reach higher positions by adding a steps. So if the frog can reach a position in the range [x - a + 1, x], then it can reach all positions from that point up to x by adding a steps. But how to find if such a position exists?\n\nThis seems like a classic problem where once the frog can reach a certain range, it can reach all higher positions.\n\nLet me think about the problem as follows: For the frog to be able to reach all multiples of d up to x, it must be able to reach at least one position in the range [x - a + 1, x]. If it can, then adding a steps allows it to reach x. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: once the frog can reach a position k, then for any m >=k, if m is a multiple of d and m-k is a multiple of a, then the frog can reach m by adding a steps. But this is not helpful unless m-k is a multiple of a.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the problem in terms of the frog's ability to reach any position once it has enough room to \"move around\". For example, if the frog can reach a position that allows it to generate all positions by adding and subtracting steps. For example, if the frog can reach a position that is a multiple of d, and can generate positions by adding a and subtracting b, then it can reach all positions beyond a certain point.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps I should think about the problem in terms of the following. Since the frog can move forward by a and backward by b, it can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d. But for x large enough, the frog can reach all such positions. So the problem becomes to find for each x, the number of such positions that are reachable, and then sum them up.\n\nBut how to find the number of reachable positions for each x.\n\nLet me think of the following scenario. Suppose that the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d and are in the range [0, x], provided that x is large enough. Let's say that the minimal x for which this is true is T. Then, for x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1. For x < T, f(x) is less than that.\n\nSo, the problem now is to find T, and for x < T, compute f(x) separately.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nLet's think about the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. This would happen when the frog can reach all positions from some value onwards.\n\nFor example, if the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k + a, k + 2a, ..., up to x. So if k is such that k + a >= x, then the frog can reach x by adding a steps. But this depends on k.\n\nBut how to find such a k?\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and >=0, provided that x is large enough to allow the frog to perform the necessary steps. For example, once the frog can reach a position that is >= b, it can subtract b steps to reach lower positions. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. The frog can reach all multiples of d that are in [0, x], provided that x is at least the maximum between a and b. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn the first sample input, a=5, b=3, x=7 >= max(5,3) =5. And indeed, all positions are reachable. So this hypothesis holds for this case. What about other cases?\n\nTake a=2, b=2. d=2. For x=2, the frog can reach 0, 2. For x=3, the frog can reach 0, 2. Because to reach 2, it jumps +a once. To reach 0, it jumps -b once (from 2). But for x=3, can the frog reach any other multiples of 2? Like 4? No, since 4 >3. So f(3) = 2. Which is floor(3/2)+1 = 1+1=2. So it works. For x=4, the frog can reach 0, 2, 4. So f(4)=3 = floor(4/2)+1=2+1=3. So it works.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=2. d=1. For x=3, the frog can reach 0, 3, and 3-2=1. From 1, adding 3 gives 4 (if x >=4). For x=3, the positions are 0,1,3. So f(3)=3. But floor(3/1)+1 =4. So it's not all positions. But for x=4, can the frog reach 2?\n\nYes. From 0, jump to 3, then subtract 2 to reach 1. From 1, add 3 to reach 4 (allowed for x=4). From 4, subtract 2 to reach 2. So yes, 2 is reachable. So for x=4, the positions are 0,1,2,3,4. So f(4)=5 = floor(4/1)+1=5. So it works.\n\nSo for x >= a + b, it seems that all positions are reachable. But in the first example, a=5 and b=3. a + b =8. For x=7 <8, all positions were reachable. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So what is the pattern here? It seems that once x is large enough, all multiples of d are reachable. But how to find that x?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following. For any position k that is a multiple of d, the frog can reach it if there exists a way to reach it by adding a steps and subtracting b steps, such that during the journey, the frog never goes below 0 or above x.\n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nLet's consider that the frog can reach any position k >=0 that is a multiple of d, provided that k >= (some value). Let's say that this value is the maximum between a and b. Or maybe it's the maximum of a and b multiplied by some factor.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and >=0, provided that it can reach at least one position in the range [k - b, k + a], but this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck on finding a general formula for f(x). Maybe I should look for patterns in the examples.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nIn the first example, a=5, b=3, m=7. The sum is 19. The f(x) values are as given.\n\nAnother sample input is the third example: m=100, a=100000, b=1. The output is 101. This implies that for all x from 0 to 100, f(x) = 1. Why?\n\nBecause the frog can't make any jumps. Because a=100000, which is larger than x=100. So the frog can't jump forward (since it would go beyond x). And b=1, but to jump back, the frog would have to be at position >=1. But the frog starts at 0, and can't jump back from 0. So the only reachable position is 0. Hence, for all x, f(x) =1. So the sum is 101.\n\nSo this case shows that when a is larger than x, and b is such that the frog can't make any jumps, then f(x)=1.\n\nSo, the general approach must account for cases where the frog can't make any forward jumps (because a >x), and can't make any backward jumps (because it's at 0).\n\nSo, for a given x, the frog can make forward jumps only if a <=x. Similarly, for backward jumps, the frog must be at position >=b to make a jump.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nPerhaps the problem can be divided into two cases:\n\nCase 1: The frog can't make any forward jumps (a >x) and can't make any backward jumps (since it starts at 0, and can't jump back). So the only reachable position is 0. Hence, f(x) =1.\n\nCase 2: The frog can make some jumps. In this case, the reachable positions depend on the ability to combine forward and backward jumps.\n\nBut even this division may not help directly.\n\nAnother idea: For each x, the reachable positions are those that can be reached via some sequence of jumps, and are in [0, x]. Let's think of the reachable positions as the set S(x). The size of S(x) is f(x).\n\nBut since x can be up to 1e9, we need to find a way to calculate f(x) efficiently for all x from 0 to m.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nLet's assume that for x >= a, the frog can make forward jumps. So, the frog can reach 0 +a =a. Then from a, it can jump to a +a =2a, etc., as long as it's <=x. Also, from a, it can jump back by b to a -b, provided that a -b >=0.\n\nBut this suggests that the reachable positions are all multiples of d, and can be reached via combinations of adding a and subtracting b.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nPerhaps the problem is equivalent to finding the number of positions that are multiples of d and are in the range [0, x], and also can be expressed as k*a - l*b for some non-negative integers k and l, such that during the journey, the frog never goes below 0 or above x.\n\nBut this seems too abstract.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is in [0, x], provided that x >= (some value). Let's assume that this value is the maximum of a and b. Then, for x >= max(a, b), f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut in the first example, x=5 is >= max(5,3)=5, and f(5)=3. floor(5/1)+1 =6. But the actual value is 3. So this assumption is incorrect.\n\nSo what's the correct value for x where all multiples of d are reachable?\n\nMaybe it's when x >= (a + b). Let's check the first example. a=5, b=3, x=7 >= 8? No, 7 <8. But for x=7, all positions are reachable. So this is also incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is getting frustrating. Let me think of the problem in terms of the following: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is in [0, x], provided that x is large enough to allow the frog to \"generate\" all those positions through the allowed jumps.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and >=0, as long as it can reach at least one position in the range [x - a + 1, x]. Because from that position, the frog can add a steps to reach x, and then continue to add steps to reach higher positions. But this is not helpful for x itself.\n\nAlternatively, for x >= a, the frog can reach a. From a, it can reach a -b if a >=b. So if a >=b, then the frog can reach a -b. If this is >=0, then from a-b, it can add a steps to reach a-b +a = 2a -b, etc. This forms a sequence of positions.\n\nBut how to find if all multiples of d up to x are in this sequence?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a BFS, but for large x, it's not feasible.\n\nAnother idea: Since the frog can move forward and backward, the problem is similar to being able to reach any position in the range [0, x] that is a multiple of d, provided that x is large enough to allow the frog to reach the required positions through the allowed steps. For example, once the frog can reach a position k, it can generate positions k + a, k + 2a, ..., up to x. Similarly, it can generate k -b, k -2b, ..., down to 0. So if the frog can reach a single position in the range [x - a +1, x], then it can reach all positions up to x by adding a steps. But how to find if such a position exists?\n\nBut this brings us back to the original problem: how to find if the frog can reach at least one position in [x -a +1, x].\n\nThis seems like a recursive problem, but I'm not seeing the pattern.\n\nLet me think about the following: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is in [0, x], provided that x >= a and x >= b. But this is not necessarily true.\n\nIn the first example, x=5 >= a=5 and b=3. But f(5)=3, which is less than floor(5/1) +1 =6.\n\nSo this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for patterns in the sample inputs",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line given certain constraints on its jumps. The frog starts at position 0 and can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`. The goal is to compute the sum of the number of reachable positions for all values from 0 to `m`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog can only land on positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. This is because any linear combination of `a` and `b` will be a multiple of their gcd.\n2. **Threshold Calculation**: For sufficiently large `x`, the frog can reach all multiples of `d` (where `d = gcd(a, b)`) within the range [0, x]. We determine this threshold based on the ability of the frog to make forward and backward jumps without stepping out of bounds.\n3. **Handling Edge Cases**: If the frog cannot make any forward jumps (i.e., `a > x`), it can only stay at position 0. Similarly, if `b` is too large to allow backward jumps, the frog's movement is restricted.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx += 1\n\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a //= d\n    b //= d\n\n    # Now, the problem reduces to considering a and b coprime\n    # Because the original d was factored out\n\n    # If a == 0 or b == 0, but according to input constraints, a and b are positive\n\n    # Compute the minimal x such that all multiples of d up to x are reachable\n    # But since a and b are now coprime, we can use the following approach\n\n    # The key is to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]\n    # For coprime a and b, the minimal x is a * b - a - b + ... ?\n\n    # However, given time constraints, we'll use the following approach:\n    # For each x, if x < a, then the frog can't make any forward jumps\n    # So f(x) = 1 (only 0)\n    # Otherwise, if x >= a, then the frog can reach some positions\n\n    # But how to compute f(x) efficiently?\n\n    # Let's consider the following: when x >= a, the frog can reach positions via BFS\n    # But for large m (up to 1e9), we need a mathematical formula\n\n    # Let's think again about the problem when a and b are coprime\n    # The frog can reach all positions >= (a*b - a - b) + 1 ?\n\n    # For example, in the first sample, a=5, b=3 (coprime), the threshold is 7 (which is 5*3 -5 -3 = 7)\n    # And for x >= 7, all positions are reachable\n\n    # So the threshold T is a*b - a - b\n    T = a * b - a - b\n    if T < 0:\n        T = 0\n\n    # Now, for x >= T, f(x) = x + 1 (since d = 1 in this case)\n    # Wait, no.

However, since a and b are up to 1e5, a'*b' could be up to (1e5)^2 = 1e10, which is too large for m=1e9.\n\n    # Wait, but in the problem statement, m can be up to 1e9.

Hence, we need a different approach.\n\n    # Alternative idea: For x < T, the frog can only reach positions that are reachable through some sequence of jumps without going out of bounds.

So we need to compute f(x) for each x from 0 to m, which is not feasible for m=1e9.\n\n    # Therefore, this approach is not viable for large m. Hence, I must find another way.\n\n    # Let me think differently: For the frog to reach a position k, it must be possible to write k as k = pa - qb, where p and q are non-negative integers, and during the jumps, the frog never goes below 0 or above x.\n\n    # But since this is complex, perhaps the correct way is to realize that when a and b are coprime, the frog can reach all positions >= T, where T = a*b - a - b. For x >= T, f(x) = x + 1. For x < T, f(x) is the number of positions reachable via BFS.\n\n    # However, for large m, we need to compute the sum for x < T and x >= T separately.\n\n    # Let's assume that T is small enough to compute the sum for x < T via BFS.\n\n    # So, for the given problem, here's the code:\n\n    # Compute g = gcd(a, b)\n    # a' = a//g, b' = b//g\n    # T = a' * b' - a' - b'\n    # if T < 0, set T = 0\n\n    # Now, for x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/g) + 1\n    # For x < T, we need to compute f(x) using BFS.\n\n    # However, since T can be up to (1e5)^2 = 1e10, which is too large for m=1e9, this approach may not be feasible.\n\n    # Another observation: When the frog can't make any forward jump (a > x), then f(x) = 1.

So we need to compute f(x) for each x from 0 to m, which is not feasible for m=1e9.\n\n    # Therefore, this approach is not viable for large m. Hence, I must find another way.\n\n    # Let me think differently: For the frog to reach a position k, it must be possible to write k as k = pa - qb, where p and q are non-negative integers, and during the jumps, the frog never goes below 0 or above x.\n\n    # But since this is complex, perhaps the correct way is to realize that when a and b are coprime, the frog can reach all positions >= T, where T = a*b - a - b. For x >= T, f(x) = x + 1. For x < T, f(x) is the number of positions reachable via BFS.\n\n    # However, for large m, we need to compute the sum for x < T and x >= T separately.\n\n    # Let's assume that T is small enough to compute the sum for x < T via BFS.\n\n    # So, for the given problem, here's the code:\n\n    # Compute g = gcd(a, b)\n    # a' = a//g, b' = b//g\n    # T = a' * b' - a' - b'\n    # if T < 0, set T = 0\n\n    # Now, for x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/g) + 1\n    # For x < T, we need to compute f(x) using BFS.\n\n    # However, since T can be up to (1e5)^2 = 1e10, which is too large for m=1e9, this approach may not be feasible.\n\n    # Another observation: When the frog can't make any forward jump (a > x), then f(x) = 1. Similarly, if it can't make any backward jump (b > x), then f(x) = 1 if x is 0, else depends on whether it can reach positions via forward jumps.\n\n    # But this seems too vague.\n\n    # Given the time constraints, I'll refer to the sample inputs and try to code the solution based on the assumption that for x >= T, f(x) = floor(x/g) + 1, and for x < T, we compute f(x) using BFS.\n\n    # But for large T, this is not feasible. So, the code will work for small T, but for large T, we need another approach.\n\n    # Given that the problem has a sample where a=1 and b=2019, and m=1e9, the output is sum_{i=0}^{1e9} (i+1) = 5e17 + ... which implies that for all x, f(x) = x+1. This suggests that when a=1 and b=2019, T is negative, so all x >= 0 are >= T, hence f(x) = x+1.\n\n    # So, the code should handle cases where T is negative, meaning that all x are >= T, hence f(x) = floor(x/g) + 1.\n\n    # So, the final approach is:\n\n    # 1.

Since 1 and 2019 are coprime, and T = 1*2019 -1 -2019 = -1, which is <0. Hence, all x >=0 can reach all positions, so sum is sum_{i=0}^m (i+1) = (m+1)(m+2)/2\n\n            # So, the code should check if T is <=0.

Hence, it can't move from 0. So f(x)=1 for all x.\n\n            # So, the previous approach is incorrect. Hence, the key is to determine whether the frog can make any forward jumps.\n\n            # So, the correct condition is: if a > x, then the frog can't make any forward jumps.

So, the reachable positions depend on whether the frog can make any backward jumps.\n\n            # But the frog starts at 0, and to make a backward jump, it needs to be at position >=b. Since it starts at 0, it can't make any backward jumps. Hence, for x < a, the frog can only reach 0.\n\n            # So, for x < a, f(x) = 1.\n\n            # For x >= a, the frog can make a forward jump to a.
