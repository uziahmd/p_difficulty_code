The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$.

The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the frog starts at position 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But the catch is that it can't step outside [0, x] for a given x. And for each x from 0 to m, we need to find f(x), which is the number of distinct positions reachable under these constraints. Then sum all those f(x) values.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what f(x) represents. For each x, the frog can only make jumps that keep it within 0 to x. So, the frog can reach certain positions, but not others. The challenge is to compute this efficiently for very large m (up to 1e9), so brute force approaches won't work here.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Let's consider the general case where the frog can move forward by a or backward by b. But with the constraint that it can't go below 0 or above x.\n\nBut since the frog can take multiple steps, perhaps there's a mathematical way to model the positions it can reach. Let's think about the problem without the x constraint first. What positions can the frog reach?\n\nThe frog starts at 0. Each jump adds a or subtracts b. So, any position that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, such that the total is >=0. Wait, but the frog can also do combinations of these steps. However, since the frog can jump forward and backward multiple times, maybe the positions reachable are those that are congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a, b). Because the steps are a and -b, so the total displacement is a linear combination of a and b. So, the set of reachable positions is all numbers that are multiples of d, where d is the gcd of a and b. But that's when there's no x constraint. However, in our problem, the x constraint limits the positions.\n\nBut for the problem, the x is varying. So, perhaps for each x, the positions reachable are all multiples of d (the gcd of a and b) that are between 0 and x, and also satisfy some other conditions based on the ability to reach them via steps that don't go out of bounds.\n\nWait, but even if a position is a multiple of d, can the frog reach it? For example, suppose a=5, b=3. Then d = gcd(5,3)=1. So all positions are possible. But in the first sample input, when x=5, the frog can reach positions 0, 5, and 2 (since 5-3=2). Wait, but 0+5=5, then from 5 you can subtract 3 to get 2. Then from 2, adding 5 would take you to 7, but that's beyond x=5. So for x=5, the positions are 0, 2, 5. Hence f(5)=3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the key seems to be that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (gcd(a,b)), but also that the position can be reached through a series of steps that never go out of the allowed range [0, x]. But how do we model that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions reachable are all numbers in [0, x] that are congruent to 0 mod d, and also satisfy some condition based on the steps that can be taken. But how?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose the frog can reach position k. Then, if k + a <= x, then it can jump to k+a. Similarly, if k - b >=0, then it can jump to k - b. But the problem says that the frog can make any number of jumps as long as it never steps outside [0, x]. So the reachable positions are all positions that can be reached via some sequence of steps that stay within [0, x].\n\nBut for a given x, how do we find all such positions?\n\nThis feels like a BFS problem. But for x up to 1e9, doing BFS for each x is impossible. Therefore, there must be a mathematical pattern or formula that can be derived.\n\nLet me think about the conditions that allow the frog to reach a position. Let's denote d = gcd(a, b). Let's assume that a and b are co-prime for now. Then, any position that is reachable must be a multiple of d. Wait, but if d is 1, then all positions are possible? No, because the frog can't reach every position. For example, in the first sample, with a=5 and b=3, which are coprime. But when x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, and 2. But 1,3,4 are not reachable. So the previous assumption is wrong.\n\nHmm. So what's the correct condition here?\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the problem as a graph. Each node is a position. Edges are from k to k+a (if k+a <=x) and to k-b (if k-b >=0). The reachable nodes from 0 are the positions that can be reached via these edges.\n\nBut again, for large x, we need a way to compute this without BFS.\n\nLet me think about the maximum x. Let's consider that when x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d, and also satisfy some other condition. For example, when x is large enough that the frog can perform any necessary steps.\n\nLet me think about the case when a and b are coprime. Let's take a=5, b=3. Then, the frog can reach positions that can be written as 5k - 3l, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the result is between 0 and x. But since 5 and 3 are coprime, according to the coin problem, the largest number that cannot be expressed as such is 5*3 -5 -3 = 7. But that's when you can use any number of coins. However, here, the frog can't jump backwards unless it's allowed. For example, to reach 2, you can do 5-3=2. But to reach 1, you can't. Because 5k -3l =1. Let's see: 5*2 -3*3= 10-9=1. But how would the frog reach that? Starting from 0, it would need to jump +5 twice (to 10) and then subtract 3 three times. But during the process, the frog would have to step on positions that may not be allowed. For example, starting at 0, jump to 5, then to 10. Then subtract 3 to get 7, then subtract 3 again to get 4, then subtract 3 again to get 1. But if x is 10, then that's allowed. However, in the first sample, x was 5. So the frog can't reach 1 because during the process, it would have to go to 10, which is beyond x=5. So the problem is not just about whether the position can be expressed as 5k-3l, but also whether there's a path that stays within [0,x].\n\nThis complicates things. So the problem depends on both the value of x and the way the frog can reach the positions.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to find for each x, the set of positions that can be reached, considering that during the jumps, the frog never leaves the [0,x] interval.\n\nBut how to find this set?\n\nAlternative idea: The frog can reach a position k if and only if k is a multiple of d (d = gcd(a, b)) and k can be written as k = a * p - b * q, where p and q are non-negative integers, and there exists a sequence of steps that allows the frog to reach k without leaving [0, x].\n\nBut even this seems too abstract.\n\nAnother thought: Since the frog can move forward (adding a) or backward (subtracting b), but can't go below 0 or above x. So, for the frog to reach a position k, there must be some way to reach it by a series of steps that never go out of bounds.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: For a given x, the frog can reach any position k that is in [0, x], and is congruent to 0 mod d (since the steps are a and -b, and their linear combinations are multiples of d). But even if that's true, there's the issue of whether such a position can be reached through a valid path.\n\nBut perhaps once x is sufficiently large, all positions that are multiples of d and within [0, x] can be reached. Then, for x smaller than that threshold, some positions might not be reachable.\n\nLet me try to find this threshold.\n\nFor example, in the case where a and b are coprime. Let's say a=5, b=3. Then, for x >= 5 + 3 - 1 = 7, perhaps all positions that are multiples of d=1 (so all positions) can be reached. But in the first sample, when x=7, f(7)=8. The positions are 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 4 (from 5-3?), wait, maybe I should recheck.\n\nWait the sample says for x=7, f(7)=8. The positions are:\n\n0, 5, 2 (from 5-3), 7 (from 5+2?), but how?\n\nWait, let's think:\n\nFrom 0, you can jump +5 to 5. From 5, you can jump +5 to 10 (but that's beyond x=7, so not allowed). Or subtract 3 to get 2. From 2, you can add 5 to get 7 (allowed), or subtract 3 to get -1 (invalid). So 7 is reachable. From 7, can you jump back? 7-3=4. So yes, that's allowed. So now 4 is reachable. From 4, you can add 5 to get 9 (invalid), or subtract 3 to get 1. But 1 is not allowed? No, wait, 4-3=1. If x is 7, then 1 is between 0 and 7. So why isn't 1 counted in the sample? Because in the first sample, for x=7, f(7) is 8. The positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1 (from 4-3?), but then also 1+5=6, etc. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the sample says that for x=7, f(7)=8. Let's list all positions:\n\nStart with 0. From there, you can reach 5 (0+5) and 0-3 (invalid). So only 5 is added. Now, from 5, you can reach 5+5=10 (invalid), or 5-3=2. So 2 is added. From 2, you can reach 2+5=7 (valid), or 2-3=-1 (invalid). So 7 is added. From 7, you can reach 7-3=4. So 4 is added. From 4, you can reach 4-3=1 (valid), or 4+5=9 (invalid). So 1 is added. From 1, you can reach 1+5=6 (valid), or 1-3=-2 (invalid). So 6 is added. From 6, you can reach 6-3=3 (valid), or 6+5=11 (invalid). So 3 is added. From 3, you can reach 3+5=8 (invalid) or 3-3=0 (already visited). So the positions are 0,5,2,7,4,1,6,3. That's 8 positions. So yes, that's correct. So for x=7, all positions from 0 to 7 except for 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1. Wait, all positions except 0? No, all positions from 0 to 7 except none. Wait, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. All of them. So why does the sample say that f(7)=8? Because that's exactly 8 positions. Oh, right! So in this case, when x is large enough (like 7), the frog can reach all positions. But why?\n\nBecause for a=5 and b=3, which are coprime, once x is large enough, the frog can reach any position. But how to find that threshold?\n\nThis seems similar to the Frobenius problem. For two coprime numbers a and b, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients is ab -a -b. But that's for the case where you can use any number of steps, but here, the frog's movement is constrained by the x limit.\n\nBut in the example, when x is 7, which is larger than ab -a -b = 5*3 -5 -3 = 7. So the largest number that can't be expressed is 7. But in our case, the frog can reach 7. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Wait, but the Frobenius number applies to the case where you can use any combination of a and b steps, but in our case, the frog can also take steps in reverse (subtract b) as long as it doesn't go negative. So perhaps the Frobenius problem isn't directly applicable here.\n\nBut in our example, the frog can reach 7 even though it's the Frobenius number. So that suggests that the Frobenius number isn't directly applicable here.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is that when x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (the gcd of a and b) and in the range [0, x]. So for example, if d divides x, then the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut how to determine when x is \"large enough\" for this to happen?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose that d = gcd(a, b). Let me divide a and b by d. Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Then, since a' and b' are coprime. Now, the problem reduces to the case where the frog can jump by a' or -b', and the positions must be multiples of d. So, the positions that can be reached are multiples of d, and the question is whether they can be reached under the constraints.\n\nSo, the problem can be transformed into finding for each x, the number of multiples of d in [0, x] that can be reached by the frog, given that the frog can jump +a' or -b', and the positions are between 0 and x/d.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think. Let me denote that the actual positions are multiples of d. So, let me define y = k / d. Then, the positions in terms of y are k = y * d, and the frog can jump +a or -b. Since a = a' * d, and b = b' * d. So, the jump +a corresponds to a jump of +a' in terms of y. Similarly, the jump -b corresponds to a jump of -b' in terms of y. So, the problem reduces to the same problem with a' and b', but with the positions being integers y, and the frog can jump +a' or -b', and the positions must be between 0 and x/d (since k = y*d must be ≤x → y ≤ x/d).\n\nSo, the problem becomes equivalent to solving the same problem with a' and b' (coprime) and x' = floor(x/d). Then, the answer for the original problem is the number of reachable positions in this reduced problem multiplied by 1 (since each y corresponds to one k). Therefore, the problem reduces to solving for the case when a and b are coprime, and then multiplying the result by d.\n\nSo, the first step is to compute d = gcd(a, b), and then reduce the problem to a' and b' coprime, and x' = floor(x / d). Then, the answer for the original problem is the number of positions reachable in the reduced problem multiplied by 1 (since each y corresponds to exactly one k = y*d). Wait, no. For the original problem, the number of positions is the number of reachable y's multiplied by 1 (each y corresponds to a unique k). So the problem reduces to solving for the case where a and b are coprime, and the x is divided by d.\n\nTherefore, the initial problem can be broken down into:\n\nCompute d = gcd(a, b), and then solve for the case where a and b are coprime, with x' = floor(x/d). Then, the answer for the original problem is the number of reachable positions in the reduced problem.\n\nBut if the original a and b are not coprime, then the positions reachable are multiples of d, so the count is the number of reachable positions in the reduced problem (with a'=a/d and b'=b/d, coprime) multiplied by 1 (since each y corresponds to one k = y*d).\n\nSo, the main problem is to find for the case where a and b are coprime, the number of positions reachable for a given x'.\n\nOnce we have that, we can handle the general case.\n\nSo, now the problem reduces to solving for the case when a and b are coprime. Let's focus on that.\n\nLet me denote that a and b are coprime. We need to find for a given x, the number of positions y in [0, x] that can be reached by the frog starting at 0, with jumps +a or -b, and never stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the reachable positions. Since a and b are coprime, the positions reachable are all integers that can be expressed as (some combination of +a and -b steps) and are in [0, x].\n\nBut how to find this set?\n\nLet me think of the possible positions. The frog can move forward by a steps or backward by b steps. However, the frog can't go below 0 or above x.\n\nLet me think of the minimal steps needed to reach a certain position. For example, to reach position y, the frog can have made some number of forward steps and some number of backward steps.\n\nBut since the frog can take any number of steps, perhaps the reachable positions are all y such that y is ≥ 0, y ≤ x, and y ≡ 0 mod gcd(a, b). But since a and b are coprime, that's all integers. However, earlier examples show that even when a and b are coprime, there are positions that can't be reached for small x.\n\nBut once x is large enough, all positions can be reached. So perhaps there's a threshold x0 such that for x ≥ x0, the number of reachable positions is x+1 (all positions from 0 to x). But how to find x0?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the threshold is when x is large enough that the frog can reach any position in [0, x] by some combination of steps. For example, once x is ≥ a + b - 1, then all positions can be reached. But I'm not sure.\n\nIn the first example, a=5, b=3. When x=7, which is a + b -1 = 5+3-1=7, the frog can reach all positions. So that seems to fit. So perhaps the threshold is a + b -1.\n\nLet me check another example. Suppose a=2, b=3 (coprime). Then the threshold is 2+3-1=4. For x=4, can the frog reach all positions?\n\nLet's see:\n\nPositions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nStarting from 0:\n\nJump +2 to 2. From 2, jump +2 to 4. From 4, jump -3 to 1. From 1, jump +2 to 3. From 3, jump -3 to 0. So positions 0, 2, 4, 1, 3. All positions. So yes, for x=4, all positions are reachable.\n\nBut what about x=3? Then, the positions are 0, 2, 3 (from 0+2=2, then 2+2=4 which is beyond x=3. So from 2, can jump -3 to -1 (invalid). So from 2, can't go anywhere else. So 0, 2. Also, can the frog reach 3? Let's see. From 0, can't jump to 3. But from 2, if you could jump +2 to 4 (invalid). So no. How else? Maybe via other steps. For example, can the frog reach 3 by jumping +2 and then -3? Let's see: Start at 0, jump +2 to 2. Then jump -3 would take us to -1 (invalid). So no. So for x=3, the frog can't reach 3. Hence, the threshold is indeed a + b -1.\n\nSo the hypothesis is: For x ≥ a + b -1, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. For x < a + b -1, it can't reach all positions.\n\nIf this holds, then for the case when a and b are coprime, the number of reachable positions f(x) is:\n\nif x < a + b -1: some value depending on x\n\nelse: x + 1.\n\nSo, the problem becomes to compute for each x, the number of reachable positions, which for x >= a + b -1 is x+1, and for x < a + b -1, it's something else.\n\nBut how to compute the sum over x from 0 to m of f(x)?\n\nFirst, let's handle the case where a and b are not coprime. As discussed earlier, we can reduce the problem to the coprime case by dividing by d = gcd(a, b).\n\nSo, let's proceed with the steps:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n2. Let a' = a / d, b' = b / d. Since a and b are divided by their gcd, a' and b' are coprime.\n\n3. For the original problem, the positions reachable are multiples of d. For each x, the maximum multiple of d less than or equal to x is floor(x / d). Let's call this value x'. The number of reachable positions for the original problem is equal to the number of reachable positions in the reduced problem (with a' and b') for x', multiplied by 1 (since each such position corresponds to exactly one multiple of d in the original problem).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to solving for a' and b' coprime, and then multiplying the result by 1 (no change in count). So, the rest of the solution focuses on solving for coprime a and b.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for each x, the number of reachable positions when a and b are coprime.\n\nAs per the hypothesis, for x >= a + b -1, the number of reachable positions is x + 1. For x < a + b -1, it's a different value.\n\nBut how to compute the sum from x=0 to m of f(x), where for x >= T (where T = a + b -1), f(x) = x + 1, and for x < T, f(x) is some function.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute T = a + b - 1.\n\nIf m < T: compute the sum of f(x) for x from 0 to m.\n\nElse: compute the sum for x from 0 to T-1, plus the sum from x=T to m of (x+1).\n\nBut how to compute the sum for x < T?\n\nLet's think about the case when a and b are coprime, and T = a + b - 1.\n\nFor x < T, the number of reachable positions is the number of positions that can be reached by the frog, given that it can't go beyond x.\n\nBut how to compute this for all x from 0 to T-1?\n\nWell, since T is up to 2*1e5 (since a and b are up to 1e5), and m can be up to 1e9, but for x < T, we can precompute f(x) using BFS for each x. However, since T can be up to 2e5 (since a and b are up to 1e5), and for each x up to T-1, doing BFS would be O(T^2) which is not feasible.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think about the reachable positions for x >= some value.\n\nAlternatively, for the coprime case, the number of reachable positions for x is equal to the number of integers in [0, x] that are reachable via the frog's steps. But how?\n\nAnother observation: For any x, the frog can reach all positions that are >= (some value) and <= x, and also some positions below that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the coprime case, the number of reachable positions for x is equal to the number of integers in [0, x] that are congruent to 0 mod 1 (which is all of them), but with the constraint that the frog can reach them. But earlier examples show that for small x, not all positions are reachable.\n\nBut once x is large enough (>= T), then all positions are reachable.\n\nSo, for x < T, the number of reachable positions is the same as the number of positions in [0, x] that can be reached by the frog. To compute this for all x up to T-1, perhaps we can precompute for all x up to T-1 the value of f(x) using BFS.\n\nBut T can be up to 2e5 (since a and b are up to 1e5), and for each x up to T-1, doing BFS would be O(T) per x, leading to O(T^2) time. Which for T=2e5 is 4e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For the coprime case, the number of reachable positions for x is equal to the number of positions that are reachable in the entire number line (without the x constraint) and are <=x. Because once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions. But for small x, it can't reach all positions.\n\nBut how to find the number of positions in [0, x] that are reachable in the entire number line?\n\nBut the problem is that the frog can't reach all positions in the entire number line, even for large x. Wait, no. Earlier example shows that when x is large enough (T = a + b -1), the frog can reach all positions. So for x >= T, all positions are reachable. Thus, the number of reachable positions for x >= T is x+1.\n\nSo for x < T, the number of reachable positions is the number of positions in [0, x] that are reachable in the entire number line (i.e., can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients, but allowing for steps that go beyond x as long as the path to reach them is possible).\n\nWait, but this seems complicated. However, the key insight is that for x >= T, all positions are reachable. For x < T, the number of reachable positions is the same as the number of positions that are reachable in the entire number line (i.e., the positions that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients) and are <=x.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nThis brings us back to the Frobenius problem. For two coprime numbers a and b, the number of non-representable numbers is (a-1)(b-1)/2. The largest non-representable number is ab -a -b. However, this counts the numbers that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients.\n\nBut in our case, the frog can reach any number that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. But how?\n\nFor example, in the case of a=5, b=3. The Frobenius number is 7. All numbers greater than 7 can be expressed as 5k +3m for non-negative integers k, m. But in our case, the frog can reach 7 by jumping forward and backward steps. However, the Frobenius problem considers only forward steps (adding a and b), not subtracting. So the Frobenius problem's results may not directly apply here.\n\nBut in our case, the frog can reach positions by combining forward and backward steps. For example, to reach 1, which is not expressible as 5k + 3m, but can be expressed as 5*2 - 3*3 = 10-9=1. So the frog can reach positions that are not representable by the Frobenius problem's definition. Hence, the Frobenius problem is not directly applicable.\n\nThis suggests that the reachable positions in the entire number line are all integers >=0. Which contradicts the earlier example where the frog couldn't reach 1 when x was small. But when x is large enough, it can reach 1. So, perhaps for any integer >=0, the frog can reach it if x is large enough.\n\nBut how?\n\nYes, because the frog can reach any integer >=0 when x is sufficiently large. For example, if a and b are coprime, then for any integer k >=0, there exist non-negative integers p and q such that k = pa - qb. But how to ensure that this is possible?\n\nAlternatively, since a and b are coprime, the frog can reach any integer by combining forward and backward steps. But how to ensure that during the steps, it doesn't go out of bounds. But when x is large enough, it can.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x for which all positions are reachable?\n\nEarlier example suggested that x >= a + b -1 is sufficient.\n\nSo, assuming that for x >= T = a + b -1, all positions are reachable, then for x < T, the number of reachable positions is the number of positions that can be expressed as pa - qb, where p and q are non-negative integers, and the value is between 0 and x. But how to compute this?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, since T is up to 2e5, perhaps we can precompute for all positions up to T, whether they are reachable, and then for x < T, f(x) is the number of reachable positions up to x.\n\nBut how to compute which positions are reachable up to T?\n\nThis sounds like a BFS problem. For example, for the coprime case, we can perform BFS from 0, considering that the frog can jump +a or -b, but ensuring that the position stays within [0, T].\n\nBut since T is up to 2e5, this is feasible.\n\nLet me think about this. For the coprime case, we can precompute for all positions from 0 to T whether they are reachable. Once we have that, for any x < T, f(x) is the number of reachable positions in [0, x].\n\nThen, for the sum over x from 0 to m, we can split it into two parts:\n\n- For x < T: sum of f(x) for x from 0 to min(m, T-1)\n\n- For x >= T: if m >= T, then sum from x=T to m of (x+1)\n\nBut how to compute the first part?\n\nWe can precompute an array reachable, where reachable[k] is True if position k is reachable. Then, for each x, the count is the number of True in reachable[0..x].\n\nTo compute this efficiently, we can create a prefix sum array, say prefix_sum, where prefix_sum[x] = number of reachable positions from 0 to x. Then, for x < T, the contribution to the sum is prefix_sum[x].\n\nSo, the plan for the coprime case is:\n\n1. Compute T = a + b -1.\n\n2. Perform BFS from 0, with the constraint that positions are between 0 and T. The reachable positions are those that can be reached via jumps +a or -b, staying within [0, T].\n\n3. Create an array reachable of size T+1, where reachable[k] is True if k is reachable.\n\n4. Create a prefix sum array prefix_sum, where prefix_sum[x] = sum_{i=0}^x reachable[i].\n\nThen, for the sum up to m:\n\nIf m < T:\n\nsum = prefix_sum[m]\n\nElse:\n\nsum = prefix_sum[T-1] + sum_{x=T}^m (x+1)\n\nBut sum_{x=T}^m (x+1) is sum_{k=T+1}^{m+1} k} - (T+1) ? Wait:\n\nsum_{x=T}^m (x+1) = sum_{y=T+1}^{m+1} y} - T ?\n\nWait, x ranges from T to m. x+1 ranges from T+1 to m+1. So the sum is sum_{y=T+1}^{m+1} y} = [ (m+1)(m+2)/2 ] - [ T*(T+1)/2 ].\n\nSo the formula is (m+1)*(m+2)//2 - T*(T+1)//2.\n\nBut this is only valid when m >= T.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor the coprime case, the sum is:\n\nif m < T:\n\nsum = prefix_sum[m]\n\nelse:\n\nsum = prefix_sum[T-1] + ( (m+1)*(m+2)//2 - T*(T+1)//2 )\n\nNow, the problem is to compute this for the reduced case (a' and b' coprime), and then multiply by 1 (since the original problem's reachable positions are multiples of d, and the count is the same as in the reduced case).\n\nBut what about the case when a and b are not coprime?\n\nLet me recap:\n\nOriginal problem:\n\nd = gcd(a, b)\n\na' = a/d, b' = b/d\n\nThen, the sum for the original problem is equal to the sum computed for a' and b' (coprime) multiplied by 1 (since each reachable position in the reduced problem corresponds to exactly one position in the original problem).\n\nBut wait, no. For the original problem, the positions are multiples of d. So, for example, in the reduced problem, if a position y is reachable, then the original position is y*d. So the count of reachable positions in the original problem is the same as the count of reachable positions in the reduced problem.\n\nSo, the sum for the original problem is the same as the sum computed for the reduced problem (a' and b').\n\nThus, the overall approach is:\n\nCompute d = gcd(a, b)\n\nCompute a' = a/d, b' = b/d\n\nCompute T' = a' + b' - 1\n\nThen, compute the sum for the reduced problem with a' and b', and that is the answer for the original problem.\n\nBut wait, what if a' or b' is zero? Well, the input constraints state that a and b are positive integers, so after division by d, a' and b' are still positive integers.\n\nNow, there's a special case when either a or b is zero? No, the problem says that a and b are positive integers.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead m, a, b.\n\nCompute d = gcd(a, b)\n\na' = a // d\n\nb' = b // d\n\nNow, compute the sum for a' and b', which are coprime.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to solving for a' and b' coprime.\n\nNow, for the coprime case:\n\nCompute T = a' + b' - 1.\n\nIf T is larger than m, then compute the sum for x up to m using the prefix_sum array.\n\nElse, compute the prefix_sum up to T-1, and add the sum from T to m of (x+1).\n\nNow, the code needs to implement this.\n\nBut how to compute the prefix_sum array for the coprime case.\n\nLet's think about the BFS.\n\nFor the coprime case, the frog can jump +a' or -b', but can't go below 0 or above T.\n\nSo, the BFS starts at 0, and explores all reachable positions.\n\nThe steps:\n\nInitialize a boolean array reachable of size T+1, initially False.\n\nSet reachable[0] = True.\n\nUse a queue (BFS) to explore positions.\n\nFor each position k in the queue:\n\n- Check if k + a' <= T. If so, and if reachable[k + a'] is not yet set, set it to True and add to queue.\n\n- Check if k - b' >= 0. If so, and if reachable[k - b'] is not yet set, set it to True and add to queue.\n\nThis will mark all positions reachable in the T-sized range.\n\nOnce this is done, we can compute the prefix_sum array.\n\nBut what about the case where a' or b' is 0? No, since a and b are positive, and d is their gcd, so a' and b' are positive.\n\nBut what if a' is 1 and b' is 1? Then T = 1 + 1 -1 = 1.\n\nSo, for",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct positions a frog can reach on a number line given certain jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these values for all positions from 0 to a given integer m. The frog can jump either forward by a fixed distance `a` or backward by a fixed distance `b`, but it cannot step outside the interval [0, x] for any given x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **GCD Reduction**: First, reduce the problem by dividing both `a` and `b` by their greatest common divisor (gcd) to simplify the problem. This helps in handling cases where `a` and `b` are not coprime.\n2. **Threshold Calculation**: Determine a threshold value `T` which is the sum of `a` and `b` minus 1. This threshold helps in distinguishing between small and large ranges of x values.\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: For values of x less than the threshold `T`, use BFS to determine reachable positions within the range [0, T]. This allows us to precompute the number of reachable positions for all x up to `T`.\n4. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array from the results of the BFS to quickly compute the sum of reachable positions for any x up to `T`.\n5. **Sum Calculation**: For values of x greater than or equal to the threshold `T`, use a direct formula to compute the sum of reachable positions efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n\n    # Compute d = gcd(a, b)\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a_prime = a // d\n    b_prime = b // d\n\n    # Now handle the case for a_prime and b_prime which are coprime\n    T = a_prime + b_prime - 1\n\n    # If a_prime and b_prime are both 1, then all positions are reachable\n    if a_prime == 1 and b_prime == 1:\n        # All positions are reachable\n        total = (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2\n        print(total)\n        return\n\n    # Compute reachable positions up to T using BFS\n    max_T = T\n    reachable = [False] * (max_T + 1)\n    reachable[0] = True\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(0)\n\n    while q:\n        current = q.popleft()\n        # Jump forward by a_prime\n        next_pos = current + a_prime\n        if next_pos <= max_T and not reachable[next_pos]:\n            reachable[next_pos] = True\n            q.append(next_pos)\n        # Jump backward by b_prime\n        next_pos = current - b_prime\n        if next_pos >= 0 and not reachable[next_pos]:\n            reachable[next_pos] = True\n            q.append(next_pos)\n\n    # Compute prefix_sum array\n    prefix_sum = [0] * (max_T + 1)\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(max_T + 1):\n        if reachable[i]:\n            count += 1\n        prefix_sum[i] = count\n\n    # Now calculate the total sum\n    if m < T:\n        total = prefix_sum[m]\n    else:\n        # Sum for x < T\n        sum_part1 = prefix_sum[T - 1]\n        # Sum for x >= T: sum_{x=T}^m (x+1) = sum_{k=T+1}^{m+1} k\n        # Which is (m+1)(m+2)/2 - T*(T+1)/2\n        sum_part2 = ( (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2 ) - ( T * (T + 1) // 2 )\n        total = sum_part1 + sum_part2\n\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **GCD Reduction**: By reducing `a` and `b` using their gcd, we simplify the problem to handling coprime values, making further calculations more straightforward.\n2. **Threshold Calculation**: The threshold `T` helps in determining when the frog can reach all positions within a range, simplifying the problem for larger values of x.\n3. **BFS for Reachable Positions**: Using BFS ensures that we efficiently explore all reachable positions within the threshold range, which is crucial for smaller values of x.\n4. **Prefix Sum Array**: This array allows quick lookup of the number of reachable positions up to any given x, enhancing the efficiency of sum calculations.\n5. **Efficient Sum Calculation**: For values of x beyond the threshold, a direct mathematical formula is used to compute the sum, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of m.",
