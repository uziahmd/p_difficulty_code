Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which is a lowercase letter or a question mark. The question mark can match any color. I need to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair consists of one left and one right boot with compatible colors. And then output those pairs.\n\nThe key here is to maximize the number of pairs. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, think about how to pair them optimally. Let's consider that each left boot can be paired with a right boot if their colors are compatible. But since each boot can be used once, we need to find a way to match them optimally.\n\nAn initial thought: For each color (including ?), count how many left and right boots have that color. Then, for each color, pair as many as possible between left and right. But since ? can match any, maybe we need to handle them carefully.\n\nWait, but how to handle the ?s? Because they can be matched with any other color, including other ?s. However, pairing them with specific colors might be better than pairing them with each other, depending on the situation.\n\nLet me think of an approach:\n\nStep 1: Pair all the specific colors first. For example, for each color c (not ?), pair left boots with color c with right boots with color c. This would be the maximum possible for those specific colors. But how to do that?\n\nBut perhaps, for each color c (excluding ?), we can take the minimum of the count of left c's and right c's, and pair them. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which could be ? or others), pair them with ?s.\n\nWait, but maybe that's not optimal. For example, if there are some left boots with color 'a' and right boots with color 'b', but if there are also some left and right ?s, maybe pairing the left 'a's with right ?s and vice versa would be better than leaving them unpaired.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best approach is to first pair left and right boots that have the same color (non-?), then use the ?s to fill in the gaps.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother approach: Let's separate the left and right boots into counts for each color. Let's create dictionaries for left and right counts, excluding the ?s. Then, for each color c, pair as many as possible between left[c] and right[c]. Then, after that, the remaining left and right boots (including ?s) can be paired with each other.\n\nBut how to handle the ?s. For example, after pairing all non-? specific colors, the remaining left and right boots may have some ?s and some non-?s. For example, suppose there are left ?s and right non-?s. Then, each left ? can be paired with a right non-? (since ? can match any). Similarly for the other way around.\n\nBut maybe the optimal way is to pair the non-?s first, then pair the remaining ?s with each other and the remaining non-?s.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. Let's think of the following steps:\n\n1. For each color c (not ?), pair left[c] with right[c], taking the min of the two. So, for example, if left has 3 a's and right has 5 a's, we pair 3 of them. Then, subtract those from the counts.\n\n2. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (which include ?s and any leftover non-?s), pair the ?s with any available non-?s. For example, if there are left ?s and right non-?s, each left ? can be paired with a right non-? (but only if that right non-? hasn't been paired yet). Similarly for right ?s with left non-?s.\n\n3. Finally, pair the remaining ?s between left and right. Since each ? can match any other ?.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nBut the problem is that the order in which we pair these might affect the total. For example, if we have left ?s and right ?s, but also some left a's and right b's, maybe pairing the left a's with right ?s and left ?s with right b's would be better than pairing the ?s together. But how to decide?\n\nBut since the problem requires maximum pairs, perhaps the optimal approach is:\n\n- First pair all same-colored non-? pairs.\n\n- Then, pair as many as possible between left non-?s and right ?s, and vice versa.\n\n- Then, pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to track which boots are used?\n\nWait, but the problem requires that we output the actual pairs, not just the count. So, the approach must not only compute the maximum number but also track which boots are paired.\n\nThis complicates things, because we need to track individual positions.\n\nSo perhaps the way to proceed is:\n\nWe need to collect for each color (excluding ?) the indices of left and right boots. Then, pair them. Then, for the remaining, pair the ?s with other non-?s, then pair the remaining ?s.\n\nBut how to manage this?\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\nFirst, for each color c (excluding ?), pair as many left c's with right c's as possible. For example, for each c, take the left indices and right indices, and pair them in some way. For example, take the first min(left_count[c], right_count[c]) pairs.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired), process the ?s. For example, collect all left ?s and right non-?s. Pair each left ? with a right non-? (if any). Similarly, pair right ?s with left non-?s. Then, pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nLet me think about data structures. For each color, we can have lists of indices. For example, left_counts is a dictionary where keys are colors, and values are lists of indices (1-based?) of left boots with that color. Similarly for right_counts.\n\nThen, for each color c (not ?), we can pair the left and right indices. For example, for c in left_counts and right_counts:\n\nTake the minimum of the lengths of left_counts[c] and right_counts[c], and pair them. For example, for i in 0 to min-1: pair left_indices[i] with right_indices[i].\n\nOnce that is done, we can remove those from the left and right counts. Then, the remaining left and right boots (including ?s) can be processed.\n\nBut then, after that, for the remaining left and right boots, we can collect all the left non-?s and right non-?s. Wait, no. Because after step 1, the left and right counts for non-? colors have been processed. So the remaining left and right boots are:\n\nLeft boots that are either ? or have colors that were not matched (e.g., if there were more left a's than right a's, then the excess left a's remain).\n\nSimilarly for the right boots.\n\nSo, for the next step, we can collect all left boots that are not paired yet, which may include:\n\n- Left boots with colors that have not been matched (like left a's when there were not enough right a's).\n\n- Left boots with ?.\n\nSame for the right.\n\nNow, the idea is to pair the left ?s with right non-?s, and vice versa. Because each ? can match any non-?.\n\nSo, for example, take all left ?s and pair them with right non-?s that are not yet paired. Then, take all right ?s and pair them with left non-?s that are not yet paired. Then, pair the remaining ?s between left and right.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nLet me think about the following steps:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\n- We have some left boots that are not paired. These can be:\n\n   - Left boots with color c (non-?), but their count was higher than the right's count for c.\n\n   - Left boots with ?.\n\nSimilarly for the right.\n\nSo, for step 2:\n\nCollect all left non-?s (those that are not paired yet) and all right non-?s (those not paired yet). Also collect left ?s and right ?s.\n\nFor each left ? and right non-? (not yet paired), pair them. Similarly, for each right ? and left non-? (not paired yet), pair them.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nWe can collect all left non-?s (unpaired) into a list. Similarly for right non-?s. Then, for each left non-? in the list, we can pair it with a right ? (if available), and vice versa.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to pair as many as possible between left non-? and right ?. Let me think:\n\nSuppose we have L_left (left non-? unpaired) and R_right (right non-? unpaired). Also, left_q (left ? unpaired) and right_q (right ? unpaired).\n\nWe can pair each left non-? with a right ? (if possible). Then, pair each right non-? with a left ? (if possible). Then, pair the remaining left ? and right ?.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of code steps.\n\nFirst, create for left and right:\n\nFor left, a list of all the indices for each color. For example, left_dict = defaultdict(list), where for each color c, left_dict[c] contains the indices (1-based?) of left boots with color c.\n\nSame for right_dict.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_dict and right_dict (excluding ?):\n\n   Take the minimum of len(left_dict[c]) and len(right_dict[c]). Pair them.\n\n   For example, for i in 0 to min_val-1:\n\n      pair left_dict[c][i] with right_dict[c][i]\n\n   Then, remove those elements from left_dict[c] and right_dict[c]. Or, perhaps, keep track of which ones are used.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used? Because once they are paired, they cannot be used again.\n\nSo, perhaps, after pairing, the left_dict[c] will have the remaining elements. For example, if left_dict[c] had m elements and right_dict[c] had n elements, and m > n, then after pairing, the left_dict[c] will have m - n elements left. Similarly for the other way around.\n\nBut perhaps, after processing each color, we can leave the lists as the remaining elements. Then, after processing all non-? colors, we can collect all left non-?s (from all colors except ?) and right non-?s.\n\nThen, for the remaining left non-?s and right non-?s, we can pair them with ?s.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nAfter step 1, collect all left non-?s that are unpaired (they are in left_dict for colors other than ?), and same for right non-?s.\n\nThen, collect all left ?s (left_dict['?']) and right ?s (right_dict['?']).\n\nNow, for the left non-?s and right ?s:\n\nWe can pair each left non-? with a right ?.\n\nSimilarly, pair each right non-? with a left ?.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\nTake the left non-?s (unpaired) and right ?s (unpaired). For each left non-? in this list, pair it with a right ?.\n\nSimilarly, for each right non-? in this list, pair it with a left ?.\n\nBut how to do this in code? Let's say:\n\nWe have:\n\nleft_non_q = list of all left non-? unpaired (from all colors except ?)\n\nright_non_q = list of all right non-? unpaired (from all colors except ?)\n\nleft_q = left_dict['?']\n\nright_q = right_dict['?']\n\nNow, for each element in left_non_q, we can pair it with a right_q element. Let's say we take the first min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q)) elements. For each of those, pair them.\n\nThen, for the remaining elements in right_non_q, pair them with left_q elements. Again, take min(len(right_non_q), len(left_q)).\n\nThen, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired with each other.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used? Well, perhaps during this process, we can iterate through the lists and pair them, removing the elements once paired.\n\nBut how to manage the lists?\n\nAlternatively, for each left non-? in left_non_q, we can pair with a right ? from right_q. For example, take the first k elements from left_non_q and pair them with the first k elements of right_q. Then, the same for the right_non_q and left_q.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired with each other. The number of pairs here is min(len(left_q), len(right_q)).\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of code steps:\n\nAfter step 1, the left and right have some unpaired boots. Now, collect all left non-?s (unpaired) into a list called left_non_q_list. Similarly for right_non_q_list.\n\nThen:\n\ncount_pairs = 0\n\npairs = []\n\n# Pair left_non_q with right_q:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_non_q_list), len(right_q_list))):\n\n   pair left_non_q_list[i] with right_q_list[i]\n\n   add to pairs\n\n   count_pairs +=1\n\n# Then pair right_non_q with left_q:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(right_non_q_list), len(left_q_list))):\n\n   pair right_non_q_list[i] with left_q_list[i]\n\n   add to pairs\n\n   count_pairs +=1\n\n# Then pair left_q with right_q:\n\nremaining_left_q = len(left_q_list) - ... ?\n\nWait, but after the first two steps, the left_q_list and right_q_list have some elements left. For example, after pairing left_non_q with right_q, the right_q_list may have some elements left. Similarly for left_q_list after pairing right_non_q with left_q.\n\nSo, the remaining elements in left_q and right_q can be paired. For example, take min(len(left_q), len(right_q)), and pair them.\n\nBut how to track which elements are left?\n\nAlternatively, after the first two steps, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as much as possible.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, the left_q and right_q are the original lists. So, for example, after step 1, the left_q is the list of all left ?s that were not paired in step 1. Similarly for right_q.\n\nBut then, during step 2, we pair some of them with non-?s. So, perhaps we can process the left_non_q and right_q, and then process right_non_q and left_q.\n\nBut how to collect the left_non_q and right_non_q?\n\nAlternatively, after step 1, for all colors except ?, we have some left and right boots that are unpaired. So, we can collect all left boots that are not ? and not yet paired into a list called left_unpaired_non_q. Similarly for right_unpaired_non_q.\n\nThen, collect all left ?s (left_unpaired_q) and right ?s (right_unpaired_q).\n\nThen, for each left in left_unpaired_non_q, we can pair with a right_unpaired_q. For example, take as many as possible. Then, for each right in right_unpaired_non_q, pair with a left_unpaired_q. Then, pair the remaining left_unpaired_q and right_unpaired_q.\n\nBut how to collect the left_unpaired_non_q and right_unpaired_non_q?\n\nWell, after step 1, the left_dict and right_dict for non-? colors have their remaining elements. So, for example, for each color c in left_dict (excluding ?), we can add all elements of left_dict[c] to left_unpaired_non_q. Similarly for right_dict.\n\nSo, let's think of code steps:\n\nInitialize left_dict and right_dict as defaultdict(list).\n\nFor each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   left_char = l[i]\n\n   if left_char != '?':\n\n       left_dict[left_char].append(i+1)  # assuming 1-based index\n\n   else:\n\n       left_dict['?'].append(i+1)\n\nSame for right_dict.\n\nThen, for each color c in left_dict and right_dict (excluding ?), we process them.\n\nBut wait, for all colors except ?, we need to pair left and right of same color.\n\nBut how to loop through all possible colors? For example, for all colors present in left_dict and right_dict.\n\nBut perhaps, for each color c in the set of all possible colors (a-z plus ?), we check if both left and right have entries. But perhaps, for all colors except ?, we can process them.\n\nBut to avoid missing any, perhaps:\n\nfor c in all possible colors except '?':\n\n   if c is in left_dict and c is in right_dict:\n\n       take min(len(left_dict[c]), len(right_dict[c])) pairs.\n\n       for i in 0 to min-1:\n\n           pair left_dict[c][i] with right_dict[c][i]\n\n       then, remove those elements from left_dict[c] and right_dict[c].\n\nWait, but how to remove them? Because after pairing, we need to have the remaining elements. For example, if left_dict[c] had 5 elements, and right_dict[c] had 3, then after pairing 3, the left_dict[c] would have 2 elements left.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can do:\n\nfor c in all possible colors except '?':\n\n   if c in left_dict and c in right_dict:\n\n       num_pairs = min(len(left_dict[c]), len(right_dict[c]))\n\n       for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n           pair left_dict[c][i], right_dict[c][i]\n\n       # Now, we need to remove those paired elements from the lists.\n\n       # But since we can't modify the lists while iterating, perhaps we can truncate them.\n\n       # For example, left_dict[c] = left_dict[c][num_pairs:]\n\n       # Similarly for right_dict[c]\n\nBut wait, in Python, list slicing creates a new list. So, after pairing, the left_dict[c] and right_dict[c] would have their remaining elements.\n\nBut how to process all colors? Well, perhaps we can iterate over all possible characters in the left_dict and right_dict.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to iterate through all possible colors (a-z) and check if they exist in both left and right dicts.\n\nBut for code efficiency, since n can be up to 150,000, and the number of colors is 26, this is manageable.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nInitialize left_dict and right_dict as defaultdict(list).\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   if c is present in left_dict and right_dict:\n\n       take the min of the lengths of left_dict[c] and right_dict[c], pair them.\n\n       for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n           add pair (left_dict[c][i], right_dict[c][i])\n\n       then, truncate the left_dict[c] and right_dict[c] lists to remove the paired elements.\n\nSo, after this, the left_dict[c] and right_dict[c] have the remaining elements (if any) that couldn't be paired.\n\nOnce this is done, we have the left_dict and right_dict containing:\n\n- For each color c (a-z), the unpaired left and right boots of color c.\n\n- The '?' entries in left_dict and right_dict contain the unpaired ?s.\n\nNow, the next step is to pair the remaining boots.\n\nNow, the remaining boots are:\n\nLeft boots: left_dict[c] for all c (including ?) that have elements.\n\nRight boots: same.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the left non-?s with right ?s, and vice versa.\n\nBut how to collect all the left non-?s and right ?s.\n\nSo, collect all left non-? unpaired boots into a list called left_non_q. Similarly for right_non_q.\n\nBut left_non_q is all elements in left_dict for colors other than '?'. Similarly for right_non_q.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nleft_non_q = []\nfor c in left_dict:\n    if c != '?':\n        left_non_q.extend(left_dict[c])\n\nSimilarly for right_non_q.\n\nThen, collect left_q = left_dict['?'], right_q = right_dict['?'].\n\nNow, the idea is to pair as many as possible between left_non_q and right_q, and between right_non_q and left_q.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nFor example, for each element in left_non_q, we can pair it with an element in right_q.\n\nBut since the order may affect the result, perhaps we can iterate through them and pair them in order.\n\nSo, for example:\n\ni = 0\n\nj = 0\n\nwhile i < len(left_non_q) and j < len(right_q):\n\n   pair left_non_q[i] with right_q[j]\n\n   i += 1\n\n   j += 1\n\nSimilarly for pairing right_non_q with left_q:\n\ni = 0\n\nj = 0\n\nwhile i < len(right_non_q) and j < len(left_q):\n\n   pair right_non_q[i] with left_q[j]\n\n   i += 1\n\n   j += 1\n\nThen, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired between themselves. For example, take the min of their lengths and pair them.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining elements after the first two steps?\n\nAlternatively, after the first two steps, the left_q and right_q lists would have some elements left. For example, if there were more right_q elements than left_non_q, then after pairing left_non_q with right_q, the remaining right_q elements are len(right_q) - len(left_non_q).\n\nSimilarly for the other case.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nIn code, perhaps:\n\nAfter collecting left_non_q and right_non_q, and left_q and right_q:\n\n# Pair left_non_q with right_q:\n\npaired = min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(paired):\n\n   pair left_non_q[i], right_q[i]\n\nThen, the remaining right_q is right_q[paired:]\n\nSimilarly, for pairing right_non_q with left_q:\n\npaired = min(len(right_non_q), len(left_q))\n\nfor i in range(paired):\n\n   pair right_non_q[i], left_q[i]\n\nThen, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired with each other.\n\nBut how to collect these lists? Well, in code, perhaps we can create copies of the lists, and then process them.\n\nBut in practice, since we can't modify the original lists during iteration, perhaps we need to create temporary lists for this step.\n\nBut how to manage this?\n\nAlternatively, after pairing the left_non_q and right_q, we can take the first 'paired' elements from right_q and remove them. Similarly for the other steps.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nleft_non_q = [all left non-? unpaired]\n\nright_q = [all right ? unpaired]\n\npairing between them:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))):\n\n   add (left_non_q[i], right_q[i]) to pairs.\n\nThen, the remaining right_q is right_q[min(...):], and the left_non_q is left_non_q[min(...):].\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can take slices.\n\nBut perhaps, after pairing, we can take the remaining left_non_q and right_non_q as the ones not used.\n\nBut perhaps, for code simplicity, we can process the left_non_q and right_q as follows:\n\nTake the first min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q)) elements from left_non_q and pair them with the first min(...) elements of right_q. Then, the remaining left_non_q and right_q are the ones not used.\n\nBut in code, after this, the right_q is now the part that wasn't paired. Then, we can process the right_non_q and left_q similarly.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining left_q and right_q?\n\nAlternatively, after pairing left_non_q with right_q, the remaining right_q is the part that wasn't used. Then, the same for the other steps.\n\nBut perhaps, in code, the following steps:\n\nCollect left_non_q, right_non_q, left_q, right_q.\n\nThen:\n\n# Pair left_non_q with right_q:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))):\n\n   add (left_non_q[i], right_q[i])\n\n   count +=1\n\n# Now, the right_q has len(right_q) - min(...) elements left.\n\n# Then, pair right_non_q with left_q:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(right_non_q), len(left_q))):\n\n   add (right_non_q[i], left_q[i])\n\n   count +=1\n\n# Now, pair remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_q), len(right_q))):\n\n   add (left_q[i], right_q[i])\n\n   count +=1\n\nBut wait, in this approach, after pairing left_non_q with right_q, the left_non_q is not modified, but the right_q is modified? Or no, because we are using the original lists. Oh, no. Because in this approach, the code is just taking the first min(...) elements of left_non_q and right_q. But the original lists are not modified. So, for example, after pairing, the code would have to track which elements are already used.\n\nAh, here's a problem. Because in the code above, after pairing left_non_q and right_q, the code would have to remove those elements from the lists, otherwise, they might be reused in the next steps.\n\nBut how to track which elements are used?\n\nThis seems complicated. Because the left_non_q and right_q are lists of indices, and once an index is paired, it cannot be used again.\n\nSo, the approach of using slices would work if we process the lists in such a way that once paired, they are not considered again.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps, the code should create temporary lists for these steps. For example:\n\nAfter step 1, we have:\n\nleft_non_q = list of left non-? unpaired.\n\nright_non_q = list of right non-? unpaired.\n\nleft_q = list of left ? unpaired.\n\nright_q = list of right ? unpaired.\n\nNow, we can process:\n\nPair left_non_q with right_q:\n\nnumber = min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(number):\n\n   pair left_non_q[i], right_q[i]\n\nThen, the remaining elements in left_non_q are left_non_q[number:] (but we don't need to process them anymore, since they are not paired here). However, the right_q has elements from index number onwards.\n\nBut then, for the next step, we need to pair right_non_q with left_q.\n\nBut the left_q is the original list of left ?s. So, the same approach applies.\n\nBut then, after pairing right_non_q with left_q, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired.\n\nBut how to track the remaining elements?\n\nWait, perhaps the code can process the left_non_q and right_q as follows:\n\ntemp_left_non_q = left_non_q.copy()\n\ntemp_right_q = right_q.copy()\n\npaired_count = 0\n\nfor i in range(min(len(temp_left_non_q), len(temp_right_q))):\n\n   pair temp_left_non_q[i], temp_right_q[i]\n\n   paired_count +=1\n\nBut this doesn't actually remove them from the original lists. So this approach is wrong.\n\nAh, right. Because the original lists (left_non_q, right_q, etc.) are not modified, and thus, the same elements could be used again in other steps. Which would be incorrect.\n\nSo, this suggests that the approach of creating temporary lists and then processing them is not sufficient. Therefore, perhaps the better way is to process the lists by consuming elements from them.\n\nSo, for example, after collecting left_non_q, right_non_q, left_q, right_q, we can process them as follows:\n\nWe can have pointers for each list, and process them step by step.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative idea: for each of the steps, we can process the lists and remove the elements once paired.\n\nBut in Python, list.pop(0) is O(n), which is not efficient for large n. However, given that n is up to 150,000, and for each step, we process O(n) elements, this may be acceptable.\n\nBut for large n, popping from the front is O(n) time, which could be O(n^2) overall. Which would be too slow.\n\nSo, perhaps a better approach is to use queues or deques, which allow O(1) pops from the front.\n\nSo, for example, for left_non_q, we can convert it into a deque, and then pop from the left as needed.\n\nSo, here's a revised plan:\n\nAfter step 1, collect left_non_q, right_non_q, left_q, right_q as lists.\n\nConvert them into deques:\n\nfrom collections import deque\n\nleft_non_q_deque = deque(left_non_q)\n\nright_non_q_deque = deque(right_non_q)\n\nleft_q_deque = deque(left_q)\n\nright_q_deque = deque(right_q)\n\nThen, process:\n\n# Pair left_non_q with right_q:\n\nwhile left_non_q_deque and right_q_deque:\n\n   pair left_non_q_deque.popleft(), right_q_deque.popleft()\n\n   count +=1\n\n# Pair right_non_q with left_q:\n\nwhile right_non_q_deque and left_q_deque:\n\n   pair right_non_q_deque.popleft(), left_q_deque.popleft()\n\n   count +=1\n\n# Pair remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nwhile left_q_deque and right_q_deque:\n\n   pair left_q_deque.popleft(), right_q_deque.popleft()\n\n   count +=1\n\nThis approach would work, because each deque is processed in order, and once elements are popped, they are no longer considered.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nBut how to collect the left_non_q, right_non_q, left_q, right_q lists?\n\nLet me think again.\n\nAfter step 1, which pairs same-color non-? boots, the left_dict and right_dict have:\n\nFor each color c (non-?), the remaining left and right boots (those not paired in step 1).\n\nSo, to collect left_non_q (the unpaired left non-? boots), we can iterate through all colors in left_dict except '?', and collect all their elements.\n\nSimilarly for right_non_q.\n\nleft_non_q = []\nfor c in left_dict:\n    if c != '?':\n        left_non_q.extend(left_dict[c])\n\nSimilarly for right_non_q.\n\nleft_q = left_dict['?']\nright_q = right_dict['?']\n\nBut in Python, when you do left_dict['?'], it's a list of indices. So, the code would collect all those.\n\nOnce we have these lists, we can convert them into deques and process as above.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_dict and right_dict as defaultdict(list).\n\nFor each index i in 0..n-1:\n\n   left_char = l[i]\n\n   if left_char != '?':\n\n       left_dict[left_char].append(i+1)  # 1-based index\n\n   else:\n\n       left_dict['?'].append(i+1)\n\n   same for right_char = r[i]\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   if c is present in left_dict and right_dict:\n\n       num_pairs = min(len(left_dict[c]), len(right_dict[c]))\n\n       for i in range(num_pairs):\n\n           pair left_dict[c][i], right_dict[c][i]\n\n       # Truncate the lists to remove the paired elements.\n\n       left_dict[c] = left_dict[c][num_pairs:]\n\n       right_dict[c] = right_dict[c][num_pairs:]\n\nOnce this is done, collect the left_non_q, right_non_q, left_q, right_q as before.\n\nThen, process the deques as explained.\n\nNow, the code needs to collect all the pairs generated in each step.\n\nSo, the code will have a list called 'pairs' that accumulates all the pairs.\n\nSo, during step 1, when pairing same-color non-? boots, we add the pairs to the list.\n\nThen, during the deque steps, add the pairs to the list.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\nl = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nr = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nleft_dict = defaultdict(list)\nright_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    lc = l[i]\n    if lc != '?':\n        left_dict[lc].append(i+1)\n    else:\n        left_dict['?'].append(i+1)\n    rc = r[i]\n    if rc != '?':\n        right_dict[rc].append(i+1)\n    else:\n        right_dict['?'].append(i+1)\n\npairs = []\n\n# Step 1: Pair same color non-? boots\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    if c in left_dict and c in right_dict:\n        # Get the number of pairs possible\n        num_pairs = min(len(left_dict[c]), len(right_dict[c]))\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n            pairs.append( (left_dict[c][i], right_dict[c][i]) )\n        # Truncate the lists\n        left_dict[c] = left_dict[c][num_pairs:]\n        right_dict[c] = right_dict[c][num_pairs:]\n\n# Collect left_non_q, right_non_q, left_q, right_q\nleft_non_q = []\nfor c in left_dict:\n    if c != '?':\n        left_non_q.extend(left_dict[c])\nright_non_q = []\nfor c in right_dict:\n    if c != '?':\n        right_non_q.extend(right_dict[c])\nleft_q = left_dict['?']\nright_q = right_dict['?']\n\n# Convert to deques\nleft_non_q_deque = deque(left_non_q)\nright_non_q_deque = deque(right_non_q)\nleft_q_deque = deque(left_q)\nright_q_deque = deque(right_q)\n\n# Step 2: Pair left_non_q with right_q\nwhile left_non_q_deque and right_q_deque:\n    a = left_non_q_deque.popleft()\n    b = right_q_deque.popleft()\n    pairs.append( (a, b) )\n\n# Step 3: Pair right_non_q with left_q\nwhile right_non_q_deque and left_q_deque:\n    a = right_non_q_deque.popleft()\n    b = left_q_deque.popleft()\n    pairs.append( (a, b) )\n\n# Step 4: Pair remaining left_q and right_q\nwhile left_q_deque and right_q_deque:\n    a = left_q_deque.popleft()\n    b = right_q_deque.popleft()\n    pairs.append( (a, b) )\n\nprint(len(pairs))\nfor a, b in pairs:\n    print(a, b)\n\nWait, but in the code above, for step 1, when we process each color in 'a' to 'z', we check if the color is in left_dict and right_dict. However, in Python, checking if a key is in a defaultdict is possible. However, for example, if a color is not present in left_dict, then left_dict[c] would be an empty list. So, perhaps the code should check if the length of left_dict[c] and right_dict[c] is non-zero.\n\nBut in the code, the for loop is over 'a' to 'z', and for each c, if c is in left_dict and right_dict. Wait, no. The code checks if c is in left_dict and right_dict. However, defaultdict will return an empty list if the key is not present. Wait, no. The 'in' operator for defaultdict checks if the key exists in the dictionary. For example, if a key was never added, even if the default factory creates a list, the 'in' check would return False. Wait, no. Because defaultdict's __contains__ method checks whether the key is present in the dictionary. So, if a key was never added, even if it's accessed, it's not in the keys.\n\nWait, for example, if you have a defaultdict(list), and you check if 'a' is in the defaultdict, it returns False unless you have added 'a' to the defaultdict. Because defaultdict automatically creates a default value (empty list) when you access it, but the 'in' operator checks for presence in the dictionary's keys.\n\nSo, the code for step 1 is correct. For each color c in a-z, if the color is present in both left_dict and right_dict (i.e., the keys exist), then we process them. Otherwise, we skip.\n\nBut what about colors that are present in one dict but not the other? For example, if left_dict has color 'a', but right_dict does not. Then, the code skips processing 'a', which is correct, because there are no right boots with color 'a' to pair with.\n\nBut what about colors that are in both dicts, but with zero length? For example, if left_dict[c] is empty. But since we check if c is in left_dict and right_dict, and if so, process them. But in that case, the min(len(...)) would be zero, so nothing is added to pairs, and the lists are truncated to empty. So it's safe.\n\nSo, the code for step 1 is okay.\n\nNow, testing this code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nWait, but the user provided multiple examples. Let me check the first sample input.\n\nWait, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nOutput",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot.
