Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color, which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The question marks are wildcards that can match any color. I need to find the maximum number of pairs where a left boot and a right boot are compatible. Each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nThe output is the maximum number of such pairs and the list of pairs with their indices.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, think about how to pair them optimally. Let's think of possible strategies.\n\nI remember that when dealing with matching problems with wildcards, sometimes it's best to first handle the specific matches, then use wildcards for the remaining.\n\nBut here, since both left and right can have wildcards, maybe we need to consider different cases.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. Pair left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots that have the same color (non-? or ?). But how to maximize this?\n\nWait, but each left and right can be used once. So perhaps the way to do this is:\n\n- For each color c (a-z), count the number of left boots with color c (excluding ?) and the number of right boots with color c (excluding ?). The minimum of these two would be the number of pairs we can make directly for that color. Then, after that, the remaining left and right boots with ? can be paired with each other, or with remaining non-? boots if possible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. Because the ? can be used as wildcards. So perhaps we should first pair all possible specific matches, then pair the remaining with ?.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: Let's process all the possible exact matches first. For example, for each color c, take the left boots with c and right boots with c, and pair them. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those that couldn't be paired because their color didn't match, or they were ?), we can pair them using the ?.\n\nBut how to handle the ?s optimally?\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\nFirst, create a mapping of counts for each color (excluding ?) on both left and right. For each color c, the number of pairs we can make between left[c] and right[c] is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). So we can pair those first.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (those not paired yet), which include ?s and possibly some non-? that couldn't be matched. Now, the remaining left and right can be paired with each other, since ? can match anything.\n\nBut how to track which boots are already used?\n\nBut the problem is that the actual positions (indices) matter for the output. So perhaps the approach is to first pair up all exact matches, then pair the remaining with ?s.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of data structures. For example, for each color c, collect the list of indices of left boots with color c (excluding ?), and similarly for the right boots. Then, for each color, pair as many as possible. Then, collect the remaining left and right boots (which are either ? or couldn't be matched) and pair them.\n\nBut how to handle the ?s?\n\nWait, for example, after pairing all the exact matches, the remaining left boots may have ?s and some non-? that couldn't be matched. Similarly for the right. Then, the remaining left and right boots can be paired as follows: each left can be paired with any right, since ? can match anything.\n\nSo the total number of such pairs would be the number of remaining left boots (after exact matches) and the number of remaining right boots. But since they can be paired in any way, the maximum is min(remaining_left, remaining_right).\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each color c (a-z), collect all left boots with color c (non-?), and same for right boots.\n\n2. For each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, for color 'a', if there are 3 left and 5 right, pair 3 of them. Then, subtract these from the counts.\n\n3. After this, collect all the left boots that are not yet paired (could be ? or non-? that couldn't be matched), and same for right.\n\n4. Then, pair as many as possible between these remaining left and right boots. Since ? can match anything, each left can be paired with any right.\n\nBut how to track which boots are already used?\n\nSo, the main challenge is to track which boots have been used in the first step (exact matches) and which are available for the second step (wildcard pairs).\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the implementation.\n\nFirst, for each color c (a-z), we can have two lists:\n\nleft_colors: a dictionary where key is the color, value is a list of indices of left boots with that color.\n\nSimilarly for right_colors.\n\nThen, for each color c, we can take the min of len(left_colors[c]) and len(right_colors[c]), and pair them. For example, if left has 3 'a's and right has 5 'a's, we can pair 3 of them. Then, we need to record which left and right indices are used in these pairs.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left boots are those in left_colors for all colors, minus the ones used in the exact matches, plus the left boots that are '?'. Similarly for the right.\n\nBut how to collect the remaining left and right boots?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can process each color and pair as much as possible, and track which left and right indices are used.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the following approach:\n\nWe can have two arrays, used_left and used_right, of size n, indicating whether the boot is already used.\n\nInitially, all are False.\n\nFor each color c in a-z:\n\n   left_list = list of indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i]\n\n   right_list = list of indices where r[i] == c and not used_right[i]\n\n   num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in 0 to num_pairs -1:\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n       mark used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n\nThen, after this, collect all left boots that are not used and have color '?', and all right boots not used and have color '?'. Then, pair them in any way.\n\nBut wait, maybe there are some non-? left boots that are not used, but their color could be matched with some non-? right boots. However, since in the first step, we processed all possible exact matches, those would have already been handled. Wait, no. Because for example, suppose there's a left boot with color 'a' and a right boot with color 'a', but during the first step, we didn't pair them because we processed the color 'a' and found that there were more left than right, but maybe there are some left and right that were not processed. Wait, no. Because for each color, we process all possible pairs. So for example, for color 'a', we take all left 'a's and all right 'a's, and pair them as much as possible. So after that, any left 'a's that are not paired would be because there are no more right 'a's left. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo after that, the remaining left boots (non-?) can only have colors that don't have a matching right boot (or vice versa). So, they can't be paired with any other non-? boots. Thus, the only way to pair them is with ? boots.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the remaining left and right boots (which may include ?s) with each other.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nAfter the first step, collect all left boots not used and all right boots not used. Then, pair as many as possible between them. Since ? can match anything, any left can be paired with any right.\n\nBut how to do that? Let's collect two lists:\n\nremaining_left = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nremaining_right = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\nThen, the number of possible pairs is min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right)).\n\nBut how to pair them? For example, pair the first k elements of remaining_left with the first k elements of remaining_right. Since the order doesn't matter, as long as each is used once.\n\nSo, the total pairs would be the sum of the exact matches and the min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right)).\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this logic.\n\nBut how to handle the first step efficiently?\n\nBecause for each color, we need to collect all the left and right boots that are not yet used. However, if n is up to 150000, and for each color, we do O(n) operations, that could be O(26n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to collect the left and right lists for each color?\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nFor each color c in a-z:\n\n   collect all left indices with color c into a list, and same for right.\n\nThen, for each color, process the pairs between left and right.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used?\n\nWait, perhaps we can use pointers for each color. For example, for each color c, we have left_c list and right_c list. Then, for each color, we pair the first min(len(left_c), len(right_c)) elements. But since we can't modify the original lists, perhaps we can track how many have been used.\n\nWait, but that's not straightforward. Because once you pair some elements, they can't be used again. So perhaps, for each color, we can have a queue or a list, and for each color, pair as many as possible, then mark them as used.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nCreate two arrays, left_available and right_available. Initially, all are True. Then, for each color c in a-z:\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and left_available[i] is True.\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and right_available[i] is True.\n\n   take the min of the two lists' lengths, say m.\n\n   pair the first m elements of left and right lists.\n\n   mark those left and right as unavailable.\n\nBut how to collect those lists for each color?\n\nThis seems feasible. For example, for each color c, we can loop through the entire left string, check if the character is c and not used. But for n=1.5e5, and 26 letters, that would be O(26n) operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for each color, looping through the entire array each time would be O(n) per color, leading to O(26n) steps, which is manageable.\n\nSo, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this?\n\nIn Python, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n   right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n   for j in range(min(len(left_list), len(right_list))):\n\n       add pair (left_list[j], right_list[j])\n\n       mark used_left[left_list[j]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_list[j]] = True\n\nBut for large n, building these lists for each color might be expensive. However, since for each color, the total number of elements across all colors is O(n), this approach would be O(n) per color, but 26 times, which is O(26n) = acceptable for n=1.5e5.\n\nBut in Python, for n=1.5e5, 26*1.5e5 is 3.9e6, which is manageable.\n\nOnce that's done, collect the remaining left and right boots (those not marked as used) and pair them as much as possible.\n\nBut how to collect them? Again, for the remaining left boots, we can collect all indices where used_left[i] is False. Similarly for right. Then, pair them in any way.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nremaining_left = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nremaining_right = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\nThen, the number of pairs is min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right)).\n\nThen, pair the first k elements of remaining_left with the first k elements of remaining_right.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nOnce that's done, the total pairs is the sum of the pairs from the first step and the second step.\n\nNow, the problem is to collect the pairs in the correct order, and output them.\n\nNow, the next thing is to handle the case where the same index is used in multiple steps. But since we mark them as used, they will not be considered again.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given.\n\nTake the first example input:\n\nInput:\n10\ncodeforces\ndodivthree\n\nSample Output:\n5\n7 8\n4 9\n2 2\n9 10\n3 1\n\nBut perhaps I need to think of the steps.\n\nBut let's not get stuck on examples now.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as arrays of False.\n\nCollect pairs:\n\npairs = list()\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   left_list = list of indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i]\n\n   right_list = list of indices where r[i] == c and not used_right[i]\n\n   m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for j in 0..m-1:\n\n       pairs.append( (left_list[j]+1, right_list[j]+1) )\n\n       mark used_left[left_list[j]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_list[j]] = True\n\nThen, collect remaining_left and remaining_right.\n\nremaining_left = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\nremaining_right = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\nk = min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right))\n\nfor j in 0..k-1:\n\n   pairs.append( (remaining_left[j]+1, remaining_right[j]+1) )\n\nThen, output len(pairs), followed by the pairs.\n\nBut wait, this may not be the optimal approach. Because there might be cases where pairing some ?s with non-?s first would allow more total pairs. But according to the problem statement, the ? can be matched with any, so perhaps the approach is correct.\n\nWait, but suppose that after the first step, there are some left ?s and some right non-?s. For example, left has a ? and right has a 'a'. Then, pairing them would be allowed. But if we pair the ?s with each other, then the 'a' would not be matched. So the approach of pairing the remaining left and right in any way (including ?s and non-?) is correct, because the second step allows that.\n\nYes. Because in the second step, we have all remaining left and right boots. So, for example, a left ? can be paired with a right 'a', and that's allowed. So the code's approach of pairing the remaining left and right in any way is correct.\n\nThus, this approach should work.\n\nNow, let's think about possible optimizations.\n\nIn the first step, for each color c, we can collect the left and right indices. However, for each color, we can iterate through the entire string each time. But for n=1.5e5, and 26 colors, this is O(26n) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, list comprehensions are efficient, but for n=1.5e5, this may be acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps, for efficiency, it's better to pre-process for each color, the list of indices. For example:\n\nprecompute for left:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_dict = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if l[i] != '?':\n\n        left_dict[l[i]].append(i)\n\nSimilarly for right_dict.\n\nBut then, during the first step, for each color c, we can take the left_dict[c] and right_dict[c], but we have to track which elements are used. However, this approach may not work, because once some elements are used, they need to be removed from the lists. But since we can't modify the lists, perhaps we can use pointers.\n\nAlternatively, during the first step, for each color c, we can process the left and right lists, and for each pair, mark them as used. But how?\n\nAnother approach is to have for each color, a list of available left indices and a list of available right indices. For example, for color c, left_available[c] is a deque or a list, and we can pop elements from the front as we pair them.\n\nBut perhaps the initial approach is manageable.\n\nBut in code, for each color in 'a' to 'z', we can generate the left_list and right_list as follows:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n    right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n    # pair them\n\nBut for each color, this is O(n) time.\n\nBut in practice, for each color, the number of elements in left_list and right_list is small, but for the worst case, it's O(n) per color.\n\nBut perhaps in Python, even for n=1.5e5, this is manageable.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the order in which the colors are processed may affect the total number of pairs. For example, if you process 'a' first, then 'b', etc. But since we are pairing all possible exact matches, regardless of the order, the total number of pairs would be the same. Because for each color, we are pairing as much as possible. The order of processing colors does not affect the total number of pairs in the first step.\n\nSo, the code can process colors in any order.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given in the problem statement.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=10\n\nl = 'codeforces'\n\nr = 'dodivthree'\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor each color, process exact matches.\n\nFor example, let's look for 'c' in left and right.\n\nLeft: l is 'c o d e f o r c e s'\n\nIndices 0-based:\n\nindex 0: 'c'\n\nindex 7: 'c'\n\nRight: r is 'd o d i v t h r e e'\n\nLooking for 'c's in right. There are none. So for color 'c', left has 2 entries, right has 0. So nothing is paired.\n\nFor 'o' in left: left has indices 1,5.\n\nIn right, looking for 'o's: right is 'd o d i v t h r e e' â†’ index 1 is 'o'.\n\nSo for color 'o', left has 2, right has 1. So pair 1 left and 1 right. So one pair.\n\nSimilarly for other colors.\n\nBut the exact details may vary, but the code would handle this.\n\nOnce the exact matches are done, the remaining left and right boots are collected and paired as much as possible.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where both left and right have '?'?\n\nFor example, n=1, l='?', r='?'. Then, the code would process each color from a-z, but none would match. Then, the remaining left and right are both 1 element. They are paired, resulting in 1 pair.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l='a', r='?'. Then, during the first step, for color 'a', left has 1, right has 0 (since r is '?'). So no pair. Then, remaining left is 1, remaining right is 1. They are paired. So the pair is (1,1). Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l='?', r='a'. Same result.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l='a?', r='?a'. Then, during first step, for color 'a', left has index 0 (a), right has index 1 (a). So pair (0+1, 1+1) â†’ (1,2). Then, remaining left is index 1 (which is '?') and remaining right is index 0 (which is '?'), so pair them. Total pairs 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nBut the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says:\n\nWait, the original problem's example shows that the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input given is:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nBut that seems like four separate test cases. But the problem says that the input is read from stdin. So the user probably needs to read multiple test cases? Or perhaps that was a mistake in the example?\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\nThe input is:\n\nThe first line contains n, then the second line is l, third is r.\n\nBut the sample input shows four entries, which may be four different test cases. However, the problem's original input description says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n, then second line l, third line r.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are given. However, the original problem statement says that the input is for a single test case.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains n...\n\nSo, the code must read one test case per run. However, the sample input seems to have multiple test cases. But that may be a formatting error. For example, the user may have pasted multiple test cases into the example, but the actual problem expects to read a single test case.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nWhich suggests that there are four test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the problem is from a contest where multiple test cases are present, but the user's code must read them all.\n\nBut the original problem says that the code must read input from stdin. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, and the code must process them all.\n\nBut this is conflicting with the problem's input description. However, looking back, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nBut the problem's input format says that the first line is n, then l, then r. So for each test case, three lines. But the sample input shows four test cases. So perhaps the code must read multiple test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to determine the number of test cases? Well, the code can read all lines, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut in practice, the code may need to read until there's no more input.\n\nBut the original problem's sample input seems to be a list of four test cases, each with their own input and output. However, the original problem's input description says that for each test case, the input is three lines: n, l, r.\n\nThus, the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? For example, reading all lines from stdin, then processing them in groups of three.\n\nBut in practice, for programming competition problems, sometimes multiple test cases are given, and the code must process them all.\n\nBut the original problem's input description is ambiguous. However, looking back at the problem's sample input and output, which includes multiple test cases, the code must read multiple test cases. So the code must process each test case, and for each, output the answer.\n\nBut in the problem's original input description, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains n... etc. So perhaps the sample input was formatted incorrectly, and the actual problem has only one test case. However, the user's note says that this is a very easy question, and the code should be written to handle the input correctly.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows multiple test cases, perhaps the code must process multiple test cases, each with their own n, l, r.\n\nBut how to read them?\n\nIn Python, the standard way to read multiple test cases is to read all lines at once, and process them.\n\nBut perhaps the code should read until EOF. For example, read all lines, split into groups of three, and process each group as a test case.\n\nBut how?\n\nBut the problem's sample input may have been presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code should read one test case per run. However, the sample output shows that each test case's output is printed.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the problem is intended to have a single test case. However, the sample shows multiple test cases, which may suggest that the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, looking at the sample input given in the problem:\n\nThe sample input is:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nEach of these is a test case. For example, the first one is:\n\nn=10, l is 'codeforces', r is 'dodivthree'.\n\nThe second is n=7, l is 'abaca?b', r is 'zabbbcc'.\n\nThird is n=9, l is 'bambarbia', r is 'hellocode'.\n\nFourth is n=10, l is 'code??????', r is '??????test'.\n\nBut the sample output shows four outputs.\n\nSo the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them in Python?\n\nWell, the code can read all input lines, and process them in groups of three. For example:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nThen, for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n\n   n = int(lines[i])\n\n   l = lines[i+1]\n\n   r = lines[i+2]\n\n   process and output.\n\nBut this is assuming that the input consists of multiple test cases, each with three lines.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the input is for one test case. However, the sample input shows four test cases. This is confusing.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output have multiple test cases, the code must handle multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read all test cases, process each, and output the results.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is from a programming competition where the input is multiple test cases. For example, the problem may have been from Codeforces, where multiple test cases are given.\n\nBut how to handle that in the code.\n\nBut the user's note says that this is a very easy question, so perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is not properly formatted, and the code should process one test case.\n\nBut given the confusion, perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that the code must read one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but perhaps the code is supposed to read one.\n\nBut given that the sample output has four outputs, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. So, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python.\n\nIn any case, the code must read from stdin, and output the correct answers.\n\nAssuming that the code must process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines: n, l, r.\n\nSo, the code will read all lines, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the user's code should read one test case. However, given the sample input and output, perhaps the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut since the problem's original input description says that the first line is n, then the second line is l, third line is r, perhaps the code should read one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows four test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input.\n\nBut regardless, the code must handle the input as per the problem's description.\n\nBut given that the problem's sample input and output have multiple test cases, and the code must handle them, I'll proceed with writing code that reads multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's actual input is only one test case, and the sample input is shown as a list of test cases for illustration.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, given the sample output, I'll proceed to write code that processes multiple test cases.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is from a source where each test case is given in the input, and the code must process all of them.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving this problem, let's assume that the code must process one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases, so perhaps the code must process multiple.\n\nBut perhaps the user's example is incorrect, and the actual problem is for one test case. For example, the sample input may have been presented as a list of test cases for the purpose of showing multiple outputs, but the code should read one test case.\n\nIn the problem's original description, the input is given as three lines: n, l, r. So the code must read one test case.\n\nBut then, the sample input shows four test cases. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake.\n\nBut given the uncertainty, I'll proceed with writing code that reads one test case. Because otherwise, for the code to read multiple test cases, the user would have to provide input accordingly.\n\nBut given that the problem's sample output has four outputs, perhaps the code must handle multiple test cases. However, without more information, it's hard to tell.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is from a programming competition where the input is multiple test cases, and the code must read all of them.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as a list of test cases, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut to handle that, in Python, I can read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of three, and process each group as a test case.\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[idx])\n\n        l = lines[idx+1]\n\n        r = lines[idx+2]\n\n        idx +=3\n\n        # process and output\n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\nn=10\n\nl = 'codeforces'\n\nr = 'dodivthree'\n\nThen, the next test case starts at idx=3, which is '7', etc.\n\nBut in the sample input, the lines are:\n\nLine 0: '10'\n\nLine 1: 'codeforces'\n\nLine 2: 'dodivthree'\n\nLine 3: '7'\n\nLine 4: 'abaca?b'\n\nLine 5: 'zabbbcc'\n\netc.\n\nSo, the code would process each group of three lines as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the number of lines is not a multiple of three? Well, the problem says that the input is correct.\n\nSo, assuming that the code is correct, the code would process each group of three lines as a test case.\n\nNow, proceeding with writing the code.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nProcess each group of three lines as a test case.\n\nFor each test case:\n\n   Read n, l, r.\n\n   Initialize used_left and used_right as [False]*n.\n\n   pairs = list()\n\n   for c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n       collect left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n       collect right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n       m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n       for j in range(m):\n\n           pairs.append( (left_list[j]+1, right_list[j]+1) )\n\n           used_left[left_list[j]] = True\n\n           used_right[right_list[j]] = True\n\n   collect remaining_left = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i]]\n\n   collect remaining_right = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i]]\n\n   k = min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right))\n\n   for j in range(k):\n\n       pairs.append( (remaining_left[j]+1, remaining_right[j]+1) )\n\n   print(len(pairs))\n\n   for a, b in pairs:\n\n       print(a, b)\n\nBut this code would work for the sample input?\n\nLet's take the first sample input:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=10, l=codeforces, r=dodivthree.\n\nLet's process the exact matches.\n\nFor each color in a-z:\n\nFor example, 'c':\n\nl has 'c' at positions 0 and 7.\n\nr has 'd', 'o', 'd', 'i', 'v', 't', 'h', 'r', 'e', 'e' â†’ no 'c's. So left_list has two elements, right_list is empty. No pairs.\n\nFor 'o':\n\nl has 'o' at positions 1 and 5.\n\nr has 'o' at position 1 (assuming r is 'dodivthree' â†’ let's check:\n\nr is 'd o d i v t h r e e' â†’ indexes 0-9:\n\n0: d\n\n1: o\n\n2: d\n\n3: i\n\n4: v\n\n5: t\n\n6: h\n\n7: r\n\n8: e\n\n9: e\n\nSo for 'o', right_list has [1]. So left_list has [1,5], right_list has [1]. So m=1. Pair (1+1, 1+1) â†’ (2,2). Mark used_left[1] and used_right[1] as True.\n\nThen, for other colors.\n\nAfter processing all colors, collect remaining_left and remaining_right.\n\nThen, pair them.\n\nBut this is getting complicated to trace manually. However, the code seems logically correct.\n\nNow, considering the time constraints for n=1.5e5.\n\nThe code for each test case:\n\nFor each of the 26 letters, it loops through n elements twice. So O(26 * 2n) = O(52n) per test case. For n=1.5e5, that's 7.8e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nThe remaining_left and remaining_right steps are O(n) each.\n\nThus, the code should be efficient enough.\n\nNow, what about the case where there are multiple pairs possible in the first step, but the code pairs them in a certain order that may not be optimal? For example, if pairing a certain way could allow more pairs in the second step. However, since the first step pairs all possible exact matches, the second step pairs the remaining with wildcards, which is optimal.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut for Python, with n up to 1.5e5, and multiple test cases, the code should be efficient.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut for the code:\n\nRead lines as per the test cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(input):\n\n        n_line = input[idx].strip()\n\n        if not n_line:\n\n            idx +=1\n\n            continue\n\n        n = int(n_line)\n\n        l = input[idx+1].strip()\n\n        r = input[idx+2].strip()\n\n        idx +=3\n\n        used_left = [False]*n\n\n        used_right = [False]*n\n\n        pairs = []\n\n        # Process exact matches\n\n        for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n            left_list = []\n\n            for i in range(n):\n\n                if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]:\n\n                    left_list.append(i)\n\n            right_list = []\n\n            for i in range(n):\n\n                if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]:\n\n                    right_list.append(i)\n\n            m = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n            for j in range(m):\n\n                a = left_list[j] + 1\n\n                b = right_list[j] + 1\n\n                pairs.append( (a, b) )\n\n                used_left[left_list[j]] = True\n\n                used_right[right_list[j]] = True\n\n        # Process remaining with wildcards\n\n        remaining_left = []\n\n        remaining_right = []\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            if not used",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots (left and right) based on their colors. Each boot can either have a specific color or be an indefinite color denoted by '?'. The goal is to pair these boots such that each pair has compatible colors.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Exact Color Matching**: First, we pair boots with exact matching colors. For each color from 'a' to 'z', we collect all left and right boots that have this color and pair them up.\n2. **Wildcard Matching**: After handling exact matches, we handle remaining boots using wildcards ('?').
