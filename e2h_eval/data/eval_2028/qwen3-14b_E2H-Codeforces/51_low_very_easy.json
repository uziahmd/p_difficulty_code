Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input: guest's name, host's name, and a pile of letters. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach is to take the first two strings, concatenate them, then check if the count of each character in the concatenated string matches exactly with the count in the third string.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to use the Counter class from collections. For example, we can create a Counter for the combined guest and host names, and another Counter for the pile. Then compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, because Counter counts the frequency of each character. So if the counts are the same, the letters can be rearranged to form the other string.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three lines of input.\n2. Combine the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Create a frequency count of all characters in this combined string.\n4. Create a frequency count of the third line (the pile).\n5. Compare the two counts. If they are the same, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the combined length of the first two is different from the third? For example, if the guest and host names have a total length of 5, but the pile has length 6. Then obviously it's impossible. So checking the lengths first might be a quick way to return NO.\n\nYes. So first check if len(guest) + len(host) equals len(pile). If not, immediately return NO. Otherwise, proceed to check the counts.\n\nBut even if the lengths are the same, the counts could differ. Like if guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\" — that's okay. But if guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" — that's okay. But if pile is \"AA\", then counts would differ.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck if the sum of lengths of guest and host equals the length of pile. If not, return NO.\n\nElse, check if the combined counts of guest and host equals the counts of the pile.\n\nSo in Python code:\n\nRead the three lines: guest, host, pile.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile): print NO.\n\nelse: check if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile). If yes, print YES else NO.\n\nBut how to handle the Counter?\n\nYes, that's straightforward.\n\nBut what about the case where the guest and host have combined letters that have the same count as the pile, but the pile has some letters not present in the combined?\n\nWait, the Counter will take care of that. Because if the pile has a letter not present in combined, then the Counter for pile will have that letter's count, but the combined's Counter won't. So the comparison will return False.\n\nSo that's covered.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput lines are 'SANTACLAUS', 'DEDMOROZ', 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's see the length.\n\nLet me count:\n\nSANTACLAUS is 10 letters (S A N T A C L A U S) — wait, let me count:\n\nS (1), A (2), N (3), T (4), A (5), C (6), L (7), A (8), U (9), S (10). Yes, 10 letters.\n\nDEDMOROZ: D E D M O R O Z — that's 8 letters. So combined length is 18.\n\nThe pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let's count the letters. Let me see:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S — let me count the letters. Let's see, perhaps it's easier to check the length. The sample says that the output is YES. So the length must be 18. Let me check:\n\nThe pile string is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' — let's count the letters. Let's see:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → that's 18 letters. So the length matches.\n\nThen the Counter for combined and pile should be same.\n\nSo the code would return YES.\n\nIn the second example:\n\nInput lines are 'PAPAINOEL', 'JOULUP",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door could have been formed by combining the letters from the guest's name and the host's name. This involves checking if the pile contains exactly the same letters (with the same frequency) as the combined names of the guest and host.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Length Check**: First, check if the combined length of the guest's and host's names matches the length of the pile. If they do not match, it is immediately impossible for the pile to be formed from the names, so we return \"NO\".\n3. **Character Frequency Check**: Use a frequency counter to compare the characters in the combined names of the guest and host with the characters in the pile. If both frequency counters match, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the three lines from input\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    \n    # Check if lengths are equal\n    if len(combined) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    # Compare the character counts\n    if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` to handle the three lines efficiently.\n- **Combined Length Check**: By concatenating the guest and host names, we first check if their total length matches the length of the pile. This is a quick check to rule out impossible cases early.\n- **Counter Comparison**: Using `collections.Counter`, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined names and the pile. If these counters match exactly, the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names, resulting in \"YES\"; otherwise, it results in \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check both the length and the character frequency, providing an optimal solution to the problem.",
