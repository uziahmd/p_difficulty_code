    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The problem is about a frog jumping on a number line. The frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But the catch is that it can't jump outside the interval [0, x] when calculating f(x). Then, for each i from 0 to m, we need to compute f(i) and sum them all. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what f(x) represents. For a given x, f(x) is the number of distinct positions the frog can reach, starting from 0, without ever stepping outside [0, x]. So the frog can make any number of jumps as long as it doesn't go beyond 0 or x. \n\nThe challenge here is to find an efficient way to calculate f(x) for all x up to m, given that m can be as large as 1e9. A brute force approach for each x is impossible here because m is too big. So we need some mathematical insight.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Since the frog can jump forward by a or backward by b, the positions must satisfy certain conditions. Let's consider the problem without the x constraint first. The frog can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and b, but since the frog can only add a or subtract b, perhaps the positions are those that can be expressed as k*a - l*b where k and l are non-negative integers. However, this might not be sufficient. But since the frog can jump multiple times, maybe the reachable positions are those that are congruent modulo gcd(a, b). Wait, the general theory says that any integer that is a linear combination of a and b (with integer coefficients) is a multiple of their gcd. But here, the coefficients are non-negative? Hmm, no. Because the frog can do a combination of adding a and subtracting b. So the positions are in the form of (some multiple of a) minus (some multiple of b). But the actual reachable positions would depend on the steps taken.\n\nBut since the frog can jump multiple times, perhaps the positions reachable are those that are congruent to 0 modulo d, where d = gcd(a, b). Because the steps are multiples of a and -b. So the total displacement is a*k - b*l. Since a and b are multiples of d, then the displacement is a multiple of d. Therefore, the reachable positions must be multiples of d. However, this is under the assumption that the frog can move freely. But with the constraints of not going below 0 or above x, it's more complex.\n\nWait, but maybe the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is within [0, x], provided that there's a way to reach it. But how?\n\nLet me think about the case when the frog can reach any multiple of d up to x. But that's probably not true. For example, if a=5 and b=3, then d=1. So the frog can reach any integer. But in the first example, when x=5, the answer is 3. Let's see: the frog starts at 0. It can jump +5 to reach 5. Then, from there, can it jump -3? That would take it to 2. From 2, can it jump +5 again to reach 7, but x is 5, so that's not allowed. Or maybe from 2, jump -3 to -1 which is invalid. So the positions reachable under x=5 are 0,5,2. So f(5)=3. Which matches the example. But according to the earlier idea, since d=1, all positions should be reachable. But that's not the case here. So there's something wrong with my initial thought.\n\nAh right! Because the frog can't go beyond x. So even though the frog can reach positions that are multiples of d, but they have to be reachable through a sequence of jumps that never step outside [0, x]. So the problem becomes more complicated. \n\nSo the key is to find, for each x, all positions that are reachable via some path that stays within [0, x]. How to model this?\n\nAnother angle: Let's think about the frog's movement. The frog can move forward by a, but can also move backward by b. But the frog can't go below 0 or above x. So for a given x, the frog's movement is constrained. However, if the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k+a (if <=x) and k-b (if >=0). \n\nThis sounds like a BFS problem. For each x, we can perform BFS starting from 0 and count the reachable positions. But since m can be up to 1e9, doing this for each x is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nBut considering that for different x values, the reachable positions change. However, perhaps for some ranges of x, the function f(x) has a certain pattern. Let's think about how f(x) changes as x increases.\n\nSuppose that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (d = gcd(a, b)) and is between 0 and x. However, that's only possible if the frog can reach that position without exceeding x. For example, in the first case, d=1, but the frog can't reach 1. So that idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the frog can reach all positions that are congruent to 0 mod d and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with certain coefficients. But again, the constraints on the path complicate this.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as follows: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d (since each jump adds a or subtracts b, which are multiples of d), and that is reachable via some steps that do not go out of bounds. However, the question is whether such a position can be reached. \n\nBut how to determine which positions are reachable given the constraints?\n\nAnother thought: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and is greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to x, and for which there exists a way to reach it through some steps. However, the problem is figuring out for each x, how many such positions exist.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the maximum distance the frog can reach. Suppose that the frog can reach up to some maximum position. Once x is larger than that maximum, then f(x) would be the same as the total number of reachable positions. But how to find that maximum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d, and are in [0, x], provided that x is sufficiently large. For example, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. But how to find the threshold where this happens?\n\nThis seems similar to the coin problem. For two coins of denominations a and b, the largest amount that cannot be formed is (a*b -a -b) if they are coprime. But this is for non-negative combinations. However, in our case, the frog can add a and subtract b, but the path must stay within [0, x]. So perhaps the problem is more complex.\n\nLet me think about the case when a and b are coprime. Let's say d=1. Then the frog can reach any integer that can be expressed as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the path of jumps does not go out of [0, x]. However, even if a number is expressible as such, the path may require going beyond x. \n\nBut perhaps for sufficiently large x, the frog can reach all multiples of d (which is 1) up to x. For example, once x is large enough, the frog can reach every position. But how to find that?\n\nLet me take the example from the first sample input: a=5, b=3. So d=1. Now, for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5, 2. For x=7, the frog can reach 0,5,2,7 (from 5+5?), but wait 5+5=10, which is larger than 7. So that's not allowed. So from 2, the frog can jump +5 to 7. That's allowed. So for x=7, the positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, and also other positions. Wait, from 5, the frog can jump -3 to 2. From 2, can it jump +5 to 7. From 7, can it jump -3 to 4. Then from 4, can it jump +5 to 9 (but that's beyond x=7). Or jump -3 to 1. So 1 is allowed. So then, 1 is reachable? How?\n\nWait, how can the frog reach 1? Let's think. Starting from 0, jump +5 to 5. Then from 5, jump -3 to 2. Then from 2, jump -3 to -1 (invalid). So that's not allowed. Alternatively, from 2, jump +5 to 7. Then from 7, jump -3 to 4. Then from 4, jump -3 to 1. So yes. So 1 is reachable. So in the first example, f(7) is 8. The positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6 (from 1+5?), and 3 (from 6-3). Wait, but how?\n\nLet me list all positions for x=7. Let me think:\n\nStarting at 0.\n\nFrom 0, can jump to 5 (since 0+5=5 ≤7). Also can't jump -3 since that would be -3 <0.\n\nSo positions: 0,5.\n\nFrom 5, can jump to 5+5=10>7 (invalid), or 5-3=2. So 2 is added.\n\nNow positions: 0,5,2.\n\nFrom 2, can jump to 2+5=7 (allowed), or 2-3=-1 (invalid). So add 7.\n\nPositions: 0,5,2,7.\n\nFrom 7, can jump to 7+5=12>7 (invalid), or 7-3=4. Add 4.\n\nFrom 4, can jump to 4+5=9>7 (invalid) or 4-3=1. Add 1.\n\nFrom 1, can jump to 1+5=6 (allowed), or 1-3=-2 invalid. Add 6.\n\nFrom 6, can jump to 6+5=11>7 (invalid), or 6-3=3. Add 3.\n\nFrom 3, can jump to 3+5=8>7 (invalid) or 3-3=0. 0 is already present.\n\nSo all positions are 0, 5, 2, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. That's 8 positions. Hence f(7)=8 as per the example.\n\nSo even though d=1, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to 7 except maybe some. Wait, but in this case, all positions from 0 to 7 are reachable? No, for example, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7. All 8 positions. So for x=7, the frog can reach all positions. So for x ≥7, the frog can reach all positions up to x?\n\nBut why? Because once you can reach positions up to x, you can reach all positions. But how?\n\nIn this case, once the frog can reach x, then for any position k in [0,x], can the frog reach it? Well, in this example, when x is 7, the frog can reach all positions. So for x >=7, maybe the frog can reach all positions. But how?\n\nThis suggests that for sufficiently large x, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (in this case, 1) up to x. So for x >= some value, f(x) = x+1 (since all positions are reachable). But how to find that value?\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding for each x, the number of positions reachable, which depends on whether x is large enough to allow all multiples of d up to x. If that is the case, then for x >= some threshold, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1 (since all multiples of d up to x are reachable, but since d=1, it's x+1).\n\nBut how to find that threshold? And what about when d is not 1?\n\nLet me think again. Let's suppose that d = gcd(a, b). Then, any reachable position must be a multiple of d. Let me denote a' = a/d and b' = b/d. Then, since a and b are multiples of d, and gcd(a', b') = 1. \n\nSo the problem reduces to the case where a and b are coprime, and the positions must be multiples of d. So, for the original problem, the positions are multiples of d, and the problem becomes equivalent to solving the same problem with a' and b', and then multiplying the count by d.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think. If the original problem has a and b, then the reachable positions are multiples of d. So, the number of reachable positions up to x is the same as the number of positions reachable in the transformed problem (with a'=a/d, b'=b/d) multiplied by d, but scaled. So perhaps we can model the problem for a'=a/d and b'=b/d, which are coprime, and then find the reachable positions in terms of multiples of d.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the transformed problem. Let's assume that a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any integer that is a linear combination of a and -b. But again, the path must not go out of [0, x].\n\nBut when a and b are coprime, the classic problem says that the largest number that cannot be expressed as a positive combination (i.e., ma + nb, m,n ≥0) is ab - a -b. However, in our case, the frog can subtract b, which is different. So perhaps this is not directly applicable.\n\nBut in our case, the frog can move forward by a, or backward by b. So the positions are those that can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers, and during the process, the frog never goes below 0 or above x. \n\nBut how to find the minimal x where all positions up to x can be reached?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps once x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions that are multiples of d (which is 1 in this case) up to x. For example, once x is ≥ a + b, then the frog can reach all positions. But how to verify this?\n\nIn the first example, a=5 and b=3. The minimal x where all positions are reachable is 7. Which is a + b - 1 = 5+3-1=7. So perhaps for x ≥ a + b -1, the frog can reach all positions up to x.\n\nBut how to generalize this? For coprime a and b, the maximum number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients is ab -a -b. However, this is for the case of positive combinations. Our case is different.\n\nBut perhaps once x is larger than or equal to a + b, the frog can reach all positions. Or perhaps once x is larger than or equal to some value, the frog can reach all positions. \n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose a=3, b=2. They are coprime. Let's see what positions can be reached. Starting from 0.\n\nAt x=0, only 0.\n\nAt x=3: can reach 0,3. From 3, can jump back by 2 to 1. So positions 0,3,1. From 1, can jump forward by 3 to 4 (if x is ≥4). So if x is 3, then 1 can't jump forward. So for x=3, positions are 0,3,1. So f(3)=3. But 2 is not reachable yet.\n\nAt x=4, the frog can reach 0,3,1,4 (from 1+3=4). Then from 4, jump back by 2 to 2. So positions 0,3,1,4,2. So f(4)=5. Now, all positions from 0 to 4 are covered. So for x≥4, the frog can reach all positions. But 4 is a + b -1 (3+2-1=4). \n\nSo this seems to fit. So for coprime a and b, once x ≥ a + b -1, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. Thus, for x ≥ a + b -1, f(x) = x + 1. \n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's see for x=5. From 0, reach 3, then 1, then 4, then 2, then 5 (from 2 + 3). So yes, all positions are reachable. So for x ≥ a + b -1, the frog can reach all positions. \n\nBut what about when a and b are not coprime? Let's take d = gcd(a,b). Then, the positions must be multiples of d. So the problem can be transformed into the same problem with a'=a/d, b'=b/d, which are coprime. Then, the minimal x for which all multiples of d up to x are reachable is x = d*(a' + b' -1) = d*(a/d + b/d -1) = a + b -d. \n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose a=6, b=4. Then d=2. a'=3, b'=2. So a' and b' are coprime. The minimal x for the transformed problem is a' + b' -1 = 3+2-1=4. Then, the original x would be d * (a' + b' -1) = 2*4=8. So for x ≥8, all multiples of d (2) up to x are reachable. For example, x=8: positions are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. But can the frog reach all of them?\n\nLet me check. Starting from 0. Can reach 6 (a=6), then 6-4=2. Then 2+6=8 (if x≥8). Then from 2, can jump -4 to -2 (invalid). From 6, can jump -4 to 2. From 8, can jump -4 to 4. From 4, can jump -4 to 0. So positions 0,6,2,8,4. Are there other positions? Like 6 + 6 = 12, but that's beyond x=8. So for x=8, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. So 5 positions. But according to the formula, for x=8, which is the threshold, all multiples of 2 up to x are reachable. Which is correct. \n\nBut what about x=9? The multiples of 2 up to 9 are 0,2,4,6,8. So same as before. So for x=9, the frog can reach the same positions. But when x increases beyond the threshold, the number of reachable positions increases by 1 every time x is a multiple of d. For example, when x=10, the multiples are 0,2,4,6,8,10. So f(10) would be 6. \n\nSo the general approach seems to be:\n\nFor a given x, the number of reachable positions is:\n\nIf x < threshold, then some value based on the reachable positions.\n\nOtherwise, the number of reachable positions is floor(x / d) + 1.\n\nWhere threshold is (a + b - d), where d = gcd(a, b).\n\nWait, but in the first example where a=5, b=3, d=1. The threshold is 5+3-1=7. Which matches the example where x=7 allows all positions up to 7. \n\nSo the key is to compute for each x:\n\nIf x is less than the threshold, then compute the number of reachable positions in a certain way. Otherwise, it's floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute the sum from i=0 to m of f(i)?\n\nThe problem is that for x < threshold, f(x) can vary, and we need to find the sum for those x. For x >= threshold, each x contributes floor(x/d) + 1. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b). If a or b is zero (but according to input constraints, a and b are positive integers).\n\n2. Check if the frog can make any moves. For example, if a=0 or b=0. But according to the input constraints, a and b are positive.\n\nBut wait, the frog can only make jumps of +a or -b. So if a is zero, but the input constraints say a and b are positive. So no need to worry about that.\n\nBut what if a and b are such that the frog can't move? For example, in the third sample input, a=100000 and b=1. Then, the frog can't make any jumps. Because to jump forward by a (100000) would take it to 100000, but if x is less than that, then it can't. So for example, if x is less than a, then the frog can't make any jumps. So f(x) is 1 (only 0). But if x is >=a, then the frog can jump to a, but then from there, can it jump back by b (1) to a-1. Then from there, jump back again to a-2, etc. So for x >=a, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to x. But wait, in that case, a=100000 and b=1, d=1. The threshold is a + b -d = 100000 +1 -1 = 100000. So for x >=100000, the frog can reach all positions. Which makes sense. For x=100000, the frog can reach 0, a, a-1, a-2, ..., 0. So all positions from 0 to a. Which is x=100000. So for x >= threshold, the count is x+1. \n\nBut in the third example, the input is m=100, a=100000, b=1. So for all x from 0 to 100, the frog can't make any jumps. Because a=100000 is larger than x (up to 100). So f(x) is 1 for all x. Hence the sum is 101, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this suggests that the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute for each x in 0..m, the value of f(x). Which can be split into two parts:\n\nFor x < threshold: compute f(x) as some value.\n\nFor x >= threshold: compute floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute the sum of f(x) for x < threshold?\n\nBut what is the threshold? Let me define threshold = a + b - d. Where d = gcd(a,b).\n\nWait, but in the example where a=5, b=3, d=1. Threshold is 5+3-1=7. Which is the x where for x >=7, all positions are reachable.\n\nSo for x < threshold, we need to compute f(x) for each x. But if m is up to 1e9, and threshold could be up to a + b (since d is at least 1), and a and b are up to 1e5, then threshold is up to 2e5. Which is manageable. Because for m up to 1e9, the number of x < threshold is up to 2e5, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute d = gcd(a, b).\n\nCompute threshold = a + b - d.\n\nIf m < threshold: compute f(x) for all x from 0 to m, sum them.\n\nElse: compute the sum for x from 0 to threshold-1, plus the sum for x from threshold to m.\n\nNow, how to compute the sum for x from 0 to threshold-1?\n\nFor that, we can simulate the reachable positions for each x up to threshold-1. However, since threshold is up to 2e5, and for each x, we can compute f(x) using BFS or dynamic programming. But for x up to 2e5, this is feasible.\n\nBut how to compute f(x) efficiently for all x up to threshold-1?\n\nLet me think: For each x, f(x) is the number of positions reachable in [0, x]. But since the frog can reach positions up to x, and the movement is constrained, perhaps we can precompute for all positions up to threshold, and for each x, track which positions are reachable up to x.\n\nBut this seems complex. Another approach is to precompute for each position up to threshold, the minimal x where it can be reached. Then, for each x, the count is the number of positions whose minimal x is <=x.\n\nAlternatively, for each x, we can compute f(x) using BFS, but since x is up to 2e5, and for each x, the BFS would be O(x), which could be O( (2e5)^2 ), which is 4e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nThat's not feasible. So we need a better approach.\n\nAlternative idea: For x up to threshold, the reachable positions are the same as the positions reachable in the entire range up to threshold. Because once you can reach a position, you can reach it for any x >= that position. So perhaps we can precompute all positions reachable up to threshold, and then for each x, f(x) is the number of positions that are <=x.\n\nBut how to find all positions reachable up to threshold?\n\nLet me think: The frog can reach certain positions, and for any x >= that position, it's counted. So if we can find all positions that are reachable by the frog (without considering x limits), then for x >= that position, it's counted. But how to find all such positions?\n\nBut since the frog can jump forward and backward, but the path must stay within [0, x], the reachable positions for x=threshold may include all positions that are reachable in the unconstrained case (i.e., without x limits) and are <= threshold.\n\nBut how to find all positions that are reachable in the unconstrained case?\n\nThis is equivalent to the set of positions that can be reached via some sequence of jumps, regardless of x. For example, in the first example, the unconstrained case allows reaching all positions. So for x >= threshold, all positions are reachable.\n\nBut for x < threshold, some positions may not be reachable.\n\nBut how to find the set of all positions reachable in the unconstrained case?\n\nThis is the same as the set of positions that are multiples of d, and can be written as k*a - l*b for non-negative integers k and l. But how to find this set?\n\nAlternatively, since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps the set of reachable positions is all multiples of d that are >=0 and can be written as (k*a - l*b), where k and l are non-negative integers. But how to find that?\n\nThis is equivalent to the set of all integers >=0 that are congruent to 0 mod d, and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients k and l (non-negative) such that the path of jumps doesn't go negative. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog being able to reach any position that is a multiple of d and is >=0, and for which there exists some way to reach it via the allowed jumps, possibly going beyond x. But how to find this set?\n\nBut perhaps the set of reachable positions is all multiples of d that are >=0 and >= (some value). For example, in the case where a=5 and b=3, d=1. All positions >=0 are reachable. So the unconstrained set is all non-negative integers.\n\nBut in the case where a=3 and b=2 (coprime), the unconstrained set is all non-negative integers. But for the case where a=6 and b=4 (d=2), then the unconstrained set is all multiples of 2 that are >=0. Because the frog can reach 0, 6, 2 (6-4), 8 (6+2), etc. So for any multiple of 2, the frog can reach it.\n\nBut how to find this? Well, since the frog can move forward by a and backward by b, and since a and b are multiples of d, and a' and b' are coprime, the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >= (something). \n\nBut how to find that \"something\"?\n\nLet me think of the problem for a'=a/d and b'=b/d, which are coprime. Then, the problem reduces to finding all positions that are multiples of d, and which can be expressed as k*a' - l*b', where k and l are non-negative integers. Multiply by d, we get the original positions.\n\nBut since a' and b' are coprime, the set of numbers that can be expressed as k*a' - l*b' for non-negative integers k and l is the same as all integers >= (a'*b' -a' -b') + ... ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as the frog can move forward by a' and backward by b'. Since a' and b' are coprime, then for sufficiently large numbers, all numbers can be expressed as k*a' - l*b', but there may be some exceptions.\n\nBut how to find the minimal number that can be expressed as such, and beyond which all numbers can be expressed?\n\nThis seems similar to the classic coin problem, but with subtraction allowed. However, I'm not aware of a standard formula for this case.\n\nAlternatively, since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps the set of reachable positions is all integers >=0 that are multiples of d. But in the example where a=5 and b=3, this is true. But in the example where a=3 and b=2, it's also true. However, for a=6 and b=4 (d=2), the reachable positions are multiples of 2. But for example, 2 is reachable (6-4), 4 is reachable (2+2?), but how?\n\nWait, for a=6 and b=4 (d=2). a'=3, b'=2. So in the transformed problem, the frog can move forward by 3 or backward by 2. Let's see:\n\nStarting at 0, can reach 3. From there, can jump back by 2 to 1 (but since we are in the transformed problem, the positions are multiples of d=2. So maybe I'm getting confused here. \n\nWait, the original positions are multiples of d. So in the transformed problem, the positions are integers (since a' and b' are coprime), and the original positions are multiplied by d. So for example, in the transformed problem, the frog can reach any integer that is reachable via the jumps of +a' and -b', and then multiplied by d. \n\nBut how to find the reachable positions in the transformed problem?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the only thing we need is to find for x < threshold, the number of positions reachable up to x. However, since threshold is small (up to 2e5), we can precompute for all x up to threshold, the value of f(x) using BFS.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think: For each x, the frog can reach certain positions. But for x up to threshold, the maximum x is 2e5. So we can precompute for all positions up to threshold, whether they are reachable. Then, for each x, f(x) is the number of positions that are <=x and are reachable.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Precompute all reachable positions up to threshold (threshold is up to 2e5).\n\n- For each x in 0 to m, if x < threshold: f(x) is the number of reachable positions up to x.\n\n- Else: f(x) is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to precompute the reachable positions up to threshold?\n\nWe can model this as a BFS problem. We can simulate the frog's movements for all positions up to threshold. However, since the frog can jump forward by a or backward by b, but must stay within [0, x], but since we're considering all x up to threshold, perhaps we can model it as follows:\n\nWe can consider the entire range up to threshold, and for each position, determine whether it's reachable. The frog can reach a position if there exists a path from 0 to it, such that during the path, no position exceeds threshold (since x can be up to threshold). \n\nWait, but if we are considering all x up to threshold, then for a position k, to be reachable, there must be a way to reach it without going beyond threshold. So during the BFS, we can ignore the x constraint and just ensure that the frog doesn't go beyond threshold. Because for any x >=k, the position k will be counted in f(x).\n\nSo the idea is to precompute all positions that are reachable by the frog, assuming that the frog can go up to threshold. Then, for any x, f(x) is the number of positions <=x that are in this set.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b).\n\n2. Compute threshold = a + b - d.\n\n3. Compute all positions that are reachable by the frog, considering that the frog can jump up to threshold (so during the jumps, it can't go beyond threshold, but can go up to threshold). \n\nOnce we have this set of positions, for any x, f(x) is the number of positions in the set that are <=x.\n\nSo how to compute this set?\n\nWe can use BFS. We start at 0. For each position in the queue, we can generate new positions by adding a or subtracting b, but ensuring that the new positions are between 0 and threshold. We also need to mark visited positions to avoid cycles.\n\nFor example, in the first sample, threshold is 7. So during BFS, the frog can reach positions up to 7, and the set includes all positions from 0 to 7.\n\nSo the BFS would proceed as follows:\n\nInitialize a visited array of size threshold+1.\n\nAdd 0 to the queue.\n\nWhile queue is not empty:\n\n   current = dequeue.\n\n   for next_pos in current +a and current -b:\n\n      if next_pos is between 0 and threshold, and not visited:\n\n         mark as visited\n\n         enqueue.\n\nOnce this BFS is done, the visited array contains all positions reachable up to threshold.\n\nOnce we have this visited array, for any x, the count is the number of visited positions up to x.\n\nSo for x < threshold, the count is the sum of visited[0...x].\n\nFor x >= threshold, the count is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n- Compute d and threshold.\n\n- If threshold is 0 (unlikely, since a and b are positive, but check).\n\n- Run BFS to find all positions up to threshold that are reachable.\n\n- Precompute a prefix sum array for the visited positions up to threshold.\n\nThen, for the sum from i=0 to m:\n\n   if m < threshold:\n\n      sum the prefix up to m.\n\n   else:\n\n      sum the prefix up to threshold-1, plus the sum for x >= threshold.\n\nFor x >= threshold, each x contributes floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nThe sum from x=threshold to m of (floor(x/d) + 1) can be computed as follows:\n\nLet total = sum_{x=threshold}^m (floor(x/d) + 1) = sum_{x=threshold}^m floor(x/d) + (m - threshold + 1).\n\nSo we need to compute sum_{x=threshold}^m floor(x/d).\n\nHow to compute this sum?\n\nWell, floor(x/d) is the same as (x - (x mod d)) /d.\n\nSo for x from L to R (L=threshold, R=m):\n\nsum_{x=L}^R floor(x/d) = sum_{k=0}^{K} k * (number of x in [L, R] where floor(x/d) =k).\n\nAlternatively, note that floor(x/d) increases by 1 every d steps.\n\nLet me think of it as follows:\n\nLet q = floor(L/d), r = L %d.\n\nThen, the first term is q.\n\nThe next terms increase by 1 every d steps.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to compute it using arithmetic series.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet m = upper bound.\n\nLet L = threshold.\n\nLet total = sum_{x=L}^m floor(x/d).\n\nLet me compute this sum as follows:\n\nLet q = floor(m/d), r = m %d.\n\nLet q_low = floor(L/d).\n\nThe sum can be broken down into",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints, and then compute the sum of these values for all integers from 0 to a given maximum value `m`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog starts at position 0 and can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`. The key observation is that the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`.\n\n2. **Threshold Calculation**: For sufficiently large values of `x`, the frog can reach all multiples of `d` (where `d` is the gcd of `a` and `b`) up to `x`. This threshold is calculated as `threshold = a + b - d`.\n\n3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: For values of `x` less than the threshold, we use BFS to determine all reachable positions up to the threshold. This helps us precompute the number of reachable positions for each `x` up to the threshold.\n\n4. **Sum Calculation**: We compute the sum of reachable positions for all values from 0 to `m`. For values below the threshold, we use the precomputed results from BFS. For values above or equal to the threshold, we use arithmetic series to efficiently compute the sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    threshold = a + b - d\n\n    # Precompute reachable positions up to threshold\n    max_pos = threshold\n    visited = [False] * (max_pos + 1)\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(0)\n    visited[0] = True\n\n    while q:\n        current = q.popleft()\n        next1 = current + a\n        if next1 <= max_pos and not visited[next1]:\n            visited[next1] = True\n            q.append(next1)\n        next2 = current - b\n        if next2 >= 0 and not visited[next2]:\n            visited[next2] = True\n            q.append(next2)\n\n    # Compute prefix sums for positions up to threshold\n    prefix = [0] * (max_pos + 1)\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(max_pos + 1):\n        if visited[i]:\n            count += 1\n        prefix[i] = count\n\n    # Now calculate the sum from 0 to m\n    total_sum = 0\n\n    if m < threshold:\n        total_sum = prefix[m]\n    else:\n        # Add the sum up to threshold-1\n        total_sum = prefix[threshold - 1]\n\n        # Now calculate sum from threshold to m of (floor(x/d) + 1)\n        # which is sum (floor(x/d)) + (m - threshold + 1)\n        L = threshold\n        R = m\n\n        def sum_floor_div(L, R, divisor):\n            if L > R:\n                return 0\n            q_L = L // divisor\n            rem_L = L % divisor\n            q_R = R // divisor\n            rem_R = R % divisor\n\n            total = 0\n            # Sum from q_L to q_R -1\n            if q_L < q_R:\n                # Number of full blocks\n                # Each block k contributes k * divisor numbers\n                # The first block is q_L, which has (divisor - rem_L) numbers\n                # The last block is q_R - 1, which has divisor numbers\n                # The sum from q_L to q_R -1 is sum_{k=q_L}^{q_R-1} k * divisor\n                # But how many terms?\n                total += (q_R - q_L - 1) * (q_L + q_R - 1) // 2 * divisor\n                # Add the first partial block\n                total += q_L * (divisor - rem_L)\n                # Add the last partial block\n                total += q_R * (rem_R + 1)\n            else:\n                # Only one block\n                total += q_L * (R - L + 1)\n            return total\n\n        sum_floor = sum_floor_div(L, R, d)\n        count_terms = R - L + 1\n        total_sum += sum_floor + count_terms\n\n    print(total_sum)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values for `m`, `a`, and `b` are read and parsed.\n2. **GCD Calculation**: The greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b` is computed to determine the reachable positions.\n3. **Threshold Calculation**: The threshold beyond which all positions are reachable is calculated.\n4. **BFS for Reachable Positions**: Using BFS, we determine all positions reachable up to the threshold.\n5. **Prefix Sum Array**: A prefix sum array is built to quickly query the number of reachable positions up to any given index.\n6. **Sum Calculation**: Depending on whether `m` is below or above the threshold, the sum of reachable positions is computed using the prefix sums and arithmetic series for larger values.",
