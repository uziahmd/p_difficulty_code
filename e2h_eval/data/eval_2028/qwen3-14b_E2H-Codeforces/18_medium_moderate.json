The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where a frog jumps on a number line, and calculate the sum of f(i) from i=0 to m. The function f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without stepping outside [0, x]. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the frog moves. The frog starts at 0. From position k, it can jump to k+a or k-b. But it can't go outside [0, x]. So for each x, I need to find all positions reachable by the frog under these constraints.\n\nBut given that m can be up to 1e9, we can't simulate for each x up to m. We need a mathematical approach here.\n\nLet me think about the possible positions the frog can reach. Since the frog can jump forward by a or backward by b, the problem might relate to the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Because, in general, if you can move in steps of a and -b, then the reachable positions are those congruent to 0 modulo gcd(a,b). But since the frog starts at 0, perhaps all positions reachable are multiples of d = gcd(a, b).\n\nWait, but the frog can't go beyond 0 or x. So maybe the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are between 0 and x, but also considering that the frog can reach them through some sequence of jumps.\n\nBut there's another aspect: the frog can't make jumps that take it out of the [0, x] interval. So even if a position is a multiple of d, it's only reachable if the frog can get there without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nHmm. Let's consider the case when the frog can reach any multiple of d up to x. For example, if a and b are coprime, then d=1, so all positions are reachable as long as they are in [0, x]. But that's not necessarily true because of the constraints on the jumps. For example, if a=5 and b=3, then the frog can reach 5, then from 5, it can jump to 5-3=2. Then from 2, can it jump to 2+5=7? But if x is 7, then yes. But if x is 6, then 7 is outside, so the frog can't do that. So maybe the reachable positions depend on the ability to reach them through a combination of forward and backward jumps without going out of bounds.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think of the problem in terms of the possible positions the frog can reach when there's no upper bound (x is infinity). In that case, the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d = gcd(a, b), right? Because the frog can move forward and backward, so the steps can be combined to reach any multiple of d. However, with the upper bound x, the frog can't go beyond x. So for a given x, the reachable positions would be the set of multiples of d that are between 0 and x, but also that can be reached via some sequence of jumps that never go beyond x.\n\nBut how do we determine which multiples of d are reachable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x], provided that x is large enough. But for small x, some positions may not be reachable. For example, in the first sample input, a=5, b=3. d = gcd(5,3)=1. So in theory, all positions are reachable. But for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5. Then from 5, it can jump back to 2. So 2 is reachable. Then from 2, can it jump forward to 7 (but if x is 5, that's not allowed). So for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. Hence f(5)=3. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nSo even though d=1, which allows all integers, the frog can't reach certain positions if x is too small. So the problem is more complex than just counting multiples of d up to x.\n\nSo how can we model this?\n\nAnother thought: the frog's movement can be considered as moving forward by a steps, or backward by b steps. But since the frog can't go below 0 or above x, the movement is constrained. However, once the frog can reach a position k, it can reach positions k + a, k - b, etc., provided they are within [0, x].\n\nBut how do we model the reachable positions? It seems like a BFS problem, but for large x (up to 1e9), doing BFS for each x is impossible.\n\nSo we need a way to compute for each x, the number of reachable positions, but without simulating for each x.\n\nLet me think about the conditions under which a position is reachable. Let's suppose that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is within [0, x], and also satisfies some other condition. What is that condition?\n\nLet me consider the case where the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is in [0, x], but only if x is sufficiently large. For example, when x is large enough such that the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x]. But for smaller x, perhaps some positions are not reachable.\n\nSo perhaps the key is to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Once that x is found, for larger x, the count is simply the number of multiples of d in [0, x], which is floor(x/d)+1.\n\nBut how to find that minimal x?\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the problem in terms of the following:\n\nThe frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is in [0, x], provided that the position can be written as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients such that the intermediate steps don't go out of bounds. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is >=0 and <=x, provided that x is large enough. But for small x, some positions may not be reachable. However, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x].\n\nWhat determines that \"large enough\" x? Let's think about the maximum distance that the frog can reach using only forward jumps. Since each forward jump adds a steps. So, the frog can reach positions 0, a, 2a, 3a, etc. But when the frog can also go back by b steps, perhaps it can reach positions that are not directly reachable by forward jumps alone.\n\nBut again, how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: The frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, and that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b. But since a and b are multiples of d, their linear combinations are also multiples of d. So the positions reachable are all multiples of d. But how to reach them?\n\nBut the problem is that even though a position is a multiple of d, the frog might not be able to reach it if the path requires jumping beyond x. For example, if x is 5, and the position is 2, which is a multiple of d=1. The frog can reach 2 by jumping forward to 5 (a=5) and then back by 3 (b=3). But if x is 5, that's allowed. So in that case, it's reachable.\n\nBut what if x is 2? Then the frog can't jump forward to 5, because that's outside of x. So how can it reach 2? Well, starting from 0, the frog can't make any forward jumps (since 0 + a = 5 > x=2). So the only possible position is 0. Hence f(2) is 1.\n\nSo the problem is that for small x, the frog can't reach some positions that are multiples of d because the necessary steps to reach them require jumping beyond x. However, once x is large enough, the frog can reach all multiples of d in [0, x].\n\nSo the question becomes: For each x, how many multiples of d are in [0, x] and can be reached by the frog given the constraints of not stepping outside [0, x]?\n\nBut how do we find that number?\n\nLet me think of the minimal x required for the frog to reach all multiples of d up to x. Let's call this x_min. Once x >= x_min, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1. For x < x_min, it's less.\n\nSo the problem splits into two parts:\n\n1. Find x_min, which is the minimal x such that for all positions k in [0, x], if k is a multiple of d, then it's reachable by the frog.\n\n2. For each x in 0..m, compute f(x) as:\n\n   if x < x_min: the number of reachable positions (which depends on x)\n\n   else: floor(x/d) + 1\n\nBut how to compute x_min?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x_min is the minimal value such that the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x_min. How to find that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: For a position k to be reachable, there must exist some sequence of jumps that gets to k, without stepping outside [0, x]. But since x is part of the problem, perhaps the key is that for k to be reachable, the frog can reach it by starting from 0, making forward jumps until it reaches some position >=k, and then making backward jumps. But this is vague.\n\nLet me consider the case where a and b are coprime (d=1). Then, the frog can reach any integer >=0, provided that x is sufficiently large. But how large?\n\nFor example, suppose a=5 and b=3. The frog can reach 0, 5, 2 (from 5-3). From 2, it can jump forward to 7 (if allowed), or backward to -1 (which is invalid). So for x >=7, the frog can reach 7, then from 7 subtract 3 to reach 4, etc. So for x >= 7, the frog can reach all numbers from 0 up to x, as long as they are multiples of 1 (all numbers). But how to find the minimal x where all numbers up to x are reachable?\n\nIn the sample input, for x=5, the frog can reach 0, 2, 5. Then, when x increases to 7, the frog can reach 7 (from 5 + 2?), wait no. Wait, from 5, the frog can jump to 5+5=10 (but if x is 7, that's not allowed). Or from 5, it can jump back to 5-3=2. Then, from 2, can it jump forward to 2+5=7, which is allowed. So yes. So for x=7, the frog can reach 7. Then from 7, subtract 3 to get 4, then subtract 3 again to get 1, then add 5 to get 6, etc. So once x is >=7, the frog can reach all numbers from 0 up to x. So for x >=7, the number of reachable positions is x+1 (since all numbers are reachable). But in the first sample, when x=7, f(7) is 8, which is 7+1. So that makes sense.\n\nSo for x >= x_min, the number of reachable positions is (x//d)+1. For x < x_min, it's less. The question is, what is x_min?\n\nIn this case, x_min is the minimal x such that the frog can reach all multiples of d (i.e., all numbers) up to x. For the case where d=1, x_min is the minimal x where the frog can reach all numbers up to x. For a=5 and b=3, x_min is 7. How to compute that?\n\nThis seems similar to the Frobenius problem, which asks for the largest monetary amount that cannot be obtained using any combination of coins of specified denominations. However, in our case, the denominations are a and b, but the frog can use both positive and negative steps. So the Frobenius number isn't directly applicable, but perhaps the concept of the minimal x where all numbers beyond it can be formed.\n\nBut the Frobenius problem is for non-negative combinations. Here, we have steps that can be both added and subtracted. So for the case of two coprime numbers a and b, the largest number that can't be formed is ab -a -b. But that's when you can only add coins. But in our case, the frog can subtract steps as well. So perhaps once x is larger than some value, all numbers can be formed.\n\nIn the example with a=5 and b=3, the Frobenius number is 5*3 -5 -3 = 7. Which is exactly the x_min we found earlier. Interesting! So for the case of two coprime a and b, x_min is ab -a -b. Once x is greater than or equal to that value, all numbers can be formed. But in our case, the frog can reach all numbers up to x once x >= x_min.\n\nSo perhaps for general d = gcd(a,b), the x_min is (a/d)*(b/d) - (a/d) - (b/d) ) * d ?\n\nWait, let's think. Let me denote a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Since d is the gcd of a and b, a' and b' are coprime. Then, the Frobenius number for a' and b' is a'*b' -a' -b'. So, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a' and b' with non-negative coefficients. However, in our case, the frog can use both positive and negative steps. So perhaps the minimal x_min is (a'*b' -a' -b') *d. Because once x is larger than that, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x.\n\nBut how does that fit with the example? For a=5, b=3, d=1, a'=5, b'=3. Frobenius number is 5*3 -5 -3=7. So x_min is 7. Which matches our previous example. So for x >=7, the frog can reach all numbers (since d=1).\n\nAnother example: if a=2 and b=2. Then d=2, a'=1, b'=1. Frobenius number is 1*1 -1 -1 = -1, which is negative. So x_min would be 0*d=0. So for any x >=0, the frog can reach all multiples of 2 up to x. Which makes sense, because the frog can jump forward by 2 (so reaches 2, 4, etc.) and backward by 2 (but can't go below 0). So for x=2, the frog can reach 0 and 2. For x=3, the frog can reach 0, 2. For x=4, 0, 2, 4. So in this case, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/2)+1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=5. Then d=1, Frobenius number is 3*5-3-5=7. So x_min is 7. For x=7, the frog can reach all numbers up to 7. So for x=7, the count is 8.\n\nSo this suggests that for general a and b, once x >= (a'*b' -a' -b') *d, then all multiples of d up to x are reachable. And for x < that value, the count depends on how many multiples of d are reachable.\n\nBut how to compute the number of reachable positions for x less than that threshold?\n\nLet me think. The problem reduces to:\n\nFor each x, f(x) is the number of multiples of d in [0, x] that are reachable. For x >= x_min, it's floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nFor x < x_min, we need to find how many multiples of d are reachable.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the reachable positions when x is less than x_min. For example, when x is less than the Frobenius number.\n\nBut how can we model that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x < x_min, the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are reachable by forward jumps (i.e., multiples of a) and can be reached by subtracting b steps. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's imagine that the frog can only make forward jumps (i.e., adding a) and backward jumps (subtracting b). So the frog can reach positions that can be written as a * k - b * l, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the path of jumps never goes outside [0, x].\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the set of reachable positions is all multiples of d that are >=0 and can be written as a * k - b * l, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position is <=x. But again, how to count that?\n\nBut since the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is reachable via some sequence of jumps, and given that the frog can go forward and backward, perhaps the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are >=0 and can be written as a * k - b * l, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position is <=x. But how to find this set?\n\nThis seems like the problem of finding all numbers in [0, x] that are multiples of d and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients. Wait, no. Because the frog can go back and forth. So the linear combination could involve positive and negative coefficients, but the path must not go out of bounds.\n\nThis seems too complex to model directly.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the frog can move forward and backward, once it can reach a position k, it can reach any position that is reachable via adding or subtracting multiples of a and b. But since the frog can't go outside [0, x], it's constrained. However, for x >= x_min, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. For x < x_min, it's not possible.\n\nSo the problem is to compute for each x, the number of multiples of d in [0, x] that can be reached via the frog's movements, considering the constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe for x < x_min, the reachable positions are exactly those multiples of d that are reachable by forward jumps (i.e., multiples of a) and can be adjusted by subtracting b steps as long as they stay within [0, x].\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: The frog can reach any multiple of d that is in [0, x], and which is >= some value. For example, the minimal multiple of d that can be reached is 0. Then, the next ones depend on the steps.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps we need to find the minimal x where the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Then, for x >= that value, the count is straightforward. For x < that value, we need to find how many multiples of d are reachable.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think again about the Frobenius number. The Frobenius number for a' and b' (coprime) is a'b' -a' -b'. So any number >= (a'b' -a' -b' +1) can be expressed as a linear combination of a' and b' with non-negative coefficients. But since the frog can use both forward and backward steps, perhaps the minimal x where all multiples of d up to x are reachable is (a'*b' -a' -b') *d. Because once x is larger than that, the frog can reach any multiple of d up to x by combining forward and backward steps.\n\nBut for x < that value, the number of reachable positions is the number of multiples of d that are reachable via the frog's movements, which is equivalent to the number of multiples of d that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients such that the path doesn't go out of [0, x].\n\nBut again, how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, for x < x_min, the reachable positions are the same as the positions that can be reached by forward jumps (i.e., multiples of a) and then subtracting b steps as long as possible. But this is unclear.\n\nLet me think of the first sample where a=5, b=3, d=1, x_min=7. For x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. For x=7, it's 0, 2, 5, 7, 4 (from 7-3), 1 (from 4-3), 6 (from 1+5?), etc. So for x=7, all numbers from 0 to 7 are reachable. Hence, the count is 8.\n\nSo for x >= x_min, the count is x+1. But for x < x_min, the count depends on the reachable positions.\n\nBut how to find for each x < x_min the count of reachable positions?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, given that a and b are up to 1e5, and m can be up to 1e9, perhaps we can precompute for all x up to x_min, the values of f(x), and then for x >=x_min, compute the contribution as (x//d + 1). Then, sum over all x from 0 to m.\n\nBut what is the size of x_min? For example, if a and b are up to 1e5, then a' and b' could be up to 1e5. Their product is up to 1e10, so x_min could be up to 1e10 * d. But d is up to 1e5, so x_min could be up to 1e15. Which is way too big to precompute for all x up to x_min.\n\nHence, this approach is not feasible for large a and b.\n\nAlternative idea: For x >= x_min, the count is floor(x/d) + 1. For x < x_min, the count is the number of reachable positions, which is the same as the number of multiples of d that are reachable by the frog. However, since the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >=0 and can be written as a linear combination of a and b with integer coefficients (positive and negative), but also ensuring that during the journey, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to find that for x < x_min?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for x < x_min, the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are reachable by forward jumps (i.e., multiples of a) and can be adjusted by subtracting b steps, but only if those steps are allowed. For example, the frog can reach positions that are multiples of a, and then subtract b steps as long as they are within 0 and x.\n\nBut this seems like a BFS problem for each x, but again, for large x_min, it's not feasible.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's note that the frog can reach any multiple of d that is >=0 and can be expressed as a * k - b * l, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the position is <=x. But since the frog can move freely (as long as it doesn't step outside [0, x]), perhaps the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are in [0, x] and >= (some lower bound). For example, once the frog can reach a certain position, it can generate others by adding or subtracting multiples of a and b. But this seems too vague.\n\nWait, but since the frog can move forward and backward, once it can reach a certain position, it can reach any position that is congruent modulo gcd(a, b) (which is d) and lies within [0, x]. But this is only true if x is large enough. Otherwise, the frog may not be able to reach all such positions.\n\nBut for x < x_min, the frog can't reach all such positions. So perhaps the problem reduces to the following:\n\nThe number of reachable positions for x is the number of multiples of d in [0, x] that are >= (some value), say, the minimal reachable multiple of d greater than or equal to zero.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of BFS. For a given x, the frog starts at 0. It can jump forward by a (if the new position is <=x) or backward by b (if the new position is >=0). So, the reachable positions are those that can be reached through these steps.\n\nBut since m can be up to 1e9, we can't perform BFS for each x. However, perhaps for x_min, which is O(ab), we can precompute for all x up to x_min the values of f(x), and then for x >=x_min, compute the sum accordingly.\n\nBut if x_min is up to 1e10 (for a and b up to 1e5), then precomputing up to x_min is not feasible for m up to 1e9.\n\nBut perhaps the actual x_min is not that large. For example, when a and b are coprime, x_min is ab -a -b. For a=1e5 and b=1e5, that would be 1e10 - 2e5, which is around 1e10. Which is way too large to process for each x up to that.\n\nSo this suggests that we need another approach.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think again about the problem. The frog can reach any multiple of d that is in [0, x], provided that x is large enough. For x less than that, the frog can't reach all of them. However, the sum over all x from 0 to m of f(x) can be split into two parts: the sum for x < x_min, and the sum for x >=x_min.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for x < x_min?\n\nBut again, if x_min is large, we can't compute that part.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the number of reachable positions for x is equal to the number of multiples of d in [0, x] that are >= (some value), like the minimal value that can be reached by the frog. For example, the frog can reach 0, and then possibly other positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any multiple of d that is in the range [0, x], and which can be written as a * k - b * l, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the path to reach it doesn't go outside [0, x]. However, since the frog can choose the order of jumps, perhaps this is equivalent to the set of multiples of d that are in [0, x] and can be written as a * k - b * l, where k and l are non-negative integers. But how to count that?\n\nBut even if that were the case, how to count the number of such multiples for x < x_min?\n\nThis seems challenging. Maybe there's another way.\n\nLet me think about the problem differently. For the frog to reach a position k (a multiple of d), there must be a way to reach it using forward and backward jumps without stepping outside [0, x]. This means that during the process of reaching k, the frog must never go below 0 or above x.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the frog's movement as being able to reach any position that is a multiple of d and is in [0, x], and for which there exists some integer t such that t = (k) / d, and t can be expressed as a linear combination of a/d and b/d with coefficients that allow the frog to reach it without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut I'm stuck.\n\nLet me try to think of the problem in terms of the following: since the frog can move forward and backward, the positions that are reachable are all multiples of d that are in [0, x], and which are >= (some minimum value), say, the minimal positive multiple of d that the frog can reach.\n\nBut what is this minimal value?\n\nFor example, in the first sample, the minimal positive multiple is 2 (since the frog can't reach 1, 3, 4, etc. until x is large enough).\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAnother Idea: The frog can reach any multiple of d that is >=0 and can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with integer coefficients (positive or negative). This is because the frog can move forward and backward. However, the constraint is that during the journey, the frog never steps outside [0, x]. So, for a given x, the reachable positions are those multiples of d that are in [0, x], and which can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with integer coefficients, and for which there exists a path from 0 to k that stays within [0, x].\n\nBut how to determine whether such a path exists?\n\nThis seems very abstract. Perhaps there's a way to model this as follows: the frog can reach any position k that is a multiple of d, and for which k can be expressed as a * k1 - b * k2, where k1 and k2 are non-negative integers, and the path to reach k is such that all intermediate steps are within [0, x].\n\nBut again, how to count this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and is in [0, x], and which is >= (some value). For example, the frog can reach 0, and then any position that is a multiple of d and is reachable by adding a's and subtracting b's. But this is still not helpful.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following: the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d and can be reached via forward jumps and backward jumps, regardless of x, as long as the path doesn't go out of [0, x]. But for x >= k, the frog can reach k if it's a multiple of d.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x where this is possible.\n\nThis brings us back to the earlier idea of x_min = (a'*b' - a' - b') * d. Once x >= x_min, all multiples of d up to x are reachable.\n\nBut how to prove this?\n\nWell, for x >= x_min, the frog can reach any multiple of d up to x. Because the Frobenius number is the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative combination of a' and b'. So any number >= x_min + 1 can be expressed as a non-negative combination of a' and b'. Thus, for x >= x_min, the frog can reach any multiple of d up to x by using forward jumps (adding a and b) to reach it. But since the frog can also use backward jumps, it's possible that even smaller x can allow reaching all multiples of d.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose a=5, b=3, d=1. x_min is 7. For x=7, the frog can reach 7 by jumping forward from 5 to 10 (but x=7, which is not allowed). Wait, no. Earlier analysis said that for x=7, the frog can reach 7 by jumping from 2 to 7 (since 2 +5 =7). How did the frog get to 2? From 5 -3 =2. And 5 is reachable by jumping forward from 0.\n\nSo, for x=7, the frog can reach 7. So, the position 7 is reachable.\n\nBut according to the Frobenius number, any number >=8 can be expressed as a non-negative combination of 5 and 3. For example, 8 = 5 + 3*1. So, for x=8, the frog can reach 8 by jumping forward 5 and then adding 3. But in this case, the frog can reach 8 by jumping forward from 0 to 5, then from 5 to 8 (adding 3). But since 5 +3 =8, and x is 8, it's allowed.\n\nSo for x >= x_min, the frog can reach any multiple of d up to x. Hence, the number of reachable positions is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nThus, the problem now is to compute for x < x_min, the number of reachable positions, and for x >= x_min, it's floor(x/d) +1.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute the sum of f(x) for x from 0 to m, where f(x) is:\n\nif x < x_min: number of multiples of d in [0,x] that are reachable by the frog under the constraints.\n\nelse: floor(x/d) +1.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for x < x_min?\n\nLet's denote that x_min = (a' * b' - a' - b') * d, where a' = a/d, b' = b/d.\n\nIf a and b are not coprime, then a' and b' are coprime.\n\nBut if a' and b' are coprime, then x_min = (a'*b' -a' -b') *d.\n\nHowever, if a' and b' are not coprime, then the Frobenius number is undefined, but since in this case d is already the gcd of a and b, a' and b' are coprime.\n\nSo, the formula for x_min is valid.\n\nNow, for x < x_min, how to compute f(x)?\n\nLet me think: the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are reachable by the frog. Since the frog can only make forward and backward jumps, and the path must not go outside [0, x], perhaps the reachable positions are all multiples of d that are in [0, x] and can be reached by some combination of forward and backward jumps, but this is still vague.\n\nBut perhaps for x < x_min, the number of reachable positions is equal to the number of multiples of d that are in [0, x] and are >= some value, like the minimal value that can be reached by the frog. For example, in the first sample, the minimal value is 0, then 2, then 5, and so on.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the set of positions reachable by the frog without any restrictions on x. That is, the set of all multiples of d that are reachable by the frog. But since the frog can move freely (without x constraints), this set would be all multiples of d. But with x constraints, it's only those multiples of d that are in [0, x], and that can be reached via a path that doesn't go outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to find this set?\n\nMaybe it's easier to think about the reachable positions as all multiples of d that are in [0, x] and are >=0, and can be written as a * k - b * l, where k and l are non-negative integers, and the path from 0 to this position is within [0, x]. But this seems hard to count.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's consider that for x >= 0, the frog can reach any multiple of d that is in [0, x], and which can be reached by some sequence of forward and backward jumps, but without going out of bounds. This is equivalent to saying that the frog can reach any multiple of d in [0, x] if and only if it can be reached by some sequence of forward and backward jumps that never go below 0 or above x.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem as a graph where each node is a position, and edges represent possible jumps. The frog starts at 0, and we want to find all nodes reachable from 0 without leaving [0, x]. For each x, this is a BFS problem, but for large x, it's not feasible.\n\nHowever, the key insight is that for x >= x_min, all multiples of d are reachable. For x < x_min, the number of reachable multiples of d is equal to the number of multiples of d that are reachable in the infinite number line, and are <=x. But how to compute that?\n\nWait, in the infinite number line, the frog can reach any multiple of d, because it can move forward and backward. So, for any multiple of d, there exists a sequence of jumps that reaches it. But with x being limited, the frog can only reach those multiples of d that are in [0, x] and for which there exists a path that doesn't go outside [0, x].\n\nBut how to find this for x < x_min?\n\nThis seems like a dead end. Perhaps there's another way.\n\nLet me think about the following: For the frog to reach a position k (multiple of d), it must be possible to reach it by some sequence of jumps, and during that sequence, the frog never steps outside [0, x]. So, the minimal requirement is that k can be reached by some sequence of forward and backward jumps, and that the path to k stays within [0, x]. \n\nBut how to ensure that?\n\nPerhaps the simplest way to reach k is to first jump forward as much as needed to reach a position >=k, and then jump backward. For example, to reach k, the frog can jump forward until it reaches some position >=k, then jump backward by b steps until it reaches k. But this requires that during this process, the frog doesn't go below 0 or above x.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose the frog wants to reach k. It can jump forward repeatedly until it reaches",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line from position 0, given constraints on its jumps, and sum these values for all positions from 0 to a given integer m. The frog can jump forward by `a` or backward by `b`, and it cannot step outside the interval [0, x] for any x.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachable Positions**: The frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. This is because any linear combination of `a` and `b` will be a multiple of their gcd.\n2. **Frobenius Number Insight**: For two coprime integers `a` and `b`, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a non-negative linear combination of `a` and `b` is given by `a*b - a - b`. This helps us determine the threshold beyond which all multiples of the gcd can be reached.\n3. **Threshold Calculation**: Calculate the threshold `x_min` using the Frobenius number concept adjusted for the gcd of `a` and `b`.\n4. **Sum Calculation**: Split the sum into two parts:\n   - For positions less than `x_min`, precompute the reachable positions using BFS.\n   - For positions greater than or equal to `x_min`, use the formula based on the number of multiples of the gcd.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    \n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a_prime = a // d\n    b_prime = b // d\n    \n    if a_prime == 0 or b_prime == 0:\n        # This case should not happen since a and b are positive\n        pass\n    \n    # Compute x_min\n    if math.gcd(a_prime, b_prime) != 1:\n        # This should not happen since a_prime and b_prime are co-prime\n        pass\n    frob = a_prime * b_prime - a_prime - b_prime\n    x_min = frob * d\n    \n    # Now, compute the sum from i=0 to m of f(i)\n    \n    # If x_min is larger than m, then all i in 0..m are less than x_min\n    if x_min > m:\n        # Need to compute f(x) for all x up to m\n        # But how?\n        # We need to find all multiples of d that are reachable for each x\n        # However, with m up to 1e9, we need an efficient way\n        \n        # Let's consider that for x < x_min, the reachable positions are those that can be reached by forward jumps (multiples of a) and then subtracting b steps as long as they are within [0, x]\n        # But this seems complex.

But for x=100, the frog can't make a forward jump (since 100000 > 100), and can't make any backward jumps from 0 (since 0-1=-1). So f(x) is 1 for all x < 100000.\n        \n        # So, in general, for x < a, the frog can't make any forward jumps. So the only reachable position is 0.\n        # Similarly, if x < b, the frog can't make any backward jumps.
