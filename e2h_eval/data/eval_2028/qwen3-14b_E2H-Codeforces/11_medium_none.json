After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast), np (grams of salt per toast).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Calculate total drink available: k * l ml.\n   Each toast requires nl ml per friend. For all friends, each toast requires n * nl ml. Wait, no. Wait, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends has nl ml. So if there are t toasts, total drink required is t * n * nl. But the total available is k*l. So the maximum t based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, that's only if we have enough of other resources.\n\n2. Calculate total lime slices available: c * d. Each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices are needed. So maximum t based on limes is (c*d) // n.\n\n3. Calculate salt: p grams. Each toast requires np grams per friend. So total per toast is n * np. So maximum t based on salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of those three values. Because all three resources are required. So the maximum possible t is the minimum of the three calculated values.\n\nWait, but in the example given:\n\nFirst input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nTotal drink: 4*5=20. For each toast, 3 friends * 3 ml per toast (nl=3) per friend? Wait, no. Wait, each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for one toast, each friend uses nl, so total for all friends is n * nl. So for t toasts, it's t * n * nl. So for the first example:\n\nDrink available is 20. For t toasts, total drink needed is 3 * 3 * t = 9t. Wait, no, wait: per toast, each friend needs nl. So per toast, total is n * nl. So for t toasts, it's t * n * nl. So the maximum t based on drink is (total_drink) // (n * nl). \n\nIn the first example, total_drink is 20. n is 3, nl is 3. So 3*3=9 per toast. 20 /9 is 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the example's note where they say 20/3=6 toasts. Wait, wait, what's that? Oh, the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nAh, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck the note. The note says that the drink is 4*5=20 ml. For each toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, 3 friends *3ml =9ml. So for t toasts, 9t. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Wait, that seems conflicting. Wait, what's the note's explanation?\n\nThe note says: \"the drink is enough to make 20/3=6 toasts.\" Wait, why is that? Because maybe the note is considering per friend. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for one toast, each friend has nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. But if you have t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts, so each needs t * nl ml. So total for all friends is n * t * nl. So the total drink required is n * t * nl. So the maximum t is (total_drink) // (n * nl). \n\nBut in the note, the example says that 20 / 3 = 6. Which would be (total_drink) / nl. But that would be if each toast per friend requires nl, but the total is per toast. Wait, perhaps the note is wrong? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait, why 20 / 3? Because each toast requires 3 ml per friend. So for each toast, all friends together need 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But the note says 6. That suggests that perhaps the note is considering per toast per friend. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the note is wrong? Or perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. So for t toasts, total is t * n * nl. \n\nBut the note says that 20 ml is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the total drink needed is 3 ml. Which would be if per toast, all friends together need 3 ml. Which would be the case if nl was 1 ml per friend. But in the first input, nl is 3. So that seems conflicting.\n\nWait the first input is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'. So the parameters are n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo according to the note, the drink is 4*5=20. Then, for each toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So per toast, 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So 20 /9 = 2.222, so 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. How?\n\nAh! Wait, maybe the note is considering that each toast requires nl per friend. So for each toast, each friend has one toast. So for one toast, each friend uses nl. So for one toast, total is n * nl. But the note says 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 20 divided by (nl) equals 6. Which would be 20 /3 = 6.666..., but rounded down to 6. But that would be the case if the total drink is divided by nl per toast. But that would be if each toast requires nl ml per friend, but for one toast, each friend makes one toast. So for one toast, each friend uses nl, so total is n * nl. So the total number of toasts possible is total_drink / (n * nl). \n\nBut according to the note, the calculation for drink is 20 /3 =6. So that's 20 divided by nl, not divided by (n * nl). Which suggests that perhaps the note is wrong. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for each toast, each friend has one toast. Therefore, for one toast, the total drink required is n * nl. So for t toasts, it's t * n * nl. So the maximum t is (total_drink) // (n * nl).\n\nBut in the note, the example says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be (total_drink) / nl. Which would be 20 /3 =6.666. So that's 6. But why is that?\n\nThis is a contradiction. So I need to figure out what the correct approach is.\n\nLooking back at the note's explanation:\n\nIn the first sample, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 =2. So the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. But according to the note's calculation, that's 20 /3=6. So how is that 6?\n\nAh! Maybe the note is calculating the total number of toasts that can be made per friend. Wait, the problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for each toast, each friend uses nl. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl. So total for all friends is n * t * nl. Which must be <= total_drink.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be t =6. Let's check:\n\nn=3, t=6. So total drink needed is 3 *6 *3 =54. But the total drink is 20. That's impossible. So that suggests that the note's explanation is wrong. But that's not possible. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for each toast, each friend uses nl. So for one toast, total is n * nl. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 20 /3 =6.666, which is 6. So 6 toasts. Let's compute the total drink needed for 6 toasts: 6 * n * nl =6 *3 *3 =54. Which is way more than 20. So that can't be right. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, the problem says that each friend makes the same number of toasts. So each friend makes t toasts. So for each friend, they need t * nl ml of drink. So for all friends, total drink is n * t * nl. Which is what I thought before.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 20 /3 =6.666, implying that t=6. But then the total drink would be 3 *6 *3 =54, which is larger than 20. So that's impossible. Therefore, the note must have a different calculation.\n\nWait the note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 =6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 *8=80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 /1 =100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 =2.\n\nWait, why is the drink sufficient for 6 toasts? Then, they divide by 3 friends to get 2 per friend. So that suggests that the 6 is the total number of toasts across all friends. So for example, if each friend makes 2 toasts, total toasts is 3*2=6. So the drink is sufficient for 6 total toasts. So how is that calculated?\n\nSo the total number of toasts across all friends is T. Each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for T toasts, total drink is T * nl * n? No. Wait, each toast per friend requires nl ml. So for each friend making t toasts, that's t * nl ml. So total for all friends is n * t * nl. So T is n * t. So the total drink is (n * t) * nl. So solving for t:\n\nt = (total_drink) / (n * nl). \n\nBut in the note, they have 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which is total_drink / nl = 20/3 =6.666, which would be 6. So that's T =6. Which would be the total number of toasts across all friends. Then, the number of toasts per friend is T /n. Which would be 6/3=2. Which matches the example's answer.\n\nAh! So the note's calculation is that the total number of toasts (across all friends) is min( total_drink / nl, ... ), and then divide by n to get per friend.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Let me think again.\n\nIf the total number of toasts across all friends is T, then each friend makes T/n toasts. But since T must be divisible by n, but the problem says that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So T must be a multiple of n. However, the problem wants to find the maximum t such that t is the number of toasts per friend. So T = n * t.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\ntotal_drink >= n * t * nl\n\ntotal_lime_slices >= n * t (since each toast requires one slice per friend, so for t toasts per friend, each friend has t toasts, so total slices is n * t)\n\ntotal_salt >= n * t * np.\n\nTherefore, t must be the minimum of:\n\n(total_drink) // (n * nl),\n\n(total_lime_slices) // (n),\n\n(total_salt) // (n * np).\n\nSo in the first example:\n\ntotal_drink = 20\n\nn * nl = 3 *3 =9. So 20//9 =2.\n\ntotal_lime_slices = 10 *8 =80. 80//3=26. So 26.\n\nsalt: 100/(3*1) =33.333, so 33.\n\nSo the minimum is 2, which matches the example's answer of 2.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which would be T =6. Then, T /n is 6/3=2. So that's the same as the calculation above. But how is T calculated?\n\nBecause T is the total number of toasts across all friends. So T = n * t.\n\nSo for the drink, the maximum T is (total_drink) // (nl). Because each toast (per friend) requires nl ml. So T * nl <= total_drink. So T is (total_drink) // nl. But then, T must also be <= (total_lime_slices) // 1 (since each toast requires one slice per friend, so T slices). And T must be <= (total_salt) // np.\n\nThen, once we find the maximum T, the per friend toasts is T//n.\n\nWait, but that's a different approach. Which one is correct?\n\nLet me think with the first example.\n\nIf T is the total number of toasts across all friends. Each toast requires:\n\n- nl ml per friend. So total drink is T * nl.\n\nBecause each toast (for any friend) requires nl ml. So for T toasts, total is T * nl.\n\nWait, that's a different approach. For example, if there are 3 friends and each makes 2 toasts, then total toasts is 6. Each toast requires 3 ml. So total drink is 6 *3 =18 ml, which is within 20.\n\nBut according to the previous approach, the drink would be n * t * nl =3 *2 *3= 18, which is same as T * nl (T=6). So yes, T is n*t. So T * nl = n * t * nl.\n\nSo the maximum T is the minimum between:\n\ntotal_drink // nl,\n\ntotal_lime_slices // 1 (because each toast requires 1 slice per friend, so T slices),\n\ntotal_salt // np.\n\nOnce we find T, then the per friend toasts is T // n.\n\nBut then, in the first example:\n\ntotal_drink // nl is 20//3 =6.\n\ntotal_lime_slices is 80, which is 10*8=80. So T can be up to 80.\n\nsalt is 100//1 =100.\n\nSo T is min(6, 80, 100) =6. Then per friend is 6//3=2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nBut why is that different from the previous approach?\n\nBecause earlier I thought that the drink constraint is T * nl <= total_drink, which is same as T <= total_drink // nl.\n\nBut in the previous approach, I thought that the drink constraint is T =n*t, so total drink is n*t * nl. Which is same as T * nl. So the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nSo the key is to compute T as the minimum of:\n\ntotal_drink // nl,\n\ntotal_lime_slices // 1,\n\ntotal_salt // np.\n\nThen, the answer is T // n.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nBecause T is the maximum total toasts across all friends. But since each friend must have the same number of toasts, T must be divisible by n. But in reality, T may not be divisible by n. For example, if T is 7 and n is 3, then each friend can have 2 toasts (total 6), and one toast left over. So the answer would be 7//3=2.\n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate T as the minimum of the three possible maximums (drink, lime, salt), and then the answer is T //n.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate:\n\ndrink_max = (k * l) // nl\n\nlime_max = (c * d) // 1 (since each toast requires 1 slice per friend, so total slices needed is T. So T can be up to c*d.)\n\nsalt_max = p // np\n\nThen T = min(drink_max, lime_max, salt_max)\n\nanswer = T // n\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\ndrink_max = 20//3 =6\n\nlime_max = 80//1 =80\n\nsalt_max = 100//1=100. So T=6. answer=6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: the second input in the sample is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10. So total drink is 100*10=1000.\n\nnl=4. So drink_max = 1000//4=250.\n\nlime: c=1, d=19. So slices is 1*19=19. lime_max=19//1=19.\n\nsalt: p=90, np=3. salt_max=90//3=30.\n\nT is min(250,19,30)=19. answer is 19//5=3. Which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input is '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'.\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000. total drink is 1e6.\n\nnl=50. drink_max = 1e6//50=20000.\n\nlime: c=25, d=23. total slices 25*23=575. lime_max=575//1=575.\n\nsalt: p=1, np=1. salt_max=1//1=1.\n\nT is min(20000, 575, 1) =1. answer is 1//10=0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute total_drink = k*l.\n\ndrink_max = total_drink // nl.\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c*d.\n\nlime_max = total_lime_slices.\n\nsalt_max = p // np.\n\nT = min(drink_max, lime_max, salt_max).\n\nanswer = T // n.\n\nYes. So that's the correct approach.\n\nSo now, the code can be written as follows.\n\nRead the input line as integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_max = total_drink // nl\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\n\nlime_max = total_lime\n\nsalt_max = p // np\n\nt_total = min(drink_max, lime_max, salt_max)\n\nresult = t_total // n\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but let me check the third sample:\n\nInput is 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1.\n\ntotal_drink = 1000 * 1000 = 1,000,000.\n\nnl is 50. drink_max = 1,000,000 //50 = 20,000.\n\ntotal_lime is 25 *23=575.\n\nsalt_max is 1//1=1.\n\nt_total is 1. divided by n=10 is 0. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: if T is 7, n=3. Then answer is 2.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as integers. For example, the first input line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'.\n\nSo the code would read the input line, split into parts, and process.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_max = total_drink // nl\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\n\nlime_max = total_lime\n\nsalt_max = p // np\n\nt_total = min(drink_max, lime_max, salt_max)\n\nresult = t_total // n\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes.\n\nBut need to handle cases where division is zero? Well, since all inputs are >=1, so for example, if drink_max is zero? Well, for example, if k*l is less than nl. But since the input variables are positive integers, but for example, if k*l is 0? No, because the input says that the numbers are positive integers. So no problem.\n\nBut for example, if k=1, l=1, nl=2. Then total_drink is 1, drink_max is 0. So t_total is 0, and result is 0//n=0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1']\n\nProcessing:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total_drink=20. nl=3 → drink_max=6.\n\nc=10, d=8 → total_lime=80. lime_max=80.\n\np=100, np=1 → salt_max=100.\n\nt_total = min(6, 80, 100) →6. result 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nSecond input: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink=1000. nl=4 → 1000//4=250.\n\nc=1, d=19 → total_lime=19. lime_max=19.\n\np=90, np=3 → 90//3=30. min(250,19,30) is 19. 19//5=3. Correct.\n\nThird input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\ntotal_drink=1000*1000=1,000,000. nl=50 → 1,000,000//50=20000.\n\nc=25, d=23 → 25*23=575. p=1, np=1 → 1//1=1. min(20000, 575, 1) is 1. 1//10=0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input line as list of integers.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of lines? Wait, the input is given as a single line. The sample input shows that the input is given as a list of lines, but in the problem statement, the input is the first and only line.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\nSo the input is a single line. But in the example, the input is given as a list of three lines. But that's probably for the purpose of the example. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nWhich is three test cases. But when the code is run, the input is read from stdin, which for each test case would be a single line.\n\nBut the user's code needs to read from stdin. So for the code submission, the code should read one line from stdin, process it, and print the answer.\n\nBut the sample shows that there are multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is the first and only line. So perhaps the sample input is given as multiple lines for the purpose of the example, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one line.\n\nWait, the problem's sample input shows that the input is given as three lines, but the output is three lines. So perhaps the actual code should read multiple lines of input, each being a separate test case. But the problem says that the input is the first and only line. Which is conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first and only line contains positive integers ... \n\nSo each test case is a single line. But the sample input shows three lines. Probably, the sample input is given as three test cases, each on their own line. But the code is supposed to process one line per test case. However, the code submission is supposed to read from standard input. So for example, in programming competition, sometimes the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is the first and only line. So perhaps the sample input is presented with multiple lines for the purpose of the example, but the actual code should read one line.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample input is three lines, sample output is three lines. So the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input, each line being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first and only line. So there is a contradiction here. But looking at the problem's note, the first sample input is given as a single line. So perhaps the sample input in the problem is written as a list of three lines, but each is a separate test case. However, the code should read all lines from the input, process each as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first and only line. So this is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's example, the input is given as a list of three lines, and output as three lines. So the code should read all lines from input, process each as a separate test case.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the input is the first and only line. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the actual code is supposed to read multiple lines of input, each being a separate test case. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', the second line is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', etc. So the code should read all lines from input, and for each line, output the answer.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is the first and only line. So this is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem statement has a mistake, and the code should read multiple lines.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is the first and only line. So perhaps the sample input is formatted incorrectly, and the actual code should process one line of input.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three lines. So for example, the user may have to read all lines from input, and for each line, process and output the answer.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first and only line. So perhaps the sample input is incorrect.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows three lines, and the output three lines, I think that the code must process multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut how to know? Well, looking at the problem's original description, perhaps the sample input is given with multiple lines for the purpose of the example, but the actual code is supposed to read one line of input.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first and only line. So perhaps the sample input is written with multiple lines for clarity, but each line represents a separate test case. But the code must process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is the first and only line. Which is conflicting.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think that the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input, each being a separate test case. So for example, in the sample input, there are three lines, each representing a separate test case, and the code should output three lines of answers.\n\nBut the problem's original statement says that the input is the first and only line. So this is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nOutput\n\n['2', '3', '0']\n\nWhich implies that there are three test cases. So the code must read multiple lines of input. However, the problem says that the input is the first and only line. This is a contradiction.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement's sample input is formatted incorrectly, and the actual input is one line. However, for the purposes of solving the problem, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single line of input, and output a single line.\n\nBut the sample shows that there are multiple lines. So perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are given, and the code should process each line.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first and only line. This is very confusing.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output have multiple lines, perhaps the code should read all lines from input, and for each line, process and output the answer.\n\nSo the code will read all lines from stdin, for each line, process as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? For example, in programming competitions, sometimes the code reads from stdin until EOF.\n\nSo the code could be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    # process line\n\nBut in the problem's sample, the input is given as three lines. So the code should read each line, process and output the answer.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first and only line. This is conflicting.\n\nHowever, looking back at the problem's original description, the sample input is given as a list of three lines, and the output as a list of three lines. So the code is expected to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's description says that the input is the first and only line. Which is a contradiction. However, perhaps the problem's sample is incorrect, and the actual code should process a single line of input.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows multiple lines, I think that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is the first and only line. So perhaps the sample is wrong.\n\nBut given that the user has provided the sample input and output, and the code must match that, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first and only line. So I'm confused.\n\nBut the user's instruction says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases.\"\n\nSo the code must read from stdin and write to stdout. So for example, if the input is multiple lines, the code must read them all.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, there are three lines. So the code must process each line as a separate test case.\n\nThus, the code should read each line from stdin, process it, and output the answer for each line.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    total_drink = k * l\n\n    drink_max = total_drink // nl\n\n    total_lime = c * d\n\n    lime_max = total_lime\n\n    salt_max = p // np\n\n    t_total = min(drink_max, lime_max, salt_max)\n\n    result = t_total // n\n\n    print(result)\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', which would be processed as n=3, etc., and output 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSimilarly for the other lines.\n\nBut the problem's original statement says that the input is the first and only line. So why does the sample have multiple lines?\n\nPerhaps the problem is from a programming competition where multiple test cases are given, and the code should process them all.\n\nBut the problem statement's input description says that it's the first and only line. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input has multiple lines, and the sample output has multiple lines, I think the code should process multiple lines.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is described as a single line. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input has multiple lines, and the code needs to pass the sample, I think that the code must read multiple lines of input.\n\nSo I'll proceed with writing the code that reads all lines from stdin, processes each as a separate test case.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem is designed for a single test case, and the sample input shows multiple test cases for illustration.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, but based on the sample, I'll proceed with the code that reads each line as a separate test case.\n\nSo the code is as written above.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFor the first line:\n\n3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, write the Python code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read multiple lines of input, each representing a separate test case.\n2. **Resource Calculation**:\n   - **Drink**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available and determine how many toasts can be made based on the drink per toast.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available and determine how many toasts can be made based on the slices per toast.\n   - **Salt**: Calculate the total grams of salt available and determine how many toasts can be made based on the salt per toast.\n3. **Determine Constraints**: For each resource, compute the maximum number of toasts that can be made considering the constraints.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum of the constraints divided by the number of friends.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, line.strip().split())\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available and max toasts based on drink\n    total_drink = k * l\n    drink_max = total_drink // nl\n    \n    # Calculate total lime slices available and max toasts based on limes\n    total_lime = c * d\n    lime_max = total_lime\n    \n    # Calculate max toasts based on salt\n    salt_max = p // np\n    \n    # Determine the total possible toasts across all friends\n    t_total = min(drink_max, lime_max, salt_max)\n    \n    # Calculate the number of toasts per friend\n    result = t_total // n\n    \n    # Print the result for this test case\n    print(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads each line from standard input, which represents a separate test case.\n- **Total Resources Calculation**: For each test case, the total amount of drink, lime slices, and salt are calculated.\n- **Constraints Determination**: The maximum number of toasts that can be made based on each resource is determined by dividing the total available resource by the requirement per toast.\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum value among the constraints (drink, lime slices, salt) gives the maximum total toasts possible across all friends. Dividing this by the number of friends gives the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum number of toasts each friend can make while adhering to the constraints of the available resources.",
