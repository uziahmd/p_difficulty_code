A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So, I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, first, I need to calculate how much of each resource is available, then determine how many toasts can be made considering all constraints.\n\nLet me think about each resource:\n\n1. Drink: Total drink is k * l ml. Each toast requires n * nl ml (because each of the n friends needs nl ml). So the total number of toasts possible from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). Wait, no. Wait, for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. So total toasts possible from drink is total_drink // (n * nl). But wait, total_drink is k*l. So yes.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample input: 3 friends, 4 bottles of 5ml each. Total drink is 20ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml? Wait, the sample says that for the first input, the drink allows 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, that's because 3 friends each need 3 ml per toast. So per toast, total is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222..., which floor to 2. But the sample says 6 toasts. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" Wait, why 20 divided by 3? Oh, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nEach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total per toast is n * nl ml. So the total number of toasts possible from the drink is (total_drink) // (n * nl). \n\nBut in the first example, total_drink is 4*5=20. n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, total is 3 * 3 =9. 20//9 is 2. But the note says that the drink allows 6 toasts. Wait that's a contradiction. Wait what's the note saying?\n\nIn the first sample, the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Oh, so maybe the calculation is (total_drink) divided by (nl) and then divided by n? Or maybe I have the formula wrong. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait the note says that the drink is 20ml. Each toast requires each friend to have nl=3 ml. So for one toast, each friend uses 3 ml. So for 3 friends, that's 3 * 3 =9 ml per toast. So with 20ml, you can have 2 full toasts (using 18ml), leaving 2ml. So why does the note say that the drink allows 6 toasts?\n\nWait that's impossible. Wait there's a mistake here. Wait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3=2. Wait why 6?\n\nAh! Oh wait, maybe the note is saying that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. But that would be if each toast requires 3 ml per friend. Wait, but that would be for one friend. So perhaps the note is considering per friend, not total.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement. \n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, all friends together need n * nl ml. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 20 / (3) = 6.666... So that would be 6. So that suggests that the per toast is nl per friend, but perhaps the calculation is total_drink divided by (nl) and then divided by the number of friends? Or maybe the total toasts is (total_drink) // (nl) divided by n? \n\nWait let's think again. For example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4 *5 =20ml. \n\nEach toast requires each friend to have nl=3 ml. So per toast, each friend uses 3ml. So for one toast, total is 3 * 3 =9ml. \n\nSo how many toasts can be made? 20 / 9 = 2.222... So 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. That's a contradiction. So clearly I have a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait looking at the note again: \n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait according to this, the drink allows 6 toasts. But how? 20 /3 is 6.666... So why is that the case?\n\nAh! Oh! Because maybe the per toast per friend is nl. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So the total amount of drink needed for t toasts is t * n * nl. \n\nBut the note says that 20 / 3 =6 toasts. Which would imply that 20 is equal to t * n * nl. So 20 = t * 3 * 3 → t = 20/(9) = 2.222. But that's not matching. So why does the note say that the drink allows 6 toasts?\n\nWait maybe the note is wrong? No, that's impossible. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait perhaps the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. But for each toast, each friend makes one toast. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl ml. So total drink needed is n * t * nl. \n\nSo the total drink available is k * l. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nIn the first sample, that would be 20 / (3 * 3) = 20 /9 = 2.222, so 2. But according to the note, the drink allows 6 toasts. So that's conflicting. So where is the error here?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 20 /3 =6.666. So why is that the case?\n\nAh! Oh! Maybe the problem is that the note is considering per toast per friend. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, each friend uses 3 ml. So for one toast, total is 3 *3 =9 ml. But the note says that the drink allows 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 20 /3 =6.666. So that would be if each toast requires 3 ml per friend. But that's only possible if there's 1 friend. \n\nWait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 =2. So 6 divided by 3 equals 2. Which suggests that the initial calculation is for per friend toasts. \n\nWait maybe the problem is that the total number of toasts is calculated per friend. Like, each friend can make t toasts, and the resources are calculated accordingly. So for example, for the drink, each friend needs t * nl ml. So total for all friends is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before. \n\nBut the note says that the drink allows 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be 20/(nl) = 20/3 =6.666. So that would be the maximum t per friend, but then divided by n? No. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps I have misread the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says: the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\nAh! Oh! So the question is, each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend has to have their requirements. \n\nSo for each friend, making t toasts requires t * nl ml of drink. So for all friends, total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nSimilarly, each toast requires one slice of lime per friend. So for t toasts, each friend needs t slices. So total slices needed is n * t. \n\nAnd for salt, each toast requires np grams per friend. So for t toasts, per friend, it's t * np. So total salt is n * t * np.\n\nSo the resources are:\n\nDrink: total is k*l. Must be >= n * t * nl.\n\nLime slices: total is c *d. Must be >= n * t.\n\nSalt: total is p. Must be >= n * t * np.\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of:\n\n(k*l) // (n * nl), \n\n(c*d) // (n), \n\np // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nAh! So that's the correct approach. \n\nSo in the first sample, let's compute each component:\n\nDrink: (4 *5) =20. n=3, nl=3. So 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222 → floor to 2.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8 → 10*8=80 slices. n*t must be ≤ 80. So t ≤ 80 /n = 80 /3 =26.666 → floor 26.\n\nSalt: p=100, n=3, np=1. So 100/(3*1) = 33.333 → floor 33.\n\nSo the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nAh! Because the note is saying that the drink allows for 20 /3 =6 toasts. But according to our calculation, it's 20/(3 *3) = 2.222. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. But according to our calculation, the drink is 20, and the required per toast is 3*3=9. So 20//9 is 2. But the note says 6. So what's going on here?\n\nWait perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Let me recheck the note again.\n\nThe note says:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait why 20 /3? Because 20 divided by 3 is 6.666. So that would be if each toast required 3 ml total. But that would be for one friend. For example, if each toast requires 3 ml per friend, and there is one friend, then 20 /3 is 6 toasts. But in the problem, there are 3 friends. \n\nAh! Oh! Oh! I think I see the mistake. The note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts, but that's the total number of toasts across all friends. But the actual problem requires that each friend makes t toasts. So the total number of toasts across all friends is n * t. \n\nWait no, the problem says that each friend makes t toasts. So for example, if each friend makes 2 toasts, then the total number of toasts is 3 *2 =6. \n\nSo the note is saying that the drink allows for 6 toasts (total across all friends), which would be 6 toasts in total. Then, since there are 3 friends, each makes 2 toasts. \n\nSo the note is calculating the total toasts possible from the drink as (total drink) / (nl) → 20 /3 =6.666 → 6. But that's because each toast (per friend) requires nl ml. So for total toasts across all friends, say T, then T * nl = total drink. \n\nWait no. Because each toast per friend requires nl ml. So for T total toasts (across all friends), each toast requires nl ml. So total drink needed is T * nl. \n\nBut that's not correct. Because if each friend makes t toasts, then total toasts across all friends is n * t. Each of those toasts requires nl ml. So total drink is (n * t) * nl. \n\nSo the maximum T (total toasts) is (k*l) // (nl). \n\nThen, since each friend makes t toasts, T = n * t → t = T /n. \n\nSo the maximum t is floor( (k*l // nl) /n )\n\nBut in the first sample:\n\nk*l is 20, nl is 3. So 20//3 =6. So T is 6. Then t is 6 /3 = 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nAh! So the original approach was wrong. Instead of calculating (k*l) // (n * nl), we should calculate (k*l) // nl divided by n. \n\nSo the mistake was in the way we compute the maximum number of toasts per friend. \n\nSo the correct approach is:\n\nFor each resource, compute the maximum total number of toasts (across all friends) possible, then divide by n (number of friends) to get the number of toasts per friend. \n\nSo for the drink:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\nmax_total_toasts_drink = total_drink // nl \n\nthen, max_t_drink = max_total_toasts_drink // n \n\nSimilarly for the limes:\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c *d \n\neach toast (per friend) requires 1 slice. So total toasts across all friends is T, so T must be <= total_lime_slices. So max_total_toasts_lime = total_lime_slices. Then max_t_lime = max_total_toasts_lime //n \n\nFor the salt:\n\ntotal_salt = p \n\neach toast (per friend) requires np grams. So total toasts across all friends is T, so T * np <= p → max_total_toasts_salt = p // np \n\nthen max_t_salt = max_total_toasts_salt //n \n\nThe answer is the minimum of max_t_drink, max_t_lime, max_t_salt. \n\nAh! That explains the note. Because in the first sample, the drink allows 20//3=6 total toasts (across all friends). Divided by 3 friends, gives 2 per friend. Which is the correct answer. \n\nSo the key mistake in the initial approach was thinking that each toast requires n * nl ml, but actually, each toast (per friend) requires nl ml. So for total toasts across all friends T, the drink required is T * nl. \n\nSo the correct way to compute the maximum T for each resource is:\n\n- Drink: T_drink = (k*l) // nl \n\n- Limes: T_lime = c*d \n\n- Salt: T_salt = p // np \n\nThen, since each friend can make t toasts, the total toasts across all friends is T = n * t. So for each resource, the maximum t is floor(T_resource /n). \n\nThus, the answer is min( T_drink //n , T_lime//n, T_salt//n )\n\nSo in the first sample:\n\nT_drink = 20//3 =6 → 6//3=2 \n\nT_lime = 10*8=80 → 80//3=26 \n\nT_salt =100//1=100 → 100//3=33 \n\nmin(2, 26, 33) → 2 \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother example: the second input line is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nLet me parse that. \n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000. nl is 4. \n\nT_drink = 1000 //4 = 250. Then divided by n=5 → 50. \n\nLimes: c=1, d=19 → 1*19=19 slices. T_lime is 19. Divided by 5 is 3. \n\nSalt: p=90, np=3 → T_salt = 90//3=30 → divided by 5 is 6. \n\nSo min(50,3,6) → 3. Which matches the sample output. \n\nThird input line is '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1' \n\nDrink: total is 1000 *1000 = 1,000,000. nl=50. T_drink = 1,000,000 //50 = 20000. Divided by 10 → 2000. \n\nLimes: 25 *23 = 575. Divided by 10 is 57. \n\nSalt: p=1, np=1. T_salt =1//1=1. Divided by 10 is 0. \n\nSo min(2000,57,0) is 0. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo now I understand the correct approach. \n\nSo the steps to code this are:\n\nRead the input numbers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np. \n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l \n\nt_drink = total_drink // nl \n\nmax_t_drink = t_drink // n \n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d \n\nmax_t_lime = total_lime_slices // n \n\ntotal_salt = p \n\nt_salt = total_salt // np \n\nmax_t_salt = t_salt // n \n\nanswer is min( max_t_drink, max_t_lime, max_t_salt )\n\nSo code-wise, that's straightforward. \n\nNow, handle the input. The input is a single line with 9 integers. \n\nWait the sample input shows that the first input line is ['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', ...]. So the first line is the first input. But the problem says that the input is the first line containing the numbers. So in the code, we need to read a line, split into the 9 integers. \n\nSo in Python, read the input line, split into parts, convert to integers. \n\nSo code:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts. \n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l \n\nt_drink = total_drink // nl \n\nmax_t_drink = t_drink // n \n\ntotal_lime = c * d \n\nmax_t_lime = total_lime // n \n\ntotal_salt = p \n\nt_salt = total_salt // np \n\nmax_t_salt = t_salt // n \n\nresult = min( max_t_drink, max_t_lime, max_t_salt )\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut wait, what if division is zero? For example, if the total_drink is less than nl, then t_drink is zero, and then max_t_drink is zero. Which is correct. \n\nTesting the third sample input: \n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink = 1,000,000. nl=50 → t_drink = 1e6 //50 = 20000. divided by 10 → 2000. \n\nBut the salt is 1 gram. np=1. t_salt = 1//1=1. divided by 10 → 0. \n\nSo the answer is zero. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother test case: if the total_drink is 0? Well, the problem says that all inputs are positive integers. So no. \n\nSo the code should handle all cases. \n\nNow, let me code this in Python. \n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers. \n\nThen compute each part. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\nt_drink = total_drink // nl\nmax_t_drink = t_drink // n\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\nmax_t_lime = total_lime // n\n\nt_salt = p // np\nmax_t_salt = t_salt // n\n\nresult = min(max_t_drink, max_t_lime, max_t_salt)\nprint(result)\n\nYes. \n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nInput line is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. \n\ntotal_drink =4*5=20. t_drink =20//3=6. max_t_drink=6//3=2. \n\ntotal_lime =10*8=80. 80//3=26. \n\nt_salt=100//1=100. 100//3=33. \n\nmin(2,26,33) → 2. Correct. \n\nSecond sample input: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 \n\ntotal_drink=100*10=1000. 1000//4=250. 250//5=50. \n\ntotal_lime=1*19=19. 19//5=3. \n\nt_salt=90//3=30. 30//5=6. min(50,3,6) →3. Correct. \n\nThird sample input: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 \n\ntotal_drink=1000*1000=1,000,000. 1e6//50=20000. 20000//10=2000. \n\ntotal_lime=25*23=575. 575//10=57. \n\nt_salt=1//1=1. 1//10=0. min(2000,57,0) →0. Correct. \n\nSo this code should work. \n\nEdge cases: \n\nCase where all resources are exactly enough. \n\nE.g., n=1, k=1, l=1, c=1, d=1, p=1, nl=1, np=1. \n\ntotal_drink=1*1=1. t_drink=1//1=1. max_t_drink=1//1=1. \n\ntotal_lime=1*1=1. 1//1=1. \n\nt_salt=1//1=1. 1//1=1. \n\nmin(1,1,1) →1. \n\nAnother edge case: when division gives zero. \n\nn=2, total_drink=3, nl=2. t_drink=3//2=1. max_t_drink=1//2=0. \n\nSo answer is zero. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Requirements**: Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total available drink, lime slices, and salt.\n3. **Determine Maximum Possible Toasts**: For each resource, calculate how many total toasts (across all friends) can be made. Then, convert this into the number of toasts per friend by dividing by the number of friends.\n4. **Find Minimum Constraint**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. Thus, take the minimum value from the calculated possible toasts for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\nt_drink = total_drink // nl\nmax_t_drink = t_drink // n\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\nmax_t_lime = total_lime // n\n\nt_salt = p // np\nmax_t_salt = t_salt // n\n\nresult = min(max_t_drink, max_t_lime, max_t_salt)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle. The maximum number of toasts (across all friends) that can be made with this drink is determined by dividing the total drink by the milliliters needed per toast per friend. This value is then divided by the number of friends to get the toasts per friend.\n2. **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is the product of the number of limes and slices per lime. This total is divided by the number of friends to determine the maximum toasts per friend.\n3. **Salt Calculation**: The total salt available is divided by the grams needed per toast per friend, and then divided by the number of friends to get the maximum toasts per friend.\n4. **Result Determination**: The final result is the minimum value from the three calculated values (drink, lime slices, salt), as this represents the limiting resource.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make while considering all constraints.",
