And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks. The input gives me n days and k days per week. For each consecutive k-day period, I need to compute the average and then find the overall average of all those averages.\n\nHmm. Wait, the problem says that the answer is the sum of all the weeks' averages divided by the number of weeks. Or wait, no. Wait, the example note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. Oh right, because each week's average is (sum of k days) / k. Then the overall average is the average of all those averages. Which would be (sum of all the weekly sums) / (number of weeks * k). But since each week's sum is added once, and there are (n -k +1) weeks, the total sum of all weekly sums is the sum of each consecutive k elements, summed over all possible positions.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum of all consecutive k-length subarrays, then dividing that by (number of weeks * k) ?\n\nWait, no. Because each week's average is (sum of the k days)/k. Then the overall average is the average of all those averages. Which is [sum of (sum_i/k) ] / (number of weeks). Which is equal to [ (sum of all sum_i) / k ] / (number of weeks). Which equals sum of all sum_i divided by (k * number of weeks).\n\nBut the number of weeks is (n -k +1). So the final answer is (total_sum_of_all_weekly_sums) / (k * (n -k +1)).\n\nSo the key is to compute the sum of all consecutive k-length subarrays, then divide by (k * (n -k +1)).\n\nBut how to compute the sum of all consecutive k-length subarrays efficiently?\n\nThe naive approach would be to compute each subarray sum, but for n up to 2e5, that would be O(n*k) time which would be too slow. For example, if n is 2e5 and k is 1e5, then n-k+1 is about 1e5, and each sum takes O(k) steps, leading to O(1e10) operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo we need a more efficient way. Let's think about using a sliding window approach. The sum of the first window is sum(a[0..k-1]). Then each subsequent window is the previous sum minus a[i] and adding a[i +k]. So we can compute all the window sums in O(n) time.\n\nYes. So here's the plan:\n\n- Compute the initial window sum (first k elements).\n- Then for each next window, subtract the element leaving the window and add the new element.\n- Keep a running total of all these window sums.\n- Finally, divide by (k * (n -k +1)).\n\nThat's O(n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo let's outline the steps:\n\nRead n and k. Then read the array a.\n\nIf k is 0? No, constraints say 1<=k<=n. So no problem.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements. Then, for each position from 1 to (n -k), compute the next sum by subtracting a[i-1] and adding a[i +k -1]. Wait, let me think. Let me think about the indexes.\n\nFor example, the first window is from index 0 to k-1. The next window is from 1 to k. So for each step, the new element is at position i +k -1? Wait, for the first window, the start is 0, end is k-1. The next window starts at 1, ends at k. So the new element is at index k (the end of the new window). So when moving from window starting at i to i+1, the element leaving is a[i], and the element entering is a[i +k].\n\nSo the initial sum is sum of a[0 ...k-1]. Then for each i in 0 to (n -k -1), the next sum is current_sum - a[i] + a[i +k]. Wait, the number of windows is (n -k +1). So the initial sum is the first window. Then for each of the next (n -k) windows, we compute the sum by subtracting the leftmost element and adding the next element.\n\nSo the total number of windows is (n -k +1). So the code would be:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, n -k +1):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n\n    total += current_sum\n\nThen the total is the sum of all the window sums. Then divide by (k * (n -k +1)).\n\nYes.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThe first window is 3 +4 =7. The next window is 4+7=11. Total sum is 7 +11 = 18. Then divide by (2 * (3-2 +1)) = 2*2=4. 18/4 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.000... Wait wait, what's the sample input?\n\nWait the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThe output is 9.0000000000.\n\nWait wait. Wait the sample says that the result is 9.0. Let me check the example again.\n\nWait the note says that in the first example, the result is (3+4)/2 + (4+7)/2 divided by 2 (since there are two weeks). Wait, the average of the two averages. So ( (7/2) + (11/2) ) / 2 = (18/2)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5? But the sample output is 9.0. Wait that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait no, the sample input says that the output is 9.000... Wait that can't be. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the problem statement says:\n\nThe output is the average sleeping time over all weeks. So for each week, compute the average, then take the average of all those averages.\n\nIn the first example, the two weeks are [3,4] and [4,7]. Their averages are (3+4)/2 = 3.5 and (4+7)/2 = 5.5. The average of those two is (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.0. That's impossible. So perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe example input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample output is 9.000...\n\nWait that's impossible unless the problem is not to average the averages, but to compute the sum of all the weekly sums divided by the number of weeks. Wait, but that would be (7 + 11)/2 = 18/2 =9. Which matches the sample. So why is that?\n\nAh! Oh, the problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error does not exceed 1e-6. So perhaps the problem is not to compute the average of the averages, but the average of the sums?\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is .\"\n\nBut the sample output is 9.000... So the example must be that the output is 9.0, which is (7 + 11) / 2 = 9. So the problem says that the answer is the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the averages. But why?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n -k +1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the problem says that the result is the average of the weekly sums? Or the average of the averages?\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"you should write a program which will calculate average sleeping time of Polycarp over all weeks.\"\n\nSo the average of the averages. But according to the sample, the output is 9.0, which is the average of the sums. Which suggests that the problem is not to compute the average of the averages, but the average of the sums. But that's conflicting with the description.\n\nWait let's recheck the example.\n\nThe example says that for the input 3 2, 3 4 7, the output is 9.0000000000.\n\nSo according to the note, the output is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. Which would be (7 + 11) / 2 = 9. So that's the case. But why?\n\nBecause the problem says that the average is the average of the weekly averages. But in that case, the average would be (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9. So this suggests that the problem is not to average the averages, but to average the sums. Which would be the sum of all the weekly sums divided by the number of weeks. Which is (7 + 11)/2 = 9. So that's the correct answer.\n\nBut why?\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is .\"\n\nBut the sample output for that input is 9.0000000000.\n\nSo the note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. So the problem is to compute the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the averages. Which seems to be the case.\n\nBut why is that? Because the problem says that the average sleep time per week. So for each week, the average is (sum of hours)/k. Then the overall average is the average of these values. Which would be (sum of (sum_i/k )) / (number of weeks) = (sum of sum_i) / (k * number of weeks).\n\nBut according to the sample, the answer is sum of sum_i / (number of weeks). Which would be the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the averages. So that's conflicting.\n\nBut the sample shows that the output is 9.0 for the first case, which is (7 + 11)/2 = 9. So according to that, the problem is to compute the average of the weekly sums. Which would be the same as the average of the averages multiplied by k.\n\nSo what's the correct approach here?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"the average amount of hours of sleep per week.\"\n\nSo, the average over all weeks. So for each week, the average is (sum of k days)/k. The overall average is the average of these values. So the average of the averages.\n\nBut in the sample input, the average of the averages would be (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. However, the sample output is 9.0. So there's a contradiction here. Which suggests that perhaps I have misread the problem statement.\n\nWait looking back at the problem statement's note:\n\n\"In the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\"\n\nWait that's the third example. So the answer is (sum of all weeks) / 7. So the sum of all weeks is the sum of the weekly sums, divided by the number of weeks. So the answer is the average of the weekly sums. Which would be the same as the average of the averages multiplied by k. Because each average is sum_i/k. So average of averages is (sum sum_i/k) / number of weeks. Which is (sum sum_i) / (k * number of weeks). Whereas the average of the weekly sums is (sum sum_i) / number of weeks.\n\nSo the problem statement's note says that the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. Which would be the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the averages.\n\nBut the problem says that Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week, and the average is the average amount of hours per week. So why is the sample output the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the averages?\n\nThis is confusing. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is .\"\n\nIn the example, the output is 9.0000000000. Which is the average of the weekly sums. So the problem requires us to compute the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the averages.\n\nBut that's contradictory to the problem description. So what's the correct approach?\n\nLooking back at the problem's sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 2, 3 4 7. Output is 9.0.\n\nWhich is (3+4 + 4+7)/2 = (7+11)/2 = 18/2 =9.\n\nBut according to the problem's description, the average per week is (sum of the week)/k. So the average over all weeks would be the average of those values. Which would be (3.5 +5.5)/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9. So why?\n\nAh, the problem statement says:\n\n\"the average amount of hours of sleep per week.\"\n\nBut maybe the problem is to compute the average of the sum of hours per week. Like, the average total hours per week. Which would be the average of the weekly sums. Which would be the same as the average of the averages multiplied by k.\n\nBut the sample shows that this is the case. So perhaps the problem is not to compute the average of the averages, but the average of the weekly sums.\n\nBut that contradicts the problem statement's wording. However, the sample shows that the output is the average of the weekly sums. So perhaps the problem statement is written incorrectly, or I have misread it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the average of the averages, but the sample explanation is incorrect. But that's unlikely.\n\nLet me check the problem statement again. The note says:\n\n\"In the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\"\n\nSo the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. So the answer is the average of the weekly sums. Which implies that the problem requires us to compute that. Therefore, the problem's description may be wrong, but the sample shows that the correct approach is to compute the average of the weekly sums.\n\nBut why is the note saying that? Because the problem says that the average is the average amount of hours per week. So that would be the average of the averages. But the note says that the answer is the sum of the weekly sums divided by the number of weeks.\n\nSo this is a contradiction. But given that the sample input shows that the correct answer is the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the averages, I must proceed accordingly.\n\nSo the problem requires us to compute the average of the weekly sums, not the average of the averages. Which means that the formula is:\n\n(total_sum_of_weekly_sums) / (number_of_weeks).\n\nWhich is the average of the weekly sums. Which for the first sample gives 9, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that's the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the code needs to compute the sum of all consecutive k-day periods, then divide by the number of weeks (n -k +1).\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nCalculate the total sum of all the consecutive k-day periods. Then divide by (n -k +1).\n\nSo the initial approach was wrong. The correct approach is to compute the sum of all the weekly sums, then divide by the number of weeks.\n\nSo for the first sample, the sum is 7 + 11 = 18, divided by 2 weeks, gives 9. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code needs to compute that.\n\nSo the problem is to calculate the sum of all consecutive k-length subarrays, then divide by the number of such subarrays (which is (n -k +1)).\n\nSo the code structure is:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead the array a.\n\nCompute the sum of all consecutive k elements.\n\nThen divide by (n -k +1).\n\nSo the sliding window approach is correct here.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample, the code would compute 7 + 11 = 18, then divide by 2, giving 9.0.\n\nSo that's the correct approach.\n\nSo now, the code can be written as follows.\n\nFirst, compute the initial sum of the first k elements. Then, for each next window, subtract the outgoing element and add the incoming element. Sum all those window sums.\n\nNow, for the code.\n\nIn Python, for n up to 2e5, this approach is O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nLet's test with the first sample.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nInitial sum is 3 +4 =7.\n\nThen, next window is 4 +7 = 11. So total is 7 +11 =18. Divided by 2, gives 9.0.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is 1 1, 10. So the sum is 10, divided by 1, gives 10.0.\n\nThird example:\n\nInput is 8 2, array [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nNumber of weeks is 8 -2 +1 =7.\n\nEach week's sum is:\n\n1+2 =3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789 +1 = 790\n\nTotal sum is 3 +6 +100004 +100123 +579 +1245 +790 = ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\n3+6=9.\n\n9 + 100004 = 100013.\n\n+100123 = 200136.\n\n+579 = 200715.\n\n+1245 = 201,960.\n\n+790 = 202,750.\n\nThen divide by 7. Let's see:\n\n202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the third sample output.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead list a.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\ntotal_sum = initial_sum.\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to (n -k) times:\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n\nadd to total_sum.\n\nThen, the answer is total_sum / (n -k +1).\n\nSo in code:\n\nIn Python, for example:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, n -k +1):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i +k -1]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\nresult = total_sum / (n -k +1)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nWait but for the case where n=k, then the number of weeks is 1. So the code works.\n\nBut let's check for the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2: 1 1, 10.\n\ncurrent_sum is sum(a[0:1]) =10. total_sum is 10. Then, the loop runs for range(1, 1 -1 +1) = range(1, 1) which is no iterations. So total_sum is 10. Divided by 1, gives 10. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the output formatting. The output must be printed with at least 6 decimal digits. So in Python, formatting with 10 decimal digits, as in the sample outputs.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead multiple test cases? Wait the input is given as multiple lines. Wait the original problem says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nBut in the sample input provided, there are three examples. Wait, but the user has given the sample input as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nBut this seems to be multiple test cases. However, the original problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases for the problem. But the original problem says that the input is for one test case. However, the code needs to read from standard input, which for programming competition problems is usually one test case per run.\n\nWait the original problem's input is given as two lines. The first line has n and k, the second line has the array. So the code should process one test case. However, the sample input given in the problem seems to be multiple test cases, but that may be a mistake in the problem description.\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should handle one test case. However, the sample input given in the problem seems to have multiple test cases. But perhaps that's a formatting error in the problem description. For example, the sample input may have been presented as multiple test cases, but the actual code should handle one.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the first sample input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich outputs 9.0000000000.\n\nThe second sample input is 1 1 followed by 10, output is 10.0000000000.\n\nThird sample input is 8 2 followed by the array, output is 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo the code must read one test case, but the sample shows multiple. However, the user's input is given as a list of strings, perhaps in the problem's example. But for the actual code, we need to read from stdin. So the code should read two lines: first line is n and k, second line is the array.\n\nBut the user's sample input shows that the code may have multiple test cases. But that's not the case. The original problem's input is one test case. Therefore, the code must read one test case.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, perhaps the user is showing multiple test cases as part of the example. However, the actual code should read one test case.\n\nSo the code must read two lines: first line is n and k, second line is the array.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nRead n and k from input.\n\nRead the array.\n\nCompute the total sum of the sliding window sums.\n\nDivide by (n -k +1).\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, when you print floating points, you need to format it properly. For example, if the result is an integer, like 9, you need to print it as 9.0000000000.\n\nSo using Python's string formatting, like \"{:.10f}\".format(result) would do that.\n\nBut what about precision? For example, when the division is not exact, but the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-6. So using floating point division and printing with 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut for very large numbers, like when the sum is large, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily big, so no problem.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute initial sum.\n\nThen, for each next window, update current_sum.\n\nAdd to total_sum.\n\nFinally, compute total_sum / (n -k +1).\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, n - k +1):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\nresult = total_sum / (n -k +1)\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nWait, but in Python, when you do division, it returns a float. However, for very large numbers, but the problem says that the answer can be output with at least 6 digits after decimal, and the code uses 10 digits, which is sufficient.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\na = [3,4,7]\n\ncurrent_sum = 3+4=7.\n\ntotal_sum =7.\n\nThen, i ranges from 1 to (3-2 +1) -1 = 1 to 2-1=1? Wait the loop is for i in range(1, n -k +1). Because the number of weeks is (n -k +1), and the initial sum is for the first week. Then, the loop runs (n -k) times, because the number of weeks is (n -k +1), and the first sum is already accounted for.\n\nWait the loop runs from 1 to (n -k +1) -1 ?\n\nBecause for example, for n=3, k=2, the number of weeks is 2. The initial sum is the first week. The loop runs for i from 1 to (n -k +1) -1 ?\n\nThe code uses range(1, n -k +1). Because in Python, range is exclusive on the upper bound.\n\nSo for n -k +1 being the number of weeks, the loop runs for (number of weeks -1) times. Because the initial sum is the first week. Then, for each of the remaining (number of weeks -1) weeks, we compute the sum.\n\nYes. Because the number of weeks is (n -k +1). So the loop runs (n -k +1 -1) = n -k times. Which is correct.\n\nIn the first sample, n -k +1 is 2. So the loop is range(1, 2), which is [1], so one iteration. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the third sample input.\n\nSample input 3: 8 2, array [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nThe code computes the sum of all consecutive 2-day periods, then divides by 7.\n\nWhich gives the correct output.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where k =n. Then, there is one week. The sum is sum(a) divided by 1. So output is sum(a) as a float.\n\nAnother case where k=1. Then, each week is a single day, and the sum of all weeks is sum(a). Divided by n. Which is average of the array. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code handles all cases.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive k-day periods (weeks) from a given list of daily sleep times. The solution involves efficiently computing the sum of each k-day period and then finding the average of these sums.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We use a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the sum of each k-day period. This technique allows us to compute each subsequent window sum in constant time by adjusting the sum of the previous window.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Start with the sum of the first k days. For each subsequent window, adjust the sum by subtracting the element that is left behind and adding the new element that enters the window.\n3. **Average Calculation**: After computing the sum of all k-day periods, divide the total sum by the number of such periods to get the final average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total_sum = current_sum\n    \n    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]\n        total_sum += current_sum\n    \n    result = total_sum / (n - k + 1)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of days `n`, the length of each week `k`, and the list of sleep times.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first k days is computed to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Sliding Window Adjustment**: For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window. This adjustment ensures that each window sum is computed in constant time.\n4. **Total Sum and Average**: The total sum of all window sums is accumulated, and the final average is calculated by dividing this total by the number of weeks (n - k + 1). The result is formatted to ensure at least 10 decimal places for precision.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required average with a time complexity of O(n), making it suitable for large input sizes up to 200,000 days.",
