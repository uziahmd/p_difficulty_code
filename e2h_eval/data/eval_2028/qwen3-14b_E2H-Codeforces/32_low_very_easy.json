    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nThe instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. So when I remove one element, I want to minimize this difference. \n\nFirst, let's understand the problem with the examples. In the first example, the array is [1,3,3,7]. The original instability is 7-1=6. If we remove 7, the array becomes [1,3,3], instability is 3-1=2. If we remove 1, the array is [3,3,7], instability is 7-3=4. So the best is to remove 7.\n\nIn the second example, [1, 100000], removing either element leaves a single element array, so instability is zero.\n\nSo the key idea here is that the instability after removing one element depends on which element we remove. For each possible element to remove, we need to compute the new max and min, then find the minimum of those differences.\n\nBut for large n (up to 1e5), checking each possibility naively would be O(n^2), which is not feasible. So I need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think. The original array's max and min are known. But when you remove an element, the new max and min can be determined based on whether the removed element was the original max or min.\n\nWait, but if the array has multiple instances of the max or min, then removing one of them might not affect the overall max or min.\n\nFor example, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 7], the original max is 7 and min is 1. If I remove 7, the new max is 3. If I remove 1, the new min is 3. But if I remove one of the 3s, the max and min remain 7 and 1. So the instability would be 7-1=6, which is worse than removing 7.\n\nSo the optimal choice is to remove either the max or the min, but only if there are multiple occurrences. Otherwise, if the array has only one max and one min, then removing one of them would change the max or min.\n\nBut how do I find the best element to remove?\n\nLet me think: For each element in the array, when we remove it, the new array's max and min can be determined as follows:\n\nIf the element being removed is not the current max or min, then the max and min remain the same. Therefore, the instability remains (max - min). So removing such elements doesn't help.\n\nBut if the element being removed is the current max, then the new max is the second maximum. Similarly, if it's the current min, the new min is the second min. So the instability would be (second_max - min) if we remove the original max, or (max - second_min) if we remove the original min.\n\nBut how do I find the second max and second min?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal strategy is to consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: Remove the first occurrence of the max. Then the new instability is (second_max - min).\n\nCase 2: Remove the first occurrence of the min. Then the new instability is (max - second_min).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum between these two possibilities.\n\nWait, but maybe there are multiple maxes and mins. For example, if there are multiple max elements, then removing one of them would leave the others, so the max remains the same. So in that case, the instability would be (max - min) if we remove a max (but there are other maxes). Similarly for min.\n\nSo the key is:\n\nIf the array has more than one occurrence of the max, then removing one of them won't change the max. Similarly for min.\n\nSo the minimal instability can be achieved by either:\n\n- Removing the max (if there are multiple maxes), so the instability is (max - min) (since max remains the same, but min may not change). Wait no, if you remove a max, but there are other maxes, then the new array's max is still the same. So the instability is (max - min) if you remove a max (but only if there are multiple maxes). However, if there's only one max, then removing it would change the max to the second highest value, which would be lower than the original max.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nCompute the original max and min. Then, check how many times they appear.\n\nIf the count of max is more than 1, then removing one of them would leave the max the same. So the instability would be (max - min) if we remove a max. Similarly for min.\n\nBut if the count of max is 1,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Instability**: The instability of an array is the difference between its maximum and minimum values. Removing an element can potentially reduce this difference if the removed element is either the maximum or the minimum.\n2. **Key Insight**: If we remove an element that is not the maximum or minimum, the instability remains unchanged. Therefore, the optimal strategy involves checking the impact of removing the maximum or minimum elements.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: \n   - Calculate the original maximum and minimum values of the array.\n   - Count the occurrences of these maximum and minimum values.\n   - If there are multiple instances of the maximum or minimum, removing one of them will not change the overall maximum or minimum, thus maintaining the same instability.\n   - If there is only one instance of the maximum or minimum, removing it will change the instability, which can be calculated by finding the second highest or second lowest values respectively.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    max_val = max(a)\n    min_val = min(a)\n    \n    count_max = a.count(max_val)\n    count_min = a.count(min_val)\n    \n    # If there are multiple max or min, removing one won't change the max or min\n    if count_max > 1 or count_min > 1:\n        print(max_val - min_val)\n    else:\n        # Need to find the second max and second min\n        # Remove one max and calculate instability\n        new_a = a.copy()\n        new_a.remove(max_val)\n        instability1 = max(new_a) - min(new_a)\n        \n        # Remove one min and calculate instability\n        new_a = a.copy()\n        new_a.remove(min_val)\n        instability2 = max(new_a) - min(new_a)\n        \n        print(min(instability1, instability2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: If the array has exactly two elements, removing one results in an array with a single element, hence zero instability.\n- **Max and Min Calculation**: The maximum and minimum values of the array are determined.\n- **Count Occurrences**: The number of times the maximum and minimum values appear in the array is counted.\n- **Instability Calculation**: Depending on the occurrences of max and min values, the instability is calculated either by directly using the original max and min (if there are duplicates) or by removing one instance of max or min and recalculating the instability.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element, leveraging the properties of max and min values in the array.",
