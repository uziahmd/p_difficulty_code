            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Morse Code\n\nIn Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. Hmm. The task is to process a string S that's being built step by step by appending 0s and 1s. After each addition, we need to compute the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code. But there are four invalid codes: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring that matches one of these four shouldn't be counted.\n\nWait, but how do we approach this? Let me think. For each step, after adding a character to S, we need to consider all possible substrings of S and check if they are valid Morse code representations. Then count all possible sequences of letters that can be formed from these valid substrings. However, since sequences are made of multiple letters, maybe each valid substring represents a single letter. So the problem reduces to counting all possible ways to split the string into parts where each part is a valid Morse code (i.e., not one of the four invalid ones). But wait, no. Wait the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" Oh right! So each such sequence corresponds to a way of splitting some substring of S into valid Morse code letters. For example, if the substring is \"11\", it could be either the letter 'M' (if \"11\" is valid) or part of a longer sequence. Wait, but the question is about all possible sequences of letters that can be represented by some substring of S. So for example, if a substring is \"11\", then that's one letter. But also, if there's a longer substring that includes that as part of a split into multiple letters, like \"111\" could be split into \"1\" and \"11\", which would be two letters. So each occurrence of a valid Morse code in a substring contributes to the count, but considering all possible splits of all possible substrings.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThis seems similar to dynamic programming problems where we track the number of valid ways up to a certain point. Let me think.\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows: For the current string S, after each step, we need to calculate the total number of valid sequences. Each valid sequence corresponds to a way of splitting some substring into valid Morse code letters. However, the problem says that each such sequence is represented by some substring of S. So for example, if the entire string S is \"111\", then the substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", \"111\". Each of these substrings can be split into valid Morse codes. But each split corresponds to a sequence of letters. For instance, the substring \"111\" can be split into \"1\", \"1\", \"1\" (sequence of three letters), or \"1\", \"11\" (two letters), or \"11\", \"1\" (two letters), or \"111\" (one letter). Each of these splits counts as a different sequence. But the problem wants the total number of such sequences across all possible substrings of S.\n\nWait, but the problem statement says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe each sequence of letters is represented by a substring of S. For example, a sequence of letters is a concatenation of Morse code representations. So for example, the sequence \"T M\" would correspond to the Morse code \"1\" + \"11\" = \"111\". So the substring \"111\" would represent that sequence. But the same substring can represent multiple sequences. For example, if the substring is \"111\", it can be split into three letters (each \"1\"), two letters (like \"1\" and \"11\"), or one letter (\"111\"). So each split corresponds to a different sequence. Therefore, the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible substrings of S of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each step, compute the sum for all possible substrings of S, of the number of valid splits of that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe naive approach would be, for each step, iterate through all possible substrings of S, and for each substring, compute the number of valid splits. But with m up to 3000, and S length up to 3000, the number of substrings is O(n^2) per step, which would be O(3000^2) * 3000 steps, which is way too big (like 3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a dynamically growing string `S` in Morse code. The key challenge is efficiently calculating this after each modification to the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Insight**: We use a dynamic programming approach to keep track of valid Morse code substrings and their contributions to the total count of valid sequences.\n2. **Valid Morse Codes**: We maintain a set of valid Morse code strings (excluding the four invalid ones: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\").\n3. **Prefix Counting**: For each position in the string `S`, we compute how many valid sequences end at that position. This helps in efficiently updating the total count as the string grows.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the numbers can be very large, all operations are performed modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    ops = input[1:m+1]\n    \n    # Valid Morse codes are all binary strings of length 1-4 except the four invalid ones\n    invalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    valid = set()\n    for length in range(1, 5):\n        for bits in range(2**length):\n            s = bin(bits)[2:].zfill(length)\n            if s not in invalid:\n                valid.add(s)\n    \n    S = []\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)  # dp[i] is the number of valid sequences ending at position i-1\n    total = 0\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        S.append(ops[i])\n        current = ''.join(S)\n        # Check all possible suffixes ending at current position\n        # We check substrings ending at i (0-based) with lengths 1 to 4\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if i - l + 1 < 0:\n                continue\n            sub = current[i - l + 1:i + 1]\n            if sub in valid:\n                if l == 1:\n                    dp[i + 1] = (dp[i + 1] + 1) % MOD\n                else:\n                    dp[i + 1] = (dp[i + 1] + dp[i - l + 1]) % MOD\n        total = (total + dp[i + 1]) % MOD\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations and the sequence of operations.\n2. **Valid Morse Codes Set**: A set of valid Morse code strings is precomputed, excluding the four invalid ones.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: `dp[i]` keeps track of the number of valid sequences ending at position `i` in the string `S`.\n4. **Updating Total Count**: After each character is appended to `S`, we check all possible substrings ending at the current position. For each valid Morse code substring found, we update the DP array and accumulate the total count of valid sequences.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: All calculations are done modulo $10^9 + 7$ to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required counts using dynamic programming, leveraging the constraints on the length of Morse code strings (1 to 4 characters), leading to an optimal solution.",
