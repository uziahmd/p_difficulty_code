Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. The key points are:\n\n- The initial string s is given.\n- There are n queries. Each query replaces all occurrences of a digit di in the current string with the string ti. And these replacements are done in the order of the queries.\n- After all queries, compute the number represented by the final string, ignoring leading zeros (but keeping trailing zeros?), and then take mod 1e9+7. Also, if the string is empty, treat it as zero.\n\nBut directly simulating each substitution is going to be impossible for large inputs. Because if the string is long and substitutions are done multiple times, the string can become exponentially large. For example, if you have a substitution that replaces a digit with a long string, and then another substitution that replaces another digit with a long string, etc. So for n=1e5 and each substitution replacing a digit with a long string, the string could be way too big to handle directly.\n\nTherefore, we need a smarter approach. Let's think about how to model the substitutions without actually building the entire string.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the substitutions. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But since substitutions are applied in order, the later substitutions can override previous ones. For example, if first we replace '2' with '00', then replace '0' with '1', then the original '2's would be replaced with '00', which then get replaced with '11'.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each query replaces all instances of di in the current string with ti. So the order of processing queries matters. So, for example, if a query replaces '2' with '00', then a later query that replaces '0' with 'something' will affect those '0's that were created by the first substitution.\n\nTherefore, the substitutions are cumulative, and we need to track for each digit, what it gets replaced with, considering all the queries up to that point.\n\nBut how can we model this? Because each substitution affects the current state of the string. However, if we process the substitutions in reverse order, perhaps we can find a way to model the transformations.\n\nAlternatively, think of each substitution as a mapping from digits to other strings. However, when a substitution is applied, it's possible that the replacement string contains digits that are later substituted. So, for example, if we have a substitution sequence like:\n\nFirst, replace '2' with '3', then replace '3' with '4'. Then, the original '2's would be replaced with '3's, which are then replaced with '4's. So the net effect is that '2's are replaced with '4's.\n\nBut if we process the substitutions in order, then each substitution affects the current state of the string. But if we can track for each digit, what is the final expansion after all substitutions, then we can compute the final string by expanding each original digit according to the final mappings.\n\nWait, but substitutions can be done in any order, and later substitutions can overwrite previous ones. For example, if the first substitution is '2' -> 'a', then later substitution is '2' -> 'b', then the second substitution overrides the first. So, for each digit, the last substitution that applies to it determines its replacement.\n\nBut how do substitutions affect each other? Let's think about the substitutions as a series of replacements. Suppose we have a substitution for a digit d, and then later another substitution for d. The second one replaces all instances of d in the current string. However, if the first substitution was replacing d with some string, then after that substitution, any occurrence of d in the string would have already been replaced. So, the second substitution for d would only replace any d's that were not replaced by earlier substitutions. Wait, no. Because the substitution is applied to the current string. So, if you have a substitution for d, and then another substitution for d, the second substitution would replace all current instances of d in the string. But if the first substitution replaced all instances of d with something else, then the second substitution would replace any remaining d's (which may be none). However, if during the substitution, the replacement string for a digit includes other digits that are later substituted, then those digits will be replaced in subsequent steps.\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we model the final expansion of each original digit?\n\nAn alternative approach is to track for each digit, what is the final expansion after all substitutions. For example, suppose we process the substitutions in reverse order, and for each substitution, we track how each digit maps to its expansion. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that each substitution replaces a digit d with a string t. Now, if a substitution is",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and then compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. Directly simulating the substitutions is infeasible due to potential exponential growth in the string length. Instead, we can model the substitutions using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic to avoid constructing the entire string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) for Digit Substitution**: We maintain a mapping for each digit from 0 to 9 that represents its current expansion after all substitutions processed so far. This mapping is updated as each query is processed.\n2. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since we only need the final number modulo $10^9 + 7$, we can compute the result incrementally using modular arithmetic. This avoids dealing with very large numbers directly.\n3. **Efficient String Processing**: For each substitution query, we update the mapping for the affected digit. When processing the original string, we use the current mappings to compute the final value efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    s = input[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(input):\n            break\n        line = input[idx].strip()\n        if line:\n            queries.append(line)\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Initialize the mapping: for each digit, what it expands to\n    # Initially, each digit maps to itself\n    # But since we process queries in order, we need to track the latest substitution for each digit\n    # So we can have a dictionary where for each digit, we store the current expansion string\n    # However, since we need to compute the value mod MOD, we can precompute the value of each expansion\n    # So instead of storing strings, we can store the value mod MOD, and the length of the expansion\n    # Because when concatenating, the value is (current_value * 10^length + new_value) mod MOD\n\n    # dp[d] will be a tuple (value, length) representing the value of the expansion of digit d mod MOD and the length of the expansion\n    dp = [None] * 10\n    for d in range(10):\n        dp[d] = (d, 1)  # initially, each digit maps to itself\n\n    for query in queries:\n        if not query:\n            continue\n        # parse the query: di->ti\n        parts = query.split('->')\n        di = parts[0]\n        ti = parts[1]\n        d = int(di)\n        # compute the value and length of ti\n        val_ti = 0\n        len_ti = 0\n        for c in ti:\n            val_ti = (val_ti * 10 + int(c)) % MOD\n            len_ti += 1\n        # Now, we need to update dp[d] to be the value and length of ti\n        # However, note that ti may contain digits that have been substituted before\n        # Wait, no.

So when we process a query, the ti is a string that is inserted into the string. So, when we process future queries, the digits in ti may be replaced if they are subject to substitution.\n        # Therefore, our approach of keeping for each digit d, the value and length of its expansion is not sufficient because ti may contain other digits that have their own expansions.\n        # Therefore, the correct way is to represent for each digit, the expansion string (but that's too big), or to track for each digit, the value and length of its expansion, considering all previous substitutions.\n        # Wait, but when we process a query for di -> ti, the ti is a fixed string.
