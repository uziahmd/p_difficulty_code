Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding three vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the angles in a regular polygon work. Let me think. In a regular n-gon, each interior angle is (n-2)*180/(n) degrees. Wait, but that's the angle for each vertex when you look at the internal angles of the polygon. But here, Mister B is creating an angle by selecting three vertices where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 are on the sides. So this isn't the internal angle of the polygon, but some other angle formed by choosing three vertices.\n\nWait, maybe I should think about how the angle is formed. For example, in a regular polygon, if you pick three vertices v1, v2, v3, with v2 being the middle vertex, then the angle at v2 depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2. Like, if they're adjacent, then maybe the angle is something else. \n\nLet me think about the regular polygon. Let's consider the central angles. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. But when you have a triangle formed by three vertices, the angle at v2 can be calculated based on the number of sides between v1 and v2 and between v2 and v3. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a formula for the angle at v2. Let me think. Suppose we have a regular n-gon. Let's say that between v2 and v1 there are k edges, and between v2 and v3 there are m edges. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 would depend on the number of steps between v1 and v3. Wait, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when going around the polygon. \n\nAlternatively, for a regular polygon, the angle formed at a vertex when connecting to two other vertices depends on the number of sides between them. For example, in a regular pentagon (n=5), if you take two adjacent vertices (like v1 and v2) and connect them to another vertex that's two steps away, the angle might be different. \n\nI remember that in a regular polygon, the measure of an inscribed angle depends on the arc it subtends. For example, the angle at v2 formed by points v1 and v3 would be related to the number of sides between v1 and v3. Let me think. \n\nIn a regular polygon, the central angle between two vertices separated by k steps is (k * 360)/n degrees. But for the inscribed angle, which would be the angle at v2, maybe it's half of that? Or maybe not. Wait, no, because the polygon is regular, but the points are on the perimeter. \n\nAlternatively, consider the regular polygon inscribed in a circle. Then any triangle formed by three vertices will have angles that can be calculated using the arcs. For example, the angle at v2 would be equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Wait, that's the case for a circle. Because in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice that subtended at the circumference. \n\nSo if the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is equal to x degrees, then the angle at v2 would be x/2. \n\nBut in the regular polygon, the arc between two vertices depends on how many steps apart they are. For example, if there are k steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't pass through v2, then the arc length is k*(360/n) degrees. Therefore, the angle at v2 would be (k * 360 / n) / 2 = (k * 180)/n degrees. \n\nWait, but how do we find k? Let's think. Suppose we fix v2 as the middle vertex. Then, v1 and v3 are two other vertices. Let's assume that between v2 and v1 there are m steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3 there are l steps clockwise. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. However, since the polygon is convex, the arc that doesn't contain v2 would be the one that's longer? Or maybe not. \n\nWait, perhaps for the angle at v2, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2 must be considered. Let me think again. Suppose we have three vertices arranged such that when you go from v1 to v2 to v3, they are consecutive. Then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be the long way around the polygon. But that seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of the regular polygon as being inscribed in a unit circle. Then, the angle at v2 would depend on how far apart v1 and v3 are. For example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2 (like in a triangle), then the angle at v2 is the internal angle of the polygon. But for a triangle, the internal angle is 60 degrees. Wait, but according to the formula I thought earlier, if k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not include v2. \n\nIn a triangle (n=3), if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the arc between them that doesn't include v2 would be the entire circle minus the arc between them that includes v2. Wait, this is getting confusing. \n\nLet me take an example. For a square (n=4). Let's take vertices 1, 2, 3. The angle at vertex 2. The internal angle of the square is 90 degrees. But according to the problem's note, when n=4 and a=67, the closest possible is 45 degrees. How does that happen? \n\nAh, the problem says that in the square, you can create angles of 45 or 90 degrees. For example, in the sample input 4 67, the closest is 45. How is that 45 achieved? Let's see: suppose you take vertices 1, 2, 3. The angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But if you take vertices 1, 3, 2. Then the angle at 2 would be formed by connecting 1 to 2 to 3. Wait, no. Wait, the angle is formed with v2 as the vertex. So for example, if you take vertices 1, 2, 4. Then, the angle at vertex 2 is between the lines from 2 to 1 and 2 to 4. What's that angle?\n\nIn a square, the angle between adjacent vertices (like 2 to 1 and 2 to 3) is 90 degrees. If you take 2 to 1 and 2 to 4, then that's a straight line? No. Wait, in a square, vertices 1, 2, 3, 4 are arranged clockwise. So vertex 2 is connected to 1 and 3. The line from 2 to 4 would be a diagonal. So the angle between 2-1 and 2-4 would be 45 degrees? Let me think. \n\nIn a square, the diagonals split the 90-degree angles into two 45-degree angles. So if you take the angle between the side (from 2 to 1) and the diagonal (from 2 to 4), then that angle is 45 degrees. So yes, that's possible. \n\nSo for that case, the angle is 45 degrees. How does that fit into the formula I thought earlier? Let's think. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2. For example, when v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 4. Then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2 would be the arc from 1 to 4 passing through 3. That's two steps (from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4?), no. Wait, the arc between 1 and 4 not passing through v2 (which is 2) would be the arc from 1 to 4 through 3. That's two edges (from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 is three edges, but if we go from 1 to 4 directly, that's one edge if it's a square? No, in a square, the vertices are connected in order. So the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't pass through 2 is the arc from 1 to 4 via 3. That's two edges (1-2-3-4 is three edges, but the arc from 1 to 4 via 3 is two edges (from 1 to 3 is two steps? Wait, in a square, between 1 and 4, the steps can be either 1 step (if you go the other way around). Wait, maybe the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2 is (n - k), where k is the number of steps between them along the other arc. \n\nAlternatively, for any two vertices, the number of steps between them along the shorter arc is some value. But in this case, the arc that is not containing v2. So for the example where v2 is 2, and v1 is 1 and v3 is 4, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the arc from 1 to 4 through 3. That's two steps (since 1 to 3 is two steps, and 3 to 4 is one step? Wait, no. Wait, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would have to be the arc that skips v2. So for v1=1, v3=4, the arc that doesn't contain v2=2 is the path from 1 to 4 through 3, which is two steps (1 to 3 is two steps? Wait, in the square, the vertices are 1,2,3,4. So the arc from 1 to 4 through 3 is 1->2->3->4? No, that's three steps. Wait, but maybe the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is (n - k), where k is the number of steps between them along the other arc. \n\nLet me think again. For two vertices, the minimal number of steps between them is m, then the other arc would have (n - m) steps. So, for example, in a square (n=4), between 1 and 4, the minimal steps is 1 (since 1 to 4 is adjacent if the square is 1-2-3-4-1?), no. Wait, in a square, each vertex is connected to two others. So 1 is connected to 2 and 4. So between 1 and 4, the minimal steps is 1. The other arc would be 3 steps (1-2-3-4). \n\nSo, in this case, for the angle at v2, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be the longer arc. But how does that relate to the angle? \n\nEarlier idea was that the angle at v2 is equal to half the measure of the arc that is opposite to it. For example, in the case of the square, when v2 is 2, and v1 is 1, v3 is 4. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the longer arc (length 3 steps). The measure of that arc is 3 * (360 / 4) = 270 degrees. Then the angle at v2 would be half of that? Which is 135 degrees. But that's not matching the example. \n\nHmm, that contradicts the earlier example where the angle was 45 degrees. So perhaps my previous approach is wrong. \n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the regular polygon as being inscribed in a circle. Then, the angle at v2 formed by v1 and v3 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Wait, but in the square example, when v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 4. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the arc going from 1 to 4 through 3, which is 270 degrees. Then the angle would be 270/2 = 135 degrees. But according to the example, the angle is 45 degrees. So this can't be right. \n\nHmm, perhaps I have the formula backwards. Maybe the angle is half the measure of the arc that does contain v2. Let's try that. For the same example, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is 90 degrees (since it's 1 step from 1 to 4 via 2). Then the angle at v2 would be 90/2 = 45 degrees. Which matches the example. \n\nYes! So the correct formula is: the angle at v2 is equal to half of the arc between v1 and v3 that does contain v2. \n\nWait, but why? Because in the case of the inscribed angle theorem, the angle formed by two chords (v2v1 and v2v3) would be equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that is opposite to the angle. Which is the arc that does not contain v2. Wait, no, that's the opposite. \n\nWait, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle formed by two chords in a circle is equal to half the measure of the intercepted arc. The intercepted arc is the arc that is opposite to the angle, i.e., the arc that is not containing the angle's vertex. \n\nSo, in the example where the angle is at v2, the intercepted arc is the one that doesn't contain v2. So the angle should be half of that arc. But earlier calculation gave 135 degrees, but the actual angle is 45 degrees. That's conflicting. \n\nWhat's the actual angle in the square example? Let me think of the square. The square is inscribed in a circle. The angle between the two chords (from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3) where v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 4. \n\nThe intercepted arc is the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2. Which is the arc from 1 to 4 through 3. That's 270 degrees. So according to the theorem, the angle at v2 is half of that, which is 135 degrees. But that's not matching the example. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe my understanding of the intercepted arc is incorrect. Let me think again. The angle at v2 is formed by two chords: v2v1 and v2v3. The intercepted arc is the arc between v1 and v3 that is opposite to the angle, i.e., the arc that is not intersected by the angle's sides. \n\nIn this case, if the angle is at v2, then the intercepted arc is the arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2. So for the square example, that's the arc from 1 to 4 through 3, which is 270 degrees. Then the angle at v2 is half of that, which is 135 degrees. But according to the problem's note, when you choose vertices 2, 1, 3 (but wait, no. Wait the example in the note says that in the square, when you take 2 1 3, that's an angle of 45 degrees. Wait, but in that case, the angle is at vertex 1. So the angle is between v1 (vertex 1) and sides connecting to v2 (vertex 2) and v3 (vertex 3). \n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up which vertex is the angle. Let me re-express the problem statement. The angle is formed with v2 as the vertex. So the angle is at v2, and v1 and v3 are on the sides of the angle. So the angle is ∠v1-v2-v3. \n\nIn the example where the square's vertices are 1,2,3,4. If we take v1 as 1, v2 as 2, and v3 as 4. Then the angle is ∠1-2-4. \n\nSo the intercepted arc is between 1 and 4, not containing 2. Which is 270 degrees. Then the angle should be 270/2 = 135 degrees. But according to the problem's note, when the input is 4 67, the answer is 45 degrees. How is that possible?\n\nWait, in the note, the second example is input 4 67. The output is 2 1 3. Which means v1 is 2, v2 is 1, v3 is 3. The angle is ∠2-1-3. \n\nSo, the intercepted arc here is between 2 and 3, not containing v2 (which is 1). Wait, no. The intercepted arc is between v1 (2) and v3 (3) that does not contain v2 (which is 1). So the arc between 2 and 3 not containing 1. Since the polygon is 1,2,3,4. The arc between 2 and 3 not containing 1 is the direct arc from 2 to 3 (length 1 step). The measure is 90 degrees. Then the angle at v2 (which is 1) is 90/2 = 45 degrees. Which matches the example. \n\nAh, okay. So the formula is correct. The angle at v2 is half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. \n\nSo, for the example where v2 is 2, v1 is 1, and v3 is 4, the intercepted arc is between 1 and 4 not containing 2. Which is the arc through 3. Which is 270 degrees. So the angle is 135 degrees. But in the problem's note, when the input is 4 67, the answer is 45 degrees. So how do we get that?\n\nWell, the problem says that in the square, the possible angles are 45 or 90 degrees. So perhaps when the angle is formed by adjacent vertices. For example, taking v1 and v3 as adjacent to v2. \n\nSo, for example, taking v1 as 2, v2 as 1, v3 as 3. The intercepted arc between 2 and 3 not containing v2 (which is 1) is the arc from 2 to 3 directly, which is 1 step. 360/4 = 90 degrees per step. So the arc is 90 degrees. The angle is 45 degrees. Which is correct. \n\nSo, the formula is correct. \n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding, for a given n and a, the value of k (number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2) such that the angle is (k * 360 / n) / 2 = (k * 180)/n degrees. \n\nBut wait, the intercepted arc is between v1 and v3, which is k steps. So the measure of the arc is (k * 360)/n degrees. Then the angle is half that, so (k * 180)/n degrees. \n\nBut how do we find k? Because for a given n and a, we need to choose k such that this angle is as close as possible to a. \n\nBut what are the possible values of k? \n\nLet's think. For any three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3, with v2 being the middle vertex. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be at least 2 steps. Because if it's 1 step, then v2 is adjacent to both v1 and v3. Wait, no. Let me think. For example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the arc between them that does not contain v2 is the rest of the polygon. For example, in a square, if v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 3. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is the arc from 1 to 3 through 4. That's two steps. So k is 2 steps. Then the angle is 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which is the internal angle of the square. \n\nSo, for any three distinct vertices, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be at least 2 steps. Because if they were adjacent (k=1 steps), then that would imply that the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is (n -k) steps. Wait, perhaps the k here is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. \n\nBut how do we determine the possible values of k? For a given n, the possible k values range from 2 to (n-2). Because if the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) is k steps, then the minimal possible is 2 (since they can't be adjacent, otherwise the arc would be 1 step and the other arc would be n-1 steps, but that would require that v2 is on the other arc). \n\nWait, no. Let's think. For any three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be at least 2 steps. Because if the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is 1 step, then v1 and v3 are adjacent. Then, the arc that contains v2 would be n-1 steps. But that would require that v2 is somewhere on the longer arc. \n\nBut how can that happen? For example, in a square, if v1 is 1, v3 is 2, and the arc between them that does not contain v2 is 1 step. But then, v2 can't be on the arc that contains v1 and v3. So this scenario is impossible. Because if v1 and v3 are adjacent, then the arc between them that does not contain v2 would be 1 step only if v2 is not on that arc. Which would require that v2 is on the other arc. But since the arc between v1 and v3 (the one that does not contain v2) is 1 step, then the other arc (which contains v2) must be n-1 steps. So for example, if n=4, v1=1, v3=2. The arc between them not containing v2 is 1 step (from 1 to 2). Then v2 has to be on the other arc, which is 3 steps (from 1 to 2 via 3 and 4). But that's possible. For example, if v2 is 3 or 4. \n\nBut then, in that case, the angle at v2 would be (k * 180)/n, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. So in this case, k is 1, leading to angle (1*180)/4 = 45 degrees. Which is the same as when the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is 3 steps. \n\nBut how is that possible? Because for example, if v1 is 1, v3 is 2, and v2 is 3. Then the angle at v2 is between the lines from 3 to 1 and 3 to 2. What's that angle? \n\nIn a square, the points are arranged as 1,2,3,4. So if v2 is 3, then v1 is 1 and v3 is 2. The angle at 3 between 1 and 2. Let's imagine that. The line from 3 to 1 is a diagonal, and the line from 3 to 2 is a side. The angle between them would be 45 degrees. Which matches the formula. \n\nSo in this case, k can be 1. So the possible values of k are from 1 to (n-2). But wait, when k is 1, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is 1 step. But then, how can that happen? Because that implies that v1 and v3 are adjacent. \n\nSo the possible values of k are from 1 to (n-2), because when you have three distinct vertices, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 can be any length from 1 to (n-2) steps. Because if it's longer than n-2, then it would wrap around. \n\nWait, but for a given n, the maximum number of steps between two vertices along an arc is n-1 steps (for adjacent vertices on the opposite arc). But since we are considering the arc that does not contain v2, then the maximum steps would be n-2. Because if you have three distinct vertices, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 can't be n-1 steps. Because that would require that the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is 1 step, which would mean that v2 is adjacent to both v1 and v3, but that's possible. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me think of the possible values of k. \n\nFor any three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3, there are two arcs between v1 and v3. One of them contains v2, the other doesn't. The length of the arc that doesn't contain v2 is k steps. Then, the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees. \n\nBut for k to be valid, the arc that doesn't contain v2 must be such that v2 is not on that arc. So, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc must be such that when you add the steps between v1 and v2 and between v2 and v3, you get the total steps along the other arc. \n\nBut perhaps instead of worrying about that, we can think that for any k between 1 and (n-2), there exists some configuration of v1, v2, v3 that gives that k. \n\nWait, for example, when k is 1, then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is 1 step. So v1 and v3 are adjacent. Then, v2 is on the other arc, which has (n - k) steps. For example, in a square, n=4, k=1. Then the other arc has 4-1=3 steps. Which would imply that v2 is on that arc. \n\nSo, given that, the possible values of k are 1 ≤ k ≤ n-2. Because when k is n-2, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is n-2 steps. Which would imply that the other arc (containing v2) is 2 steps. So v2 is between v1 and v3 along that arc. \n\nSo the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n degrees. \n\nTherefore, our task is to find the value of k (in the range 1 ≤ k ≤ n-2) such that the angle (k * 180)/n is as close as possible to a. Once we find that k, we need to find any triplet of vertices that corresponds to that k. \n\nBut how do we find the optimal k?\n\nLet me think. For each possible k, compute the angle θ = (k * 180)/n. We want θ to be as close as possible to a. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the integer k (between 1 and n-2) that minimizes |θ - a|. \n\nOnce we find that k, we need to construct a triplet of vertices. \n\nBut how to find this k?\n\nLet me think about solving for k:\n\nWe want to find k such that (k * 180)/n ≈ a → k ≈ (a * n)/180.\n\nBut since k must be an integer between 1 and n-2, we can calculate the optimal k as the nearest integer to (a * n)/180. However, we have to check the floor and ceiling values, since the optimal k may be between two integers. \n\nBut first, let's compute the ideal value of k as (a * n) / 180. Let's call this value k_ideal. Then, the candidates for k are floor(k_ideal), ceil(k_ideal), and possibly others if they are within the range. \n\nBut since we need to find the best k in the range [1, n-2], we can compute k_candidate = round((a * n)/180), and check nearby values. \n\nHowever, there's also the possibility that multiple k's give the same minimal difference. In that case, any of them can be chosen. \n\nOnce we find the optimal k, we need to construct a triplet of vertices. \n\nHow to construct the triplet? Let's think. For a given k, we can choose any v2, and then choose v1 and v3 such that the arc between them (not containing v2) is k steps. \n\nFor example, let's pick v2 as 1. Then, we need to choose v1 and v3 such that the arc between them not containing 1 is k steps. \n\nLet me think. Let's imagine the polygon is numbered 1 to n in clockwise order. Let's choose v2 as 1. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 (which is 1) must be k steps. So, v1 and v3 are positioned such that when you go from v1 to v3 along the arc that doesn't contain 1, there are k steps. \n\nOne way to do this is to select v1 as 2, and v3 as (2 + k) mod n. Wait, but need to make sure that the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain 1 is exactly k steps. \n\nAlternatively, since the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 (which is 1) is k steps, then the arc between them that contains v2 is (n - k) steps. \n\nBut how to find v1 and v3 for a given k and v2. \n\nLet me think of a concrete example. Suppose n=4, k=1. Then, the angle is (1 * 180)/4 = 45 degrees. To form this, we can take v2=3, v1=1, v3=2. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 (3) is 1 step (from 1 to 2). \n\nAnother example: n=4, k=2. Then, angle is 90 degrees. For example, v2=2, v1=1, v3=3. The arc between 1 and 3 not containing 2 is 2 steps (through 4). \n\nSo, for a general k, given v2, how to choose v1 and v3? Well, one approach is to take v1 as v2 + 1 (mod n), and v3 as v1 + k (mod n). Wait, but that may not always work. \n\nAlternatively, for any v2, we can take v1 as v2 + 1, and v3 as v2 + 1 + k. But need to ensure that the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is k steps. \n\nAlternatively, think of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. For example, if we take v2 as the middle vertex, then v1 and v3 are located such that there are k steps between them on the arc that doesn't contain v2. \n\nLet me think of a way to choose v1 and v3 for a given v2 and k. For example, if v2 is fixed, then v1 can be v2 + 1, and v3 can be v2 + 1 + k. But then, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 would be k steps. \n\nBut how to ensure that. Let's take an example. Let's say n=5, v2=2, k=2. Then, v1 = 3 (v2+1), v3 = 3 + 2 = 5. The arc between v1 (3) and v3 (5) that does not contain v2 (2) would be from 3 to 5. Let's see the steps: in a pentagon, the arc from 3 to 5 not containing 2. The vertices are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The arc from 3 to 5 not containing 2 would go through 4. That's 2 steps (3→4→5). So yes, k=2. \n\nSo this seems to work. \n\nSo the general approach is: for a given k, pick v2 as any vertex (say, 1), then set v1 as v2 + 1, and v3 as v1 + k. But need to make sure that v3 is within the range and that the numbering wraps around properly. \n\nBut since the polygon is circular, adding k steps to v1 would give us v3. \n\nBut how to handle wrapping around? For example, if v1 is n, then adding k steps would wrap around. \n\nBut in code, we can represent the vertices as numbers from 1 to n, and for any given v1 and k, v3 = v1 + k. However, if this exceeds n, we need to wrap around. Wait, no. Because the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is k steps. So if v1 is 1, and k is 3 steps, then v3 would be 1 + 3 = 4 (assuming n ≥ 4). \n\nBut in this case, the arc between 1 and 4 not containing v2 (which is 2) would be 3 steps (1→2→3→4?), no. Wait, no. If v2 is 2, then the arc between 1 and 4 that does not contain v2 would be the arc that goes from 1 to 4 through 5, 6, etc. So perhaps my previous approach is flawed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should fix v2 as 1, and then v1 is 2, and v3 is 2 + k. But if 2 + k exceeds n, then wrap around. But how to ensure that the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is exactly k steps. \n\nAlternatively, for a given k, the minimal way to choose v1 and v3 is to take v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + k. But since the polygon is circular, if 2 + k exceeds n, then subtract n. \n\nWait, for example, n=5, k=3. Then 2 + 3 = 5. So v3 is 5. The arc between v1 (2) and v3 (5) that does not contain v2 (1) is steps from 2 to 5 through 3,4. That's 3 steps (2→3→4→5). Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: n=5, k=4. Then 2 + 4 = 6. Which is 1 (since 6 mod 5 is 1). But then the arc between 2 and 1 that does not contain v2 (1)? Wait, no. v2 is 1, so the arc between v1 (2) and v3 (1) that does not contain v2 (1) would be... but v3 is 1. That's the same as v2. Which is invalid. \n\nAh, so this approach is not correct. Because when k is larger than n-2, but in our earlier analysis, k ranges from 1 to n-2. So for n=5, k can be up to 3. \n\nSo, in our code, once we find the optimal k (which is between 1 and n-2), then for that k, we can safely choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + k. \n\nBut for example, if k=3, n=5, then 2 + 3 = 5, which is valid. \n\nIf k=2, then 2+2=4. The arc between 2 and 4 not containing 1 is 2 steps (2→3→4). Correct. \n\nSo this approach works. \n\nSo the triplet",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle formed at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves understanding the geometric properties of regular polygons and efficiently determining the closest possible angle using mathematical calculations.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular n-gon, the angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the number of steps between those vertices along the arc that does not contain the vertex where the angle is formed. This angle can be calculated using the formula: `angle = (k * 180) / n`, where `k` is the number of steps between the two vertices along the arc that does not contain the vertex where the angle is formed.\n\n2. **Finding Optimal k**: For a given angle `a`, we need to determine the integer `k` that minimizes the absolute difference between the calculated angle and `a`. The value of `k` should be in the range [1, n-2].\n\n3. **Constructing the Vertices**: Once the optimal `k` is found, we can construct the vertices such that the angle at one of them is formed using the determined `k`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = int(input[1])\n    \n    # Calculate the ideal k\n    ideal_k = (a * n) / 180.0\n    k_candidates = []\n    for k in [int(ideal_k - 1), int(ideal_k), int(ideal_k + 1)]:\n        if 1 <= k <= n - 2:\n            k_candidates.append(k)\n    # Also check boundaries if needed\n    if len(k_candidates) == 0:\n        k = 1\n    else:\n        # Find the best k among candidates\n        min_diff = float('inf')\n        best_k = 1\n        for k in k_candidates:\n            angle = (k * 180.0) / n\n            diff = abs(angle - a)\n            if diff < min_diff:\n                min_diff = diff\n                best_k = k\n            elif diff == min_diff:\n                if k < best_k:\n                    best_k = k\n        k = best_k\n    \n    # Now construct the triplet\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = v1 + k\n    if v3 > n:\n        v3 -= n\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (the target angle).\n\n2. **Ideal k Calculation**: The ideal value of `k` is calculated based on the formula derived from the geometry of regular polygons. We consider nearby integer values of this ideal `k` to handle cases where the exact value might not be an integer.\n\n3. **Finding the Best k**: Among the candidate values of `k`, we select the one that results in the angle closest to `a`.\n\n4. **Constructing the Triplet**: Using the optimal `k`, we construct the triplet of vertices. Here, we fix `v2` as 1, `v1` as 2, and calculate `v3` based on `k`, ensuring it wraps around correctly within the range of vertices.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the closest possible angle using mathematical insights and ensures the solution adheres to the constraints of the problem.",
