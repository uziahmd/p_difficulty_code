For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes forms a major chord, minor chord, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor definitions.\n\nFirst, let me understand the definitions again. \n\nA major triad has X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3. So total from X to Z is 7. But since the notes are cyclic, I need to calculate the distances properly.\n\nSimilarly, a minor triad requires X to Y is 3 semitones, Y to Z is 4. So total X to Z is 7 as well. Wait, but the order of the notes matters here. The problem says that the triad is unordered, but we can arrange them in some order to check the conditions.\n\nSo for the three notes, I need to check all permutations of them and see if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between two notes?\n\nFirst, I need to map each note to its position in the sequence. Let's list the notes in order:\n\nThe order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the list is cyclic. So the order is:\n\nLet me write them as a list. Let's think about the indexes. Let's assign each note a numerical value. For example:\n\nC is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7, G# is 8, A is 9, B is 10, H is 11. Then, the next note after H (index 11) is C (index 0). \n\nSo the distance between two notes is calculated as (target - start) mod 12, but since the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. Wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is calculated as the number of semitones from X to Y along the scale. So if X is lower than Y, then it's (Y - X) semitones. But if X is higher than Y, then since it's cyclic, the distance would be (Y + 12 - X) semitones? Wait, no. Because the distance is measured as the number of semitones moving upwards. For example, between E and C: the distance is 8 semitones. Let's see. Let's take E as 4, C as 0. If you go from E to C, you can go up by 8 semitones (since E to F is 1, F to F# is 2, etc., up to C is 8 steps). But if you have X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12? No, because if Y is larger than X, then it's Y - X. If Y is smaller, then (Y + 12 - X) ?\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's check. C is 0, E is 4. So 4-0=4. Correct. Between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because E to C is going up by 8 steps (E to F is +1, ..., E to C is 8 steps). So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y is larger than X, else (Y + 12 - X). Which can be written as (Y - X) % 12? Wait, no. Because (Y - X) mod 12 would give the same as (Y - X) if Y >= X, but if Y < X, then (Y - X) mod 12 would be (Y - X + 12). For example, if X is 4 (E) and Y is 0 (C), then Y - X = -4, mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper note. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12. Because when Y is less than X, (Y - X) is negative, mod 12 gives the positive value. So yes, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose X is C (0) and Y is E (4). Then the distance is 4. (Y - X) mod 12 is 4 mod 12 = 4. Correct. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then (Y - X) mod 12 is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. So that's how I can compute the distance between two notes.\n\nSo for any two notes, the distance from X to Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones when moving from X to Y along the scale. So for example, between C and E is 4 semitones. Between E and C is 8 semitones. So the distance depends on the direction. So the way to compute the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But that's not exactly correct. Because for example, if X is C (0) and Y is C (0), the distance is zero. But if X is C and Y is C#, then the distance is 1. So yes, the formula holds.\n\nSo, given that, for three notes, I need to check all possible permutations of them to see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor condition.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For the three notes, there are 6 possible permutations. For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check if the distance from X to Y is 4 and Y to Z is 3 (major), or X to Y is 3 and Y to Z is 4 (minor).\n\nBut since the triad is unordered, perhaps there are multiple permutations that can be checked. However, since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we can check all permutations and see if any of them meet the criteria.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Read the three input notes.\n\n2. Create a mapping from note names to their numerical positions. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, 'D' is 2, etc. So I need to create a dictionary for that.\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of the three notes. Since the order matters for checking the distances.\n\n4. For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\n   a. Compute the distance between X and Y. If it's 4, then check the distance between Y and Z. If that is 3, then it's a major chord.\n\n   b. Similarly, check if the distance between X and Y is 3, and Y to Z is 4. If so, it's a minor chord.\n\n5. If any permutation meets the major condition, output \"major\". Similarly for minor. If none, output \"strange\".\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we can check for all permutations and return the first occurrence, but we need to check all possibilities to see if any of them meet the conditions.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Well, since the three notes can be arranged in any order, but for each permutation, the order is X, Y, Z. So for example, for the three notes A, B, C, there are 6 permutations.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for a major chord, the distances between X and Y is 4, Y and Z is 3. So the total distance from X to Z is 7. But since the notes are cyclic, perhaps there's another way to check. However, for the purposes of checking, perhaps generating permutations is easier.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n- For the three notes, generate all permutations (there are 3! = 6 permutations).\n\n- For each permutation, check if the first two notes have a distance of 4, and the next two have 3. If yes, then it's a major.\n\n- Also check if the first two have a distance of 3 and the next two have 4. If yes, then it's a minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies either condition, then return the corresponding result.\n\nNow, the problem is to code this.\n\nSo first, I need to create a note_to_index dictionary. Let's list the order:\n\nThe notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nSo the order is as follows:\n\nindex 0: C\n\nindex 1: C#\n\nindex 2: D\n\nindex 3: D#\n\nindex 4: E\n\nindex 5: F\n\nindex 6: F#\n\nindex 7: G\n\nindex 8: G#\n\nindex 9: A\n\nindex 10: B\n\nindex 11: H\n\nSo the list is ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'].\n\nSo I can create a dictionary that maps each note to its index.\n\nOnce that's done, for each permutation of the three input notes, I can get their indices and compute the distances.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead the input. The input is three space-separated notes. For example, the first sample input is ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] — but the actual input is a single line with three notes, but in the example, the input is given as a list of three examples. Wait, the problem says that the input is the only line containing 3 space-separated notes. So for example, the first example input is 'C E G' — but in the example given, the input is a list of three examples. But in reality, the input for the code is a single line with three notes. For example, the sample input would be:\n\nC E G\n\nC# B F\n\nA B H\n\nBut perhaps the example shows that for each input case, the output is the corresponding string. But in the problem statement, the input is one line with three notes.\n\nSo the code needs to read a single line, split into three notes.\n\nSo the code will read the input line, split into three notes. For example, in Python:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nThen, for each note in notes, we need to get their index.\n\nNow, for the permutations: in Python, itertools.permutations can generate all permutations of the three elements. So for example, permutations(notes, 3) would give all possible orderings.\n\nBut since the three elements can be in any order, for each permutation, we can check the distances.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\n- Create the note_to_index mapping.\n\n- Read the three notes.\n\n- Generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\n- For each permutation (x, y, z):\n\n   - compute distance between x and y: (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n   - compute distance between y and z: (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n   - if first distance is 4 and second is 3 → major.\n\n   - if first distance is 3 and second is 4 → minor.\n\n- If any permutation meets the major condition, then output 'major'.\n\n- Similarly for minor.\n\n- If none, output 'strange'.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So once any permutation meets the major or minor condition, we can return the corresponding result.\n\nBut how to check all permutations and see if any of them meet the conditions.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can loop through all permutations. For each permutation, check for major and minor. Once any of them is found, return the answer.\n\nBut since there are 6 permutations, it's manageable.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplementing the note_to_index mapping.\n\nLet me create a list of the notes in order.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nThen, the dictionary is:\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nBut need to make sure that the note names are exactly as given. For example, 'C#' is in the list, and 'B' is present, 'H' is present.\n\nNow, for the three input notes, we can get their indices.\n\nNow, for each permutation of the three notes, check the distances.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        print(\"major\")\n        exit()\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        print(\"minor\")\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but this code would check all permutations. But for example, in the first sample input, 'C E G' would have permutations where the order is C, E, G. Then, d1 is (E - C) = 4, d2 is (G - E) = 2? Wait, let me check.\n\nWait, the note indices:\n\nC is 0, E is 4, G is 7.\n\nSo for the permutation (C, E, G):\n\nd1 = (4 - 0) mod 12 = 4 → correct.\n\nd2 = (7 -4) mod 12 = 3 → correct. So yes, this would trigger the major condition.\n\nSo the code would print 'major' and exit.\n\nAnother example: 'C# B F' → the input is C#, B, F. Let's see the permutation B, C#, F.\n\nB is note 'B' which is index 10. C# is index 1. F is index 5.\n\nd1 is (1 - 10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 → 3. Because 1 -10 = -9. Adding 12 gives 3. So d1 is 3. Then d2 is (5 - 1) mod 12 → 4. So that's 3 and 4 → minor. So the code would print 'minor'.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nAnother example: 'A B H' → A is index 9, B is 10, H is 11. Let's check all permutations.\n\nCheck permutation A, B, H:\n\nd1 = (10 -9) mod 12 = 1 → not 3 or 4. So no.\n\nCheck permutation A, H, B:\n\nd1 = (H - A) → 11 -9 = 2 → mod 12 is 2. No.\n\nPermutation B, A, H: d1 is (A - B) → 9 -10 = -1 mod 12 is 11. Not 3 or 4.\n\nPermutation B, H, A: d1 is (H - B) → 11 -10 =1 → mod 12 is 1. No.\n\nPermutation H, A, B: d1 is (A - H) → 9 -11 = -2 mod 12 is 10. No.\n\nPermutation H, B, A: d1 is (B - H) → 10 - 11 = -1 mod 12 is 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output is 'strange'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about other permutations? For example, in the case of the first example, the code checks all permutations, but once it finds one that meets the condition, it exits.\n\nBut for example, in the case of a major chord, there might be multiple permutations that satisfy the condition. But once the first one is found, the code returns.\n\nBut since the problem states that the answer is unambiguous, it's okay.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nWhat if two notes are the same? But according to the problem statement, the input is three notes. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. However, the problem says that the input is a chord, which is a set of three notes. But perhaps the input can have duplicates? Well, the problem says that the input is three notes, but perhaps they can be same. However, according to the problem statement, the answer is always unambiguous. So the code can handle that.\n\nBut for example, if all three notes are same, then the distances would be zero. So no conditions met, output strange.\n\nAnother case: notes that wrap around. For example, C (0), H (11), and E (4). Let's see if any permutation would meet the conditions.\n\nBut perhaps that's handled correctly by the code.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the note_to_index mapping.\n\nBut how to handle the note names. For example, the note 'H' is in the list, but in some other notation, perhaps the input uses 'B' instead of 'H'? No, the problem says that the input is in the given notation. The problem says that the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the input will use these notations. So the code must have the note_to_index mapping correctly.\n\nSo the code can have the list as:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    notes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n    input_notes = input().split()\n    for perm in permutations(input_notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n        y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n        z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n        d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n        d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but the code uses permutations from itertools. So need to import permutations.\n\nSo the code should have:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nBut in the code, the function is written as main(), and the code is called.\n\nTesting this code against the sample input:\n\nSample Input: 'C E G' → output 'major'.\n\nSample Input: 'C# B F' → output 'minor'.\n\nSample Input: 'A B H' → output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut let me test the code for the sample input.\n\nFor the first case, the code would generate permutations. One of them is C, E, G. d1 is 4, d2 is 3 → major. So returns 'major'.\n\nSecond case: 'C# B F' → the permutation B, C#, F. Let's compute:\n\nB is index 10, C# is 1, F is 5.\n\nd1 = (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 = (5 - 1) mod 12 = 4. So yes, minor.\n\nThird case: 'A B H' → permutations. Let's check all permutations:\n\nFor example, A, B, H → d1 is 1 (B - A is 10 -9 = 1), d2 is H - B is 11 - 10 = 1 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B → d1 is H - A: 11 -9 = 2. d2 is B - H: 10 -11 = -1 mod 12 = 11 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H → d1 is A - B → 9-10 = -1 mod 12 = 11. No.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A → d1 is H - B: 11 -10 = 1 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B → d1 is A - H → 9-11 = -2 mod 12 = 10 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A → d1 is B - H → 10 -11 = -1 mod 12 = 11 → no.\n\nSo none, output strange.\n\nThus, the code works for the sample.\n\nAnother test case: what about a minor chord. Let's say the input is B, C#, F. Which is the same as the sample's second input. So the code would find the permutation B, C#, F → d1 is 3, d2 is 4 → minor.\n\nAnother test case: 'C# E G#'. Let's see. Let's check permutations. For example, C#, E, G#. \n\nC# is index 1, E is 4. d1 is 4-1=3. Then E to G# is 8 -4 = 4? Wait, G# is index 8. So E is 4, G# is 8. 8-4=4. So d2 is 4. So that's 3 and 4 → minor. So the code would output minor.\n\nAnother case: 'C E G#'. Let's check. For permutation C, E, G#. d1 is 4, d2 is 8-4=4. So 4 and 4. Not major. Then, check other permutations. Maybe E, G#, C? Let's see:\n\nE is 4, G# is 8 → d1 is 8-4=4. Then C is 0. So d2 is 0 - 8 mod 12 → (0-8) mod 12 is 4? No. (0 -8) is -8 mod 12 is 4? Let me compute: 12 -8 = 4. Yes. So d2 is 4. So 4 and 4 → no. So not major. So this would be strange.\n\nBut maybe another permutation. For example, C, G#, E. Let's see:\n\nd1 is G# - C: 8 - 0 = 8 → no. So not 3 or 4. So no.\n\nSo this would be strange.\n\nAnother test case: 'C# E G' → check if it's major or minor.\n\nC# is 1, E is 4. So distance is 3. Then E to G is 7-4=3. So 3 and 3. Not matching. So no. Any permutation?\n\nCheck permutation E, C#, G. d1 is C# - E: (1 -4) mod 12 is -3 mod 12 = 9. No. Not helpful.\n\nAnother permutation: C#, G, E. d1 is G - C# is 7 -1 = 6. No. So no.\n\nSo this would be strange.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, need to make sure that the note_to_index is correctly built. For example, the order is as per the problem statement.\n\nYes, the code defines the notes_order as ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H'].\n\nWait, the problem says that the notes are ordered as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the code's list is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, considering that the input may have notes in any order, but the code checks all permutations, so it's okay.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor chord based on the distances between the notes in the musical scale.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding position in a predefined list of musical notes. This helps in calculating the distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, check if it meets the criteria for a major or minor chord.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each permutation, compute the distances between consecutive notes using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Determine Chord Type**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major chord (distance of 4 semitones between the first two notes and 3 semitones between the next two), print \"major\". Similarly, check for a minor chord (distance of 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones). If neither is found, print \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    notes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n    input_notes = input().split()\n    \n    for perm in permutations(input_notes):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n        y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n        z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n        \n        d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n        d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n        \n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    \n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Mapping Notes**: The `notes_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its index for quick lookup.\n- **Permutations**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three input notes to check each possible configuration.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale. For example, the distance from note X to Y is computed as `(Y_index - X_index) % 12`.\n- **Chord Check**: For each permutation, we check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major or minor chord. If a match is found, the result is printed immediately. If no valid configuration is found after checking all permutations, \"strange\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical scales.",
