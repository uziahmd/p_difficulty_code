For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that the three notes can be ordered in some way. For a major triad, there must be an ordering where X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3. For minor, it's 3 then 4. So for each possible permutation of the three notes, I need to check if any of those conditions hold.\n\nBut how do I represent the notes and calculate the distances between them?\n\nLet me think about the notes. The order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it cycles back. So each note can be assigned an index from 0 to 11. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H which is 11. Then, the distance between two notes (when moving forward) is (target - start) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So if we have two notes, say, X and Y, the distance between X and Y is calculated as (Y's index - X's index) mod 12? Wait, no. Because if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), the distance is 4 semitones. Which is exactly (4-0) = 4. But if Y is C and X is E, then the distance is (C's index - E's index) mod 12? Wait, no. Because the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance would be (Y + 12 - X) semitones? Or maybe the distance is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12, but considering the direction?\n\nWait, the problem says that between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone. So the distance between C and C# is 1 semitone. Between C and D is 2 semitones, etc. So the distance between X and Y (when X is lower than Y) is (Y's index - X's index). But if X is higher than Y, then the distance would be (Y's index + 12 - X's index) semitones. Wait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because E is 4, C is 0. So the distance from E to C would be (0 + 12 -4) = 8? But how is that determined?\n\nSo, the way to compute the distance between two notes X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? No, because if X is lower than Y, then Y - X is positive. If X is higher than Y, then Y - X is negative, and mod 12 would give the correct positive value. Wait, no. Let's take X as E (4) and Y as C (0). The distance from X to Y is (0 -4) mod 12? That would be 8. Which is correct. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So perhaps the distance is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y - X + 12). But that's equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is from the lower to upper, perhaps the actual calculation is that when you have two notes, the distance is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, otherwise (Y - X + 12). But for the purposes of checking the major and minor triads, we need to find the order of the notes such that the first interval is 4 and the second is 3 (for major) or 3 and 4 (for minor).\n\nBut how do I check all permutations of the three notes?\n\nLet me think: for the three notes, there are 6 possible permutations. For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4 and second to third is 3 (major), or first to second is 3 and second to third is 4 (minor). If any permutation satisfies either condition, then return the corresponding result.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Convert each note into its index (like C=0, C#=1, ..., H=11).\n\n2. Generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\n3. For each permutation, check the distances between first and second, and between second and third.\n\nFor example, for a permutation [X, Y, Z], compute distance between X and Y (d1), and between Y and Z (d2). Then check if d1 is 4 and d2 is 3 (major) or d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 (minor).\n\nIf any permutation meets the major condition, then it's a major chord. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For the three input notes, generate all permutations (since the order matters for checking the intervals).\n\n- For each permutation, check the two intervals.\n\nNow, how to generate permutations. Since the three notes can be arranged in 6 different ways. For example, for notes A, B, C, the permutations are ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.\n\nBut since the problem says that the triad is unordered, but we need to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nSo, for each permutation of the three notes, check the intervals.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, create a mapping from note names to their indices. Let's make a list of the notes in order. Let's see:\n\nThe order is: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"the notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. [...] after H goes C again.\"\n\nSo the list is:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but what about B and H? Because in some notations, B is the same as H? Well, according to the problem statement, the notes are as listed, and H is the last one. So the order is as given.\n\nSo, for each note in the input, we can map it to its index. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, 'D' is 2, etc., 'H' is 11.\n\nSo, the first thing is to create a dictionary that maps note names to their index. Let's create that.\n\nOnce we have the three indices, we can generate all permutations of the three elements. For each permutation, check the two intervals.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between two notes. Let's say for two notes, a and b (their indices). The distance from a to b is (b - a) if b >= a, else (b - a + 12). Or, equivalently, (b - a) % 12. Wait, no. Because for example, if a is 4 (E) and b is 0 (C), then (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which is the correct distance (from E to C is 8 semitones). So yes, the distance from a to b is (b - a) mod 12. Wait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So, the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones you have to move upwards from X to reach Y. So, if X is lower than Y, it's Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then it's (Y + 12 - X). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12. Because (Y - X) mod 12 gives the positive value.\n\nSo, for two notes, the distance between them is (Y - X) mod 12. But for the problem's purposes, when checking the intervals, the order matters. For example, in a major triad, the first interval (X to Y) must be 4 semitones. So for X and Y, the distance from X to Y is 4. So in that case, the code for the distance is (Y - X) mod 12 == 4?\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each permutation of the three notes, check if the first interval is 4 and the second is 3 (for major), or first is 3 and second is 4 (for minor).\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the input: three notes. For example, input could be like ['C E G', 'C# B F', ...] but in the sample input, it's given as a list of strings, but in the actual problem, the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo, for example, the input could be something like \"C E G\" (as in the sample input). So in Python, the code should read the input line, split into three notes.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nnotes_input = input().split()\n\nThen, for each of the three notes, get their index.\n\nOnce we have the three indices, generate all permutations of the three elements.\n\nFor example, if the indices are [a, b, c], then the permutations are all possible orderings of these three elements.\n\nFor each permutation, check:\n\nd1 = (y - x) mod 12, where x is the first note, y is the second.\n\nd2 = (z - y) mod 12, where z is the third note.\n\nIf d1 is 4 and d2 is 3 → major.\n\nIf d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate permutations. In Python, itertools.permutations can be used.\n\nSo, for the three notes, generate all permutations, then for each permutation, check the two intervals.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\n- Create a list of the three note indices.\n\n- Generate all permutations of this list (there are 6 permutations).\n\n- For each permutation (x, y, z):\n\n   compute d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n   compute d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n   check if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → if yes, it's a major.\n\n   check if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → if yes, it's a minor.\n\nOnce any permutation meets the major or minor condition, we can return accordingly.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nFirst, create the note to index mapping.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nBut wait, the note names are as per the problem's description. Let me check:\n\nThe problem says the notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nSo the order is correct. So the indexes are 0 to 11.\n\nSo, the dictionary can be built as:\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nBut wait, the list is:\n\nindexes 0: C, 1: C#, 2: D, 3: D#, 4: E, 5: F, 6: F#, 7: G, 8: G#, 9: A, 10: B, 11: H.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for example, note_to_index['C'] is 0, note_to_index['H'] is 11.\n\nOnce that is done, the code can process the input.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but for each permutation, we check if any of the conditions are met. However, even if multiple permutations meet the same condition, it's enough to find at least one.\n\nBut in code, for example, if any permutation meets the major condition, found_major becomes True. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut what if there are permutations that meet both conditions? According to the problem statement, the answer is unambiguous. So the code can safely check for major first, then minor.\n\nBut in code, for example, if a permutation meets both major and minor conditions? Well, according to the problem statement, that's impossible. Because for a permutation to satisfy both, d1 would have to be 4 and 3 at the same time, which is impossible. So no overlap.\n\nSo the code checks all permutations, and if any of them meets the major condition, then the answer is major. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut wait, the code checks for all permutations. For example, if in one permutation, the major condition is met, then found_major is True. Then, even if another permutation meets the minor condition, the code will output 'major' because found_major is True.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is unambiguous. So the code is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nLet's take the first case: C E G.\n\nIndices: C is 0, E is 4, G is 7.\n\nPermutations:\n\n(0,4,7): d1 = (4-0) mod 12 = 4. d2 = (7-4) mod 12 = 3 → major. So found_major is True.\n\nSo output is major.\n\nSecond case: C# B F.\n\nNotes: C# is 1, B is 10, F is 5.\n\nLooking for permutations. Let's check the permutation (10, 1, 5). Let's see:\n\nd1 is (1 -10) mod 12 → (1-10) is -9 mod 12 → 3. Because 1-10 is -9, adding 12 gives 3. So d1 is 3. Then d2 is (5 -1) mod 12 = 4. So this permutation meets the minor condition. So found_minor is True.\n\nThird case: A B H.\n\nA is 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nCheck all permutations.\n\nFor example, permutation (9, 10, 11): d1 is 1, d2 is 1 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: (9, 11, 10). d1 is (11-9) = 2 mod 12 → 2. d2 is (10 -11) mod 12 → ( -1 ) mod 12 → 11. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: (10, 11, 9). d1 is (11-10)=1, d2 is (9-11) mod 12 → 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (10,9,11). d1 is (9-10) mod 12 → 11. d2 is (11-9) = 2. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (11, 9, 10). d1 is (9-11) mod 12 → 10. d2 is (10 -9) = 1. No.\n\nAnother permutation: (11, 10, 9). d1 is (10-11) mod 12 → 11. d2 is (9-10) mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output is strange.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what about when the same note appears multiple times? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is three notes. But the problem says that a chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, the input is three notes. But the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So the code can assume that the three notes are distinct? Or not?\n\nBut the problem says that the input is three notes. So for example, if the input is C C C, then the code would generate permutations of (0,0,0). Then, for each permutation, d1 would be 0, d2 0. So no match. So output is strange.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is always unambiguous. So the code can proceed regardless.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code is correct.\n\nBut what about the note names? For example, 'B' and 'H'? According to the problem statement, the notes are as given, and the code uses the note_to_index mapping correctly.\n\nAnother test case: the second sample input, 'C# B F' → the code converts to indices 1, 10, 5. Let's look for permutations. One of the permutations is (10, 1, 5). Let's compute d1 and d2:\n\nd1 is (1 - 10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Because 12 -9 = 3. Then d2 is (5 -1) mod 12 → 4. So yes, this is minor.\n\nSo the code will find that.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in Python, the code needs to read the input, split into three notes, then process.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    notes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n    \n    input_notes = input().split()\n    indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n    \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n    \n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple permutations that meet the same condition? For example, if two permutations meet the major condition, but the code already sets found_major to True once, so it's okay.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input: 'C E G' → output 'major'\n\nSample Input: 'C# B F' → output 'minor'\n\nSample Input: 'A B H' → output 'strange'\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's take 'C E G#'. Let's see:\n\nC is 0, E is 4, G# is 8.\n\nCheck permutations. For example, 0,4,8. d1 is 4, d2 is 4. So not major. For major, need d1=4 and d2=3. Let's see if any permutation meets that.\n\nAnother permutation: 0, 8, 4. d1 is (8-0) mod 12 = 8. d2 is (4-8) mod 12 → 8. No.\n\nAnother permutation: 4, 0, 8. d1 is (0-4) mod 12 → 8. No.\n\nAnother permutation: 4, 8, 0. d1 is 4 → 8-4=4. d2 is (0-8) mod 12 = 4. So 4 and 4. No.\n\nAnother permutation: 8, 0, 4. d1 is 0-8 mod 12 → 4. d2 is 4-0 mod 12 → 4. So again 4 and 4. No.\n\nAnother permutation: 8,4,0. d1 is 4-8 mod 12 → ( -4 ) mod 12 → 8. No.\n\nSo no major or minor. So output 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: 'C# E G' → let's see.\n\nC# is 1, E is 4, G is 7. So permutations:\n\nCheck 1,4,7 → d1 is 3 (4-1=3), d2 is 3 (7-4=3). No. Not minor. For minor, need d1=3 and d2=4. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: 1,7,4. d1 is 7-1=6. d2 is 4-7 = -3 mod 12 is 9. No.\n\nAnother permutation: 4,1,7. d1 is (1-4) mod 12 = 9. No.\n\nAnother permutation: 4,7,1. d1 is 3, d2 is (1-7) mod 12 = 6. No.\n\nAnother permutation: 7,1,4. d1 is 1-7 mod 12 → 6. No.\n\nAnother permutation: 7,4,1. d1 is 4-7 mod 12 → 9. No.\n\nSo output strange.\n\nAnother test case: 'C E G' → major.\n\nAnother test case: 'C Eb G' → but wait, the note names are as per the problem. So Eb is not present. The notes are C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So Eb is not present. So the code assumes that the input is valid. So the code can process the input as given.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given triad of musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for a major or minor chord based on semitone distances.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in a predefined list of musical notes. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between notes.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes.

Use modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Determine Chord Type**: Check if any permutation meets the criteria for a major chord (4 semitones followed by 3 semitones) or a minor chord (3 semitones followed by 4 semitones).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\ndef main():\n    notes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    note_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n    \n    input_notes = input().split()\n    indices = [note_to_index[note] for note in input_notes]\n    \n    found_major = False\n    found_minor = False\n    \n    for perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        d1 = (y - x) % 12\n        d2 = (z - y) % 12\n        if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n            found_major = True\n        if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n            found_minor = True\n    \n    if found_major:\n        print(\"major\")\n    elif found_minor:\n        print(\"minor\")\n    else:\n        print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `notes_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its corresponding index for easy distance calculation.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into individual notes, which are then converted to their respective indices.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three notes are generated. For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Chord Classification**: The distances are checked against the criteria for major and minor chords. If any permutation meets the criteria for a major chord, the result is set to \"major\". Similarly, if any permutation meets the criteria for a minor chord, the result is set to \"minor\".
