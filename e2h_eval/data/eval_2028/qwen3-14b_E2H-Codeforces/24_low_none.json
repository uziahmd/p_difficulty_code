She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. Let's think about how she can do this optimally.\n\nFirst, the initial setup: there are n tabs, and the mouse is at position pos. The goal is to have only tabs from l to r open. So any tabs outside this range need to be closed. But how?\n\nEach second, she can move left or right, or close tabs to the left or right. Closing tabs to the left or right requires that she is at a certain position. For example, if she wants to close all tabs to the left, she needs to be at the leftmost tab (or maybe not? Wait, no. Wait, the description says that when she closes tabs to the left, it's all tabs from a (the current min) to i-1. So, when she closes to the left, she must be at some position i, and then all tabs from a to i-1 are closed. But after closing, the new a would be i, since those tabs are closed. Similarly for closing to the right.\n\nBut the problem is that when you close tabs, the a and b values change. But perhaps the optimal way is to close all tabs to the left of the desired range and all tabs to the right. But how to get to the positions where you can perform these closes.\n\nLet me think. The desired range is [l, r]. So, the tabs that need to be closed are those less than l and those greater than r.\n\nSo, Luba needs to close all tabs to the left of l (if any), and all tabs to the right of r (if any). But how to do that efficiently.\n\nLet me consider the steps required:\n\nCase 1: If the current position is already within [l, r], and the entire range is already open. Then, maybe no steps are needed. Like the third example where l=1, r=5, and n=5. So the answer is 0.\n\nBut if the current position is inside [l, r], but there are tabs outside that need to be closed, then she needs to close them.\n\nFor example, in the second example input: 6 3 1 3. So the desired range is 1-3. The current position is 3. She can close all tabs to the right (since they are 4,5,6). So she just needs to do that once. So that's 1 second.\n\nSo the key is to find the minimal steps required to reach positions where she can close the left and right parts.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios:\n\nFirst, determine whether the current position is already in the [l, r] range. If not, then she needs to move to a position where she can close the tabs outside the desired range.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to first close all tabs to the left of l, and then close all tabs to the right of r. Or the other way around. Or maybe do both in one step if possible.\n\nWait, but closing tabs to the left or right requires being at a certain position. For example, to close all tabs to the left of l, she needs to be at position l. Because then, closing all tabs to the left (from a to i-1) would close everything up to l-1. Similarly, to close the right part, she needs to be at position r, then close to the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can close the left part by moving to the leftmost tab (like l) and then closing left, but that depends on the current position.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nIf there are tabs to the left of l (i.e., l > 1), then she needs to close them. To do that, she must be at position l. Then, closing to the left (which would close all tabs from a (initially 1) to l-1). Similarly for the right side: if r < n, then she needs to be at r, and close to the right.\n\nSo, the steps would involve moving to l (if needed), closing left, moving to r (if needed), closing right. But perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nBut what if l is 1, then there's nothing to close on the left. Similarly for r =n.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n\nWe need to close left (if necessary) and close right (if necessary). Each of these actions requires that the cursor is at the correct position (l for left closing, r for right closing). So, the time is the time to move to l (if needed), plus 1 second to close left, plus time to move to r (if needed), plus 1 second to close right.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to do this more optimally. For example, if",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified range [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos` in a browser with `n` tabs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: Determine if there are tabs to the left of `l` and to the right of `r` that need to be closed.\n2. **Cursor Movement**: Calculate the time required to move the cursor to the positions where Luba can efficiently close the tabs. Specifically, she needs to be at position `l` to close tabs to the left of `l` and at position `r` to close tabs to the right of `r`.\n3. **Closing Tabs**: Each closing operation (left or right) takes 1 second. If there are no tabs to close on either side, the respective steps are skipped.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Determine if we need to close left and right\nclose_left = l > 1\nclose_right = r < n\n\ntime = 0\n\n# If need to close left, move to l and close\nif close_left:\n    # Time to move from pos to l\n    time += abs(pos - l)\n    # Close left\n    time += 1\n\n# If need to close right, move to r and close\nif close_right:\n    # Time to move from current position (after possible left move) to r\n    # If we closed left, current position is l, else it's pos\n    if close_left:\n        time += abs(l - r)\n    else:\n        time += abs(pos - r)\n    # Close right\n    time += 1\n\nprint(time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Identify Tabs to Close**: We check if `l` is greater than 1 (indicating tabs to the left need closing) and if `r` is less than `n` (indicating tabs to the right need closing).\n2. **Cursor Movement**: Calculate the time required to move the cursor from its initial position `pos` to `l` (if needed) and then to `r` (if needed). The movement time is the absolute difference between the current position and the target position.\n3. **Closing Operations**: Each closing operation (left or right) takes exactly 1 second. These operations are performed after moving the cursor to the appropriate positions.\n\nThis approach ensures that we minimize the total time by efficiently moving the cursor and performing the necessary closing operations in the optimal order.",
