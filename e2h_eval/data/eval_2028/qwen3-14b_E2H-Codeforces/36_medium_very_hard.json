The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The problem is about calculating the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 50% chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what conditions the tower placements must satisfy for such a configuration to be possible. Let's think about the constraints:\n\nFor each town i (from 1 to n), exactly one tower's signal covers it. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower.\n\nLet me think about how the towers can be arranged. Suppose there are some towers placed. How can we assign their signal powers?\n\nEach tower's signal power p must be such that it covers some range. For example, a tower at position i with power p covers positions from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. Wait, the problem says |c - i| < p. So the range is i - p + 1 to i + p - 1? Because if |c -i| < p, then c can be from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). So the length of coverage is 2(p-1) + 1 = 2p-1. But the exact coverage depends on the power.\n\nBut the key thing is that each town must be covered exactly once. Also, the coverage of the towers must not reach 0 or n+1.\n\nSo, for the entire setup, the way the towers are placed must allow for a partitioning of the towns 1..n into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower. And each tower's coverage must not reach beyond the allowed areas.\n\nWait, perhaps the towers must be arranged such that they form a valid \"partition\" where each tower covers a certain range, and those ranges don't overlap except at the edges. But since each town must be covered exactly once, the ranges must be non-overlapping except possibly at the boundaries (but even then, overlapping would cause multiple coverage).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the towers must be placed in such a way that they form a set of intervals that exactly cover 1..n, with each interval being covered by a single tower, and each tower's coverage doesn't extend beyond the required areas.\n\nLet me think of an example. Take n=2. The valid case is when both towns 1 and 2 have towers. Then each can have power 1. Their coverage is 1-1=0 (so town 0 isn't covered), and for town 1, coverage is 1-0 to 1+0 = 1 (since p=1, |c-i| <1 implies c=i). Similarly for town 2. Thus, towns 1 and 2 are covered once each. Town 0 and 3 (n+1) are not covered. So that's valid.\n\nAnother example: if only town 2 has a tower. Then the tower can have power 2. Then its coverage is |c-2| < 2 → c can be 0,1,2,3. But town 0 and 3 are not allowed to be covered. So this is invalid. Wait, but the problem says that towns 0 and n+1 must not get any signal. So in this case, the tower in town 2 with power 2 would cover town 0 (which is not allowed). Therefore, this is invalid. Hence, the only valid case for n=2 is when both towns 1 and 2 have towers.\n\nSo the valid configurations are those where the towers can be arranged in such a way that their coverage regions exactly cover 1..n, without overlapping, and not covering 0 or n+1.\n\nHmm. How can we model this? Let's think recursively. Maybe the problem is similar to tiling or dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think about the necessary conditions for the tower placements. For each tower, the signal power must be such that:\n\n- The tower at position i must have a power p_i such that:\n\n   - The leftmost town covered by this tower is i - p_i + 1 (wait, no. For a tower at i with power p, the coverage is all towns c where |c - i| < p. That's equivalent to i - p + 1 ≤ c ≤ i + p - 1. So for example, if p=1, then c must be exactly i. If p=2, then c can be i-1, i, i+1. So the coverage is from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1).\n\nBut for the coverage to not reach town 0, the leftmost town covered by a tower at i must be ≥1. So for the tower at i, the leftmost coverage is i - (p-1) ≥ 1. Which implies p-1 ≤ i -1 → p ≤ i. Similarly, the rightmost coverage is i + p -1 ≤ n. Because town n+1 must not be covered. So i + p -1 ≤ n → p ≤ n - i + 1.\n\nSo for any tower, the maximum possible power is min(i, n - i + 1). But how does this help?\n\nBut perhaps the key idea is that the towers must be arranged in a way that allows for a partition of the towns into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower. Each such interval must be covered by a tower located at the center of the interval, and the power is set such that the interval is exactly covered.\n\nWait, for example, if there's a tower at position i that covers towns from a to b, then the tower's power must be such that a = i - p + 1 and b = i + p -1. So the length of the interval is 2p -1. But since the interval must be from a to b, which is exactly covered by the tower. Also, the tower's position is at the center of the interval.\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems that the arrangement of towers must form a set of non-overlapping intervals that exactly cover 1..n, and each interval has a tower in the middle. But how?\n\nThis sounds similar to the problem of domino tiling or other tiling problems. Alternatively, think of the towers as being placed in such a way that each tower is responsible for a certain range, and these ranges do not overlap.\n\nLet me think about the structure of such a valid configuration. Suppose that the towers are placed in positions such that between any two consecutive towers, there's a certain distance. For example, if there's a tower at position i and the next tower at position j, then the region between them must be covered by one of them. However, since each town must be covered exactly once, the coverage of the first tower must end before the next tower's coverage starts. Or perhaps the two towers' coverage regions are adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each tower's coverage must exactly cover a certain segment of towns. For example, if a tower is placed at position i, it could be responsible for covering towns from i - k to i + k, but then that requires that the next tower is placed at i + k + 1, etc. But this seems too restrictive.\n\nWait, but the problem allows varying signal powers. So perhaps the key is that the towers must be arranged in such a way that for each tower, there is a segment of towns that it covers, and these segments are non-overlapping and cover all towns 1..n. Also, the segments must not reach 0 or n+1.\n\nAnother approach: For a valid configuration, the towers must form a set of positions such that there is a way to assign to each tower a radius (signal power) so that:\n\n- The union of their coverage regions is exactly {1,2,...,n}.\n\n- No two coverage regions overlap (since each town is covered exactly once).\n\n- The coverage regions do not include 0 or n+1.\n\nThis seems like a partition of the towns into intervals, each covered by a single tower. Let's think about the possible ways to partition the towns into such intervals.\n\nEach interval must be covered by exactly one tower, which is located at the center of the interval. Because if the tower is at position i, and the interval is [a, b], then the maximum distance from i to either end is (b - i) = (i - a). So the radius must be (b - i) + 1? Or wait, the radius p must satisfy that the coverage includes all towns from a to b, and that the coverage does not extend beyond a-1 or b+1.\n\nFor example, suppose the interval [a, b] is covered by a tower at position i. Then, the maximum distance from i to a is i - a. Similarly, the maximum distance from i to b is b - i. The radius p must be such that p > max(i - a, b - i). Because for the tower to cover a and b, |a - i| < p and |b - i| < p. So p must be greater than both (i - a) and (b - i). Therefore, the minimal p is max(i - a, b - i) + 1. But since the coverage is exactly [a, b], then the radius must be chosen so that the coverage stops at a and b. So for example, if the tower is at i, and the interval is [a, b], then the radius must be such that:\n\na = i - p + 1\n\nand \n\nb = i + p - 1.\n\nWhich implies that a + b = 2i. Therefore, the interval [a, b] must be symmetric around i. Hence, the length of the interval is 2p -1, and the tower is at the center of the interval.\n\nThis suggests that each interval must be of odd length, centered at the tower's position. Therefore, for the entire problem, the towns must be partitioned into intervals of odd lengths, each centered at a tower. And each tower must be present in the set of built towers.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets of towns {1..n} such that the subset can be partitioned into intervals of odd lengths, each centered at a tower. And each such interval must not extend beyond town 0 or n+1.\n\nWait, but the tower is in the middle of the interval. For example, an interval of length 1 (just the tower itself) is allowed. For an interval of length 3, the tower is at position i, and covers i-1, i, i+1. So the interval [i-1, i+1], which is length 3. For the entire problem, the intervals must be such that:\n\n- The first interval starts at 1. So for the first interval, if the tower is at position i, then the left end is i - p + 1 = 1. Also, the right end is i + p - 1. But since the tower is at the center, the interval must be symmetric around i. So for example, if the first interval is of length l (odd), then the tower is at position (1 + (1 + l -1 )) / 2 = (1 + l)/2. So l must be odd.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nThis seems similar to tiling the line with tiles of odd lengths. For example, each tile is of length 2k+1, which is covered by a tower at the center. The total length of all tiles must be n.\n\nBut the problem is that the towers must be present in the subset. So for each tile of length l (odd), the tower is at the center. So the presence of the tower is required. Therefore, the subset of towers must be exactly the centers of these tiles.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets of towns that can be partitioned into tiles of odd lengths, each centered at a tower. Then, the total number of valid configurations is equal to the number of such subsets, multiplied by 1/(2^n) (since each tower is built with probability 1/2).\n\nBut how to compute the number of such subsets?\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem. Let's denote dp[i] as the number of valid ways to arrange towers for the first i towns (positions 1..i). Then, the recurrence relation can be derived based on the possible choices for the last tile.\n\nFor example, for dp[i], the last tile could be of length 1 (so the tower is at position i), or length 3 (tower at i-1, covering positions i-1-1, i-1, i-1+1?), wait no. Wait, if the last tile is of length l, then it ends at position i. For example, if the tile is of length 1, then it's just the tower at i. If the tile is of length 3, then the tower is at i-1, and the tile covers positions i-1-1 (i-2), i-1, i-1 +1 (i). So the tile ends at i. Similarly, a tile of length 5 would end at i, with the tower at i-2, covering positions i-2-2 = i-4 to i-2 + 2 = i.\n\nTherefore, for dp[i], the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k=0}^{...} dp[i - (2k + 1)] ?\n\nWait, for each possible tile ending at i, which has length 2k + 1. The length is 2k + 1, so the previous part is up to i - (2k + 1) + 1? Or perhaps:\n\nIf the last tile has length l = 2k + 1, then it starts at position i - l + 1, ends at i. The center is at i - l + 1 + k = i - l + 1 + (l-1)/2 = i - (l-1)/2. Since l = 2k + 1, then (l-1)/2 = k. So the center is at i - k. Which is the same as the position i - k. For example, if l = 1, then k=0, the center is i-0 = i. Which makes sense. For l=3, k=1, the center is i -1.\n\nSo for each possible k ≥ 0, such that the center position is i -k, and the tile starts at (i -k) - k = i - 2k. The start of the tile is i - 2k. Since the start must be ≥1, then i - 2k ≥ 1 → k ≤ (i-1)/2.\n\nBut for the DP, the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k=0}^{floor((i-1)/2)} dp[i - 2k - 1] ?\n\nWait, because the tile of length 2k+1 ends at i. So the previous part is up to i - (2k+1) positions. Wait, the previous part is up to (i - (2k+1)) + 1? Or no. Because the tile starts at i - (2k+1) + 1? Wait, no. The tile is of length l=2k+1, which ends at i. So the start is i - l + 1 = i - (2k+1) + 1 = i - 2k. So the previous part is up to i - 2k - 1. Because the tile starts at i - 2k, and the previous part is up to i - 2k - 1.\n\nThus, the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k} dp[i - 2k - 1], where the sum is over all k such that i - 2k - 1 ≥ 0.\n\nBut wait, when the tile starts at i - 2k, and ends at i. So for the DP, the previous state is dp[i - 2k - 1 + 1] ? No, the previous state is dp[i - 2k - 1] ?\n\nWait, the DP[i] represents the number of ways to cover the first i towns. If the last tile is of length 2k+1, then the first i - (2k+1) towns are covered in dp[i - (2k+1)] ways, and then we add the tile of length 2k+1. So the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k} dp[i - (2k + 1)] for all valid k.\n\nBut what's the base case?\n\nFor i=0, dp[0] = 1 (empty set). For i=1, the only possibility is to have a tile of length 1 (k=0), so dp[1] = dp[0] = 1.\n\nLet me test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: n=2.\n\nWe want dp[2]. Let's compute dp[0] =1, dp[1] =1.\n\nFor dp[2], the possible k values are such that 2k+1 ≤ 2. So possible k:\n\nk=0: 2k+1=1. Then i - (2k+1) = 2-1=1. So dp[1] =1.\n\nk=1: 2k+1=3>2, invalid.\n\nSo dp[2] = dp[1] =1.\n\nBut according to the sample input, for n=2, the answer is 1/4. The total number of valid subsets is 1 (the subset {1,2}).\n\nThe total number of possible subsets is 2^2=4. So the probability is 1/4, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: n=3. According to the note, the answer is 1/4. Let's see.\n\nFor n=3, the valid subsets are:\n\nCase 1: {2} (only the middle tower). Then the tile is length 3 (covers 1,2,3). So dp[3] would be sum over k where 2k+1 <=3. For k=0: 1, so dp[3-1] = dp[2] =1. For k=1: 2k+1=3, so dp[3-3] = dp[0] =1. So total dp[3] = 1+1=2.\n\nSo the number of valid subsets is 2. The total possible subsets is 8. So the probability is 2/8=1/4, which matches the sample. So this seems correct.\n\nSo the DP approach seems to model the number of valid subsets correctly.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing dp[n], where dp[i] is the number of valid subsets for the first i towns. Then, the answer is dp[n] / 2^n, modulo 998244353.\n\nBut how to compute dp[i] efficiently for large n (up to 2e5)?\n\nThe recurrence is dp[i] = sum_{j} dp[i - j], where j is an odd number (since j=2k+1, which is odd). But for each i, the possible j's are the odd numbers that are ≤i.\n\nBut this would be O(n^2) if we do it naively. For n=2e5, that's impossible.\n\nWe need to find a way to compute dp[i] efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence again. For dp[i], the sum is over all odd numbers j ≤i. So dp[i] = sum_{j is odd, j ≤i} dp[i-j].\n\nBut this can be rewritten as:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k=0}^{floor((i-1)/2)} dp[i - (2k+1)].\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find a recurrence that allows O(1) or O(n) time.\n\nLet me look for a pattern in dp[i].\n\nCompute dp[0] = 1.\n\ndp[1] = dp[0] = 1.\n\ndp[2] = dp[1] = 1.\n\ndp[3] = dp[2] + dp[0] = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\ndp[4] = sum over j=1,3 (since 1 and 3 are odd ≤4):\n\ndp[4-1] + dp[4-3] = dp[3] + dp[1] = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\ndp[5] = dp[4] + dp[2] + dp[0] = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5.\n\ndp[6] = dp[5] + dp[3] + dp[1} = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\nHmm, this looks familiar. The sequence seems like the Fibonacci numbers, but let's see:\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\ndp[0] = 1\n\ndp[1] = 1\n\ndp[2] = 1\n\ndp[3] = 2\n\ndp[4] = 3\n\ndp[5] = 5\n\ndp[6] = 8\n\ndp[7] = dp[6] + dp[4] + dp[2} + dp[0} ?\n\nWait for dp[7], the sum is over j=1,3,5,7.\n\nSo dp[7] = dp[6] + dp[4] + dp[2] + dp[0} = 8 +3 +1 +1 = 13.\n\nWhich is the Fibonacci sequence again. Wait, dp[0] = 1, dp[1] =1, dp[2]=1, dp[3] = 2, dp[4]=3, dp[5]=5, dp[6]=8, dp[7]=13, etc. This looks like the Fibonacci numbers starting from index 0, but shifted.\n\nIn particular, the sequence seems to be the Fibonacci numbers where dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2], but wait:\n\nFor example, dp[3] = 2 = dp[2] + dp[1} = 1 +1 = 2. Yes.\n\ndp[4] = 3 = dp[3] + dp[2} = 2 +1 = 3.\n\ndp[5] = 5 = dp[4] + dp[3} = 3 +2 =5.\n\ndp[6] = 8 = dp[5] + dp[4} =5 +3 =8.\n\nYes! So the recurrence simplifies to dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2} ?\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause the original recurrence was dp[i] = sum_{j odd} dp[i-j}.\n\nBut if we look at the sum for dp[i], it's equal to dp[i-1] + dp[i-2} ?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that for each i, the sum over all odd j (j=1,3,5,...) of dp[i-j} equals dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} ?\n\nLet me think for i≥2.\n\nLet me write the sum S = sum_{k} dp[i - (2k+1)} where 2k+1 ≤i. Let's substitute m = i - (2k+1) → 2k+1 = i -m. So for each m, 2k+1 = i -m. Since 2k+1 is odd, i -m must be odd. So m must have parity opposite to i. So m can be any integer such that m ≤ i-1 and m has parity different from i.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, looking at the earlier examples, it seems that the sum S equals dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} ?\n\nWait, for i=3:\n\nsum is dp[2] + dp[0} = 1 +1 = 2 = dp[2} + dp[1} = 1 +1 = 2. Which is yes.\n\nFor i=4, sum is dp[3} + dp[1} = 2 +1 =3 = dp[3} + dp[2} = 2+1=3.\n\nFor i=5: sum is dp[4} + dp[2} + dp[0} = 3 +1 +1 =5 = dp[4} + dp[3} =3+2=5.\n\nSo yes, the sum over all odd j is equal to dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} ?\n\nSo the recurrence for dp[i] is dp[i] = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} ?\n\nBut why?\n\nLet me think about the sum S = sum_{j odd} dp[i-j} = sum_{j odd} dp[i-j}.\n\nBut j can be written as 1, 3, 5, ... up to i if i is odd.\n\nNow, note that the sum of dp[i-j} for j odd is equal to the sum of dp[k} for k = i-1, i-3, i-5, ... down to 0 or 1, depending on i's parity.\n\nBut if I think about the sum of dp[k} for all k < i where k has parity different from i.\n\nBecause for j odd, i-j has parity i - odd. So if i is even, i-j is even minus odd = odd. If i is odd, i-j is odd minus odd = even. So the sum S is the sum of dp[k} where k has parity different from i, and k < i.\n\nBut how does that relate to dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} ?\n\nLet me think about the following: Let me define for each i, the sum of dp[k} for k < i where k is even (if i is odd) or odd (if i is even). But this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the sum for dp[i} is equal to the sum of dp[i-1} (since j=1 is allowed, which gives i-j = i-1) plus the sum for all other j's. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider that dp[i} = sum_{j odd} dp[i-j} = sum_{m} dp[m} where m = i-j and j is odd. Which implies that m = i - j, and j is odd. So j = i -m, which is odd. So i -m must be odd. Which means that m and i have different parities.\n\nThus, the sum S is equal to the sum of dp[m} for all m < i where m has parity different from i.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nIf i is even, then m must be odd and less than i.\n\nIf i is odd, then m must be even and less than i.\n\nSo the sum S is equal to:\n\nif i is even: sum_{m odd < i} dp[m}\n\nif i is odd: sum_{m even < i} dp[m}\n\nNow, let's consider the recurrence for dp[i}.\n\nLet me think about the sum for i and i-1.\n\nFor example, consider dp[i} and dp[i-1}.\n\nFor i even:\n\nsum_{m odd <i} dp[m} = sum_{m odd <i} dp[m} \n\nBut for i-1 (which is odd), the sum for dp[i-1} is sum_{m even <i-1} dp[m} \n\nBut how to relate these sums?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that the total sum of dp[0} to dp[i-1} is T[i} = T[i-1} + dp[i-1}.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following:\n\nLet me consider that for any i ≥ 2, dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2}.\n\nAssuming this recurrence holds, then the sequence is the Fibonacci numbers, with dp[0} = 1, dp[1} = 1, dp[2} = 1, dp[3} = 2, etc. Which seems to fit the earlier examples.\n\nBut why would this recurrence hold?\n\nLet me try to prove it by induction.\n\nBase cases:\n\ni=2: dp[2} = 1. According to recurrence, dp[2} = dp[1} + dp[0} = 1 +1 = 2? No, which contradicts. Wait, earlier calculation said dp[2} is 1. So there's a contradiction here. What's wrong?\n\nWait, earlier calculation said dp[2} = dp[1} = 1. But according to the recurrence dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2}, dp[2} would be 1 + 1 = 2. Which is not matching. So my previous assumption was wrong.\n\nWait, but earlier examples showed that dp[3} = dp[2} + dp[1} = 1 + 1 = 2. dp[4} = dp[3} + dp[2} = 2 +1 =3. dp[5} = 3+2=5. dp[6} = 5+3=8. But dp[2} is 1. So the recurrence dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} holds for i≥3, but not for i=2.\n\nSo perhaps the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} for i ≥ 3, with dp[0}=1, dp[1}=1, dp[2}=1.\n\nLet me check for i=3: dp[3} = dp[2} + dp[1} = 1 +1 =2. Correct.\n\ni=4: dp[3} + dp[2} = 2+1=3. Correct.\n\ni=5: 3+2=5. Correct.\n\nSo the recurrence holds for i≥3. But what about for i=2?\n\nWell, according to the original sum, dp[2} = sum of dp[2-j} for j odd ≤2. The possible j is 1. So dp[2-1} = dp[1} =1. So yes, dp[2} =1. Which is not equal to dp[1} + dp[0} = 1+1=2. So the recurrence is different for i=2.\n\nBut how to find the general recurrence.\n\nLet me think again about the sum S = sum_{m} dp[m}, where m has parity different from i and m <i.\n\nLet me denote that for even i:\n\nS_even = sum_{m odd <i} dp[m}\n\nFor odd i:\n\nS_odd = sum_{m even <i} dp[m}\n\nThen, dp[i} = S_even if i is even, and S_odd if i is odd.\n\nNow, let's think about the relation between S_even and S_odd.\n\nLet me think for i and i-1.\n\nFor example, if i is even:\n\ndp[i} = S_even (sum of odd m <i).\n\nBut for i-1, which is odd, dp[i-1} = sum of even m <i-1} = sum of even m <i-1}.\n\nBut the sum of even m <i is equal to sum of even m <i-1} (if i is even, then i-1 is odd, and even m <i-1} is same as even m <i except for m = i-1 if i-1 is even. But since i is even, i-1 is odd, so there is no such m. Therefore, sum of even m <i} is same as sum of even m <i-1}.\n\nBut what about sum of even m <i}?\n\nIt's equal to dp[i-1} (since for i-1, which is odd, dp[i-1} is sum of even m <i-1}).\n\nBut for even i, the sum of even m <i} is sum_{even m <i} dp[m} = sum_{even m <i-1} dp[m} + (if i is even, then i-1 is odd, and m=i-1 is not even. So no addition). So sum_even_i = sum_even_{i-1}.\n\nSimilarly, for odd i:\n\nsum_odd_i = sum_{even m <i} dp[m} = sum_even_i.\n\nBut for i-1 (even), dp[i-1} = sum_odd_{i-1} = sum_{odd m <i-1} dp[m}.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed. Let's think of the following:\n\nLet me define for each i ≥0:\n\nA[i} = sum_{k=0}^i dp[k} where k is even.\n\nB[i} = sum_{k=0}^i dp[k} where k is odd.\n\nThen, for i even:\n\ndp[i} = B[i-1} (since sum of odd m <i} is B[i-1}).\n\nFor i odd:\n\ndp[i} = A[i-1} (sum of even m <i} is A[i-1}).\n\nSo for example, when i is even:\n\ndp[i} = B[i-1}.\n\nWhen i is odd:\n\ndp[i} = A[i-1}.\n\nNow, let's see how A and B evolve.\n\nA[i} = A[i-1} + (dp[i} if i is even else 0).\n\nSimilarly, B[i} = B[i-1} + (dp[i} if i is odd else 0).\n\nBut we can also express A[i} and B[i} in terms of previous terms.\n\nLet me think for i ≥1:\n\nIf i is even:\n\nA[i} = A[i-1} + dp[i}.\n\nBut dp[i} = B[i-1} (from above).\n\nSo A[i} = A[i-1} + B[i-1}.\n\nSimilarly, if i is odd:\n\nB[i} = B[i-1} + dp[i} = B[i-1} + A[i-1}.\n\nBut for even i, B[i} = B[i-1} (since i is even, adding nothing to B).\n\nFor odd i, A[i} = A[i-1} (since i is odd, adding nothing to A).\n\nBut regardless of i's parity, the following holds:\n\nFor any i ≥1,\n\nA[i} = A[i-1} + (if i even then dp[i} else 0).\n\nB[i} = B[i-1} + (if i odd then dp[i} else 0).\n\nBut since dp[i} for even i is B[i-1}, and for odd i is A[i-1}, we can find a recurrence.\n\nLet me try to find a recurrence for dp[i}.\n\nFor i ≥2, let's look at dp[i} and dp[i-1}.\n\nCase 1: i is even.\n\nThen dp[i} = B[i-1}.\n\nBut B[i-1} = B[i-2} + (if i-1 is odd then dp[i-1} else 0). Since i is even, i-1 is odd. So B[i-1} = B[i-2} + dp[i-1}.\n\nBut B[i-2} = sum of odd numbers up to i-2. And dp[i-1} is A[i-2} (since i-1 is odd, dp[i-1} = A[i-2}).\n\nSo dp[i} = B[i-2} + A[i-2}.\n\nBut A[i-2} + B[i-2} = sum_{k=0}^{i-2} dp[k} = total_sum[i-2}.\n\nBut what is total_sum[i-2}? Let's call it T[i-2} = A[i-2} + B[i-2}.\n\nSo dp[i} = T[i-2}.\n\nSimilarly, for i odd:\n\ndp[i} = A[i-1}.\n\nBut A[i-1} = A[i-2} + (if i-1 is even then dp[i-1} else 0). Since i is odd, i-1 is even. So A[i-1} = A[i-2} + dp[i-1}.\n\nBut dp[i-1} = B[i-2} (since i-1 is even, dp[i-1} = B[i-2}).\n\nSo dp[i} = A[i-2} + B[i-2} = T[i-2}.\n\nThus, for any i ≥2, dp[i} = T[i-2} = sum_{k=0}^{i-2} dp[k}.\n\nBut what is T[i-2}?\n\nT[i-2} = sum_{k=0}^{i-2} dp[k}.\n\nBut for i ≥2, dp[i} = T[i-2}.\n\nNow, let's look for a recurrence between dp[i} and previous terms.\n\nLet me compute dp[i} + dp[i-1} for i ≥2.\n\ndp[i} = T[i-2} = sum_{0}^{i-2} dp[k}.\n\ndp[i-1} = T[i-3} = sum_{0}^{i-3} dp[k}.\n\nSo dp[i} = dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} ?\n\nBecause:\n\nsum_{0}^{i-2} dp[k} = sum_{0}^{i-3} dp[k} + dp[i-2}.\n\nWhich is dp[i-1} + dp[i-2} ?\n\nWait, no. Because dp[i-1} is T[i-3} = sum_{0}^{i-3} dp[k} ?\n\nNo, earlier conclusion was that for i ≥2, dp[i} = T[i-2} = sum_{k=0}^{i-2} dp[k}.\n\nSo for example, dp[i} = sum_{k=0}^{i-2} dp[k}.\n\nBut dp[i-1} = sum_{k=0}^{(i-1)-2} dp[k} = sum_{k=0}^{",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly building towers in towns from 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, while each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: The key insight is to use dynamic programming (DP) to count the number of valid configurations where towers can be placed such that they can cover all towns from 1 to n without overlapping and without covering towns 0 or n+1.\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: The DP approach uses a recurrence relation where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid ways to cover the first `i` towns. The recurrence relation derived is `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]` for `i >= 3`, with base cases `dp[0] = 1`, `dp[1] = 1`, and `dp[2] = 1`.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.\n4. **Modular Inverse**: The final probability is calculated as the fraction of valid configurations over total configurations, which is then converted using modular inverse.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    # Precompute dp up to n\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    if n >= 1:\n        dp[1] = 1\n    if n >= 2:\n        dp[2] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % MOD\n    \n    # Compute 2^n mod MOD\n    power = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    \n    # Compute the modular inverse of power\n    inv_power = pow(power, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    result = (dp[n] * inv_power) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array**: We initialize a DP array where `dp[i]` keeps track of the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns.\n2. **Base Cases**: The base cases are initialized as `dp[0] = 1` (representing an empty configuration), `dp[1] = 1` (only one way to cover one town), and `dp[2] = 1` (only one valid configuration for two towns).\n3. **Filling DP Array**: For each subsequent value of `i` from 3 to `n`, we compute `dp[i]` using the recurrence relation derived from the problem constraints.\n4. **Modular Exponentiation**: We compute `2^n % MOD` to determine the total number of possible configurations and use the modular inverse to compute the probability as a fraction modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required probability using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, making it feasible even for large values of `n` up to 200,000.",
