Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about processing substitution queries on a string of digits and then computing the number modulo 1e9+7. But directly applying each substitution step by step would be computationally expensive, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. So we need an efficient way to handle this.\n\nHmm, the key here is that each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But if we process the substitutions in reverse order, maybe we can track the value of each digit as it's being replaced. Wait, because if a digit is replaced later, that replacement might affect earlier substitutions. Wait no, because the substitutions are done in order. For example, if first we replace '2' with '00', then replace '0' with '1', then the original '2's would become '00' which then becomes '11'. But if we process substitutions in reverse order, maybe we can model the value of each digit in terms of the replacements.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model for each digit, what its contribution is to the final number. Let me think: Each substitution replaces a digit d with a string t. But when we do substitutions, the order matters. For example, if we first replace d with t, and then replace some other digit e with something else, that's fine. But if we have a substitution for d followed by another substitution for d, the second one would overwrite the first. So, for each digit, we need to track what is the current replacement. However, since each query replaces all instances of di with ti, the order of processing is important.\n\nBut if we process the queries in reverse order, maybe we can compute for each digit what it represents in terms of the final value. Because, for example, suppose we have a substitution for d → t. Then, any occurrence of d in the original string would be replaced by t. But if after that, there's a substitution for some other digit, say e → something, that doesn't affect the previous substitution. However, if the substitution for e happens before the substitution for d, then when we process in reverse, we need to consider that when we process the substitution for d, the e's have already been replaced.\n\nWait, maybe we can model for each digit, the value that it contributes when expanded. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a mapping where each digit is replaced by some string. But when we process the substitutions in reverse order, each substitution can be thought of as replacing a digit with a value that depends on the current mappings.\n\nLet me think of this as a dynamic programming problem. Let's say that for each digit d, we have a value mod 1e9+7. Initially, the value for each digit is itself. But when a substitution is applied (say, d → t), then the value of d becomes the value of the string t, which is computed as the concatenation of the digits in t, each of which is replaced by their current values. But how do we compute that?\n\nWait, but the substitutions are applied in sequence. So for example, if we have a query that replaces d with t, then any subsequent queries that replace other digits will not affect the current substitution of d. But if a query replaces a digit that was part of t, then that would affect the expansion of d.\n\nSo, if we process the queries in reverse order, we can track for each digit what is the value of the expansion. Let me explain:\n\nInitially, each digit d has a value of d. Then, for each query in reverse order, if the query is \"d -> t\", then we need to compute the value of t, which is the concatenation of the digits in t, each of which is replaced by their current value. Then, the value of d becomes this computed value. Because when processing in reverse, the substitution for d would have been applied after any substitutions that are processed later (since we're going backwards). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have two queries:\n\nFirst query: replace 2 with 00\n\nSecond query: replace 0 with 1\n\nSo the original string is 2. After first query, it becomes 00. Then after second query, it becomes 11. Now, if we process in reverse order, first we process the second query (0 → 1), then the first (2 → 00). How does that affect the calculation? Well, when processing the second query (0 → 1), the value of 0 is set to 1. Then, when processing the first query (2 → 00), we need to compute the value of \"00\" as the concatenation of two 0s, which each are 1. So 00 is 11, so the value of 2 becomes 11. Which is correct.\n\nSo",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we process the substitution queries in reverse order. This allows us to compute the final numeric value of each digit as it would appear after all substitutions have been applied. We use dynamic programming to keep track of the value of each digit modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Reverse Processing of Queries**: By processing queries in reverse, we can ensure that each substitution is applied based on the latest transformations.\n2. **Dynamic Programming for Digit Values**: For each digit from '0' to '9', maintain its current numeric value modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n3. **String Concatenation as Modular Arithmetic**: When a query replaces a digit `d` with string `t`, the new value of `d` is computed by concatenating the values of each character in `t` using modular arithmetic.\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split('\\n')\n    \n    idx = 0\n    s = data[idx].strip()\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(data[idx].strip())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    queries = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        if idx >= len(data):\n            break\n        line = data[idx].strip()\n        if line:\n            queries.append(line)\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Initialize dp: dp[d] = value of digit d\n    dp = [0] * 10\n    for d in range(10):\n        dp[d] = d\n    \n    # Process queries in reverse order\n    for q in reversed(queries):\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        d = parts[0]\n        t = parts[1]\n        digit = int(d)\n        \n        # Compute the value of t using current dp values\n        val = 0\n        for ch in t:\n            ch_digit = int(ch)\n            val = (val * 10 + dp[ch_digit]) % MOD\n        \n        dp[digit] = val\n    \n    # Now compute the value of the initial string s using dp\n    result = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        ch_digit = int(ch)\n        result = (result * 10 + dp[ch_digit]) % MOD\n    \n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into the initial string and the list of queries.\n- **Initialization**: An array `dp` is initialized where `dp[d]` represents the numeric value of digit `d` modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n- **Reverse Query Processing**: Each query is processed in reverse order. For each query, the target digit's value is updated based on the current values of the characters in the replacement string.\n- **Final Calculation**: After processing all queries, the initial string is evaluated using the updated values in `dp`, ensuring that the result is computed modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nThis approach ensures that each substitution is handled efficiently, leveraging modular arithmetic to avoid overflow and manage large numbers effectively.",
