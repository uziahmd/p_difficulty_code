Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving through a common border between blocks. Each block is a region divided by the roads. \n\nFirst, I need to model the problem. Since each road is a line, the blocks are regions divided by these lines. The key here is that moving between blocks requires sharing a non-zero length border. So, two blocks are adjacent if they share a segment of a road (so they are separated by exactly one road). \n\nBut how do I represent the blocks? Well, considering that each block can be represented by some kind of identifier, and the adjacency between them. However, with n roads, the number of blocks can be very large (exponentially in n?), which makes it impossible to generate all blocks directly. So, there must be a smarter way.\n\nWait, but maybe we can model this as a graph where each node represents a block. But how to find the adjacency between blocks? That seems challenging. \n\nAlternative approach: think about the problem in terms of the regions divided by the lines. The movement between regions is allowed if they are separated by exactly one line. But how to model the regions?\n\nAnother idea: For any point not on any line, the region it's in can be determined by the signs of the equations of each line. Because each line divides the plane into two halves. So for each line, the point is either on one side or the other. So the entire set of regions can be represented by a vector of signs (for each line, + or -). However, since the lines can be overlapping in various ways, two different sign vectors might not correspond to different regions. But perhaps, for the purposes of this problem, we can model the regions by their sign vectors, and then check adjacency.\n\nBut how do we determine if two regions are adjacent? Two regions are adjacent if their sign vectors differ in exactly one line. Because that would mean that they are separated by exactly one line. For example, if two regions differ in exactly one line's sign, then they are separated by that line. So moving between them would be allowed in one step.\n\nWait, but that's only true if the line is a boundary between them. But if two regions differ in exactly one line's sign, then they are separated by that line. So, their common border is that line. But since the line is infinite, the regions would share a common border. Therefore, two regions that differ in exactly one line's sign are adjacent.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find the minimum number of steps needed to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, where each step changes exactly one sign in the vector. Because each step corresponds to moving across a single line (road), changing the sign for that line.\n\nWait, but that's a BFS problem. Let me think again. Each region is represented by a vector of signs (for each road, whether the point is on the positive or negative side of the line). The home and university are each in their own regions, so their sign vectors are different. The problem is to find the minimal number of steps to go from home's sign vector to university's sign vector, where each step flips exactly one sign (since flipping one sign would correspond to moving across a single line, thus adjacent regions). \n\nBut wait, no. Because if you flip exactly one sign, then the two regions are adjacent. So the minimal steps between two regions is the minimal number of sign differences between their sign vectors. Because each step can flip one sign. So the minimal steps is the hamming distance between the two sign vectors. Because each step can change one sign, so the minimal steps is the number of positions where the sign vectors differ.\n\nWait, that seems too simple. Let me check with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are 0x +1y +0=0 (i.e., y=0) and 1x +0y +0=0 (x=0). \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nCheck for each road:\n\nRoad 1: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 > 0 → sign is +.\n\nRoad 2: 1*1 +0*1 +0 = 1>0 → sign is +. So the sign vector is [+, +].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign -.\n\nRoad 2: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign -. So sign vector is [-, -]. \n\nThe hamming distance between [+,+] and [-,-] is 2. So the answer is 2, which matches the sample output. \n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads are x=0, y=0, and x+y-3=0.\n\nLet's compute sign vectors for home and university.\n\nHome (1,1):\n\nFor x=0: 1>0 → +.\n\ny=0: 1>0 → +.\n\nx+y-3 = 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → -.\n\nSo sign vector is [+, +, -].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nx=0: -1 <0 → -.\n\ny=0: -1 <0 → -.\n\nx+y-3 = -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → -.\n\nSo sign vector is [-, -, -].\n\nThe hamming distance is 2 (the first two entries differ). So the answer is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo this seems to work. So the problem reduces to computing the hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university. \n\nBut why is that correct? Because each step allows us to cross a single road. So, each time you cross a road, you flip the sign for that road. So the minimal steps required is the number of roads where the home and university have different signs. \n\nBecause, for example, if two regions differ in k signs, then you can flip each of those signs one by one. Each flip corresponds to moving across that road. So the minimal steps is k.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that allows flipping each differing sign one by one? Because each flip is allowed. For example, suppose you have two differing signs. You can cross the first road, changing one sign, then cross the second road, changing another. So the total steps is 2. \n\nSo the answer is simply the number of roads where the home and university have different signs. \n\nWait, that's a very straightforward solution. Then why is the problem considered as a programming problem? Because perhaps there's some edge case I'm missing?\n\nWait, but what if the home and university are in the same region? Then the answer is zero. But according to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that neither home nor university is on any road. But the problem says that the home and university are located in some block. So the home and university could be in the same block, but the problem says that you need to get to the university. So in that case, the answer is zero. But how to check that?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is such that the home and university are in some block. But the problem says nothing about them being in the same block. So the code needs to check if the home and university are in the same region. If yes, output 0. Otherwise, the hamming distance between their sign vectors.\n\nBut how to compute the sign vectors for home and university?\n\nSo the steps to solve the problem are:\n\n1. For each road, compute the sign of the home point (ai*x1 + bi*y1 + ci). Similarly for the university point.\n\n2. For each road, compare the signs of home and university. Count the number of roads where they differ. That is the answer.\n\nWait, but this is only possible if the answer is indeed the hamming distance. But why is this the case?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose that the home and university are in regions that differ in k roads. Then the minimal steps is k. Because each step can flip one of the differing roads. But how can you flip them one by one?\n\nFor example, imagine that you have two roads, and the home and university differ in both. Then the minimal steps is 2. Because you can cross one road, then cross another. But when you cross the first road, you change the sign for that road. Then, crossing the second road, you change the sign for the second. So after two steps, you reach the target.\n\nBut what if the roads are arranged in such a way that crossing one road would require passing through another? But according to the problem's movement rules, you can move between regions if they share a common border. So, each time you cross a road, you move to a region that differs in exactly one sign. So the minimal steps is indeed the hamming distance between the two sign vectors.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of roads where the home and university have different signs.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because each step allows you to cross a road, which changes the sign for that road. So the minimal steps is the number of differing signs.\n\nThis seems to be the case, and the sample inputs confirm that. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. For each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). For each road, check if the signs of these two values are different. Count the number of such roads. That's the answer.\n\nBut wait, what about if the home and university are in the same region? Then the count is zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead home coordinates (x1, y1), university (x2, y2). Read n roads. For each road, compute for home and university the value of a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i. Then check if the product of the two values is negative. If yes, then the signs are different. So increment the count.\n\nBut why? Because if the product is negative, then one is positive and the other is negative. So the signs differ. If the product is positive, then they are same (both positive or both negative). If one of them is zero, but the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So the values for home and university can't be zero. So the product can't be zero. \n\nSo the code is:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each road (a, b, c):\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nreturn count\n\nThat's it? That's the solution?\n\nYes, according to the samples. Let's test the first sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are 0x +1y +0 =0 and 1x +0y +0=0.\n\nFor first road (0, 1, 0):\n\nval1 = 0*1 + 1*1 + 0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road (1,0,0): val1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0=1. val2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. product -1 → count +=1. Total is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are:\n\n1. 1 0 0 → x=0. val1 is 1, val2 is -1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\n2. 0 1 0 → y=0. val1 is 1, val2 is -1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\n3. 1 1 -3 → x + y -3 = 0. For home (1,1): 1 +1 -3 = -1. For university (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Both are negative. product is positive → no count. So total count is 2. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works for the samples.\n\nBut why is this approach correct?\n\nBecause each road that separates the home and university regions contributes to the count. And the minimal steps is the number of such roads. \n\nBut how does that account for the actual regions? Because the regions are determined by the sign vectors. So, the home and university are in different regions if and only if their sign vectors differ in at least one road. But the minimal steps is the hamming distance between their sign vectors. \n\nBut the hamming distance is the number of roads where the signs differ. Which is exactly what the code is counting. \n\nTherefore, this approach is correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Read the input, compute for each road the value for home and university, check if they have different signs, count the number of such roads, and output that count.\n\nThis is an O(n) solution, which is acceptable for n up to 300.\n\nSo the code can be written in Python as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each a, b, c in the roads:\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but why? Because each road that has different signs for home and university contributes to the count. So the answer is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n\nYes. And that's exactly the code.\n\nBut why is that the minimal steps? Because each step allows you to cross a road, which changes the sign for that road. So, if you have k roads where the home and university are on opposite sides, you need to cross each of them once. So the minimal steps is k.\n\nBut what if there are some roads that are not between the home and university? For example, suppose there are two roads that separate the home and university. But perhaps there's a way to cross them in some order. But the minimal steps is 2, which is the count. \n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute this count.\n\nSo the code is simple. Let's write it.\n\nNow, handling the input:\n\nIn Python, read the first line as x1, y1. Second line as x2, y2. Third line as n. Then read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the sample input shows two examples. But in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1.\n\nSecond line two integers x2, y2.\n\nThird line an integer n.\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo the code is supposed to process a single test case. Wait, the sample input shows two examples, but in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. So the code should process a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 — the coordinates of your home.\n\nThe second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 — the coordinates of the university.\n\nThird line contains an integer n — the number of roads.\n\nThen n lines of coefficients.\n\nSo the code must process one test case. The sample input shows two examples, but perhaps that's just for the purpose of the example. So the code should process one test case.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\nCompute count as above.\n\nPrint count.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test for the case where home and university are in the same region. For example, suppose there is one road, and home and university are on the same side of the road. Then the count is zero, and the answer is zero.\n\nAnother example: home and university are on the same side of all roads. Then the answer is zero.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code is as simple as that. So the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input lines. For example, in Python, the code could be:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nBut wait, why is this correct? Because the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. Therefore, val1 and val2 can't be zero. So their product can't be zero. Thus, for each road, val1 * val2 is either positive or negative. So the code correctly counts the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nThus, this code should pass all test cases.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nThe code will process:\n\nx1=1, y1=1; x2=-1, y2=-1.\n\nn=2.\n\nFirst road: 0,1,0. val1 = 0*1 + 1*1 +0 =1. val2=0*(-1) +1*(-1)+0 =-1. product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1,0,0. val1=1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2=1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 =-1. product -1 → count +=1. total 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor each road:\n\nRoad 1: 1,0,0. val1 =1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 =1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 =-1. product -1 → count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: 0,1,0. val1 =0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2=0*(-1)+1*(-1)+0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nRoad3: 1,1,-3. val1: 1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 =-1. val2: 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -2-3 =-5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. So total count is 2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works for the samples.\n\nSo this is the correct solution. It's surprisingly simple, but it passes all the test cases. So the code is as written.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step allows movement between adjacent blocks that share a non-zero length border.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that each block can be represented by a sign vector relative to each road. The sign vector for a point is determined by evaluating the equation of each road at that point. If the result is positive or negative, it indicates which side of the road the point lies on. \n\nTwo blocks are adjacent if their sign vectors differ in exactly one position, corresponding to crossing one road. Therefore, the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the number of roads where the signs of the home and university positions differ.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Sign Evaluation:** For each road, compute the value of the linear equation at both the home and university coordinates.\n3. **Sign Comparison:** Check if the product of these values is negative, indicating that the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. Count such instances.\n4. **Output Result:** The count of such roads gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block, as each differing sign corresponds to a necessary road crossing.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution in O(n) time complexity, where n is the number of roads, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint of n = 300.",
