Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between blocks. The roads are infinite lines dividing the plane into regions (blocks). \n\nSo, the main challenge here is modeling the blocks and figuring out how they are connected. But since directly representing all possible blocks isn't feasible (as there could be infinitely many), we need another approach.\n\nHmm. Wait, the key here is that each block can be represented by the set of roads that separate it from the home block. Or maybe think in terms of the regions divided by the lines. But how do we model the adjacency between regions?\n\nAnother idea: think of each region as a node in a graph. Then, two regions are connected if they share a common border (i.e., they are adjacent across a line). The problem then reduces to finding the shortest path from the home region to the university region. However, the problem is how to represent these regions and compute their adjacency.\n\nBut since there are n roads, each road divides the plane into two parts. So with n roads, the maximum number of regions is O(n²) according to the arrangement of lines. But even for n=300, that would be 90,000 regions, which might be manageable with BFS if we can find a way to represent the regions and their adjacency.\n\nBut how to represent each region uniquely? Well, perhaps each region can be represented by the signs of the equations of the roads. For example, for each road, the region is either on one side of the line or the other. So for each road, we can determine whether the home point is on one side or the other. Then, the region is determined by the set of signs for each road.\n\nWait, but the home is in a specific region, and the university is in another. So maybe the problem can be modeled by considering the regions as nodes, where each node is represented by the sign vector of the roads. But with n up to 300, that's 2^300 possibilities, which is impossible. That's way too big.\n\nSo that approach is not feasible. We need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative approach: Since moving between regions requires crossing a road. Each step moves across a road. So, the problem is similar to a graph where each node represents a region, and edges exist between regions that are separated by exactly one road. But again, how to model the regions.\n\nWait, here's an alternative idea inspired by BFS. Let's think of the problem as a graph where each node is a region. But instead of enumerating all regions, we can perform BFS by considering the regions as being determined by the parity of crossings. Wait, no, that might not work.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each time you cross a road, you change the sign of that road's equation. So, the home region is determined by the signs of each road's equation evaluated at the home point. Similarly for the university. So, the question becomes: what's the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed to go from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration, where each step crosses exactly one road (changing its sign).\n\nWait, that's an interesting thought. Because each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road's equation. So, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads whose sign differs between the home and university regions. But that's only if the regions differ by exactly those roads. But how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that for each road, we can compute whether the home is on one side or the other. Similarly for the university. For each road, if the home and university are on opposite sides of the road, then that road must be crossed an odd number of times in the path. Otherwise, even.\n\nBut how does that relate to the minimal steps? Let me take an example. Suppose that the home and university are in regions that differ by k roads. Then, the minimal steps would be k? Or maybe something else.\n\nWait, no. Because each step allows you to cross a single road. So, if you have to cross a certain number of roads, the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate the two regions. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a state (the sign vector of the roads). But since the number of states is 2^n, which is way too big, that's not feasible.\n\nBut maybe the problem can be modeled as a BFS where each state is the set of roads that you have crossed an odd number of times. But again, with n=300, that's impossible.\n\nWait, but the home and university are fixed points. So, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and the university. Let me think: each road that separates them must be crossed once. But roads that don't separate them can be crossed even times (so they don't contribute). So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and the university. Is that correct?\n\nBut that seems too simplistic. Let's think of an example.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are two roads: 0x + 1y + 0 = 0 (which is y=0) and 1x + 0y + 0 = 0 (x=0).\n\nThe home is at (1,1), which is above y=0 and to the right of x=0. The university is at (-1,-1), which is below y=0 and left of x=0. So for each road, the signs are different. So, there are two roads that separate the home and university. The answer is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nIn the second sample input, there are three roads. The home is (1,1), the university is (-1,-1). The roads are x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. Let's check for each road:\n\nFor x=0: home is positive (x=1>0), university is negative (x=-1 <0). So different.\n\nFor y=0: same as above, different.\n\nFor x + y -3 = 0: evaluating home (1+1-3 = -1 <0). University: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0. So same sign. So the third road doesn't separate them. So the number of roads separating them is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSo in this case, the answer is exactly the number of roads that separate the home and the university. So perhaps the answer is simply the count of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nBut wait, why is that the case? Because each such road must be crossed once. But how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads once, and no others?\n\nBut maybe the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and the university. Because each step can cross exactly one road. So, if you cross each of the separating roads once, you can reach the target.\n\nBut why can't there be a shorter path? For example, if there are two roads separating them, but you can cross one road twice (but that would not help, because crossing a road twice brings you back to the original region). So, the minimal steps would be the number of roads that separate the two regions.\n\nSo this suggests that the problem reduces to counting the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n\nBut how to confirm this?\n\nAnother example: suppose there are two roads that cross each other, forming four regions. Suppose home is in one region and the university is in the opposite region (across both roads). Then, the number of separating roads is 2. But to get there, you need to cross both roads once. So steps is 2.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are two parallel roads. The home is between them, and the university is on the other side of both. Then, the number of separating roads is 2. To get there, you need to cross both roads once. So steps is 2.\n\nAlternatively, if the home and university are separated by one road. Then steps is 1.\n\nSo this seems to hold.\n\nThus, the solution is to compute for each road whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. The number of such roads is the answer.\n\nBut how to check if two points are on opposite sides of a line?\n\nThe formula for a line ax + by + c = 0. For a point (x,y), the value is ax + by + c. The sign of this value determines which side of the line the point is on. If two points have values with opposite signs, then they are on opposite sides of the line.\n\nSo for each road, compute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c, and f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c. If f1 * f2 < 0, then the points are on opposite sides of the line, so this road is a separator. Count the number of such roads.\n\nWait, but the problem says that neither home nor university lies on any road. So f1 and f2 can't be zero. So the product is non-zero. So for each road, check if f1 * f2 < 0. If yes, increment the count.\n\nThen, the answer is the count.\n\nBut why is this the case?\n\nBecause each such road must be crossed once. Because the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two regions.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because the regions are separated by these roads, and each step can cross a single road. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two regions.\n\nBut how to be sure that there's a path that crosses exactly those roads once, and no others?\n\nWell, imagine that the roads are arranged in such a way that each step crosses one road. For example, if you have multiple roads separating the two regions, you can cross them one by one. Each crossing takes you through a new region, and after crossing all the required roads, you reach the target region.\n\nSo, the minimal steps is indeed the count of roads that separate the two points.\n\nSo the solution is to compute for each road whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. The answer is the number of such roads.\n\nBut let's test this against the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are:\n\n0x +1y +0 = 0 → y=0. For home: 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1. For university: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is 1 * (-1) = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road is 1x +0y +0 =0 → x=0. Home: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. University: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. Product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2 → which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads:\n\nRoad 1: 1x +0y +0 → x=0. Same as before. Home is 1, university -1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: 0x +1y +0 → y=0. Same as before. Product -1 → count +=1.\n\nRoad3: 1x +1y -3 =0. For home (1,1): 1+1-3 = -1. For university (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0. So no count. Total count is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes. So this seems to work.\n\nSo the problem reduces to simply counting the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides of the line.\n\nThis is a very simple solution. So why is the problem considered easy? Because it's a trick question. The minimal steps is the number of roads separating the two points.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the home coordinates (x1, y1), university coordinates (x2, y2). Read n roads. For each road, compute (a*x1 + b*y1 + c) and (a*x2 + b*y2 + c). If their product is negative, increment the count.\n\nFinally, output the count.\n\nBut wait, why is that the case? What if there are overlapping roads or some other conditions?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the home and university are not on any road, so the product can't be zero. So for each road, the product is either positive or negative. So the code is straightforward.\n\nSo this is the solution. Let's code it.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count =0.\n\nFor each a, b, c:\n\ncompute val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\nval2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\nif val1 * val2 <0 → count +=1.\n\nAt the end, print count.\n\nYes. That's the code. Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nFor first road: val1 is 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. val2 is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: val1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1. product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Correct.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0 → val1 =1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 =1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\n0 1 0 → same as before, product -1 → count +=1.\n\nThird road: 1 1 -3 → val1 =1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1. val2 = 1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. So total 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nWhat about edge cases?\n\nCase when there are zero roads. Then the answer is 0. Because home and university are in the same region (since no roads divide the plane). But according to the problem statement, n can be 1. Wait, the input says n is at least 1. Wait, no. The input says n is given as 1<=n<=300. Wait, the third line is n, which is 1<=n<=300. So in the problem statement, n can be 1. But what if there are no roads? Well, according to the input constraints, the third line is n (1<=n<=300). So the code doesn't need to handle n=0.\n\nBut what if home and university are in the same region? For example, if there are roads, but all roads do not separate them. Then the answer is 0. For example, if home and university are on the same side of all roads.\n\nSo the code would output 0, which is correct.\n\nAnother example: if there's one road, and the home and university are on the same side. Then answer is 0 steps. Because they are in the same region.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written in Python as follows.\n\nRead the input lines. For each road, compute the product of the evaluations. Count the number of roads where the product is negative.\n\nNow, implement that.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input, the first input is given as a list of strings. But in the problem statement, the input is read from stdin. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nFirst line: x1 y1\n\nSecond line: x2 y2\n\nThird line: n\n\nThen n lines of a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nThen compute count.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the first line as x1, y1.\n\nSecond line as x2, y2.\n\nThird line as n.\n\nThen read n lines.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nWait, that's it. That's the code. But why is this the case? Because the problem is equivalent to counting the number of roads that separate the two points. And each such road must be crossed once, and the minimal steps is that count.\n\nYes. So this code should pass all test cases.\n\nLet me check the sample input again.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWhich is read correctly. The code outputs 2.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nInput lines:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nWhich outputs 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if there are two roads, but both do not separate the points. Then output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: if one road separates them, output 1.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, this is the correct solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving across a common border between blocks, which is defined by the roads.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. If the home and university are on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed to move from the home block to the university block. The minimum number of steps required is equivalent to the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nTo determine if a road separates the home and university, we evaluate the position of both points relative to the road. For each road defined by the equation $a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0$, we compute the values of the equation at the coordinates of the home and university. If the product of these values is negative, the points lie on opposite sides of the road, indicating that the road separates them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Road Separation:** For each road, we compute the value of the linear equation at the home and university coordinates. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the home and university are on opposite sides of the road.\n3. **Counting Separating Roads:** The number of such roads that separate the home and university is counted, which directly gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their evaluations at given points, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
