Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about Leha choosing two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x, and they don't overlap. And we have to find the minimal total cost of such a pair. If it's not possible, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. Each voucher has li (departure day), ri (return day), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. So for two vouchers i and j, their durations must sum to x. Also, they must not overlap. Which means either the first ends before the second starts, or vice versa.\n\nThe challenge is to find all pairs of vouchers that satisfy these conditions and find the minimum sum of their costs.\n\nConstraints are n up to 2e5, which is big. So O(n^2) approaches are definitely out of the question. Need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for each voucher, we can calculate its duration. Let's say duration is d. Then, for each voucher with duration d, we need another voucher with duration x - d. And those two vouchers must not overlap.\n\nSo the idea is: for each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with duration (x - d), and that they don't overlap. Then take the minimum cost for such pairs.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the minimum cost for the other voucher?\n\nLet me think about grouping vouchers by their duration. For example, create a dictionary where key is the duration, and the value is a list of vouchers with that duration, sorted by their start and end times. Or maybe for each duration, we can pre-process some data structures that allow us to quickly find the minimal cost for vouchers that end before a certain time, or start after a certain time.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into groups by their duration. For each duration d, store a list of vouchers with that duration. For each such list, we can sort them based on their end time (for example), and also for each voucher, we can track the minimum cost up to that point. Or maybe for each duration, we can have two sorted lists: one sorted by end time, and another sorted by start time. Wait, but for each voucher of duration d, when looking for a voucher of duration x-d, we need to find those that end before the start of the current voucher, or start after the end of the current voucher.\n\nWait, let's suppose we have a voucher A with duration d, and we need to find a voucher B with duration (x - d). So for voucher A, we need to find vouchers B where either B ends before A starts, or B starts after A ends.\n\nSo for each voucher A, we can look for vouchers B with duration (x - d), and check if they are non-overlapping. But how to find the minimal cost for such B's?\n\nSo for each voucher A, we can:\n\n- Check if there exists a duration (x - d_A) in our map. If not, skip.\n\n- Then, for all vouchers B with duration (x - d_A), find those that end before A's start (i.e., B.ri < A.li) or start after A's end (B.li > A.ri). For these B's, find the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nFor each duration, say target_d = x - d_A, we can have two structures:\n\n1. A sorted list of vouchers by their end time. Then, for a given A's li, we can find all B's with end time < A's li. For these, we can find the minimum cost among them.\n\n2. Similarly, a sorted list of vouchers by their start time. For a given A's ri, find all B's with start time > A's ri, and find the minimum cost among them.\n\nBut how to get the minimum cost for these ranges?\n\nSo for each target_d, we can pre-process two arrays:\n\n- For vouchers with duration target_d, sorted by end time. And for each position in this sorted list, we can have a prefix minimum array. So that when we find the last voucher whose end time is less than a certain value, we can get the minimum cost up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for the same target_d, sorted by start time, and a prefix min array for start times.\n\nAlternatively, for each target_d, we can have:\n\n- A list of vouchers sorted by end time. And for this list, we can have a structure that allows querying the minimum cost for all vouchers with end time <= some value. This can be done with a sorted list and binary search, then using a segment tree or a binary indexed tree (Fenwick tree) to query the min. However, since the vouchers are already sorted, perhaps we can precompute a prefix min array.\n\nLet me think. Suppose for a target_d, we have all vouchers sorted by end time. Then, for a given value (say, A's li), we can binary search to find the largest end time that is less than A's li. All vouchers up to that index in the sorted list are candidates. Then, the minimum cost among them is the minimum in the prefix up to that index. So if we have a prefix min array, we can get that quickly.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case where B's start time is after A's end time. For this, we can have the vouchers sorted by start time, and find the first start time that is greater than A's end time. Then, all vouchers from that index onwards are candidates. The minimum cost among them can be found using a suffix min array.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each duration d, pre-process two sorted lists:\n\n- One sorted by end time, with a prefix min array.\n\n- One sorted by start time, with a suffix min array.\n\nThen, for each voucher A with duration d, we check if there is a target_d = x - d. If yes, then:\n\n- For the target_d's vouchers:\n\n   a. Find the minimal cost of vouchers that end before A's start (li). This can be done by binary searching the end-sorted list for the largest end time less than A's li. Then, take the prefix min up to that index.\n\n   b. Find the minimal cost of vouchers that start after A's end (ri). This can be done by binary searching the start-sorted list for the first start time greater than A's ri. Then, take the suffix min from that index onwards.\n\nThen, the minimal between these two options (if any) is added to the current voucher's cost, and we keep track of the global minimum.\n\nBut we need to make sure that the voucher B is not the same as voucher A. However, since the problem allows i != j, but when considering the same voucher, if there's another voucher with the same duration and satisfying the condition, then it's allowed. But during the processing, if the same voucher is considered as B for A, but there's another voucher with same duration and same parameters, then it's allowed. However, the code needs to handle cases where the same voucher is considered twice. But since the problem says i != j, perhaps when checking, we need to ensure that the voucher B is not the same as A. However, given that the vouchers are processed in pairs, perhaps this is not a problem. Because when we process voucher A, we look for vouchers B with duration target_d. If the voucher A itself has duration target_d, then it's possible that B is the same voucher. However, in that case, the code would have to check if there's another voucher with the same parameters. But how?\n\nBut perhaps the code should not consider the same voucher. For example, if voucher A has duration d, and target_d = x - d = d. Then, when looking for B's, the code may include voucher A itself. But then, when pairing A with B, if B is A, then it's invalid. So how do we avoid that?\n\nThis seems complicated. But perhaps during preprocessing, when building the data structures for each duration, we can have all vouchers except the current one. However, that's not feasible. Alternatively, during the check, if the voucher A is part of the target_d group (i.e., if d + d = x), then we need to make sure that there is at least one other voucher in that group.\n\nBut that might complicate things. However, considering that the problem allows two different vouchers, even if they have the same duration and parameters. For example, if there are two vouchers with same li, ri, cost, then they can be paired.\n\nSo during the processing, when we look for vouchers B with duration target_d, even if the voucher A is in that group, as long as there exists at least one other voucher in that group that satisfies the non-overlapping condition, then it's acceptable.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nWell, the code would process all vouchers in the target_d group. So when the voucher A is part of the target_d group, during the processing, when we look for vouchers B that end before A's li, or start after A's ri, it's possible that the voucher A itself is considered. However, in that case, the code would have to check whether there exists another voucher in that group that meets the condition.\n\nBut this seems difficult. However, perhaps the code can proceed as follows: for each voucher A, when looking for B in the target_d group, we check all possible B's (including possibly A itself) and then, if B is A, we ignore it. But how to know that?\n\nBut that would require checking each candidate B against A. However, since the code is trying to find the minimal cost, perhaps in the case where B is A, the code would not choose it unless there are no other options. But since the problem requires two distinct vouchers, this case must be handled.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive. How can we avoid this?\n\nAlternative approach: during the preprocessing, for each duration, we have all vouchers. When processing voucher A, when looking for B's in target_d, we can check for B's that are not A. But how?\n\nBut if the code is considering all vouchers in the target_d group, then even if A is in that group, the code would find B's that are not A. For example, if there are multiple vouchers in the target_d group, then when looking for B's that end before A's li, the code would find those B's, including possibly other vouchers.\n\nBut if there's only one voucher in the target_d group, which is A itself, then the code would not be able to use it. So in that case, the code would not consider it.\n\nSo the problem is that when target_d is equal to d, and the voucher A is in the target_d group, but there's only one voucher (A) in that group, then when looking for B's, it would find A, but since it's the same voucher, the pair is invalid.\n\nBut how to avoid that? Well, when we process voucher A, and check for B's in the target_d group, we can check if there are at least two vouchers in that group. But that's not sufficient. For example, if the group has two vouchers, but both are overlapping with A, then even though there are two vouchers, the pair may not be valid.\n\nBut this seems too complicated to handle during the processing. Maybe the code can proceed as before, and then after finding a candidate B (which could be A), check if it's different from A. However, this would require, for each candidate, to check if B is A. But how?\n\nBut considering that for each voucher A, when we process it, and for each target_d group, we are looking for B's in that group. So during the processing of A, if the target_d group contains A (i.e., target_d is d, which is x - d, so x = 2d), then when we look for B's in the group, we can check if the B's that meet the non-overlapping condition are not A.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps in practice, the code can proceed as follows: for each voucher A, when looking for B in the target_d group, we can find the minimal cost of B's that are non-overlapping with A, and then if the minimal cost comes from B=A, we ignore it. But how to know that?\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have a list of vouchers. Then, when we process voucher A, and the target_d is the same as d, we can check if there are other vouchers in the target_d group that meet the non-overlapping conditions.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to proceed with the initial approach, and then during the processing, after getting the minimal cost from the B group, check if there's at least one voucher in that group that is not A and meets the non-overlapping condition.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, given that the constraints are tight, perhaps the code can proceed with the initial approach, and then during the processing, when the target_d is same as d, and the B's that are found are A, then that case is skipped. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can proceed without worrying about this case, and then in the end, if the minimal cost is found by pairing a voucher with itself, then we can check if there are at least two vouchers in that group. However, this seems error-prone.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the processing, when the target_d is same as d, then for each voucher A, we can check if there are any other vouchers in the target_d group that are non-overlapping with A. But again, how to do this efficiently.\n\nHmm. Maybe this is a problem that can be handled later. Let's proceed with the initial approach, and see if there's a way to avoid this issue.\n\nLet's think of an example. Suppose x is 4, and a voucher A has duration 2. Then target_d is 2. So for voucher A, we look for other vouchers in the target_d group. Suppose there is another voucher B with same duration and non-overlapping with A. Then the code would find B and pair them. However, if there is no such B, but voucher A is the only one in the target_d group, then the code would not find any B's, and thus not consider it.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows: when processing voucher A, and looking for B's in the target_d group, the code will find the minimal cost for B's that are non-overlapping with A, regardless of whether B is A or not. However, if B is A, then the pair is invalid. So the code must ensure that B is not A.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nWell, during the processing, when we find a B that is non-overlapping with A, but B is A itself, then we need to check if there is another B' in the group that also meets the non-overlapping condition.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps in practice, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nWhen we find the minimal cost for B's in the target_d group that meet the non-overlapping condition, and if that minimal cost is from B=A, then we need to check if there is another voucher in the group that also meets the condition. But how to track that?\n\nThis seems very complex, but perhaps during the initial processing, when we collect the minimal cost, we can check if there are multiple vouchers in the group. For example, if the minimal cost is found in the group, and the group has more than one voucher, then it's possible that there's another voucher. But this is not necessarily true.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing steps, when building the prefix min and suffix min arrays, we can ignore the current voucher A. However, that would require for each voucher A, to have access to the data structures of the target_d group excluding A. Which is not feasible.\n\nThis seems like a tough problem. However, maybe the probability that the minimal cost comes from the same voucher A is very low, and perhaps we can just proceed with the code and then check if the found B is A. But how to track that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the processing, when we find that the minimal cost comes from the same voucher A, we can ignore it. However, how to know that? For example, during the binary search steps, if the voucher A is in the target_d group, and the code finds that the minimal cost is from that group, but how to know if that voucher is A.\n\nBut perhaps the code can't know that. Therefore, maybe the problem is that the code will sometimes include the same voucher, leading to incorrect pairs. However, in the problem statement, it's required that the two vouchers are different. Therefore, the code must ensure that the two vouchers are different.\n\nThis is a critical point. How to handle this?\n\nAlternative idea: for each voucher, during the processing, when looking for B's in the target_d group, we can check if the voucher B is different from A. However, since during the binary search steps, we can't track individual vouchers, perhaps the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each target_d group, during the processing, the code can collect all possible B's that meet the non-overlapping condition and then select the minimal cost among them. However, since the same voucher can't be used twice, the code must ensure that there exists at least one B in the group that is not A and meets the condition.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nMaybe during the processing, for each voucher A, when we look for B's in the target_d group, we can first check if there are any B's that are not A. But how?\n\nThis seems challenging. Perhaps the code can proceed with the initial approach, and then after finding a candidate minimal cost, check if there exists at least one voucher in the target_d group that is not A and meets the non-overlapping condition. However, how to do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can proceed with the initial approach and then, for the cases where the target_d is same as d (i.e., x=2d), during the processing, when the code finds that the minimal cost is from the same voucher, we can check if there are multiple vouchers in that group. For example, if the group has more than one voucher, then there's a possibility that another voucher exists that can be used.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nLet me think again. What if we process all vouchers, and for each voucher, we consider all possible vouchers that can be paired with it. But to avoid O(n^2) time, we need to find for each voucher, the best possible voucher in O(log n) time.\n\nAnother approach: For each possible duration d, precompute for all vouchers of duration d, the minimal cost for vouchers that end before a certain time, and the minimal cost for vouchers that start after a certain time.\n\nSo for example, for each duration d, we can have two sorted lists:\n\n- Sorted by end time. For this list, we can have a prefix min array. So for any query of \"find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration d and end time <= t\", we can binary search t in the sorted list and get the prefix min up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for sorted by start time, and suffix min array.\n\nThen, for each voucher A with duration d, we need to find vouchers B with duration x-d, and that are non-overlapping with A. So:\n\nCase 1: B ends before A starts. So B.ri < A.li. So we can query the prefix min for duration x-d, with t = A.li - 1.\n\nCase 2: B starts after A ends. So B.li > A.ri. So we can query the suffix min for duration x-d, with t = A.ri + 1.\n\nThen, the minimal between these two cases (if any) plus the cost of A is a candidate for the answer.\n\nBut this approach would include vouchers B that are the same as A if they are in the target_d group. However, in that case, if the voucher A is in the target_d group, then during the query, the code may find that voucher A itself is a candidate. For example, if A has duration d and x-d is also d (so x=2d), then during case 1, if B ends before A starts, which could be possible if A's own ri is less than its li. Which is impossible because ri >= li. So in that case, B.ri < A.li implies that B ends before A starts. But if B is A, then B.ri = A.ri >= A.li. So B.ri cannot be less than A.li. Therefore, in case 1, B cannot be A. Similarly, for case 2, B starts after A ends. If B is A, then B.li = A.li, which is not greater than A.ri. So in this case, B can't be A. Therefore, the code doesn't need to worry about B being A. Because when B is A, it can't satisfy either case 1 or case 2.\n\nWait, this is a key insight! Because if B is the same voucher as A, then:\n\nCase 1: B.ri < A.li → A.ri < A.li → which is impossible since A.ri >= A.li.\n\nCase 2: B.li > A.ri → A.li > A.ri → also impossible.\n\nTherefore, when B is A, neither of the two cases applies. Therefore, during the processing, when we look for B's in the target_d group, the code can safely ignore the possibility of B being A. Because the code would not find it in either case.\n\nWow! That's a crucial point. Therefore, the code can proceed with the initial approach without worrying about the same voucher being considered. Because when B is A, it cannot satisfy either of the two cases. Therefore, the code can safely proceed.\n\nThat simplifies things a lot. So no need to worry about the same voucher being considered. Because during the case processing, B can't be A.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers grouped by their duration.\n\n- For each duration d, create two sorted lists:\n\n   a. sorted by end time (ri), along with a prefix minimum cost array.\n\n   b. sorted by start time (li), along with a suffix minimum cost array.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher A:\n\n   compute d_A = ri_A - li_A + 1.\n\n   target_d = x - d_A.\n\n   if target_d is not in the group map, skip.\n\n   else:\n\n      for the target_d group:\n\n         case 1: find all vouchers B with end time < A's li. So query the sorted end list for target_d, find the largest end time less than A's li. Take the prefix min up to that index. If exists, add to the possible candidates.\n\n         case 2: find all vouchers B with start time > A's ri. So query the sorted start list for target_d, find the first start time greater than A's ri. Take the suffix min from that index onwards. If exists, add to possible candidates.\n\n      take the minimum between case 1 and case 2, and if exists, add to the global minimum.\n\nSo the code can proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, how to group the vouchers by duration. Let's create a dictionary, say duration_map, where the keys are durations, and the values are the lists of vouchers with that duration. For each duration d in duration_map, we need to create two sorted lists:\n\nsorted_by_end: list of vouchers sorted by ri, then li (to break ties?), and a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost from 0 to i.\n\nsorted_by_start: list of vouchers sorted by li, then ri, and a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end.\n\nWait, for the sorted_by_end list, the vouchers are sorted by ri. For the same ri, perhaps sorted by li. But for the purpose of the binary search, the exact order may not matter as long as the list is sorted.\n\nOnce the sorted_by_end list is built, for each voucher in the list, we can compute the prefix min.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_by_start.\n\nNow, how to perform the binary search for case 1 and case 2.\n\nCase 1: find the maximum ri in the sorted_by_end list that is less than A's li. The list is sorted, so we can use bisect_left or bisect_right. For example, using bisect_left to find the insertion point of A's li in the list of ri's. Then, the number of elements less than A's li is the insertion index. So the prefix_min up to that index (if any) gives the minimum cost.\n\nFor example, suppose the list of end times is [2,3,5,7], and A's li is 4. The insertion point is 2 (since 4 would be inserted between 3 and 5). So the elements less than 4 are up to index 1 (element 3). So the prefix_min up to index 1 gives the minimum.\n\nSimilarly for case 2: find the first start time in the sorted_by_start list that is greater than A's ri. The list is sorted, so we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point of A's ri, and then all elements from that index onwards are start times > A's ri. The suffix_min from that index gives the minimum cost.\n\nSo the steps for case 1:\n\nsorted_ri_list = [voucher.ri for voucher in sorted_by_end]\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_ri_list, A.li)\n\nif index > 0:\n\n   min_cost_case1 = prefix_min[index - 1]\n\nelse:\n\n   no case 1.\n\nSimilarly for case 2:\n\nsorted_li_list = [voucher.li for voucher in sorted_by_start]\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_li_list, A.ri)\n\nif index < len(sorted_li_list):\n\n   min_cost_case2 = suffix_min[index]\n\nelse:\n\n   no case 2.\n\nNow, the problem is to precompute these sorted lists and their corresponding prefix/suffix min arrays.\n\nSo, for each duration d in duration_map:\n\n   vouchers = list of vouchers with duration d.\n\n   sorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: (x.ri, x.li)) ?\n\n   sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: (x.li, x.ri)) ?\n\nThen, for sorted_by_end:\n\n   create a list of ri's (for binary search).\n\n   create a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost of the first i+1 vouchers.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_by_start:\n\n   create a list of li's (for binary search).\n\n   create a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end.\n\nSo, for example, for the prefix_min array:\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0].cost\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly, for the suffix_min array:\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1].cost\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(sorted_by_start[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1])\n\nOnce all that is done, during the processing of each voucher A, we can look up the target_d and perform the two cases.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen read n vouchers, storing li, ri, cost. Also compute duration for each.\n\nGroup them into duration_map: a dictionary mapping duration to list of vouchers.\n\nFor each duration in duration_map, pre-process sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start, along with their prefix/suffix min arrays.\n\nThen, for each voucher A in all vouchers:\n\n   d_A = ri_A - li_A + 1\n\n   target_d = x - d_A\n\n   if target_d not in duration_map: continue\n\n   else:\n\n      process case 1 and case 2 as above.\n\n      if case 1 has a value, add to possible min.\n\n      if case 2 has a value, add to possible min.\n\n      take the minimum of these two, and compare with the global min.\n\nFinally, after processing all vouchers, if the global min was found, output it. Else, output -1.\n\nNow, the edge cases:\n\n- x is less than 2 (but according to input constraints, x >= 2? No, input says x can be 2. Wait, the input constraints are 2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5. So x can be as small as 2. So in the case where x is 2, and each voucher has duration 1. So two vouchers with duration 1, non-overlapping.\n\nAnother edge case: when there are no two vouchers that satisfy the conditions.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nIn Python, for each duration in duration_map, we can process:\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: (v.ri, v.li))\n\nthen, create a list of ri's for binary search.\n\nSimilarly, sorted_by_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: (v.li, v.ri)).\n\nThen, for the prefix min:\n\nprefix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_end)\n\nprefix_min[0] = sorted_by_end[0].cost\n\nfor i in 1 to len(sorted_by_end)-1:\n\n   prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_by_end[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for suffix_min:\n\nsuffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = sorted_by_start[-1].cost\n\nfor i in len(sorted_by_start)-2 downto 0:\n\n   suffix_min[i] = min( sorted_by_start[i].cost, suffix_min[i+1] )\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher A, we can proceed.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut how to represent the vouchers? As tuples or objects. Since in Python, it's easier to use tuples.\n\nSo, for each voucher, we can store (li, ri, cost).\n\nNow, for the duration_map, we can have:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor each voucher in input:\n\n   li, ri, cost = ...\n\n   duration = ri - li + 1\n\n   duration_map[duration].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_map, process sorted_by_end and sorted_by_start, along with their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nBut how to store these for each duration? We can have another dictionary, say, preprocessed_data, which maps duration to a tuple of (sorted_by_end_ri_list, prefix_min, sorted_by_start_li_list, suffix_min).\n\nBut perhaps for each duration, we can store:\n\n- sorted_end_list: list of (li, ri, cost), sorted by ri then li.\n\n- sorted_start_list: list of (li, ri, cost), sorted by li then ri.\n\n- prefix_min_end: list of min cost up to each index in sorted_end_list.\n\n- prefix_min_start: list of min cost up to each index in sorted_start_list? No, for the sorted_start_list, we need the suffix min.\n\nWait, for the sorted_start_list, the suffix_min is computed. So for each duration, we can have:\n\npreprocessed_data[d] = (sorted_end_list, prefix_min_end, sorted_start_list, suffix_min_start)\n\nBut how to generate these.\n\nSo, code steps for preprocessing:\n\npreprocessed = {}\n\nfor d in duration_map:\n\n   vouchers = duration_map[d]\n\n   # process sorted_end_list\n\n   sorted_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))  # sort by ri, then li\n\n   # create list of ri's for binary search\n\n   end_ri_list = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n\n   # compute prefix_min_end\n\n   prefix_min_end = [0]*len(sorted_end)\n\n   prefix_min_end[0] = sorted_end[0][2]\n\n   for i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n\n       prefix_min_end[i] = min( prefix_min_end[i-1], sorted_end[i][2] )\n\n   # process sorted_start_list\n\n   sorted_start = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))  # sort by li, then ri\n\n   # create list of li's for binary search\n\n   start_li_list = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n\n   # compute suffix_min_start\n\n   suffix_min_start = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n\n   suffix_min_start[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n\n   for i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n\n       suffix_min_start[i] = min( sorted_start[i][2], suffix_min_start[i+1] )\n\n   # store in preprocessed\n\n   preprocessed[d] = (sorted_end, prefix_min_end, end_ri_list, sorted_start, suffix_min_start, start_li_list)\n\nBut perhaps storing the sorted_end and sorted_start lists is redundant, since the end_ri_list and start_li_list can be generated from them. But for the purposes of the code, during the processing, when we need to find the prefix_min_end, we can refer to the prefix_min_end array.\n\nOnce this is done, for each voucher A, we can process as follows:\n\ncurrent_li, current_ri, current_cost = voucher A's data.\n\ntarget_d = x - (current_ri - current_li + 1)\n\nif target_d not in preprocessed: continue.\n\nelse:\n\n   get the preprocessed data for target_d:\n\n   sorted_end, prefix_min_end, end_ri_list, sorted_start, suffix_min_start, start_li_list = preprocessed[target_d]\n\n   # case 1: B ends before A's li\n\n   # find in end_ri_list the largest value < current_li\n\n   # using bisect_left\n\n   import bisect\n\n   idx = bisect.bisect_left(end_ri_list, current_li)\n\n   if idx > 0:\n\n       min_case1 = prefix_min_end[idx-1]\n\n   else:\n\n       min_case1 = infinity\n\n   # case 2: B starts after A's ri\n\n   # find in start_li_list the first value > current_ri\n\n   # using bisect_right\n\n   idx = bisect.bisect_right(start_li_list, current_ri)\n\n   if idx < len(start_li_list):\n\n       min_case2 = suffix_min_start[idx]\n\n   else:\n\n       min_case2 = infinity\n\n   current_min = min( min_case1, min_case2 )\n\n   if current_min is not infinity:\n\n       total = current_cost + current_min\n\n       update global_min if needed.\n\nNow, the global_min is initialized to infinity, and after processing all vouchers, if it's still infinity, output -1 else output the global_min.\n\nBut wait, the code for case 1 and case 2 may have both values. So for each voucher, we check both possibilities.\n\nNow, the code can be written in Python.\n\nBut what about the time complexity?\n\nFor each voucher, the processing is O(log m), where m is the number of vouchers in the target_d group. So overall time is O(n log n), which should be acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nBut how about the preprocessing steps?\n\nFor each duration d, we sort the vouchers in O(m log m) time, where m is the number of vouchers for that duration. Summing over all durations, the total time is O(n log n), since all vouchers are processed once.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 → duration is 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nSo x is 5. For each voucher:\n\nVoucher 1: duration 3. target_d is 5-3=2. So look for vouchers with duration 2.\n\npreprocessed data for duration 2 includes three vouchers: (1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4). Wait, no, original vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 2: (1,2,5) → duration 2\n\nvoucher 3: (5,6,1) → duration 2\n\nvoucher 4: (1,2,4) → duration 2\n\nSo sorted_end for duration 2 is sorted by ri (which is 2 for all three, then by li). So sorted_end would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]? No, the ri for the first two is 2, and for the third is 6. So sorted by ri, the third voucher comes last. So sorted_end for duration 2 is [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]. The end_ri_list would be [2, 2, 6].\n\nprefix_min_end for this would be [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4, 1)=1]. So prefix_min_end is [5,4,1].\n\nsorted_start for duration 2 is sorted by li (then ri). The li's are 1,1,5. So the sorted_start list would be [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)]. The start_li_list is [1,1,5]. suffix_min_start would be [min(5, min(4,1)), ... ].\n\nLet's compute suffix_min_start:\n\nStart from the end:\n\nindex 2: 1 → suffix_min_start[2] = 1.\n\nindex 1: min(4, 1) → 1.\n\nindex 0: min(5, 1) → 1.\n\nSo suffix_min_start is [1, 1, 1].\n\nNow, for voucher 1 (li=1, ri=3, cost=4). target_d=2. So:\n\ncase 1: B ends before 1 (current_li is 1). end_ri_list is [2,2,6]. bisect_left([2,2,6], 1) → returns 0. idx is 0. So idx>0 is false. case1 is infinity.\n\ncase2:",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to help Leha find two non-overlapping travel vouchers whose combined duration exactly matches his vacation length, while minimizing the total cost. The solution involves efficiently searching for valid voucher pairs using preprocessing and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, group all vouchers by their duration. This allows us to quickly access vouchers of specific durations when checking for valid pairs.\n2. **Preprocess Data Structures**: For each duration, sort vouchers by their end times and start times. Additionally, create prefix minimum arrays for end-sorted lists and suffix minimum arrays for start-sorted lists. These arrays help in quickly finding the minimum cost of valid vouchers during the search phase.\n3. **Binary Search for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher of the required duration (calculated as `x - current duration`) that does not overlap with it. Use binary search on the preprocessed data structures to efficiently find these valid pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    duration_map = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        duration_map[duration].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    preprocessed = dict()\n    \n    for d in duration_map:\n        vouchers_d = duration_map[d]\n        # Process sorted by end time (ri)\n        sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))\n        end_ri_list = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n        prefix_min_end = [0] * len(sorted_end)\n        prefix_min_end[0] = sorted_end[0][2]\n        for i in range(1, len(sorted_end)):\n            prefix_min_end[i] = min(prefix_min_end[i-1], sorted_end[i][2])\n        \n        # Process sorted by start time (li)\n        sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n        start_li_list = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n        suffix_min_start = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n        suffix_min_start[-1] = sorted_start[-1][2]\n        for i in range(len(sorted_start)-2, -1, -1):\n            suffix_min_start[i] = min(sorted_start[i][2], suffix_min_start[i+1])\n        \n        preprocessed[d] = (sorted_end, prefix_min_end, end_ri_list, sorted_start, suffix_min_start, start_li_list)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for li_a, ri_a, cost_a in vouchers:\n        duration_a = ri_a - li_a + 1\n        target_d = x - duration_a\n        if target_d not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        \n        sorted_end, prefix_min_end, end_ri_list, sorted_start, suffix_min_start, start_li_list = preprocessed[target_d]\n        \n        # Case 1: B ends before A starts\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(end_ri_list, li_a)\n        case1 = float('inf')\n        if idx > 0:\n            case1 = prefix_min_end[idx - 1]\n        \n        # Case 2: B starts after A ends\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(start_li_list, ri_a)\n        case2 = float('inf')\n        if idx < len(start_li_list):\n            case2 = suffix_min_start[idx]\n        \n        current_min = min(case1, case2)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = cost_a + current_min\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers, each represented by its start day, end day, and cost.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary for efficient lookup.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end times and start times.
