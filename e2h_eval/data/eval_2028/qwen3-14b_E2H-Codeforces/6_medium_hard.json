Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about Leha choosing two vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x days, and they don't overlap. And we have to find the minimal total cost of such a pair. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. Each voucher has li (departure day), ri (return day), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. The two vouchers must not intersect. That means either the first ends before the second starts (ri < lj) or the second ends before the first starts (rj < li). Also, the sum of their durations must be exactly x.\n\nThe challenge is to find such pairs efficiently given the constraints on n (up to 2e5). A brute-force approach of checking all possible pairs would be O(n²), which is way too slow for n=2e5. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For each voucher, if we can find another voucher that doesn't overlap with it and has duration (x - current duration), then we can check the cost.\n\nBut how do we find those efficiently?\n\nLet me break down the problem. For each voucher i, compute its duration d_i = ri - li + 1. We need to find a voucher j where d_j = x - d_i, and the vouchers don't overlap.\n\nSo, for each voucher i, we can look for vouchers j with duration equal to (x - d_i), and that are either completely before or completely after voucher i.\n\nBut how do we find the minimum cost for such vouchers j?\n\nAn idea is to pre-process vouchers by their duration. For example, create a dictionary where the key is the duration, and the value is a list of (li, ri, cost) for vouchers with that duration. Then, for each voucher i with duration d, we check if there's a duration (x - d) in the dictionary. If yes, then for all vouchers j in that duration group, check if they don't overlap with i.\n\nBut even this approach might be O(n^2) in worst case, like when all vouchers have duration d and x - d is also d, and all pairs are non-overlapping. However, maybe we can optimize this by pre-processing for each duration, the earliest end time and earliest start time, or something like that.\n\nWait, but for each voucher i, when looking for vouchers j with duration t = x - d_i, we need to find the minimum cost among those j that are either entirely before i or entirely after i.\n\nSo for each voucher i, for the required t, we can check:\n\n- All vouchers j with duration t that end before li (so rj < li). These are valid.\n- All vouchers j with duration t that start after ri (so lj > ri). These are valid.\n\nIf we can find the minimum cost in these two groups, then for voucher i, the minimal possible pair is min(cost_i + min_cost_before, cost_i + min_cost_after).\n\nBut how do we find the min_cost_before and min_cost_after quickly?\n\nFor that, perhaps for each duration t, we can pre-process two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of the end times (rj) for vouchers with duration t, along with their minimum cost up to that point. So for any li, we can find the earliest end times that are less than li, and find the minimum cost among those.\n\nAlternatively, for each duration t, we can have two arrays:\n\n1. Sorted list of end times (rj), and for each position in the sorted list, keep track of the minimum cost up to that index. Then, for a given li, we can perform a binary search to find the largest rj that is less than li, and then get the minimum cost up to that point.\n\nSimilarly, for the other part: sorted list of start times (lj) for vouchers with duration t, and for each position, track the minimum cost from that index onwards. Then, for a given ri, find the smallest lj that is greater than ri, and get the minimum cost from that index onwards.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into groups by their duration. So, for each duration d, we have a list of vouchers with that duration.\n\n2. For each duration d, we process two sorted lists:\n\n   a. For the \"before\" case: vouchers with duration d, sorted by their end time (rj). For each such sorted list, we can create a prefix minimum array, so that for any end time <= some value, we can find the minimum cost.\n\n   b. For the \"after\" case: vouchers with duration d, sorted by their start time (lj). For this sorted list, create a suffix minimum array, so that for any start time >= some value, we can find the minimum cost.\n\nOnce these structures are built, for each voucher i with duration di, we can check if there exists a duration t = x - di. If so, then:\n\n- Check the \"before\" group: find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration t that end before li. This is done by searching in the sorted end times list for t, and finding the maximum end time <= li-1. Then, the prefix minimum up to that index gives the min cost.\n\n- Check the \"after\" group: find the minimum cost of vouchers with duration t that start after ri. This is done by searching in the sorted start times list for t, and finding the first start time >= ri+1. The suffix minimum from that index gives the min cost.\n\nThen, for each voucher i, we can compute the possible min cost from these two options and update the global answer.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, group all vouchers by their duration. For example, using a dictionary, say duration_dict, where keys are durations and values are lists of vouchers.\n\nFor each duration d in duration_dict, we process:\n\nFor the before case:\n\nSort the vouchers in duration_dict[d] by their end time (rj). Then, create a prefix_min array where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers in the sorted list.\n\nSimilarly, for the after case:\n\nSort the vouchers in duration_dict[d] by their start time (lj). Then, create a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i-th voucher to the end.\n\nWait, but for the after case, we need to find vouchers that start after ri. So, for the sorted list of lj (start times), we can find the first lj that is >= (ri + 1). All vouchers from that index onwards have start time >= ri + 1. So the minimum cost among them is the suffix_min at that index.\n\nSo for each duration d, we need two sorted lists and their respective min arrays.\n\nOnce all this is preprocessed, for each voucher i, we can do the following steps:\n\nCompute di = ri - li + 1.\n\nt = x - di.\n\nIf t is not present in duration_dict, skip.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck for vouchers with duration t.\n\nFor the \"before\" case:\n\nWe need vouchers j with rj < li. So, in the sorted list of end times for duration t, find the largest rj that is < li. Then, the prefix_min up to that index gives the min cost for vouchers ending before li.\n\nFor the \"after\" case:\n\nWe need vouchers j with lj > ri. So, in the sorted list of start times for duration t, find the first lj that is > ri. Then, the suffix_min from that index gives the min cost for vouchers starting after ri.\n\nIf either of these cases has a valid voucher, then take the min between the two possibilities, add to the current voucher's cost, and update the global answer.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement these steps efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the data structures needed for each duration d.\n\nFor each duration d, we can have:\n\nsorted_ends: list of (rj, cost) sorted by rj. Wait, but we need to sort the vouchers by their end time. So for each voucher in duration d, we collect their end times and sort them. But for the prefix min, we need the minimum cost up to each position. So, for the sorted_ends list, we can have a list of end times, and a corresponding list of prefix minimums.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_starts list, sorted by lj. And for suffix minimums.\n\nBut how to handle the same duration but different vouchers? For example, if multiple vouchers have the same duration and same end time, but different costs. We need to include all of them in the sorted_ends list, but the prefix min will take care of the minimum.\n\nSo, for each duration d, we can pre-process:\n\nsorted_ends_list = sorted(vouchers with duration d, key=lambda x: x.rj)\n\nThen, for each entry in sorted_ends_list, we can compute prefix_min where prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_ends_list[i].cost). Similarly for the sorted_starts_list.\n\nBut for the sorted_starts_list, we need to sort by lj, and then compute a suffix_min array where suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_starts_list[i].cost).\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher i:\n\ndi = ri - li + 1\n\nt = x - di\n\nif t is not in duration_dict, continue.\n\nelse:\n\nfor the t duration:\n\ncase 1: find min cost of vouchers in t that end before li.\n\nIn the sorted_ends_list for t, we can perform a binary search to find the largest end time less than li. Let's say the index is k. Then, if k is >=0, the min cost is prefix_min[k].\n\ncase 2: find min cost of vouchers in t that start after ri.\n\nIn the sorted_starts_list for t, perform a binary search to find the first lj that is greater than ri. Let's say the index is m. If m is not beyond the list, then the min cost is suffix_min[m].\n\nIf either case 1 or case 2 has a valid value, then take the min between them (if both exist) and add to current voucher's cost, then compare with the global answer.\n\nBut how do we handle the binary search?\n\nFor case 1: sorted_ends_list is sorted by end time. We need to find the maximum rj < li. So, the binary search can be done to find the insertion point of li in the list of end times, then subtract one. For example, in Python, the bisect module's bisect_left function returns the first index where the element is >= li. So the index before that would be the largest element less than li. If that index is >=0, then we can take the prefix_min up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for case 2: sorted_starts_list is sorted by lj. We need to find the first lj that is > ri. So, the bisect_right function for ri would give us the first index where lj > ri. Then, if that index is within the list, we can take the suffix_min from that index.\n\nNow, the problem is how to store the sorted_ends_list and sorted_starts_list for each duration, along with their prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nLet me think about implementing this in code.\n\nFirst, group the vouchers by their duration.\n\nThen, for each duration d in the duration_dict:\n\nsorted_ends = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nsorted_starts = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.li)\n\nBut for each of these, we need to precompute the prefix and suffix min arrays.\n\nSo, for sorted_ends, we can create a list of end times (for binary search), and a prefix_min array.\n\nSimilarly for sorted_starts, a list of start times, and a suffix_min array.\n\nBut in code, perhaps for each duration d, we can have:\n\n- ends: list of (rj, cost) sorted by rj. But actually, we can just have a list of the rj's and a separate list of the costs. Or perhaps, since we need to compute the prefix min, we can process the list once and generate the prefix_min array.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose for duration t, we have a list of vouchers sorted by their end time. For each voucher in this list, we can compute the prefix_min as follows:\n\nprefix_min[0] = cost[0]\n\nprefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], cost[i])\n\nSimilarly, for the starts sorted list, the suffix_min is:\n\nsuffix_min[-1] = cost[-1]\n\nsuffix_min[i] = min(cost[i], suffix_min[i+1])\n\nSo, during preprocessing, for each duration d, we can generate:\n\n- ends_sorted: list of end times (ri) of vouchers with duration d, sorted in ascending order.\n\n- ends_costs: list of costs of these vouchers in the same order.\n\n- ends_prefix_min: list of prefix minima for ends_costs.\n\nSimilarly, starts_sorted: list of start times (li) of vouchers with duration d, sorted in ascending order.\n\nstarts_costs: list of costs of these vouchers.\n\nstarts_suffix_min: list of suffix minima for starts_costs.\n\nOnce these are preprocessed, for each voucher i, we can proceed as follows.\n\nSo, the steps in code would be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead all vouchers, compute their duration.\n\nGroup them into a dictionary, where key is duration, and value is a list of vouchers.\n\nFor each duration d in the dictionary:\n\n   process the list of vouchers for that duration:\n\n   sort them by end time (ri), create ends_sorted list, ends_costs list, and compute ends_prefix_min.\n\n   sort them by start time (li), create starts_sorted list, starts_costs list, and compute starts_suffix_min.\n\nStore all these in the dictionary, perhaps as tuples or separate entries.\n\nOnce that is done, iterate through each voucher in the original list.\n\nFor each voucher i:\n\n   di = ri - li + 1\n\n   t = x - di\n\n   if t not in duration_dict, continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      process the t duration's data.\n\n      for the before case:\n\n         find in the ends_sorted list of t, the largest end time < li.\n\n         if found, get the min cost from ends_prefix_min up to that index.\n\n      for the after case:\n\n         find in the starts_sorted list of t, the first start time > ri.\n\n         if found, get the min cost from starts_suffix_min from that index.\n\n      combine these two possibilities, add to current voucher's cost, and track the global minimum.\n\nBut wait, the voucher j can't be the same as voucher i. Because the problem says i != j. So, what if the voucher i's duration is d, and t is x -d, and there's a voucher j in the t group which is the same voucher as i? For example, if x is 2d, and voucher i's duration is d, and there's only one voucher with duration d, which is voucher i itself. Then, when considering the case where we look for vouchers with duration t =d, and check if there is a voucher j that is not i.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nAh, this is a problem. Because when we process voucher i, and look for vouchers in the t group (which could be same as d_i), there may be a voucher j that is the same as i. So, in that case, we need to make sure that j is not i.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nHmm. For example, suppose there are two vouchers with the same duration. Then, when processing voucher i, and looking for vouchers in the t group (same as d_i), we need to ensure that the voucher j is not i.\n\nBut in our approach, when we look for vouchers in the t group, the current voucher i may be part of that group. For example, if voucher i's duration is d, and x is 2d, then t is d. So, when we look for vouchers in the t group, which includes voucher i. However, the code as described would include voucher i in the possible candidates for j. But since we need j != i, we have to check that.\n\nBut how can we handle that?\n\nThis seems complicated. How can we avoid selecting the same voucher twice?\n\nOne approach is, during the processing of the voucher i, when looking for j in the t group, we need to check whether the voucher j is not the same as i. But how can we do that efficiently?\n\nBut for the current approach, when we are considering the vouchers in the t group, we have to make sure that the min cost in the group does not include the same voucher.\n\nBut this complicates the problem. For example, if the voucher i is in the t group (i.e., t is same as d_i), then when we look for the min cost in the t group, we need to exclude voucher i.\n\nSo, how can we handle that?\n\nAn alternative idea is: during the preprocessing, for each duration, we have all vouchers. When checking for voucher i, if the t group is same as d_i, then when we look for the min cost in the t group, we have to make sure that the voucher j is not the same as i.\n\nBut how can we do that efficiently?\n\nThis seems challenging, especially since for each voucher i, we may need to check if the min cost comes from a voucher that is not i.\n\nBut perhaps, the number of such cases is small. For example, if the voucher i is the only one in the t group, then there is no possible j. But if there are multiple vouchers in the t group, then the min cost may be from another voucher.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nWell, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have the list of vouchers, and when processing voucher i, for the t group, we can check if the voucher i is in that group (i.e., t equals d_i). Then, during the binary search steps, we need to exclude voucher i.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems tricky. For example, during the before case, when looking for vouchers in the t group with end time < li, perhaps voucher i is in that group. So, when we find the min cost in that group, we need to check if the voucher i is part of that min. If it is, then we need to find the next minimum, excluding voucher i.\n\nBut how can we do that efficiently?\n\nThis seems complicated and might require additional steps, leading to increased time complexity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the initial grouping, for each duration, we can have multiple copies of the vouchers. Then, when considering voucher i, during the processing of the t group, we can check if the voucher j is not the same as i. However, this would require checking each candidate j, which would be O(1) if we have the min cost, but only if the min cost is not from the same voucher.\n\nBut how can we know that?\n\nAnother idea: when we process the voucher i, and the t group is same as d_i, then during the before case, we can check if the voucher i is in the group. If it is, then the min cost in the group may be the voucher i. So, in that case, we need to find the second min, but that's not feasible.\n\nThis seems very complicated. Maybe there's another way to avoid this problem.\n\nWhat if we process all vouchers, and for each voucher, when considering the t group, we check if there are at least two vouchers in the t group? But that's not sufficient because even if there are two vouchers, the voucher i could be one of them, but the other could be the one that's valid.\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have the list of vouchers, and for each voucher in the list, when we check if the voucher j is in the group, we can check if the voucher j is not the same as the current voucher i.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can allow the current voucher i to be considered as part of the t group, but during the calculation, if the min cost is found to be from voucher i, then we need to check if there's another voucher in the group that can be used.\n\nBut again, this seems complex.\n\nBut maybe the problem is not that bad. Let's think: when we are processing voucher i, and looking for j in the t group (same as d_i), the j must be a different voucher. So, during the binary search steps, when we find the min cost for the t group, we need to check if that min cost comes from a voucher that is not i.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, suppose that during the before case, we find that the min cost is from a voucher j that is not i. Then, it's valid. If the min cost is from voucher i, then we need to see if there's another voucher in the group that can be used.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nThis seems difficult. However, perhaps the probability of this happening is low, and perhaps we can ignore it for now and see if the code passes the test cases. But this is risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can store all the vouchers, and during the binary search steps, we can check if the voucher i is in the group and adjust accordingly.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows for the same voucher to be considered twice. Wait, no. The problem says that i and j must be different vouchers.\n\nSo, in the code, when the current voucher i is in the t group (i.e., t = x - di, which is same as di, if x is 2*di), then during the processing of voucher i, the code may find that the voucher i is part of the group. So, when we find the min cost in the group, we need to ensure that it's not the same voucher.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose there's only one voucher in the t group. Then, when processing voucher i (which is that voucher), there is no possible j. So, we can't use it.\n\nIf there are two vouchers in the t group, and the current voucher i is one of them, then the other can be used.\n\nSo, during the processing of voucher i, when looking for the min cost in the t group, we need to check if the min cost is from a voucher that is not i.\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nPerhaps during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have the list of vouchers, and for each voucher in the group, when we perform the binary search, we can check if the voucher is the same as i. But that would require storing the vouchers' data (like li, ri, cost) in the sorted lists.\n\nAlternatively, during the binary search steps, when we find the min cost, we can check if that min cost is from the current voucher i. If it is, then we need to find the next min cost in the group, excluding the current voucher.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive. For example, in the worst case, for each voucher i, we may need to do O(k) operations, where k is the number of vouchers in the t group.\n\nBut given that the time constraints are tight (n up to 2e5), this approach may not be feasible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can store the vouchers in sorted lists, and for each voucher in the group, when we are processing voucher i, we can check if the voucher i is in the group. If so, then during the binary search, we can exclude it.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor example, during the before case, the sorted_ends list for duration t. Suppose we find the index k where the end time is less than li. Then, among the vouchers up to index k, we have the min cost. However, if the voucher i is in this group (i.e., t is same as di, and voucher i is in the t group), then we need to check if the voucher i is in the first k+1 vouchers. If yes, then the min cost could be from voucher i. In that case, we need to find the next min cost in the group, excluding voucher i.\n\nBut how can we do this quickly?\n\nThis seems really complicated. Perhaps there's a better way.\n\nWait, what if during the preprocessing, for each duration, we store not only the sorted lists and their min arrays, but also for each voucher in the group, we can check if it's present in the group. But again, this seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the initial grouping, we can process all vouchers and for each voucher, when considering the t group, if the t group is same as di, then during the processing, we can check if the voucher i is in the t group, and if so, then when we find the min cost, we can check if it's from the same voucher and adjust accordingly.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have the sorted lists and their min arrays. Then, when processing voucher i, if the t group is same as di, then during the before case, after finding the min cost in the group, we can check if there are at least two vouchers in the group. If there are, then the min cost may be from another voucher. However, this is not guaranteed.\n\nThis seems like a dead end.\n\nLet me think again. What if we allow the current voucher to be considered as j, but then later check if i and j are different? For example, during the processing, when we find the min cost for the group, we can check if the voucher j is not i. However, how can we know which voucher j gives that min cost?\n\nThis requires storing more information. For example, in the prefix_min array, not just the min cost, but also the indices where the min occurs. But that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have for the sorted_ends list, the prefix_min array. But when the voucher i is in the t group, and during the before case, the min cost is found, we can check if there's at least one other voucher in the group that satisfies the condition.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe, during the preprocessing, for each duration, we can have the counts. For example, if the t group has at least one voucher, and during the before case, the voucher i is in the group and is the only one that satisfies the condition (end < li), then we can't use it. Otherwise, we can.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the processing of voucher i, when checking the t group, we can first check if the voucher i is in the t group. If yes, then during the before and after cases, we can check if the voucher i is part of the possible candidates and subtract it from consideration.\n\nBut again, how?\n\nAt this point, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach, assuming that the same voucher is not chosen twice, and then handle the cases where it is chosen by checking if there's another voucher in the group.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for the same voucher to be considered twice, but the code will automatically discard it if it's the only one. However, this would lead to incorrect answers in some cases.\n\nBut given the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach and then see if there's a way to handle this.\n\nLet me think of the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n1 3 4 → duration is 3-1+1=3\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2\n\nSo x is 5. So for each voucher:\n\nFor the first voucher (duration 3), we need to find vouchers with duration 5-3=2. The third voucher has duration 2 (5-6+1=2?), wait no:\n\nWait, for voucher 3: li=5, ri=6. Duration is 6-5+1=2. Yes. So for voucher 1 (duration 3), we need vouchers with duration 2. The other three vouchers (voucher 2,3,4) have durations 2,2,2.\n\nSo when processing voucher 1, during the before case, we look for vouchers with duration 2 that end before li (li is 1). So the end time of voucher j must be <1. But none of the vouchers with duration 2 have end time <1. So the before case is invalid. The after case: look for vouchers with duration 2 that start after ri (voucher 1's ri is 3). So lj >3. Looking at vouchers 2,3,4:\n\nvoucher 2 has lj=1, voucher 3 has lj=5, voucher4 has lj=1. So only voucher3 has lj=5>3. So the after case gives the cost of 1. So total is 4+1=5, which is correct.\n\nNow, during this process, when we check for voucher3 (duration 2), when we look for vouchers with duration x -2 = 5-2=3. So looking for vouchers with duration 3. Which is voucher1. So when voucher3 is processed, during the after case, it would check for vouchers with duration 3 that start after voucher3's ri (6). So voucher1's ri is 3, which is less than 6. So no voucher in duration 3 has start time >6. So the after case would not find anything. The before case would check for vouchers with duration 3 that end before voucher3's li (5). Voucher1's end time is 3 <5. So the before case would find voucher1's cost of 4. So the total is 1+4=5. So the code would find this pair.\n\nSo the code would correctly find the pair (voucher1 and voucher3) in both directions.\n\nBut what if there was a case where the same voucher is considered twice?\n\nFor example, suppose x=4, and there are two vouchers with duration 2. Each has li=1, ri=2 (so duration 2). Now, for voucher1, when looking for vouchers with duration 2 (since x -2 = 2). The before case would look for vouchers ending before li (1). None. The after case would look for vouchers starting after ri (2). So vouchers with lj>2. But there are none. So no solution. But if there were two vouchers, say voucher1 (1-2, cost 1) and voucher2 (3-4, cost 1). Then x=4. So each voucher's duration is 2. So for voucher1, looking for vouchers with duration 2 (t=2). The after case would look for vouchers with lj>2. voucher2's lj is 3>2. So the min cost is 1. So total cost is 1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo in this case, the code would work.\n\nBut what if there's only one voucher with duration 2, and x=4? Then, no solution.\n\nSo the code would handle that.\n\nNow, the problem arises when there's a single voucher in the t group, and it's the same as the current voucher. For example:\n\nn=2, x=4.\n\nvoucher1: li=1, ri=2, cost=1 (duration 2).\n\nvoucher2: li=3, ri=4, cost=1 (duration 2).\n\nSo, x=4. Each voucher has duration 2. So for voucher1, looking for vouchers with duration 2 (t=2). The after case would look for vouchers with lj>2. voucher2's lj is 3>2. So the min cost is 1. So total cost is 1+1=2. Which is correct.\n\nBut if there's only one voucher with duration 2, and x=4. Then, no solution.\n\nSo the code would handle that.\n\nBut what about if there are two vouchers with the same duration and same start/end times, but different costs? For example:\n\nvoucher1: li=1, ri=2, cost=10.\n\nvoucher2: li=1, ri=2, cost=5.\n\nx=4. So each has duration 2. So for voucher1, during the after case, the code would find voucher2 (start time 1 is not > ri (2) of voucher1. So no. Wait, voucher1's ri is 2. So for the after case, vouchers must have lj > 2. voucher2's lj is 1, which is not. So no. So the code would not find anything. But there are two vouchers with duration 2. However, they overlap. So no solution.\n\nSo the code would correctly return -1.\n\nAnother case: voucher1 (1-2, cost 10), voucher2 (3-4, cost 5). x=4. So voucher1's after case finds voucher2. So total cost 10+5=15. voucher2's after case looks for vouchers with duration 2 (x-2=2) that start after 4. None. voucher2's before case looks for vouchers with duration 2 that end before 3. voucher1 ends at 2 <3. So cost is 10. So total is 5+10=15. So code would find the correct answer.\n\nSo the code seems to handle the cases where the same voucher is not selected twice. But what if there is only one voucher in the group, and it's the same as the current voucher?\n\nFor example, n=1, but the problem says n >=2. Oh, the input constraints say n >=2. So the code doesn't have to handle cases where there is only one voucher in the group. Because when processing voucher i, the t group may have only one voucher, which is i. But since there are other vouchers in the group (because n >=2?), no. Wait, no. For example, if n=2, and both vouchers have duration d. Then, when processing voucher1, the t group is x -d. Suppose x is 2d. Then, the t group is d, and there are two vouchers in the group. So during processing voucher1, the code can find voucher2 as a valid j.\n\nThus, the code would not have a situation where the same voucher is selected twice. Because the t group would have at least one other voucher.\n\nWait, but what if the voucher i is the only one in the t group? No, because the t group is for duration t=x -di. For example, if x=2d, and voucher i's duration is d. The t group is d. But if there is only one voucher in the t group (i.e., voucher i), then there is no other voucher. Hence, during processing, the code would not find any valid j. Thus, the code would not select the same voucher twice.\n\nSo, the initial approach would not select the same voucher twice, because for the t group, there must be at least one other voucher (since the code is processing voucher i, and the t group includes voucher i, but during the processing, the code looks for vouchers j that are not overlapping with i. But if the t group has only one voucher (i), then during the processing, the code would not find any valid j, since it's the only one in the group and it overlaps with i.\n\nWait, but if the t group has only one voucher, which is i, then during the before case, it would check if that voucher ends before i's li. But since the voucher is i, its end time is ri. So ri < li? No, because li is the start time of voucher i, and ri is the end time. So ri >= li. So the before case would not find it. Similarly for the after case, the voucher's lj is li, which is not greater than ri. So no. Hence, the code would not consider it. Thus, the code would not select the same voucher twice.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach is safe. The same voucher is not selected twice, because during the processing of voucher i, when looking for j in the t group, the code would not find voucher i as a valid candidate for either the before or after case.\n\nThus, the initial approach is correct and does not require any special handling for the same voucher.\n\nSo, this is a relief. So I can proceed with the initial approach.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nLet's outline the steps again.\n\nImplementing:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nFor each of the n vouchers, read li, ri, cost. Compute duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup all vouchers by their duration. For example, using a dictionary, where keys are durations, and values are lists of vouchers.\n\nFor each duration d in the dictionary, preprocess:\n\nSort the vouchers by their end time (ri), create a list of end times, and a prefix min array.\n\nSort the vouchers by their start time (li), create a list of start times, and a suffix min array.\n\nOnce this is done, iterate over each voucher in the original list:\n\nFor voucher i with li, ri, cost_i, duration_di:\n\nt = x - duration_di.\n\nIf t not in the duration_dict, continue.\n\nElse:\n\nProcess the t group.\n\nCase 1: find vouchers in t group with end time < li.\n\nTo do this:\n\nIn the t group's sorted_ends list, which is sorted by end time.\n\nUse bisect to find the rightmost end time < li.\n\nIf found, get the prefix_min up to that index.\n\nCase 2: find vouchers in t group with start time > ri.\n\nIn the t group's sorted_starts list, which is sorted by start time.\n\nUse bisect to find the leftmost start time > ri.\n\nIf found, get the suffix_min from that index.\n\nTake the min between case1 and case2, and add to cost_i. Update the global answer.\n\nNow, the code needs to implement this.\n\nBut how to represent the sorted_ends and sorted_starts for each duration.\n\nIn Python, for each duration, we can store:\n\n- ends_sorted: list of end times (ri) sorted.\n\n- ends_prefix_min: list of min costs up to each index.\n\nSimilarly for starts_sorted, starts_suffix_min.\n\nSo, during preprocessing, for each duration d:\n\nvouchers = duration_dict[d]\n\nsorted_by_end = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.ri)\n\nends",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration exactly matches a given number of days, and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently finding vouchers with specific durations when needed.\n2. **Preprocess for Efficient Querying**: For each duration, we preprocess the vouchers into two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by end time (for checking vouchers that end before another voucher starts).\n   - Another sorted by start time (for checking vouchers that start after another voucher ends).\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: Using binary search, we can quickly determine the minimum cost of vouchers that meet the required conditions (non-overlapping and correct duration).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    duration_dict = dict()\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ri = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        cost = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        duration = ri - li + 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost, duration))\n        if duration not in duration_dict:\n            duration_dict[duration] = []\n        duration_dict[duration].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess each duration\n    preprocessed = dict()\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        # Process ends_sorted and prefix_min\n        v_list = duration_dict[d]\n        # Sort by ri (end time)\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(v_list, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        ends = [x[1] for x in sorted_by_end]\n        ends_costs = [x[2] for x in sorted_by_end]\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for cost in ends_costs:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, cost)\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        # Process starts_sorted and suffix_min\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(v_list, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        starts = [x[0] for x in sorted_by_start]\n        starts_costs = [x[2] for x in sorted_by_start]\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(starts_costs)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(starts_costs)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, starts_costs[i])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        preprocessed[d] = (ends, prefix_min, starts, suffix_min)\n    \n    min_total = float('inf')\n    \n    for li, ri, cost_i, duration_i in vouchers:\n        t = x - duration_i\n        if t not in preprocessed:\n            continue\n        # Get the preprocessed data for duration t\n        ends, prefix_min, starts, suffix_min = preprocessed[t]\n        \n        # Case 1: find vouchers ending before li\n        # Binary search for the largest end < li\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(ends, li) - 1\n        if pos >= 0:\n            current_min = prefix_min[pos]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost_i + current_min)\n        \n        # Case 2: find vouchers starting after ri\n        # Binary search for the first start > ri\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(starts, ri)\n        if pos < len(starts):\n            current_min = suffix_min[pos]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost_i + current_min)\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into vouchers, each with their start day, end day, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by end time and start time. Prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays are created to quickly find the minimum cost for valid vouchers.\n4. **Querying for Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists another voucher with the required duration that does not overlap. Binary search is used to efficiently find these valid vouchers and compute the minimum cost.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible valid pairs while maintaining a time complexity that is feasible for large inputs.",
