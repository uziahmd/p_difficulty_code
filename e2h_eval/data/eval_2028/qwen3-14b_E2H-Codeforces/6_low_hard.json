Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding two non-overlapping vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x, and their total cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the constraints. Each voucher has a duration of ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j where the sum of their durations is exactly x. Also, they must not overlap. The non-overlapping condition is that either ri < lj or rj < li. So, one ends before the other starts.\n\nSo the approach is to find all pairs of vouchers that satisfy these conditions and have their durations sum to x, then find the minimum cost among them.\n\nBut with n up to 2e5, checking all possible pairs would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. So we need an efficient way.\n\nLet me think: For each voucher, we can check if there exists another voucher that has duration (x - current duration), and doesn't overlap with it. But how to find the minimal cost for that?\n\nLet me think about pre-processing. For each possible duration d, we can keep track of the minimal cost for vouchers of that duration. But since x can be up to 2e5, and each voucher's duration can be up to 2e5 as well, maybe we can do something like this:\n\nFor each voucher, compute its duration d. Then, check if there exists a voucher with duration (x - d). Then, for those vouchers, check if they are non-overlapping with the current voucher.\n\nBut even this approach may not be efficient enough. Because for each voucher, we need to find all vouchers of duration (x - d) that don't overlap with it. How can we find that quickly?\n\nAnother idea: For each voucher, we can consider two cases. One where it's the first voucher (say, with duration d1) and the second voucher has duration d2 = x - d1, and comes after the first voucher (so that the first ends before the second starts). Or the second voucher comes before the first.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration d2 that end before the start of the current voucher, or start after the end of the current voucher.\n\nHmm. Maybe we can pre-process for each possible duration d, the minimal cost of vouchers that end before a certain time, or start after a certain time.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach inspired by some similar problems:\n\nFor each voucher, we can check if there's a voucher of duration (x - d) that ends before the current voucher's start. Or starts after the current voucher's end.\n\nSo for example, suppose we have a voucher A with duration d. Then we need vouchers B with duration (x -d) such that B ends before A starts (so B's end <= A's start -1), or B starts after A ends (B's start >= A's end +1).\n\nSo for each voucher A, we can look for vouchers B with duration (x -d) that end before A's start, or start after A's end. Then find the minimal cost among those B's.\n\nBut how to find the minimal cost of such B's quickly?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with prefix/suffix minima.\n\nLet me think: For each duration value, we can maintain two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of end times of vouchers with that duration, along with their minimal cost up to that end time. So for a given duration d, if we have a voucher B with duration d, and we want to find the minimal cost of vouchers B that end before a certain time (say, s), then we can query the minimal cost in the vouchers of duration d that end before s.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case where B starts after a certain time.\n\nWait, but how to structure that data.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible duration d, we can have two arrays:\n\n- For vouchers of duration d, sorted by their end time. And for each position in this sorted array, we can keep track of the minimum cost up to that point. Then, given a target end time s, we can perform a binary search to find the latest end time that is <= s. Then the minimum cost up to that point would be the minimal cost for vouchers of duration d that end before s.\n\nSimilarly, for the other case where B's start is after a certain time. For that, we can sort the vouchers of duration d by their start time, and for each position, track the minimum cost from that point onwards. Then, given a target start time t, we can binary search for the earliest start time >= t, and get the minimum cost from that point onward.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers by their duration. For each duration d, store two sorted lists:\n\n   a",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their combined duration equals exactly `x` and their total cost is minimized. If no such pair exists, we return `-1`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preprocessing by Duration**: First, we group all vouchers by their duration. This allows us to efficiently check for pairs of vouchers whose durations sum up to `x`.\n2. **Efficient Querying with Binary Search**: For each duration `d`, we maintain two sorted lists:\n   - One sorted by the end time of vouchers, used to find vouchers ending before a given start time.\n   - Another sorted by the start time of vouchers, used to find vouchers starting after a given end time.\n3. **Prefix and Suffix Minimum Arrays**: For each sorted list of vouchers by end or start times, we also maintain arrays of minimum costs up to each index. This allows us to quickly determine the minimum cost of vouchers meeting specific time constraints using binary search.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        l = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        r = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        duration = r - l + 1\n        vouchers.append((l, r, cost, duration))\n\n    # Preprocess: group by duration\n    duration_dict = defaultdict(list)\n    for l, r, cost, d in vouchers:\n        duration_dict[d].append((l, r, cost))\n\n    # For each duration d, we'll create two sorted lists:\n    # 1. sorted by end time, with prefix min cost\n    # 2. sorted by start time, with suffix min cost\n    # So we pre-process each duration's data\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    duration_data = dict()\n\n    for d in duration_dict:\n        lst = duration_dict[d]\n        # Sort by end time\n        sorted_by_end = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for l, r, cost in sorted_by_end:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, cost)\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        # Sort by start time\n        sorted_by_start = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_by_start)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_by_start)-1, -1, -1):\n            l, r, cost = sorted_by_start[i]\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, cost)\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        duration_data[d] = (sorted_by_end, prefix_min, sorted_by_start, suffix_min)\n\n    min_total = float('inf')\n\n    for l1, r1, cost1, d1 in vouchers:\n        d2 = x - d1\n        if d2 < 1:\n            continue\n        if d2 not in duration_data:\n            continue\n        # Check for vouchers with duration d2 that end before l1\n        sorted_by_end, prefix_min, _, _ = duration_data[d2]\n        # Find the largest end <= l1 - 1\n        end_list = [r for (l, r, c) in sorted_by_end]\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(end_list, l1 - 1)\n        if idx > 0:\n            current_min = prefix_min[idx-1]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost1 + current_min)\n        # Check for vouchers with duration d2 that start after r1\n        _, _, sorted_by_start, suffix_min = duration_data[d2]\n        start_list = [l for (l, r, c) in sorted_by_start]\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(start_list, r1 + 1)\n        if idx < len(start_list):\n            current_min = suffix_min[idx]\n            min_total = min(min_total, cost1 + current_min)\n\n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into vouchers, each represented by their start time, end time, cost, and duration.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate quick lookups when checking for complementary durations.\n3. **Sorting and Minimization**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by end time and start time. Prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays are created to allow efficient range minimum queries.\n4. **Checking Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, we check if there exists a valid complementary voucher (with the required duration) that ends before the current voucher starts or starts after the current voucher ends. Binary search is used to efficiently find these valid pairs and their minimum costs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible valid pairs while keeping the complexity manageable, leading to an optimal solution.",
