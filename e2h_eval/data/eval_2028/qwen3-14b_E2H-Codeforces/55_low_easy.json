Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string — the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum lexicographical string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But we can't swap 0 and 2 directly. Hmm.\n\nSo, what's the key here? Well, since we can swap 0s and 1s, and 1s and 2s, but not 0s and 2s. So the 0s can move past 1s, and 2s can move past 1s, but 0s and 2s can't pass each other. Wait, that's an important point. Because if you can't swap 0 and 2, then their relative order can't be changed. So for example, if there's a 0 followed by a 2, they can't be swapped. So the 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order relative to each other. But 1s can move between 0s and 2s. \n\nSo the idea is that the 0s and 2s can't pass each other. So the positions of 0s and 2s in the original string determine their positions in the final string. But the 1s can be arranged between them. So perhaps we need to process the string in such a way that the 0s and 2s are in their original order, but the 1s are arranged as much as possible to the left (since 1 is bigger than 0 but smaller than 2). Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the goal is to make the lex smallest string. So lex order is determined by the first differing character. So we want as many 0s as possible early in the string, then 1s, then 2s. However, since 0s and 2s can't pass each other, their original order must be preserved. So for example, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, that 0 must come before that 2. Similarly, if there's a 2 followed by a 0, then in the final string, the 2 comes before the 0.\n\nBut the 1s can be moved around. So the approach could be:\n\n- Split the original string into groups of 0s, 1s, and 2s. But perhaps not. Alternatively, think about the positions of 0s and 2s. Let me think: all the 0s and 2s in the original string are fixed in their relative order. So the final string will have the same sequence of 0s and 2s as the original, but with 1s inserted between them. But how?\n\nWait, for example, suppose the original string is \"20\". Then since 2 and 0 can't be swapped, the final string is \"20\" as in the sample input. Which matches the third example.\n\nAnother example: the input is \"100210\". The output is \"001120\". Let's see. The original string has 0s and 2s in positions 0, 1, 3, 5. Wait, original string is '1','0','0','2','1','0' — so the 0s and 2s are in positions 1, 2, 3, 5. The 0s and 2s are in the order 0, 0, 2, 0. So in the final string, those 0s and 2s must be in the same order. So the 0s and 2s in the final string are 0, 0, 2, 0. Now, the 1s can be placed in between. So the original string has two 1s: at position 0 and 4. How can they be arranged?\n\nIn the output \"001120\", the 1s are placed between the first two 0s and the 2. So the idea is that the 1s can be moved as much as possible to the left, but considering the 0s and 2s.\n\nSo here's the plan: the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So the final string will consist of the 0s and 2s in their original order, but with 1s inserted in between. But how to arrange the 1s optimally?\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved past 0s and 2s. For example, if there's a 1 followed by a 0, we can swap them (since they are adjacent and 0 and 1 can be swapped). Wait, no. Wait, the allowed swaps are between adjacent 0 and 1, or adjacent ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing specific adjacent swaps on a given ternary string. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2', but not between '0' and '2'. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that '0's and '2's cannot pass each other, so their relative order in the original string must be preserved. However, '1's can be freely moved around '0's and '2's. Therefore, we can rearrange '1's to be as left as possible while maintaining the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n\nThe approach involves:\n1. Separating the original string into two parts: the positions of '0's and '2's (which must remain in their original order) and the '1's which can be rearranged.\n2. Inserting the '1's into the appropriate positions between the '0's and '2's to form the lexicographically smallest string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    zeros_and_twos = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '0' or c == '2':\n            zeros_and_twos.append(c)\n        else:\n            ones.append(c)\n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < len(zeros_and_twos) and j < len(ones):\n        if zeros_and_twos[i] == '0':\n            result.append('0')\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            result.append('1')\n            j += 1\n    # Add remaining zeros and twos\n    while i < len(zeros_and_twos):\n        result.append(zeros_and_twos[i])\n        i += 1\n    # Add remaining ones\n    while j < len(ones):\n        result.append('1')\n        j += 1\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input and output results\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    test_cases = input_str.split()\n    for case in test_cases:\n        print(min_ternary_string(case))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Separation of Characters**: The input string is split into two lists: one containing '0's and '2's (preserving their order) and another containing all '1's.\n2. **Constructing the Result**: We then construct the result by iterating through both lists. We first append '0's from the `zeros_and_twos` list until we encounter a '2'. At this point, we start appending '1's from the `ones` list. This ensures that '1's are placed as far left as possible while maintaining the relative order of '0's and '2's.\n3. **Appending Remaining Elements**: After exhausting either list, we append any remaining elements from the respective list to the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we achieve the lexicographically smallest string by optimally placing '1's between '0's and '2's while preserving their original relative order. The algorithm efficiently processes the string in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to 100,000 characters.",
