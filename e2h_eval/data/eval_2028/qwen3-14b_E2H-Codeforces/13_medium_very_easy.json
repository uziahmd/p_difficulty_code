For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, let me understand the note order and distances. The notes are in a cyclic order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it loops back to C. Each consecutive pair is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. But the problem mentions that the distance between two notes is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the upper. So for example, C to E is 4 semitones (since C to C# is 1, C# to D is 2, etc. Wait, no. Wait, how many steps between C and E?\n\nLet me think: Let's list the notes in order. Let's assign each note an index. For example:\n\nC is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4, F is 5, F# is 6, G is 7, G# is 8, A is 9, B is 10, H is 11. Then the next note after H is C again (index 0). \n\nThe distance between two notes X and Y (when X is lower than Y) is (Y - X) semitones. But if X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) semitones? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So if we have two notes, say X and Y, the distance is calculated as follows: if X comes before Y in the list, then it's (Y - X) semitones. If Y comes before X, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) semitones? Or wait, perhaps the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is from lower to upper, maybe the actual distance is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y + 12 - X). Wait, but the problem says that the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let's check that. For example, E is index 4, C is index 0. So if we take the distance from E to C, but according to the problem, the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. Wait, but E is higher than C. So the distance between E and C would be the distance from C to E, which is 4 semitones. But the problem says that between E and C is 8 semitones. Oh wait, no. Wait the problem says that the distance is taken from the lowest to the upper. So for example, between C and E is 4 semitones (as C is lower than E). Between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones, because you have to go from E up to C (which wraps around). Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the problem defines the distance between two notes as the minimal number of semitones between them? No, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) semitones. But that would make the distance between E and C (assuming E is lower than C?) No, that's not right. Wait, the problem says that the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. So when X is C and Y is E, the distance is 4. When X is E and Y is C, the distance is (C's position + 12 - E's position) = 0 + 12 -4 = 8. So yes. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y + 12 - X). But how do I compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for two notes, the distance from X to Y is (y_index - x_index) if y_index > x_index, else (y_index + 12 - x_index). But that's equivalent to (y_index - x_index) mod 12, but only if the distance is measured as the number of semitones when moving upward. Wait, no. Because if X is E (index 4), Y is C (index 0), then the distance from X to Y is (0 + 12 -4) = 8. Which is the same as (Y - X + 12) mod 12? Well, (0 -4) is -4, mod 12 is 8. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12? Wait, but that would be the same as the minimal distance? No, because for example, between C and E, (E - C) is 4, mod 12 is 4. Between E and C, (C - E) is -4 mod 12 is 8. So that's exactly the distance described. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, how is that possible? Because for example, if X is C (0) and Y is C again, the distance is zero. But for X being C and Y being C#, the distance is 1. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). But that's exactly the same as (Y - X) mod 12. Because if Y is larger than X, then (Y - X) is positive. If Y is smaller, then (Y - X) is negative, and mod 12 gives the positive value. So for example, (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But how to compute that?\n\nBut for the problem's purposes, when checking for major or minor triads, we need to find if there's an ordering of the three notes where the first to second is 4 semitones, and second to third is 3 semitones (for major), or first to second is 3 and second to third is 4 (for minor).\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- For the three given notes, generate all possible permutations (since the order matters for checking the distances).\n- For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4 and second to third is 3 (major), or first to second is 3 and second to third is 4 (minor).\n- If any permutation satisfies major, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations of the three notes?\n\nWell, since the triad is unordered, but we need to check all possible orderings. For three elements, there are 3! = 6 permutations. For each permutation, check the two conditions.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for a major triad, the three notes must have two intervals of 4 and 3 semitones. However, since the order can be any, but the problem says that the triad is considered as a set. So for example, in the example given, \"C E G\" is major. Let's check the distances between each possible ordering.\n\nBut perhaps the way to approach this is for each of the three possible orderings (since for a triad, there are multiple possible ways to arrange the three notes). But perhaps the easiest way is to generate all permutations of the three notes, and for each permutation, check if the first to second is 4, and second to third is 3 (for major), or first to second is 3 and second to third is 4 (for minor).\n\nSo for each permutation of the three notes, check those two possibilities.\n\nSo first, I need to map each note to its index. Let's create a dictionary for that. The notes are given as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is important. Let's create a list of the notes in order, then map each to their index.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nSo for example, note_to_index = {'C':0, 'C#':1, ... etc}\n\nOnce I have that, for any two notes X and Y, I can calculate the distance from X to Y as (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. Wait, no. Because the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper. So for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), the distance is 4. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), the distance is 8. But according to (Y_index - X_index) mod 12, for X=E, Y=C, that would be (0 -4) mod 12 = 8. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. Wait, but in the problem statement, the distance between X and Y is taken as the distance from the lower to the upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. Otherwise, it's (Y + 12 - X). Which is the same as (Y - X) if positive, else (Y - X + 12). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12. So yes.\n\nBut for the purpose of checking the major and minor triads, the problem says that for a major triad, there exists an ordering where the first to second is 4, and second to third is 3. So for example, in the case of C E G, the order X, Y, Z is C, E, G. The distance between X and Y is 4 (E - C is 4), and between Y and Z is 3 (G - E is 2? Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nWait, E is index 4, G is index 7. So (7 -4) is 3. Yes. So that's correct. So the distance between E and G is 3 semitones. So that's a major triad.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each permutation of the three notes (X, Y, Z):\n\nCheck if distance(X,Y) is 4 and distance(Y,Z) is 3. If yes, then it's a major triad.\n\nOr check if distance(X,Y) is 3 and distance(Y,Z) is 4. If yes, then it's a minor triad.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor. Else, 'strange'.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\n1. Read the input: three notes. For example, input could be like ['C E G', 'C# B F', ...], but the actual input is three space-separated notes. Wait, the input is a single line with three space-separated notes. For example, in the sample input, the first input is 'C E G' (but the input is given as a list of three elements, but in the problem statement, the input is given as a single line with three notes. The sample input shows that the first example input is ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], but that's probably part of the example for the output. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the only line contains 3 space-separated notes. So for example, in the sample input, perhaps the input is three lines? No, the sample input shows that the input is a list of three examples. Wait, the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nOutput:\n\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nBut that's probably a typo. Because the problem says that the input is a single line with three notes. So perhaps the sample input is three separate test cases, each with their own input. But the actual code should read a single line, split into three notes.\n\nSo the code needs to read a single line, split into three notes. For example, if the input is 'C E G', then the three notes are 'C', 'E', 'G'.\n\nSo first, the code will process the input line. Let's assume that the input is read as a single line, split into three parts.\n\nNow, the code needs to process each of the three notes.\n\nSo first, create a mapping from note names to their indexes. Let's create a list of the notes in order.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nThen, for a note name, we can find its index by looking up in this list.\n\nBut how to handle the note names? For example, 'C#' is a note. So the note_to_index can be a dictionary:\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nOnce that is done, for each note in the input, we can get their indices.\n\nOnce we have the three indices, we can generate all permutations of the three notes, and for each permutation, check the two conditions.\n\nSo for example, for the three notes, let's say they are a, b, c. Then all permutations are (a, b, c), (a, c, b), (b, a, c), (b, c, a), (c, a, b), (c, b, a). For each of these permutations, check the distances between first and second, and between second and third.\n\nSo for each permutation (x, y, z):\n\ndistance_xy = (y_idx - x_idx) mod 12\n\ndistance_yz = (z_idx - y_idx) mod 12\n\nWait, no. Because the distance between x and y is (y's index - x's index) mod 12. But according to the problem's definition, the distance is from the lower to upper. So, for example, if x is lower than y, the distance is y - x. If x is higher than y, then the distance is (y + 12 - x). Which is the same as (y - x) mod 12. So yes.\n\nSo for the permutation (x, y, z), we compute the distance between x and y (d1) and between y and z (d2).\n\nIf d1 is 4 and d2 is 3, then it's a major triad.\n\nIf d1 is 3 and d2 is 4, then it's a minor triad.\n\nSo for each permutation, check these two possibilities.\n\nOnce any permutation meets the major condition, then return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nNow, how to generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nIn Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, for the list of three notes, permutations returns all possible orderings.\n\nBut for the code, the steps are:\n\nRead the three notes.\n\nConvert each note to its index.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three indices.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCompute d1 = (y - x) mod 12\n\nCompute d2 = (z - y) mod 12\n\nCheck if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3 → if yes, then it's a major.\n\nCheck if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → if yes, then it's a minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, then return 'major'.\n\nSimilarly for minor.\n\nSo the code can check all permutations, and if any of them meets the major condition, then output 'major'; same for minor.\n\nNow, the code needs to process the three notes. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, the note_to_index dictionary.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nBut what about the input notes? For example, the input could be 'C#', which is present in the list.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead input line as a string, split into three parts.\n\nFor example, input_line = input().strip()\n\nnotes = input_line.split()\n\nThen, for each note in notes, get their index.\n\nBut first, need to make sure that the note is in the note_to_index. But according to the problem statement, the input will be valid.\n\nOnce we have the three indices, say, a, b, c.\n\nThen generate all permutations of [a, b, c].\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCheck d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\nd2 = (z - y) % 12\n\nif d1 ==4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\nif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nOnce any permutation meets either condition, then return accordingly.\n\nNow, for example, let's take the first sample input: C E G → indices are 0, 4, 7.\n\nPermutation (0,4,7):\n\nd1 is (4-0) mod 12 = 4 → correct. d2 is (7-4)=3 → correct. So major.\n\nAnother permutation may not satisfy, but since one exists, the answer is major.\n\nAnother sample input: C# B F → which is 'C#', 'B', 'F'.\n\nnote_to_index:\n\nC# is 1, B is 10, F is 5.\n\nLooking for permutations. Let's take the permutation B, C#, F → indices 10, 1, 5.\n\nCheck d1: (1 -10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Because 1-10 is -9. Adding 12 gives 3. So d1 is 3. Then d2 is (5 - 1) mod 12 → 4. So 3 and 4 → minor. So this permutation meets the minor condition.\n\nSo code would return minor.\n\nThird sample input: A B H → indices are 9, 10, 11.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's try all permutations.\n\nFor example, permutation A, B, H → indices 9,10,11.\n\nd1 = 10-9 = 1 → mod 12 is 1. d2 = 11-10 = 1. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B → indices 9, 11, 10.\n\nd1: (11-9) = 2 mod 12 → 2. d2: 10 - 11 = -1 mod 12 → 11. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H → indices 10,9,11. d1: 9-10 = -1 mod 12 → 11. d2: 11 -9 = 2. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A → indices 10, 11, 9. d1: 11-10=1 → 1. d2: 9-11 = -2 → 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B → indices 11,9,10. d1: 9-11 = -2 mod 12 → 10. d2: 10-9=1. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A → indices 11,10,9. d1: 10-11 = -1 mod 12 → 11. d2: 9-10 = -1 mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. Hence output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\n- Create the note_to_index dictionary.\n\n- Read the input line, split into three notes.\n\n- Get their indices.\n\n- Generate all permutations of the three indices.\n\n- For each permutation, check the two conditions.\n\nNow, in Python, itertools.permutations can be used.\n\nImport itertools.permutations.\n\nBut for code submission, need to import.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nnotes = input_line.split()\n\n# Get the indices of the three notes\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 ==4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So there's no case where both major and minor are found. So the code can check for major first, then minor, but in the code above, if a permutation satisfies both (unlikely?), but according to the problem statement, that's impossible. So the code can check for major and minor in all permutations.\n\nBut in the code above, for each permutation, we check if it meets major or minor. Once any permutation meets major, found_major is set to True. Similarly for minor. So after checking all permutations, if found_major is True, output major, else if found_minor is True, output minor, else strange.\n\nBut let's think about the example where a permutation meets both conditions. For example, if d1=4 and d2=3, and also d1=3 and d2=4. That's impossible. Because d1 and d2 are fixed for a permutation. So for a permutation, only one of the conditions can be true. So the code is safe.\n\nBut in the code, for each permutation, both checks are done. For example, if a permutation has d1=4 and d2=3, then found_major is set to True. Also, if another permutation has d1=3 and d2=4, then found_minor is set to True. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So in the code, once any permutation meets major, and another permutation meets minor, but according to the problem statement, this can't happen. So the code is okay.\n\nBut in practice, for a given input, it's possible that some permutations meet major, others meet minor? But according to the problem statement, the answer is always unique. So the code can safely check all permutations and if any permutation meets major, then output major, else check if any meets minor.\n\nBut the code above checks all permutations, and if any permutation meets major, found_major is True. Similarly for minor. So even if some permutations meet minor, but there is a permutation that meets major, then the code outputs major.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample input: 'C E G' → the code will generate permutations. One of them is (0,4,7). d1 is 4, d2 is 3. So found_major is True. So output is major.\n\nSample input 'C# B F' → the code will find a permutation (B, C#, F) → indices 10, 1, 5. d1 is (1 -10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 is (5 -1) mod 12 = 4. So found_minor is True. Output 'minor'.\n\nThird sample input 'A B H' → indices 9,10,11. All permutations checked, but none meet the conditions. So output 'strange'.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nNow, edge cases. What about when the same note is repeated? But according to the problem statement, the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But the problem says that the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. But in code, if two notes are same, then the code will process them. For example, input is C C C. Then, all permutations are same. d1 is (0-0) mod 12 = 0. d2 is 0. So no match. Output 'strange'.\n\nAnother test case: C, E, G → major. Another case: C, E, G# → ?\n\nLet's see. C is 0, E is 4, G# is 8. Let's check permutations. For example, (0,4,8). d1 is 4, d2 is 4. Not 3. So not major. Any permutation where the first two are 4 and next is 3? Let's see. For example, (0, 4, 8): d1 is 4, d2 is 4. (0,8,4): d1 is (8-0) = 8 mod 12 → 8. d2 is (4-8) mod 12 → -4 mod 12 → 8. No. So no. So output strange.\n\nAnother example for minor: B, C#, F. Which is the second sample. So code works.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, the permutations are generated for the three indices. For example, if the three notes are the same, then all permutations are same. But the code will check them.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut note that the input is read as a single line. So, for example, if the input is 'C E G', then split into ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nBut what about the note 'H'? It is in the list.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing that.\n\nBut need to import permutations from itertools.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nnotes = input_line.split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nBut for the sample input, the code would process each of the three examples. However, the sample input is given as a list of three examples. But the problem says that the input is a single line with three notes. So for example, the first sample input is 'C E G' → output 'major'.\n\nBut the code reads a single line. So the code is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking the intervals between the notes in all possible permutations to see if they match the criteria for major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: Represent each note as an index in a predefined list of musical notes. This allows us to easily compute the semitone distances between any two notes.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the distance between two notes using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three given notes and check each permutation for the criteria of major or minor triads:\n   - A major triad has intervals of 4 semitones followed by 3 semitones.\n   - A minor triad has intervals of 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_line = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nnotes = input_line.split()\n\nindices = [note_to_index[note] for note in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Indexing**: The notes are mapped to indices from 0 to 11, corresponding to their positions in the musical scale.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input line is read and split into three individual notes.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using permutations, all possible orderings of the three notes are checked. For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated using modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the scale.\n4. **Triad Classification**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major or minor triad, the respective flag is set. Based on these flags, the result is printed as \"major\", \"minor\", or \"strange\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the given notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to determine the correct classification.",
