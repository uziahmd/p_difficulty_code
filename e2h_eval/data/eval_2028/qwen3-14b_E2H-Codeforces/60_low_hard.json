Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. Hmm. The task is to process a string S that's being built step by step by appending 0s and 1s. After each addition, we need to compute the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code. But there are some forbidden Morse codes: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So any substring that matches one of these four is invalid and shouldn't be counted.\n\nWait, but how do we count all possible valid substrings? Because each valid Morse code string (of length 1-4) represents a letter. So for each substring of S, we need to check if it's a valid Morse code (i.e., not in the forbidden list), and then count the number of possible sequences. But the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". Oh right, so each valid substring corresponds to exactly one letter. But sequences of letters would be formed by splitting the Morse code into valid parts. Wait, no. Wait, the question is about sequences of letters. For example, if a substring is \"11\", which is a valid Morse code (say, 'M'), then that's one sequence (just the single letter M). But if there's a longer substring that can be split into multiple valid codes, like \"111\" could be split as \"1\" + \"11\" (T followed by M) or \"11\" + \"1\" (M followed by T), or even \"111\" as O. Each of these splits would count as different sequences. Wait, but how do we count all possible such sequences?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". So each such sequence corresponds to a way of splitting a substring of S into valid Morse code letters. For example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" (valid) → 1 sequence (T)\n- \"11\" (valid) → 1 sequence (M)\n- \"111\" (valid) → 1 sequence (O)\n- \"1\" (second position) → T again\n- \"11\" (positions 2-3) → M again\n- \"1\" (third position) → T again\n\nBut also, for the substring \"111\", we can split it into T followed by M, M followed by T, or O. So each of those splits counts as a separate sequence. So the total number of sequences would be the sum over all possible substrings of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". So each such sequence is formed by taking a substring of S (which is a Morse code string) and splitting it into valid Morse code letters. So each split gives a different sequence. For example, the substring \"11\" can be split as one letter (M), so contributes 1. The substring \"111\" can be split in three ways (as per the example given in the note), contributing 3. So the total for the sample input where S is \"111\" is 3 (from the three individual letters) plus 2 (from the two splits of the substring \"111\")? Wait no, the note says that after the first sample input, the answer is 7. Let me check the note again.\n\nIn the first example, after appending three 1s, S is \"111\". The note says the answer is 7. The explanation lists 7 sequences: T, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT. Wait, how does that break down?\n\nEach of these sequences corresponds to a way of splitting some substring into valid Morse codes. For example:\n\n- T comes from the substring \"1\" (length 1).\n- M comes from \"11\" (length 2).\n- O comes from \"111\" (length 3).\n- TT comes from splitting the substring \"11\" (length 2) as two Ts (each \"1\").\n- TM comes from splitting the substring \"111\" as \"1\" and \"11\".\n- MT comes from splitting \"111\" as \"11\" and \"1\".\n- TTT comes from splitting the substring \"111\" as three Ts.\n\nSo each of these sequences is counted once. However, how do we count all possibilities across all substrings?\n\nThe key here is that for each substring of S, we need to count the number of ways to split it into valid Morse code letters.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing binary string. The binary string is constructed step-by-step by appending either a '0' (dot) or a '1' (dash), and each valid Morse code substring (of length 1 to 4) corresponds to a letter, except for four specific invalid codes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Use a DP array `dp[i]` where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending at position `i` in the current string.\n2. **Forbidden Codes**: Maintain a set of forbidden Morse codes to quickly check if a substring is invalid.\n3. **Iterative Updates**: After each character addition, update the DP array by checking all possible substrings ending at the current position and validating them against the forbidden set.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since results can be very large, use modulo $10^9 + 7$ to keep numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    operations = input[1:m+1]\n    \n    forbidden = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    s = []\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)  # dp[i] is the number of valid sequences ending at position i\n    total = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        s.append(operations[i-1])\n        current_str = ''.join(s)\n        # Check all possible substrings ending at position i\n        # We'll look back up to 4 characters\n        for j in range(i, max(0, i - 4), -1):\n            substring = current_str[j-1:i]\n            if len(substring) < 1 or len(substring) > 4:\n                continue\n            if substring in forbidden:\n                continue\n            if j == 1:\n                # This is a single character, so add 1\n                dp[i] = (dp[i] + 1) % MOD\n            else:\n                # Add the number of sequences ending at j-1\n                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j-1]) % MOD\n        total = (total + dp[i]) % MOD\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations and the sequence of operations.\n2. **Forbidden Set**: A set of forbidden Morse code strings is maintained for quick lookup.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array keeps track of valid sequences ending at each position. For each new character added to the string, we check all possible substrings ending at that position.\n4. **Substring Validation**: For each valid substring (not in the forbidden set), we update the DP array by considering sequences formed by extending previous valid sequences.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: All operations are performed modulo $10^9 + 7$ to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of valid sequences after each modification, leveraging dynamic programming and careful validation of substrings against forbidden codes.",
