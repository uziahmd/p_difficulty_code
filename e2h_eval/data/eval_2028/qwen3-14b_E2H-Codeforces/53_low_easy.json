Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and I have to output the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nHmm. How do I check all possible substrings and see if they appear at least twice?\n\nAn idea: for each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check all substrings of length L. If any of them appears at least twice, return L as the answer. The maximum possible L is the length of the string divided by 2, but maybe even longer if there's overlapping. Wait, for example, in a string of length 5 like 'aaaaa', the maximum possible substring that appears twice is 4 (like 'aaaa' occurs starting at 0 and 1). So the maximum possible L is len(s) - 1. So for each possible L from len(s)-1 down to 1, check if there's a substring of length L that occurs at least twice. Once found, return that L.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Iterate L from the maximum possible (len(s)-1) down to 1.\n2. For each L, generate all substrings of length L in the string.\n3. Check if any of these substrings appears at least two times.\n4. If found, return L as the answer.\n5. If no such substring is found for any L, return 0.\n\nBut how do I efficiently check for duplicates? For each L, collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nFor example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bab' (1-3), 'aba' (2-4). So 'aba' occurs twice. So we can note that.\n\nSo for each L, we can create a set of substrings. If the size of the set is less than the number of substrings (since duplicates would make the set smaller), then there's at least one duplicate. But wait, that's not exactly correct. Because if there are multiple duplicates, but the set counts each unique once. So for example, if there are two same substrings, then the set will have one entry, and the count of substrings is more than the set size. So for each L, generate all substrings, and check if any substring occurs at least twice.\n\nBut how to do that? For each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and for each substring, track how many times it appears. If any count is >=2, then return L.\n\nSo for each L, generate all substrings of length L, and check for duplicates.\n\nNow, the question is how to generate all substrings of length L. For a string s of length n, the number of possible substrings of length L is n - L + 1. For each i in 0 to (n-L), inclusive, the substring is s[i:i+L].\n\nSo for each possible L, starting from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1, we check all substrings of that length. For each L, if any substring occurs at least twice, return L.\n\nNow, the maximum possible L for which this is possible is when the string has at least two occurrences of a substring of length L. For example, if the string is \"aa\", then L=1, since the substring \"a\" occurs twice.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n    seen = {}\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            return L\n        else:\n            seen[substr] = True\nreturn 0\n\nWait, but this would return the first L where a duplicate is found. However, since we're checking from the largest possible L down, once we find such an L, that's the maximum possible. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but for example, in the case of 'zzz', the possible Ls are 2, then 1. For L=2, the substrings are 'zz' (positions 0-1), 'zz' (positions 1-2). So when checking for L=2, the first occurrence is 'zz' (i=0), then when i=1, substr is 'zz' again. So during the loop, when we check substr in seen, which is already present, so return 2",
