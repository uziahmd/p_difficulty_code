Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and the output is the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nHmm. How do I check all possible substrings and their occurrences?\n\nAn straightforward approach could be to check for all possible substring lengths, starting from the maximum possible down to 1. For each length, check if there's a substring of that length that appears at least twice. Once found, return that length as the answer.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFor a given string s of length n:\n\nThe maximum possible length of a substring that can appear at least twice is floor(n/2). Because if the substring is longer than that, there's no way to have two non-overlapping occurrences. Wait, but the problem allows overlapping. For example, in 'aaaaa', the substring 'aaa' occurs multiple times. But for the maximum possible length, maybe it's up to n-1. Like for a string of length 2, the maximum possible is 1 (like 'aa').\n\nSo for the general case, the maximum possible length to check is n-1. But for the case where the substring can be found twice, even overlapping, the maximum possible length would be such that there are two positions where the substring starts. For example, in a string of length 5, the maximum possible length for a substring that occurs twice is 3 (like in 'ababa').\n\nSo, for each possible length L, starting from the maximum possible (which is len(s)-1) down to 1, we check if there exists a substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once we find the largest such L, we return it.\n\nNow, how to check for each L?\n\nFor each L, iterate through all possible starting indices i, such that i + L <= len(s). For each i, take the substring s[i:i+L], and check if it appears again in the string. But how to check that?\n\nWe can collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs at least twice. For example, for each L, create a set of all substrings of that length, and check if any of them has a count >=2.\n\nWait, but the same substring can appear multiple times. So for each L, generate all possible substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nSo for example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bab' (1-3), 'aba' (2-4). So the substring 'aba' appears twice. So for this L, we return 3.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\nFor L in range (max_length down to 1):\n\n   create a set of all substrings of length L. If any of them occurs more than once, return L.\n\nBut wait, how to check if a substring occurs more than once? Because when you collect all substrings of length L, if there are two same entries, then that means the substring appears at least twice. So for example, if the set has a substring that occurs multiple times, but how to check that?\n\nWait, no. Because if you collect all substrings of length L, and check if the count of any substring is >=2. So for example, using a dictionary to count frequencies.\n\nSo for each L, we can generate all substrings of length L, and check if any of them appears at least twice.\n\nBut for the problem, since the string can be up to 100 characters, the maximum possible L is 99. For each L, the number of substrings is O(n) (for L=1, 100 substrings, for L=99, 2 substrings). So for each L, the processing is O(n) time. And the total number of possible L is O(n). So overall time is O(n^2), which for n=100 is acceptable.\n\nSo the steps for the code would be:\n\nRead the input string.\n\nCompute n = len(s). If n is 0, return 0 (but the problem says it's non-empty).\n\nInitialize max_length to 0.\n\nFor L in range from n-1 down to 1:\n\n   create a dictionary or a set to track substrings.\n\n   for i in 0 to (n - L):\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr appears in the set, then return L as the answer (since we are",
