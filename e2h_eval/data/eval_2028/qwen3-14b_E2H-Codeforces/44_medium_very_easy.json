He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, Polycarp has n problems arranged in order, and he wants to split them into exactly k days. Each day he solves a contiguous block starting from the beginning. So the first day's problems are the first t1 problems, then the next day starts from t1+1, etc. Each day must have at least one problem. The total profit is the sum of the maximum difficulty each day. Our goal is to maximize this total profit.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Because for each position and number of days, we can track the maximum profit.\n\nLet's consider dp[i][j] as the maximum profit for the first i problems split into j days. Then, the recurrence would be:\n\nFor dp[i][j], we can look back to some m < i, and take the maximum of dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut for n up to 2000 and k up to 2000, this might be O(n^2 *k) time. Let's see: for each i and j, we need to check all possible m. For n=2000 and k=2000, that's O(2000^3) which is 8e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to optimize this. Let's think about the constraints. Wait, n is up to 2000, and k up to n. But for each j, the number of days, we can compute it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can precompute the max for ranges. Like, for any interval [m+1, i], we can compute the max quickly. So, precomputing a 2D array max_range where max_range[m][i] is the max of a[m..i]. Then, when we compute dp[i][j], we can check for all m from j-1 to i-1 (since each previous day must have at least one problem). But even with that, the time complexity is O(n^2 *k), which for 2000 is 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow. So this approach isn't feasible for n=2000.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the problem again. Since the splits are contiguous and the days are sequential, perhaps there's a way to find the optimal way to split.\n\nAnother thought: since each day's maximum is the maximum of the problems in that day, and since the days are contiguous, the maximum for a day is the maximum of the elements in that segment. So, for example, if we have a segment that includes a very large number, it's better to have that as a separate day, but how does that fit into the overall structure?\n\nBut given that we have to split into exactly k days, perhaps the optimal way is to split the array into k segments, where each segment's maximum is as large as possible. However, since the sum is additive, we need to find a way to maximize the sum of these maxima.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternative approach: For each day, the maximum is determined by the maximum in that segment. Since the segments are consecutive, and each day's segment starts right after the previous one ends.\n\nAnother idea: Since the problem requires splitting into exactly k days, and the segments are consecutive, the problem is similar to partitioning the array into k parts, with each part being a contiguous segment. The cost for each part is the max of that part. We need to find the partition that maximizes the sum of these costs.\n\nThis is similar to a classic dynamic programming problem. Let me think again about the DP approach.\n\nLet's define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i problems split into j days. Then, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i][j] = max{ dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) } for m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nThe base case is dp[1][1] = a[1], and for j=1, dp[i][1] is the max of the first i elements.\n\nBut with n=2000 and k=2000, even with this approach, the time complexity is O(n^2 *k). Let's calculate for n=2000 and k=2000: 2000*2000*2000 = 8e10 operations. That's way too big. Even with optimizations, this would not work. So we need to find a way to optimize this.\n\nBut maybe the constraints are not that tight. For example, if k is small, but for the worst case, it's still impossible. So perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, what's the maximum value of k? It's n. So when k equals n, each day has exactly one problem. The total profit is the sum of all a_i. So for that case, the answer is straightforward.\n\nBut when k is smaller than n, how can we find an efficient way?\n\nAlternative idea: Precompute the max_range for all intervals. Then, for each dp[i][j], we can compute the max from m+1 to i quickly.\n\nBut even with that, the DP approach is O(n^2*k) time. For n=2000 and k=2000, that's impossible. However, considering that n is 2000, and for each i and j, the inner loop is O(i) steps. Let's think about the actual numbers. For example, for n=2000 and k=2000, the DP would be filled for j up to k. But when j is 2000, then for each i, j must be equal to i. So for each i and j, the possible j ranges from 1 to min(k, i). So for the worst case, when k is 2000, and n is 2000, the total number of states is O(nk) = 4e6. For each state, the inner loop would be O(i) steps. But for j=2000, i must be 2000. So for each state (i,j), the inner loop runs O(i) steps. So total operations would be O(n^2 *k) in the worst case. Which is 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow for Python, which can handle around 1e8 operations per second. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nWe need to find a better way. Let's think again.\n\nWhat if we can find a way to compute the DP efficiently, perhaps by using some properties of the max function.\n\nAnother observation: When splitting into j days, the last day's segment is from m+1 to i. The maximum of that segment is the maximum of a[m+1 ... i]. But for each i and j, when we compute dp[i][j], we can think of trying different m's, but perhaps there's a way to find the best m quickly.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, for each j, the DP[i][j] depends on the DP[m][j-1] plus the max of the segment from m+1 to i. Let's think about for a fixed j, and varying i. For example, for j=2, we can compute for each i, the best m (from 1 to i-1) such that DP[m][1] + max(a[m+1..i]) is maximized.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently.\n\nBut the max(a[m+1..i]) for varying m can be tricky. However, for a fixed i, and varying m, the max from m+1 to i can be precomputed. For example, for each i, we can precompute for all m < i, the max from m+1 to i. But even that is O(n^2) time and space.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute a 2D array max_range where max_range[m][i] is the maximum of a[m..i], for all 1 <= m <= i <= n.\n\nYes. And that can be computed in O(n^2) time. For each i, we can compute the max for all m from 1 to i. For example, for each i, start from m=i, and go backward. For m from i down to 1, max_range[m][i] = max(a[m], max_range[m+1][i]). But that would be O(n^2) time. Which is acceptable for n=2000, as 2000^2 is 4 million.\n\nOnce we have this max_range array, then for each dp[i][j], we can compute the max from m+1 to i as max_range[m+1][i].\n\nSo with that, the DP approach is possible, but the problem is the time complexity.\n\nBut let's think about the constraints. Let's suppose that n is 2000, and k is 2000. Then, the DP will have O(n^2) states, but for each state, the inner loop is O(1) steps. Wait, no. Because for each dp[i][j], we need to check all possible m where the previous day is j-1 days. For example, for j=2, the previous day is 1 day. So for each i, m can be from 1 to i-1, and we have to check each m. So for j=2, the total number of operations is O(n^2). Similarly, for each j, the total number of operations is O(n^2). So for k=2000, the total number of operations is O(n^2 *k) = 8e10. Which is way too slow.\n\nBut perhaps the constraints are not that tight. Wait, but the problem says n can be up to 2000. So for n=2000 and k=2000, it's impossible. Therefore, there must be a smarter way.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum possible value of k? It's n. So when k is n, the answer is simply the sum of all elements. So maybe for k up to some value, we can find a way to optimize.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think of the problem as follows. Since each day's segment must be a prefix of the remaining array. For example, the first day's segment is some length t1, then the second day's is t2, etc. So the problem is to choose positions where we split the array into k parts, each part being a contiguous segment.\n\nBut how to maximize the sum of maxima of those parts.\n\nAnother observation: For each split into k parts, the sum is the sum of the maxima of each part. To maximize this sum, we want each part's maximum to be as large as possible. However, since the parts are overlapping in their positions, there's a trade-off.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal strategy is to split the array so that each split occurs just before a new maximum. For example, if the array is increasing, then splitting into k parts would require taking the first k-1 parts as single elements and the last part as the rest. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to the problem of finding k-1 split points to maximize the sum of the maxima of each segment. How can we do this?\n\nLet me think of a greedy approach. For example, the maximum element in the entire array must be in one of the segments. Since the maximum contributes its value to the sum, and we can only get it once. However, if we can split the array so that this maximum is in a segment by itself, then we can get its value once. But if we have more splits, maybe we can get more maxima. However, this seems like it's not straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to split the array into segments such that each segment contains exactly one of the top k elements. For example, if there are k elements that are larger than others, then split them into individual segments. But this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming, but find a way to optimize the transitions.\n\nLet's think again about the DP approach. For dp[i][j], the maximum sum for first i elements split into j days.\n\nNow, for each j, the value of j can't exceed i, since you need at least j elements to split into j days.\n\nSo, for each j from 1 to k, and for each i from j to n, we can compute dp[i][j].\n\nThe transition is:\n\ndp[i][j] = max( dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]) ) for m from j-1 to i-1.\n\nNow, for each j, and for each i, the inner loop is over m. But how can we compute this more efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the max(a[m+1..i]) part. For each i, and varying m, this is the maximum of the subarray from m+1 to i. For a fixed i, as m decreases, the range increases. So for each i, the max can be maintained as we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For a fixed i and j, when we compute dp[i][j], we can iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, and keep track of the current maximum. For example:\n\ncurrent_max = 0\n\nfor m in range(i-1, j-2, -1):\n\n    current_max = max(current_max, a[m+1])\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + current_max)\n\nWait, but the m here is the end of the previous day. So the current segment is from m+1 to i. So for m from (j-1) to (i-1), the previous day is m elements split into j-1 days. So for each i and j, we can iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, and for each m, we can track the max of a[m+1..i], which can be done incrementally.\n\nWait, for example, when m decreases, the range m+1 to i expands to the left. So for m = i-1: the segment is [i], which is a[i]. Then m = i-2: the segment is [i-1, i], which has max(max(a[i-1], a[i])). And so on.\n\nSo, for each i and j, when we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, we can track the current maximum of the segment [m+1, i], and update it as we move m leftwards. This way, for each i and j, the inner loop takes O(i) time, but we avoid recomputing the max each time. However, the time complexity is still O(n^2 *k), but perhaps with a lower constant factor.\n\nBut for n=2000 and k=2000, this is still O(8e10) operations, which is way too slow.\n\nBut maybe in practice, the constraints are not that bad. For example, in the problem statement, the sample input has n=8 and k=3. So perhaps the intended solution is this DP approach with the optimization of tracking the current maximum.\n\nBut with n=2000 and k=2000, even with this optimization, it's impossible. However, perhaps the constraints for the problem are not as tight as the maximums given. For example, maybe in practice, the test cases don't have k=n. Or perhaps there's another observation that allows us to optimize further.\n\nWait, what is the maximum value of k? It's n. So when k is n, the answer is the sum of all elements. Similarly, when k is 1, the answer is the max of the entire array.\n\nSo perhaps for the DP approach, we can handle the cases where k is small. For example, when k is small, say up to 100, the O(n^2 *k) approach is feasible. But for larger k, it's not. However, given that n is 2000, even with k=2000, the O(n^2 *k) is 8e10 operations, which is way beyond what Python can handle in the time limit.\n\nTherefore, there must be a better approach. Let's think differently.\n\nAnother observation: For each split into k days, the sum of maxima is the sum of the maxima of each segment. Since the segments are consecutive, the maximum of the entire array must be in one of the segments. Suppose that the maximum element is at position p. Then, the best way to split is to have this element be in a segment by itself. Because if it's in a segment with other elements, then the maximum of that segment is the same as the maximum of the entire array. However, if we split that segment into two parts, one containing the max and another part, then the max would contribute once, and the other part's max may be smaller. However, if we split into multiple segments, but include the max in one of them, it's still contributing once. So perhaps, to maximize the total sum, we should split the array such that each of the top k elements is in their own segment. But how to formalize this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as selecting k-1 split points. The maximum sum is the sum of the maxima of each of the k segments. The problem is to select k-1 split points to maximize this sum.\n\nLet me think of the following approach: For the first day, we can choose to take the first x elements, then for the remaining days, recursively apply the same logic. But how to find the optimal x.\n\nBut again, this leads back to the DP approach.\n\nWait, but perhaps the DP can be optimized further. For example, for each j, when computing dp[i][j], the maximum for the current segment can be found in a certain way.\n\nAnother idea: For each j, when computing dp[i][j], we can note that the optimal m for dp[i][j] is somewhere between m_prev and i-1. However, I don't see an obvious way to find this m quickly.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem in terms of the maximum values. For example, the maximum of the entire array must be in one of the segments. If we split the array into segments such that this maximum is in a segment by itself, then the contribution is the maximum value. Then, for the rest of the array, we can split into k-1 segments. But this is a recursive approach, but how to implement it.\n\nBut even this approach would require knowing where the maximum is, and splitting accordingly. However, for the general case, this might not be optimal. For example, suppose that there are two very large numbers in the array. Splitting them into their own segments would give their sum, which is better than putting them in the same segment.\n\nBut how to find which splits to make. This seems like a greedy approach, but I'm not sure if it's correct.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the array is [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2], as in the first example. The maximum is 9. So the optimal split would have this in a segment. But the example shows that the third segment is [1,9,2], which includes the 9. However, the maximum of that segment is 9. But if instead, we split it into [1,9], and [2], then the maxima would be 9 and 2, sum 11. Whereas in the example, the third segment is [1,9,2], which gives 9. The other segments contribute 5 and 6. Total 5+6+9=20. But if we split the third segment into two parts, then the total would be 5+6+9+2=22. But that would require k=4. However, in the example, k=3. So the greedy approach of putting the maximum in its own segment is better for higher k.\n\nSo, in the case of k=3, the maximum is in a segment that also contains other elements. Hence, the greedy approach may not work.\n\nAnother example: let's say the array is [1, 2000, 2000, 2], and k=2. The best split is [1,2000], [2000,2], giving 2000 + 2000 = 4000. Which is better than splitting into [1], [2000,2000,2], which gives 1 + 2000 = 2001. So the greedy approach of taking the largest elements into their own segments is better.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nPerhaps the problem can be viewed as selecting k-1 split points to maximize the sum of the maxima of the segments. Each split point divides the array into segments. The key is to find the optimal positions to split.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think again about the DP approach. Perhaps for n=2000 and k=2000, the code can be optimized.\n\nLet me try to estimate the time required. For n=2000 and k=2000, the DP would be O(n^2 *k) = 8e10 operations. That's way too much. However, in practice, for each j, the number of i's is up to n. But for j > i, it's not possible. So for j from 1 to k, and i from j to n.\n\nBut even with that, for j=2000, i can be only 2000, so for j=2000, the inner loop is O(1). For j=1999, i can be 1999 or 2000. So the total number of operations for j >= 1000 would be negligible. However, for j up to say 1000, the number of operations is O(1000 * 2000^2) = 4e9, which is still way too much.\n\nThus, the DP approach with the current idea is not feasible for n=2000 and k=2000.\n\nAlternative Idea: What if we notice that for the optimal solution, the number of splits (k) is small compared to n? No, since k can be as large as n.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the problem differently. For each day, the maximum of that day's segment is at least as large as the maximum of the previous day's segment. No, that's not necessarily true. For example, if the array is [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2], the first day's max is 5, the second day's max is 6, the third is 9. So they increase. But if the array is [5, 6, 4, 3], and k=2, the optimal split could be [5,6], [4,3], giving 6 +4 = 10. Or [5], [6,4,3], which gives 5+6=11. So the maxima can decrease.\n\nAnother Idea: For a given j, the maximum sum dp[i][j] can be computed with some convex hull trick or other optimization techniques. However, I'm not sure how to apply those here.\n\nLet me think about the recurrence again:\n\ndp[i][j] = max_{m} ( dp[m][j-1] + max_{m+1..i} a )\n\nIf we can find a way to compute this max efficiently for each i and j.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think for a fixed j and varying i. For example, for j=2, we can compute dp[i][2] = max_{m=1 to i-1} ( dp[m][1] + max_{m+1 to i} a )\n\nBut dp[m][1] is the maximum of the first m elements. So for j=2, we can compute for each i, the best m to split into the first m elements and then the next segment.\n\nBut how to find this m quickly.\n\nFor example, for j=2, the max for the second segment is the max from m+1 to i. Let's say that for each i, we can find the best m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother observation: For the second segment (the part from m+1 to i), the max is at least the max of the entire segment. So for each i, the best m is such that the max of the second segment is as large as possible, and the dp[m][j-1] is also as large as possible.\n\nBut how to balance these two factors.\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed i and j, the max for the segment from m+1 to i is the maximum of a[m+1..i]. Let's denote this as current_max. Then, for each m, we can think of adding current_max to dp[m][j-1]. The question is, for each i, how to find m that maximizes this sum.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly.\n\nLet me think for j=2. The dp[m][1] is the maximum of the first m elements. So for each i, the dp[i][2] = max over m from 1 to i-1 of (max_first_m + max(m+1 to i)).\n\nBut max_first_m is the maximum of the first m elements, which is the same as the maximum of the entire array up to m.\n\nSo for j=2, the problem reduces to finding for each i, the best m where the sum of the max up to m and the max from m+1 to i is maximized.\n\nIs there a way to compute this efficiently?\n\nFor example, for each i, the max from m+1 to i can be expressed as the maximum of a[m+1..i]. Let's assume we have precomputed the max for all ranges.\n\nBut even with that, for each i, we need to check all m from 1 to i-1.\n\nBut perhaps we can find for each i, the best m where the max from m+1 to i is large enough.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear way to do this.\n\nAnother Idea: For each i and j, the optimal m for dp[i][j] is such that the segment from m+1 to i contains the maximum element in that range. Because otherwise, we could have chosen a smaller m to include the maximum, thereby possibly increasing the max of the segment.\n\nWait, but the max of the segment is fixed once the segment is determined. So if the segment from m+1 to i contains a certain max, then no matter what m we choose, the max is determined by the segment. So perhaps for each i and j, the optimal m is the one that allows the max of the segment to be as large as possible, while also allowing the dp[m][j-1] to be as large as possible.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure how to leverage this.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem in terms of the following: For each j, we can compute dp[i][j] based on the previous j-1 layer.\n\nFor example, for j=2, we can compute dp[i][2] = max_{m} ( dp[m][1] + max(m+1..i) )\n\nLet's think of this as for each i, we want to find the m that maximizes (dp[m][1] + max(m+1..i)).\n\nNow, for a fixed i, as m increases, the max(m+1..i) can decrease or stay the same. For example, when m increases, the segment becomes shorter (starts later), so the max might decrease.\n\nBut dp[m][1] is the max of the first m elements, which increases as m increases.\n\nSo there's a trade-off between the two terms.\n\nBut how to find the optimal m for each i?\n\nMaybe for each i, the optimal m is somewhere around the position where the max of the segment (m+1..i) is large, and the dp[m][1] is also large.\n\nBut this is still vague.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the max of the segment (m+1..i) is non-decreasing as m decreases (because adding more elements to the left can only increase or keep the max the same), and dp[m][1] is non-decreasing as m increases (since adding more elements can only increase or keep the max the same).\n\nSo for a fixed i, when we vary m from 1 to i-1, the term dp[m][1] is non-decreasing, and the term max(m+1..i) is non-increasing. So their sum may have a single maximum point.\n\nThis suggests that for each i, the optimal m can be found using ternary search. But I'm not sure if the function is unimodal.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose i=5, and the array is [5, 4, 2, 6, 5]. For j=2, dp[m][1] is the max of first m elements. For m=1, it's 5; m=2, 5; m=3,5; m=4,6; m=5,6 (but for j=2, m can be up to i-1=4).\n\nThe max(m+1..i) for each m is:\n\nm=1: max(2,3,4,5) = 6\n\nm=2: max(3,4,5) = 6\n\nm=3: max(4,5) = 6\n\nm=4: max(5) =5\n\nSo the sum for m=1: 5+6=11; m=2:5+6=11; m=3:5+6=11; m=4:6+5=11. All the same. So the sum is flat.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 3, 2, 4], i=4, j=2.\n\ndp[m][1] for m=1:1; m=2:3; m=3:3; m=4:4.\n\nmax(m+1..4):\n\nm=1: max(3,2,4) =4\n\nsum:1+4=5\n\nm=2: max(2,4)=4 → sum 3+4=7\n\nm=3: max(4) → sum 3+4=7\n\nSo the sum increases from m=1 to m=2, then remains the same.\n\nSo in this case, the sum increases until m=2, then stays the same.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 2, 3, 4], i=4, j=2.\n\ndp[m][1] for m=1:1; m=2:2; m=3:3; m=4:4.\n\nmax(m+1..4):\n\nm=1: max(2,3,4)=4 → sum 1+4=5\n\nm=2: max(3,4)=4 → sum 2+4=6\n\nm=3: max(4) → sum 3+4=7.\n\nSo the sum increases as m increases. Hence, the optimal m is 3.\n\nIn this case, the sum is increasing with m.\n\nAnother example: array [4, 3, 2, 1], i=4, j=2.\n\ndp[m][1] is 4 for all m >=1.\n\nmax(m+1..4):\n\nm=1: max(3,2,1) =3 → sum 4+3=7.\n\nm=2: max(2,1) =2 → sum 4+2=6.\n\nm=3: max(1) =1 → sum 4+1=5.\n\nSo the sum decreases as m increases. So optimal m is 1.\n\nSo in this case, the sum is decreasing with m.\n\nSo in these examples, the sum function is either increasing, decreasing, or flat. So it's possible that for each i and j, the function is unimodal. If this is the case, then for each i and j, we can perform a ternary search on m to find the optimal value. This would reduce the time complexity from O(n^2*k) to O(n*k log n), which for n=2000 and k=2000 would be 2000*2000* log(2000) ≈ 2000*2000*11 = 44 million operations, which is manageable.\n\nBut how to verify that the function is unimodal?\n\nAssume that for a fixed i and j, the function f(m) = dp[m][j-1] + max(m+1..i) is unimodal. Then, ternary search can be applied.\n\nBut is this true?\n\nLet me think of a case where the function is not unimodal. Suppose that for some i and j, the function first increases, then decreases, then increases again. Is that possible?\n\nLet me think of an example. Let's say the array is [1, 5, 3, 5, 2], and i=5, j=2. dp[m][1] is the max of the first m elements.\n\nFor m=1:1; m=2:5; m=3:5; m=4:5; m=5:5.\n\nThe max(m+1..5) for each m:\n\nm=1: max(5,3,5,2) =5 → sum 1+5=6.\n\nm=2: max(3,5,2) =5 → sum 5+5=10.\n\nm=3: max(5,2) =5 → sum 5+5=10.\n\nm=4: max(2) =2 → sum 5+2=7.\n\nSo the function f(m) is 6, 10, 10, 7. This is not unimodal, as it increases to 10, then decreases. So it's unimodal in the sense that it has a single peak. So ternary search could find the maximum.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5], i=6, j=2. dp[m][1] is max of first m elements.\n\nFor m=1:1; m=2:3; m=3:3; m=4:4; m=5:4; m=6:5.\n\nmax(m+1..6) for each m:\n\nm=1: max(3,2,4,3,5) =5 → sum 1+5=6.\n\nm=2: max(2,4,3,5) =5 → sum 3+5=8.\n\nm=3: max(4,3,5) =5 → sum 3+5=8.\n\nm=4: max(3,5) =5 → sum 4+5=9.\n\nm=5: max(5) =5 → sum 4+5=9.\n\nSo the function increases to 9, then stays the same. So it's unimodal.\n\nIt seems that for many cases, the function is unimodal. If this holds generally, then ternary search can be applied.\n\nAssuming this is true, then for each i and j, we can perform a ternary search on m in the range [j-1, i-1] to find the optimal m that maximizes dp[m][j-1] + max(m+1..i).\n\nThis would reduce the time complexity from O(n^2*k) to O(n*k log n), which is feasible for n=2000 and k=2000.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFirst, we need to precompute the max_range array. Then, for each i and j, perform a ternary search on m between low and high.\n\nBut how to compute the max_range[m+1][i] quickly.\n\nOnce that is done, for each m, during the ternary search, we can get the max in O(1) time.\n\nNow, the steps would be:\n\n1. Precompute the max_range array.\n\n2. Initialize the dp table.\n\n3. For j from 1 to k:\n\n   a. For j=1, dp[i][1] = max_range[1][i].\n\n   b. For j>1, for each i >= j, compute dp[i][j] by performing a ternary search on m in [j-1, i-1] to find the best m.\n\nBut how to handle the ternary search correctly.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure if the function is always unimodal. But given that the examples seem to support it, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nNow, the code outline would be:\n\nPrecompute max_range:\n\nmax_range = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    current_max = a[i-1]\n\n    max_range[i][i] = current_max\n\n    for j in range(i-1, 0, -1):\n\n        current_max = max(current_max, a[j-1])\n\n        max_range[j][i] = current_max\n\nThen, initialize the dp table:\n\ndp = [[0]*(k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    dp[i][1] = max_range[1][i]\n\nfor j in range(2, k+1):\n\n    for i",
