Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the task is to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies certain flow conditions. The main points are:\n\n1. For each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. That's like conservation of flow.\n2. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The directed graph should not have cycles. Oh right, so the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nHmm. Also, we're given the flow values for each edge, and we need to assign directions such that the flow is a valid maximum flow. But how do we approach this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the flow conservation. For any vertex v (not source or sink), the total flow into it must equal the total flow out of it. Since each edge contributes its ci to either incoming or outgoing, depending on direction.\n\nBut how can we model this? Well, maybe we can model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow balances at each node. But how to ensure that the directed graph is acyclic?\n\nWait, the problem says that the original graph is connected, and that a solution exists. So perhaps there's a way to structure the directions in a way that forms a DAG, maybe by building a tree structure or something similar.\n\nAnother thought: since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the vertices in a topological order. Then, all edges go from earlier vertices in the order to later ones. But how to determine this order?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow is a maximum flow, perhaps the direction of edges can be determined based on the residual capacities. But I'm not sure. Wait, but the problem states that the flow is already computed, and we just need to assign directions. So maybe the underlying structure is a flow network, and we need to assign directions based on the flow.\n\nWait, but how do we know which direction the flow is going through each edge? Because in a standard max-flow setup, edges can have flow in either direction, but here we have to assign directions such that the flow is valid. But since the problem says that the flow values are given, maybe the directions can be determined by considering the flow as being pushed through the edges in a certain way.\n\nAnother angle: the problem requires that the directed graph is acyclic. So perhaps we can construct a DAG where the source is the root, and the sink is the leaf. Maybe we can perform some kind of traversal, like BFS or DFS, and assign directions based on the traversal order.\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each vertex except source and sink, the sum of flows going into it equals the sum going out. Which implies that for each vertex, the sum of flows on edges incident to it (with direction considered) must be zero. Wait, no. For example, if a vertex has incoming flow of X and outgoing flow of X, then the net flow is zero. So for each vertex except source and sink, the net flow is zero. For the source, the net flow is the total flow (since all edges are outgoing), and for the sink, the net flow is negative of that.\n\nSo how can we model this? Let's consider that each edge's direction determines whether it contributes to the outflow or inflow of its endpoints. For example, if an edge between u and v is directed from u to v, then for u, it's an outgoing edge (so contributes +ci to outflow), and for v, it's an incoming edge (contributes +ci to inflow).\n\nSo for each vertex v (not source or sink), the sum of all flows on edges directed towards v must equal the sum of all flows on edges directed away from v. Which is equivalent to saying that the total flow leaving v is equal to the total flow entering v. Which is the same as the net flow being zero.\n\nNow, how to model this. Let's imagine that for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it minus the sum of flows on edges directed towards it equals the net flow. For the source, this is equal to the total flow (since all edges are outgoing), and for the sink, it's -total flow. For others, it's zero.\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges to satisfy this. Hmm. This seems like a problem of assigning directions to edges such that for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it minus those directed towards it equals the required value.\n\nBut what's the required value? For the source, it's the total flow (which is the sum of all flows on edges connected to it, since all edges must be directed away). Wait, no. Because the source's outflow is the sum of all flows on edges directed away from it. But since the source can't have incoming edges, all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. So for the source, the net outflow is equal to the total flow. Similarly for the sink, the net inflow is equal to the total flow.\n\nBut how to find the required net flow for each node. Wait, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction contributes to the net flow of its endpoints. Then, for each node, the net flow is known.\n\nBut how to compute that. Let me think. The total flow in the network is the sum of flows from the source to the sink. Let me denote this as F. Then, for the source, the net outflow is F. For the sink, the net inflow is F. For all other nodes, the net outflow is zero.\n\nBut how to compute F. Well, the total flow F can be calculated as the sum of flows on edges leaving the source. But since the source can't have incoming edges, all edges connected to the source are directed away. So F is the sum of ci for edges connected to the source. Wait, but that's not necessarily correct. Because the source may have edges that are part of the flow, but perhaps in a more complex way. However, given that the problem says that the given flow is a maximum flow, perhaps the sum of flows on edges leaving the source is the total flow F. But how do we know that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total flow F can be determined by considering that for each edge, the flow is ci, and the sum of all flows leaving the source is F, and the sum of all flows entering the sink is F. But how to compute F?\n\nBut perhaps we don't need to compute F. Let's think again. For each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. Which means that for each such node, the sum of all flows on edges connected to it is even? No, because for each edge connected to v, it's either contributing to the outflow or inflow. So for example, if an edge between u and v is directed from u to v, then for u, it's an outflow, and for v, it's an inflow. So for each node, the total outflow minus inflow equals the net flow. For non-source/sink nodes, this net flow is zero.\n\nSo for each node v (excluding source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. Which can be rewritten as: the sum over all edges incident to v of (if directed away, +ci; if directed towards, -ci) equals zero. Or, equivalently, the sum over all edges incident to v of (direction * 2ci - ci) ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of each edge as contributing +ci to the outflow of one node and +ci to the inflow of another. For example, if edge is u→v, then u's outflow increases by ci, and v's inflow increases by ci. For the node u, the net outflow is (sum of outgoing flows) - (sum of incoming flows). For the node v, it's (sum outgoing) - (sum incoming) = (sum outgoing) - (sum incoming). But for non-source/sink nodes, the net outflow is zero. So for each such node, sum of outgoing flows equals sum of incoming flows.\n\nBut how to model this. It seems like a system of equations. But solving that for large n and m (up to 2e5) would be impossible with standard methods.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this as a directed graph with certain constraints. Let's think of the problem as trying to assign directions to edges so that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges leaving the node equals the sum on edges entering the node. And also, the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nAnother idea: since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each edge, we direct it from the node that comes earlier in the order to the one that comes later. Then, the directed graph will be acyclic. Now, how to choose the topological order such that the flow conservation holds.\n\nBut how to find such an order. Let's think of the nodes as being arranged in a DAG where all edges go from lower to higher in the order. Then, for each node except the source and sink, the sum of flows on edges coming into it (from lower nodes) must equal the sum of flows on edges going out (to higher nodes). How can we model this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the nodes as being in a hierarchy. The source is at the top, the sink is at the bottom, and all edges go from higher to lower. Then, for each node, the sum of flows on edges coming into it (from higher nodes) must equal the sum of flows going out (to lower nodes). Because for that node, the inflow equals outflow.\n\nBut how to compute this hierarchy. It seems like a problem of finding a potential function for each node such that for each edge between u and v, the direction is determined by the potential difference. For example, if the potential of u is higher than v, then the edge is directed from u to v. Then, the potentials must be such that for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v (from higher potential nodes) equals the sum of flows on edges directed out (to lower potential nodes).\n\nBut how to find such potentials. Let me think. Let's say that for each node, we assign a value (potential) such that for each edge between u and v, the direction is determined by the potential. For example, if the potential of u is higher than v, then the edge is directed u→v. Then, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v (i.e., edges from nodes with higher potential) must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out (edges to nodes with lower potential).\n\nThis seems similar to a system where for each node, the sum of flows on edges where the other end has higher potential (so the edge is directed into this node) equals the sum of flows on edges where the other end has lower potential (edge directed out of this node). Which implies that the sum of flows on edges incident to this node is equal to twice the sum of flows on edges directed out (since the sum of flows in is equal to the sum of flows out). But that's only possible if the sum of flows on edges incident to the node is even? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each node v (non-source/sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum of flows on edges directed out. Which implies that the sum of flows on edges incident to v is 2 * (sum of flows on edges directed out of v). Therefore, the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even. But the problem statement says that a solution exists, so this must be true.\n\nBut how to find the potentials. Let's think of the potentials as the \"level\" of the node in the DAG. For example, the source has the highest level, and the sink has the lowest. Then, for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it (from higher levels) must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out (to lower levels). \n\nLet me think of this as a flow balance. Suppose that for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v (from higher nodes) is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed out (to lower nodes). Which would imply that the net flow into v is zero.\n\nBut how to model this. For each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it (from higher nodes) equals the sum of flows on edges directed out (to lower nodes). Let me denote this as:\n\nsum_{u > v} (flow on edge u-v) = sum_{w < v} (flow on edge v-w)\n\nBut how to compute this. This seems like a system of equations. However, solving this for large graphs is not straightforward.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's model the problem as a directed graph where the directions are determined by a spanning tree. For example, build a directed tree rooted at the source, and assign directions accordingly. But how to ensure flow conservation.\n\nAnother thought: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, it must have a topological order. Let's suppose we have a topological order where the source is first, and the sink is last. Then, for each node in the order, except the first and last, the sum of flows on edges coming into it from previous nodes (in the order) must equal the sum of flows on edges going out to later nodes. \n\nHow can we find such an order? Let's consider that for each node, the sum of flows on edges that are directed into it (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out (to later nodes). \n\nThis sounds like a problem where we can process nodes in a certain order, and for each node, compute the required balance. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as a directed graph where each edge is directed from a node with lower index in the topological order to higher. Then, for each node, the sum of flows on incoming edges (from earlier nodes) must equal the sum of flows on outgoing edges (to later nodes). \n\nTo find such a topological order, perhaps we can use a greedy approach. Start with the source, and then process nodes in a way that ensures the balance condition. \n\nBut how to compute the balance. Let's think for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even. Because the sum of flows on edges directed into v plus the sum on edges directed out of v equals the total flow around the node. Since the two sums are equal (because of flow conservation), the total is twice the sum of one of them. So the total must be even. But the problem says that a solution exists, so this is guaranteed.\n\nBut how to proceed. Let's think about the problem as a directed graph where we can assign directions such that for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it equals the sum of flows directed into it. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph where each node has a balance of zero. So, for each node, the net flow (outgoing minus incoming) is zero. Except for the source and sink.\n\nBut how to assign directions. Let me think of this as a flow problem. Suppose we want to assign directions to edges such that for each node, the net outflow is zero (except source and sink). Let's imagine that for each edge, we can choose to add +ci to one node and -ci to the other. Then, the problem becomes to assign these +ci/-ci to each node such that the net for each node (except source and sink) is zero.\n\nWait, that's exactly the case. For each edge between u and v, we can choose to assign +ci to u and -ci to v (directed u→v) or +ci to v and -ci to u (directed v→u). Then, for each node, the sum of all these assignments must be zero (for non-source/sink nodes), +F (source), and -F (sink), where F is the total flow.\n\nSo this is a problem of finding a set of variables (directions) such that the sum for each node is correct. \n\nBut how to model this. Let's consider the following: the sum for each node is the sum of all flows on edges directed away from it minus the sum of flows on edges directed towards it. For non-source/sink nodes, this sum must be zero.\n\nThis is equivalent to the problem of finding a directed graph where the net outflow for each node is zero (except source and sink). Which is exactly the condition for a valid flow. \n\nBut how to find such directions. This seems like a problem of finding an Eulerian orientation. Because in an undirected graph, an Eulerian orientation is one where each node has equal in-degree and out-degree, which is similar to our condition here. Except that here, the 'degree' is weighted by the flow values. \n\nAh! So this is a problem of finding an Eulerian orientation for a graph where each edge has a weight ci. For each node, the sum of weights of edges directed away from it must equal the sum of weights of edges directed towards it. Except for the source and sink. \n\nBut in our case, the source has all edges directed away (so the net outflow is F), and the sink has all edges directed towards it (net inflow is F). For other nodes, the net outflow is zero.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding an orientation of the edges such that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of ci for edges directed away equals the sum directed towards. \n\nBut how to find such an orientation. \n\nFor a general graph, this is possible if and only if for each node, the sum of all edge weights incident to it is even. But since the problem says a solution exists, that's guaranteed. \n\nBut how to find such an orientation. One way is to model this as a directed graph where each node's net outflow is zero (except source and sink). \n\nBut how to compute this. Let's think of it as follows: For each node, the total flow on edges incident to it is T. Then, for non-source/sink nodes, we need to split T into two equal parts (each of T/2) for outgoing and incoming. \n\nBut how to do that. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using a spanning tree approach. Let's consider building a directed tree rooted at the source. Then, for each node, we can compute the required flow. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that the flow conservation is satisfied. \n\nBut how to proceed. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG, and the flow conservation is satisfied. To achieve this, we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal starting from the source, and assign directions based on the traversal. \n\nHere's an idea: \n\n- Perform a BFS or DFS traversal starting from the source. \n- For each edge, when we visit a node u and find an adjacent node v, if v hasn't been visited yet, we direct the edge from u to v. \n- However, this might not account for the flow conservation. \n\nBut how to incorporate the flow values. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed tree where the flow conservation is maintained. For example, for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed towards it from its parent must equal the sum of flows on edges directed away from it to its children. \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nAnother idea: For each node, except the source and sink, the sum of flows on edges directed into it must equal the sum of flows directed out. So, for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it is S, and the sum directed out is also S. \n\nLet me think about this recursively. Suppose we have a tree structure rooted at the source. Each node (except the source) has a parent. The edge between the node and its parent is directed from parent to node. Then, for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it (from parent) must be equal to the sum of flows on edges directed out (to children and other edges). \n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed acyclic graph where each node's flow is balanced. Let's consider that the directed graph is a DAG, and we can process nodes in topological order. \n\nSuppose we process the nodes in topological order. For each node, we can calculate the required flow that must be passed through it. \n\nBut how. Let's think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute for each node the total flow on edges incident to it. Let's call this T[v]. For non-source/sink nodes, T[v] must be even. \n\nBut for the source and sink, T[v] is the sum of flows on edges connected to them. \n\nBut since the source can't have incoming edges, all edges connected to the source are directed away. So for the source, the net outflow is the sum of all its edges. For the sink, the net inflow is the sum of all its edges. \n\nBut how to handle the other nodes. \n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. We can model the flow conservation as a system of equations. For each node v (not source or sink):\n\nsum_{edges directed away} ci - sum_{edges directed towards} ci = 0.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as sum_{edges directed away} ci = sum_{edges directed towards} ci.\n\nWhich implies that sum_{edges directed away} ci = (sum of all edges incident to v) / 2.\n\nBecause the total sum of all edges incident to v is sum_{edges directed away} ci + sum_{edges directed towards} ci = 2 * sum_{edges directed away} ci.\n\nThus, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away must be exactly half of the total flow on all edges incident to v. \n\nBut how to assign directions to achieve this. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. Let's think of the following algorithm:\n\n- Choose a topological order of the nodes. For example, start with the source, then process nodes in some order, ensuring that when we process a node, we have already processed all nodes that are predecessors in the DAG. \n\n- For each node, after processing its predecessors, we can direct the edges between it and unprocessed nodes in a way that helps satisfy the flow conservation.\n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where we can perform a DFS traversal and assign directions based on the traversal. For example:\n\n- Start with the source. For each neighbor, direct the edge from the source to the neighbor. Then, recursively visit the neighbor, and for each of its neighbors, if not visited, direct the edge from the current node to the neighbor. \n\nBut how to ensure that the flow conservation is satisfied. \n\nAnother idea: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, it's possible to arrange the nodes in a topological order. Let's assume that we have such an order, say v1, v2, ..., vn, where v1 is the source and vn is the sink. Then, for each edge between vi and vj, if i < j, we direct it from vi to vj. Otherwise, from vj to vi. \n\nNow, the question is how to choose the topological order such that for each node (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into it from earlier nodes equals the sum of flows on edges directed out to later nodes. \n\nLet's think of this as follows. For each node vi (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges from earlier nodes (those before vi in the order) must equal the sum of flows on edges to later nodes (those after vi in the order). \n\nHow to compute this. For example, during the topological sort, we can compute for each node the required sum of flows that must be directed out. \n\nBut how to find such an order. Let's think of it as a dynamic programming problem. Suppose we have processed some nodes, and for each node, we know how much flow needs to be sent out. \n\nAlternatively, think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as a directed graph, where the direction of each edge is determined by a tree structure. For example, we can build a directed tree rooted at the source, and for each node, assign directions to edges such that the flow conservation holds. \n\nLet me think of this. Suppose we have a tree rooted at the source. For each node, we can compute the required flow that must pass through it. For example, the source has a certain amount of flow to distribute. Each child node receives some flow, and then distributes it further. \n\nBut how to compute this. Let's think of the following steps:\n\n1. Build a spanning tree of the graph, rooted at the source. The tree includes all nodes. \n\n2. For each node, compute the required flow that must be sent out through its edges in the tree. \n\nBut how. For example, the source has a certain amount of flow to send. For each child in the tree, the flow sent through the edge from source to child is some value. Then, the child must distribute this flow through its own edges. \n\nBut this seems too vague. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed out. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using a modified DFS or BFS, where for each node, we track the required flow that needs to be passed through it. \n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n- Start with the source. For the source, all edges are directed away. \n\n- For each neighbor of the source, we can direct the edge from the source to the neighbor. \n\n- For each such neighbor, we need to ensure that the flow conservation holds. For example, if the neighbor is not the sink, then the sum of flows on edges directed into it (from the source) must be equal to the sum of flows on edges directed out of it. \n\n- So, for the neighbor, the sum of flows directed into it from the source is some value. We need to direct the other edges connected to this node in a way that the sum of outgoing flows equals that value. \n\nBut how to proceed. For example, suppose we have a node u that has received a certain amount of flow from its parent. Now, u must send this amount of flow through its other edges. \n\nThis sounds like a problem where we can model it as a flow network, but I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can assign directions based on the order in which nodes are visited in a BFS traversal. Let's try this. \n\nFor example, perform a BFS starting from the source. For each node, when you visit it, you direct all edges from it to its unvisited neighbors. This ensures that the directed graph is acyclic. \n\nOnce all edges are directed, we need to check if the flow conservation holds. But this might not be the case. However, since the problem says that a solution exists, perhaps there's a way to adjust the directions based on this traversal. \n\nBut how to ensure the flow conservation. Let's think of the following:\n\nDuring BFS traversal, for each node u, we have a certain amount of flow that must be passed through it. For example, the source sends all its flow to its neighbors. Each neighbor must distribute this flow to their neighbors, and so on. \n\nThis suggests that the flow conservation can be achieved by ensuring that for each node, the amount of flow it receives from its parent in the BFS tree is equal to the sum of flows it sends to its children. \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nLet's take an example. Suppose we have a node u in the BFS tree, which has a parent p. The edge between u and p is directed from p to u, and the flow on this edge is ci. The amount of flow that u has to distribute is ci. Now, u has other edges. For each edge between u and v, if v is a child in the BFS tree, we direct the edge from u to v, and assign the flow such that the sum of flows on outgoing edges equals ci. \n\nBut how to choose which edges to direct in which way. This seems like a problem of balancing the flows. \n\nPerhaps this is similar to building a directed tree where each node's outflow is equal to the inflow. \n\nLet me try to formalize this. Assume that during BFS traversal, each node u has a parent p. The edge between u and p is directed from p to u, and the flow on this edge is c. Then, the amount of flow that must be passed through u is equal to this c. Now, u has other edges. For each such edge, if it connects to a node that hasn't been visited yet, we direct it from u to that node, and assign the flow accordingly. But how to ensure that the sum of outgoing flows equals the inflow. \n\nAlternatively, the sum of flows on all edges incident to u (except the edge from p) must be such that the sum of flows directed out of u equals the inflow (c). \n\nBut this seems challenging. \n\nAnother idea: For each node u, the total inflow (from its parent) is some value, say in_flow. Then, the sum of flows on edges directed out of u must be in_flow. The edges directed out of u include the edges to its children in the BFS tree, and possibly other edges. \n\nBut how to handle non-tree edges. For example, if there's an edge between u and another node v that is already visited (and not the parent), then we need to decide the direction. \n\nThis seems complicated. \n\nPerhaps there's a simpler approach. Let's think of the problem as a directed graph where the directions are determined based on the flow conservation. For each node, the net flow is zero (except source and sink). \n\nLet's consider the following approach:\n\n- Construct a directed graph where we perform a DFS traversal, and for each edge, we direct it from the node we came from to the current node. \n\n- Once all edges are directed, check for flow conservation. If it doesn't hold, adjust the directions of certain edges. \n\nBut how to adjust them. \n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of finding an Eulerian orientation. For each node, the sum of flows directed away from it must equal the sum directed towards it. \n\nIn an undirected graph, an Eulerian orientation exists if and only if every node has even degree. But here, the degrees are weighted by the flow values. So for each node, the sum of all flows on edges incident to it must be even. Which is guaranteed by the problem statement. \n\nSo, how to find such an orientation. One way to do this is to find an arbitrary Eulerian orientation. But how. \n\nA standard method for finding an Eulerian orientation is to perform a DFS traversal and orient the edges in the direction of traversal. But I'm not sure if this works for weighted edges. \n\nWait, but for the unweighted case, this works. For example, in an undirected graph with all nodes having even degrees, you can find an Eulerian circuit. Orienting the edges in the direction of the circuit gives an Eulerian orientation. \n\nBut in our case, the edges are weighted, but the condition is that for each node, the sum of flows on edges incident to it is even. \n\nSo, perhaps we can use a similar approach. Perform a DFS traversal, and for each edge, when it is first traversed, orient it from the current node to the next. This would ensure that each node has an equal number of incoming and outgoing edges, but adjusted for the weights. \n\nBut how to handle the weights. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each edge is directed in such a way that the flow conservation is satisfied. Here's an idea inspired by the standard Eulerian orientation:\n\nFor each node, maintain a balance. Initially, the balance is the sum of flows on edges incident to it. For the source and sink, their balances are adjusted to be the total flow F and -F respectively. For other nodes, the balance is zero. \n\nThen, we can perform a DFS traversal, and for each edge, if it's between u and v, and if the balance of u is positive, we direct the edge from u to v, subtracting ci from u's balance and adding ci to v's balance. Otherwise, we direct it from v to u. \n\nWait, this might work. Let me explain. \n\nThe balance for each node represents the amount of flow that needs to be sent out from it. Initially, for the source, the balance is the total flow F, and for the sink, it's -F. For other nodes, it's zero. \n\nBut how to compute F. Well, F is the total flow from the source to the sink. Since the source has no incoming edges, all edges connected to the source are directed away, so the total flow F is the sum of flows on edges connected to the source. \n\nWait, but how to compute F. Let's see. The total flow from the source is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed away from the source. But since the source's balance is F, and all edges are directed away from it, the initial balance of the source is F. \n\nBut how to compute F. Well, for the source, the sum of flows on edges incident to it is T. Since all edges are directed away, the balance of the source is T, which is F. For the sink, the sum of flows on edges incident to it is also T (since it's the maximum flow). \n\nBut how to compute F. Well, since the flow is a maximum flow, it's possible that the total flow F is the sum of flows on edges incident to the source. However, this might not be the case. For example, if there are multiple paths from source to sink, but the flow is distributed. However, according to the problem statement, the flow is already computed and provided. So the sum of flows on edges incident to the source is the total flow F. \n\nWait, no. Because the source can have edges that are part of the flow but not directly connected to the sink. For example, if there's a cycle, but the problem says that the directed graph must be acyclic. However, the given flow is a maximum flow, and the directions are to be determined. \n\nBut regardless, the balance for the source is the total flow F, and for the sink it's -F. For other nodes, it's zero. \n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\nInitialize for each node, balance[v] = 0. \n\nFor the source, balance[1] = sum of flows on edges connected to it. \n\nFor the sink, balance[n] = -sum of flows on edges connected to it. \n\nWait, no. Because the sum of flows on edges connected to the source is the total flow F. For the source, the net outflow is F. So, the balance for the source is F. Similarly, for the sink, the net inflow is F, so the balance is -F. For other nodes, the net outflow is zero, so balance is zero. \n\nSo, for each node v:\n\nbalance[v] = (if v is source) F, (if v is sink) -F, else 0.\n\nThen, for each edge between u and v, we need to direct it in a way that reduces the balance of the nodes. \n\nThe algorithm could be:\n\nFor each edge (u, v), if balance[u] > 0, then direct it from u to v, subtract ci from balance[u], add ci to balance[v]. Else, direct it from v to u, subtract ci from balance[v], add ci to balance[u]. \n\nWait, but this is not correct. Because for example, if balance[u] is positive, it means that u needs to send out some flow. So directing the edge from u to v would contribute to sending out flow from u. \n\nBut this approach may not work for all cases, but let's think of an example. \n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nThe source is 1, sink is 3. \n\nThe edges are:\n\nEdge 1: 3-2, 10\n\nEdge 2: 1-2, 10\n\nEdge 3: 3-1, 5\n\nThe total flow F is the sum of flows on edges connected to the source. The source (1) is connected to edge 2 (10) and edge 3 (5). So F = 10 + 5 = 15. \n\nSo the balance for node 1 is 15, for node 3 is -15, others are zero. \n\nNow, let's process each edge:\n\nTake edge 2: between 1 and 2. balance[1] is 15 > 0. So direct from 1 to 2. Subtract 10 from balance[1], add to balance[2]. Now balance[1] is 5, balance[2] is 10.\n\nNext, edge 3: between 3 and 1. balance[1] is 5 > 0. So direct from 1 to 3. Subtract 5 from balance[1], add to balance[3]. Now balance[1] is 0, balance[3] is -15 +5 = -10.\n\nNow, edge 1: between 3 and 2. balance[3] is -10 < 0. So we direct from 2 to 3. Subtract ci (10) from balance[2], add to balance[3]. Now balance[2] is 10 -10 = 0, balance[3] is -10 +10 = 0.\n\nSo the directions",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conservation conditions and is acyclic. The key challenge is ensuring that the flow conservation holds at each vertex (except the source and sink) and that the directed graph does not contain cycles.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Flow Conservation**: For each vertex (except the source and sink), the sum of incoming flows must equal the sum of outgoing flows.\n2. **Acyclic Directed Graph**: The directed graph must be acyclic, which can be ensured by processing nodes in a topological order or using a traversal technique like DFS or BFS.\n3. **Balance Calculation**: We maintain a balance for each node representing the net flow that needs to be sent out from that node.
