Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about assigning directions to edges in an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The main points are that the flow must be a maximum flow, and the directed graph must have no cycles. Also, the source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges, and all other vertices except the sink (vertex n) must have equal incoming and outgoing flow.\n\nHmm. So, given that the flow values are already determined (each edge has a ci value), we need to assign directions to each edge so that the flow conservation holds for all intermediate nodes, and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nWait, how can we approach this? Let me think about the constraints again. For each vertex except 1 and n, the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. Also, vertex 1 has no incoming edges. The directed graph must not have cycles. Oh right, and the flow must be a maximum flow. But since the problem says that the given ci values are already part of a maximum flow, maybe we don't have to worry about that part. Our job is just to assign directions correctly.\n\nSo the problem reduces to directing the edges such that the flow conservation holds and the directed graph is acyclic. How?\n\nOne idea: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, perhaps we can arrange the vertices in a topological order. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from the vertex that comes earlier in the topological order to the one that comes later. But how to find such a topological order that also satisfies the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow conservation implies that for each node except the source and sink, the total flow into the node equals the total flow out. Which implies that the net flow (outflow minus inflow) is zero. For the source, the net outflow is the total flow (since it has no incoming edges), and for the sink, the net inflow is the same total.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that the flow balances. But how to find such directions.\n\nAnother thought: For each edge, the direction can be chosen such that the flow is directed from the node with higher potential to lower potential. But what defines this potential?\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a directed acyclic graph by building a directed tree structure. For example, if we construct a DAG where all edges point towards the sink, or something like that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since the graph must be acyclic, there's a topological order. Let's think about building a directed graph where each edge is directed from a node with lower index in the topological order to higher. Then, the graph is acyclic. But how to ensure that the flow conservation holds?\n\nWait, but the flow conservation requires that for each node except source and sink, the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. So, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. Which can be rephrased as: the sum of flows on edges incident to v, with direction towards v, equals the sum of flows on edges incident to v with direction away from v. Which implies that the total flow through the edges incident to v is even? Or maybe not. Wait, no. For each node, the sum of flows in equals the sum of flows out. So the total flow into the node is equal to the total flow out. Therefore, the total flow through the edges incident to the node is twice the inflow (since each edge contributes once to inflow and once to outflow if it's directed in some way). Wait, no. For example, if an edge is directed from u to v, then for node u, it contributes to outflow, and for node v, it contributes to inflow. So for each node, the sum of all flows on edges directed into the node must equal the sum of all flows on edges directed out of the node. \n\nThis seems similar to an Eulerian trail condition. For each node except source and sink, the in-degree (weighted by flow) equals the out-degree. But how to assign directions to edges to satisfy this.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as building a directed graph where for each node except the source and sink, the total flow entering equals the total leaving. Also, the source has all edges directed away, and the sink has all edges directed towards it. Wait, but the source can't have incoming edges. So for the source, all edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe we can model it as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of zero. For the source, the balance is the sum of all flows on edges connected to it (since they are all outgoing). For the sink, the balance is the negative of that sum (since all flows are incoming).\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to finding an orientation of the edges such that the net flow (outflow - inflow) for each node is as follows:\n\n- For node 1: net outflow = total flow (sum of all flows on edges connected to node 1)\n- For node n: net inflow = same total flow\n- For others: net outflow = 0.\n\nBut how to find such an orientation. This sounds like a problem of finding an Eulerian trail, but for flows. Wait, but Eulerian trails require that for each node, the in-degree equals out-degree (except for start and end). Which is exactly our case here. So, if we can model the flow as an Eulerian trail, but for the given graph.\n\nBut how to do that. Because the graph may not be connected. Wait, but the original graph is connected. However, the flow is fixed. So perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow conservation holds.\n\nBut how to compute that. Let me think of the following approach:\n\nFor each node, calculate the total flow that needs to go out. For node 1, the total outflow is the sum of all ci's on edges connected to it. For node n, the total inflow is the same. For other nodes, the total outflow is zero. Wait, but how does that relate to the edges?\n\nAlternatively, for each node v, the net outflow is:\n\n- If v is the source (1): sum of ci for all edges connected to v (since all edges are directed away)\n- If v is the sink (n): -sum of ci for all edges connected to v (since all edges are directed towards it)\n- Otherwise: 0.\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges such that the net outflow for each node is as above.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding an orientation of the edges such that the net outflow for each node is fixed. This is equivalent to finding a directed graph where for each node, the net outflow is equal to the given value.\n\nThis problem is known as the \"flow decomposition\" problem. However, I'm not sure how to solve it directly.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of assigning directions to edges such that for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from the node minus the sum of flows on edges directed towards the node equals the required net outflow.\n\nLet me denote for each node v, the required net outflow as D[v]. For the source, D[1] = sum of all flows on edges connected to it. For the sink, D[n] = -sum of flows on edges connected to it. For others, D[v] = 0.\n\nBut how to find such an orientation.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding a directed graph where for each edge, it's directed from u to v or v to u, and the sum over all edges of (if directed from u to v, then +ci for u, -ci for v) equals D[v].\n\nBut how to model this. It's equivalent to solving a system of equations. However, solving such a system for large graphs (up to 2e5 nodes and edges) is impractical.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this as a directed graph with certain properties. Let's think about building a directed graph where each node's D[v] is satisfied.\n\nFor example, the problem can be transformed into finding a directed graph where each edge is directed in some way, and the sum for each node is D[v].\n\nBut how? Well, this is equivalent to finding a directed graph where the sum of the flows on edges leaving the node minus the sum of flows on edges entering the node equals D[v].\n\nBut since the sum of all D[v] must be zero (because for the entire graph, the total outflow is equal to the total inflow), which is indeed the case here. For example, the sum of D[v] over all nodes is D[1] + D[n] + sum_{others} D[v]. Since sum_{others} D[v] is zero, and D[1] is S (sum of flows connected to source), D[n] is -S. So total sum is zero.\n\nThus, the problem is feasible.\n\nNow, how to find such an orientation. One possible approach is to model this as an Eulerian trail problem. For example, if we can find a directed graph where each node has an out-degree minus in-degree equal to D[v], then that would satisfy the conditions.\n\nBut how to find such a graph. Well, the standard way to do this is to model the problem as a flow network, but perhaps there's a simpler way.\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as a directed graph where for each node, the net outflow is D[v]. To achieve this, we can think of the problem as a directed graph where each edge is directed in a way that contributes to the net outflow.\n\nBut how to find this. Maybe we can use a DFS-based approach, assigning directions as we go.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from the node that comes earlier in the topological order to the one that comes later. However, how to choose the topological order such that the flow conservation holds.\n\nBut how to find such an order. Let's think about the flow conservation again. For each node except source and sink, the sum of flows on edges directed into it must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of it. So, if we have a topological order, then for any node, all edges directed into it come from nodes that appear before it in the order, and edges directed out of it go to nodes that appear after it. But how to ensure that the sum of flows on incoming edges equals the sum on outgoing edges.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed tree. For example, if we can build a directed spanning tree rooted at the source, with edges directed away from the root, but that might not work for all cases.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where the edges are directed such that the flow conservation holds, and the graph is acyclic. To ensure that the graph is acyclic, we can assign directions based on a certain hierarchy.\n\nWait, here's another thought. Let's consider the flow as a directed graph. For each node except the source and sink, the net outflow is zero. So, the net outflow for the source is S (the total flow), and for the sink it's -S.\n\nIf we can find a directed graph where the net outflow for each node is D[v], then we can proceed. Now, how to find such a directed graph.\n\nThis problem is equivalent to finding an orientation of the edges such that for each node, the sum of flows on edges going out minus the sum on edges coming in equals D[v]. This can be modeled as a problem of finding a directed graph with these properties.\n\nBut how to compute this. One approach is to model this as a directed graph and perform a DFS or BFS, assigning directions as we go.\n\nLet me think. Let's imagine that we start with the source node. All edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. Then, for each neighbor of the source, we can adjust their flow accordingly.\n\nWait, perhaps this is similar to building a directed graph where each node's excess (the required net outflow) is adjusted by directing edges appropriately.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph, and for each node, track the current \"excess\" (the difference between outgoing and incoming flows). Initially, the excess for each node is D[v]. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from u to v if that helps reduce the excess of u and v.\n\nBut how to do this systematically. Let's think of this as a problem of finding a directed graph where the excess of each node is zero, except for source and sink.\n\nWait, but the initial excess for each node is D[v]. So, for example, the source has an excess of S (sum of flows on edges connected to it). The sink has an excess of -S. All others have zero.\n\nThe idea is to process edges and assign directions such that the excesses are balanced.\n\nFor example, suppose we have an edge between u and v. Suppose that u has a positive excess (needs to send out more flow) and v has a negative excess (needs to receive more flow). Then, directing the edge from u to v would reduce the excess of u by ci and increase the excess of v by ci. Which could help in balancing.\n\nBut how to find such pairs. This seems like a problem that can be solved with a BFS or DFS approach, where we process nodes and their excesses.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a flow network where each edge can carry flow in one direction or the other. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Since the graph is connected, and the solution exists, perhaps we can construct a directed graph by building a spanning tree, and assign directions based on the tree.\n\nFor example, build a spanning tree rooted at the source. Then, direct all edges in the tree away from the source. For non-tree edges, direct them in some way that maintains the flow conservation.\n\nBut how to handle the flow conservation. This seems complicated.\n\nWait, here's a different idea. Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each edge, direct it from the node with lower order to higher. This ensures the graph is acyclic. Now, how to find such a topological order that also satisfies the flow conservation.\n\nBut how to find this order. Let's think of the flow conservation as requiring that for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of it. So, for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it must be equal to the sum of flows on edges directed out of it. Which implies that the total flow through all edges incident to the node is even? No, because sum_in = sum_out => sum_in + sum_out = 2 sum_in. But sum_in + sum_out is the sum of all flows on edges incident to the node. So, for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even? Because 2*sum_in must equal that sum. But the problem statement doesn't say that. However, the problem says that the given input is such that a solution exists, so this must hold.\n\nBut how to use this. Maybe not directly.\n\nLet's think again. For each node except source and sink, the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even. Because sum_in = sum_out, so sum_in + sum_out = 2 sum_in. Which is the sum of all flows on edges connected to the node. So yes, that sum must be even. But since the problem says that a solution exists, that must be the case.\n\nBut how does this help us? Not sure.\n\nBack to the topological order idea. Suppose we have a topological order of the nodes. For each node, all edges directed into it come from nodes earlier in the order, and edges directed out go to nodes later in the order. How can we find such an order that satisfies the flow conservation?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where each node has a certain \"potential\" and edges are directed from higher potential to lower. Then, the flow conservation would require that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into it equals the sum of flows directed out of it. But how to assign potentials.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where each node has a certain value (like a potential), and edges are directed from nodes with higher value to lower. Then, the flow conservation can be maintained by ensuring that for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it (from higher potential nodes) equals the sum of flows directed out (to lower potential nodes). But again, how to find such potentials.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the flow conservation is maintained by ensuring that for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it equals the sum of flows on edges directed out of it. This is equivalent to saying that the net flow through the node is zero (except source and sink). So, the flow conservation is maintained.\n\nBut how to assign directions. Let's think of the following algorithm:\n\nStart with the source. All edges connected to the source are directed away from it. Then, for each neighbor of the source, we can subtract the flow of those edges from the neighbor's required net outflow. Then, recursively process the neighbors.\n\nWait, this sounds similar to the way we compute flows in a residual network. Let me think more carefully.\n\nEach node has a \"balance\" which is the required net outflow. Initially, the balance for the source is S (sum of flows on edges connected to it), for the sink it's -S, and others are 0.\n\nFor any node u, if its balance is positive, it needs to send out more flow. If it's negative, it needs to receive more flow.\n\nSo, when processing a node u with a positive balance, we can look for an edge connected to u that leads to a node v with a negative balance. Then, we can direct the edge from u to v, subtracting the flow ci from u's balance and adding it to v's balance. This would reduce the imbalance of both nodes.\n\nIf we can find such a way to process all edges, then we can assign directions accordingly.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently. For example, using a queue-based approach where nodes with non-zero balance are processed.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nInitialize for each node, the balance as follows:\n\nbalance[1] = total_flow_from_source (sum of ci for edges connected to 1)\nbalance[n] = -total_flow_from_sink (sum of ci for edges connected to n)\nfor other nodes, balance[v] = 0\n\nBut wait, for the balance, it's the required net outflow. So, for node v, the balance is D[v], which for the source is the sum of all flows on edges connected to it, and for the sink it's -sum of flows on edges connected to it.\n\nThen, for each edge, we need to decide the direction. So, during the process, we can iterate through the edges and assign directions based on the balances.\n\nBut how to manage this. Here's an idea inspired by the BFS approach:\n\nWe can use a queue to process nodes. For each node u in the queue, we look at all adjacent edges that haven't been directed yet. For each such edge (u, v), if the balance of u is positive, we can direct the edge from u to v. Then, subtract ci from balance[u], add ci to balance[v]. Then, if balance[v] becomes non-zero, we add it to the queue. However, this might not work for all cases, but let's think through an example.\n\nLet's take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\n3 2 10\n1 2 10\n3 1 5\n\nThe nodes are 1 (source), 2, 3 (sink). The edges are:\n\nEdge 1: 3-2 with ci=10\nEdge 2: 1-2 with ci=10\nEdge 3: 3-1 with ci=5\n\nCalculating the balance for each node:\n\nFor node 1: connected to edges 2 and 3. Sum of ci is 10+5=15. So balance[1] = 15.\nFor node 3: connected to edges 1 and 3. Sum is 10+5=15. So balance[3] = -15.\nOther nodes (node 2): balance is 0.\n\nInitially, the queue contains node 1 (balance 15). We process node 1.\n\nLooking at its edges. Edge 2 is between 1 and 2. Since balance[1] is positive, we direct this edge from 1 to 2. Subtract 10 from balance[1], add 10 to balance[2]. Now balance[1] is 5, balance[2] is 10. Add node 2 to the queue.\n\nNext, edge 3 is between 3 and 1. But since we're processing node 1, and the edge is between 1 and 3. Wait, but the edge is undirected. So perhaps during the process, we need to check all adjacent edges for each node.\n\nWait, perhaps the algorithm is as follows:\n\nFor each node u in the queue:\n\n   for each undirected edge (u, v) that hasn't been processed yet:\n\n      if balance[u] > 0:\n\n          direct the edge from u to v.\n\n          balance[u] -= ci\n\n          balance[v] += ci\n\n          if balance[v] != 0:\n\n              add v to the queue.\n\n      else if balance[u] < 0:\n\n          direct the edge from v to u.\n\n          balance[u] += ci\n\n          balance[v] -= ci\n\n          if balance[v] != 0:\n\n              add v to the queue.\n\nBut how to handle this. Also, this approach may not work for all cases. For example, what if the edge is between two nodes with positive and negative balances?\n\nBut let's try applying this to the sample.\n\nInitial queue has node 1 with balance 15.\n\nProcess node 1. Look at all edges connected to 1. Let's assume edges are stored in adjacency lists.\n\nEdges connected to node 1 are edge 2 (1-2, ci=10) and edge 3 (1-3, ci=5).\n\nFirst, process edge 2 (1-2). Since balance[1] is positive, direct from 1 to 2. balance[1] becomes 15-10=5. balance[2] becomes 0+10=10. Add node 2 to the queue.\n\nNext, process edge 3 (1-3). balance[1] is still positive (5). Direct from 1 to 3. balance[1] becomes 5-5=0. balance[3] becomes -15+5=-10. Now, since balance[3] is -10, add it to the queue.\n\nNow, the queue contains node 2 (balance 10) and node 3 (balance -10).\n\nNext, process node 2. Its balance is 10. Look at its edges. Edge 2 (already processed?), and edge 1 (3-2, ci=10). So the edges connected to 2 are edge 1 (3-2) and edge 2 (already processed).\n\nSo, for edge 1 (3-2, ci=10). Node 2's balance is 10. So we direct the edge from 2 to 3? Or from 2 to 3?\n\nWait, the edge is between 3 and 2. So the current node being processed is 2. The edge is between 2 and 3. Since balance[2] is positive (10), we direct the edge from 2 to 3. Then, subtract 10 from balance[2], add 10 to balance[3]. Now, balance[2] is 0, balance[3] is -10 +10 = 0. So both are zero. No more processing needed.\n\nSo the edges are directed as:\n\nEdge 2: 1->2 (output 0)\n\nEdge 3: 1->3 (output 0? Wait, no. Wait the original edge was 3-1, and we directed it from 1 to 3. So for the original input, the third edge was 3 1 5. So the direction is ai → bi if di is 0, or bi → ai if di is 1. Wait, the original input's edges are given as ai, bi, ci. For each edge, the output di is 0 if the direction is ai→bi, else 1.\n\nSo for the third edge, which was 3 1 5, we directed it from 1 to 3. So the original ai is 3, bi is 1. So the direction is from 1 to 3, which is opposite to the original ai→bi. So di is 1. So the output for that edge is 1.\n\nSimilarly, for edge 1 (3 2 10), the direction is from 2 to 3. So original ai is 3, bi is 2. So the direction is from 2 to 3, which is bi to ai. So di is 1.\n\nFor edge 2 (1 2 10), direction is ai→bi (1→2), so di is 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample output: '1\\n0\\n1' (the first sample output is 1, 0, 1. Wait sample input's first case output is ['1\\n0\\n1'].\n\nWait the first sample input's output is:\n\n1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nWhich corresponds to:\n\nEdge 1 (3-2) is directed as bi→ai (since original is 3 2, and direction is 2→3. So di is 1.\n\nEdge 2 (1-2) is directed as ai→bi (1→2) so di is 0.\n\nEdge 3 (3-1) is directed as bi→ai (since original is 3 1, direction is 1→3, which is bi→ai. So di is 1. So output is 1, 0, 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach seems to work for the sample. Now, the question is, how to implement this in code.\n\nBut how to manage the edges and track which ones have been processed. Also, note that each edge is processed once. Because once we process an edge, it's directed and we don't need to process it again.\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\n- For each node, maintain an adjacency list of edges. Each edge is stored as a tuple (neighbor, index, ci). Also, we need to track whether the edge has been processed.\n\n- Use a queue to process nodes with non-zero balance.\n\n- For each node u dequeued, iterate through all its adjacent edges that have not been processed yet.\n\n- For each such edge (u, v, ci, index):\n\n   if the current balance of u is positive, direct the edge from u to v. Subtract ci from balance[u], add to balance[v]. Mark the edge as processed. If balance[v] is not zero, enqueue v.\n\n   else if the current balance of u is negative, direct the edge from v to u. Add ci to balance[u], subtract from balance[v]. Mark the edge as processed. If balance[v] is not zero, enqueue v.\n\n   else: ? Well, since the balance is zero, but this edge hasn't been processed yet. But according to the problem statement, a solution exists, so this situation should not occur.\n\nBut why would this work? Because the algorithm ensures that whenever an edge is processed, it helps to balance the nodes. For example, if a node has a positive balance, it sends out flow via edges, reducing its balance. Similarly for negative.\n\nBut how to handle the case when the edge is between two nodes with non-zero balances. For example, if u has a positive balance and v has a positive balance. Then, directing the edge from u to v would decrease u's balance and increase v's balance. Which might not help. But since the overall sum of balances is zero, and the algorithm processes nodes in a way that balances them, this should eventually resolve.\n\nBut how to make sure that the algorithm works for all cases. Well, since the problem states that a solution exists, the algorithm should find one.\n\nNow, the implementation steps:\n\nFirst, read the input and build an adjacency list. For each node, store a list of edges. Each edge is represented as (neighbor, index, ci). Also, we need to track whether each edge has been processed. However, since each edge is between two nodes, and we process it once, we need to mark it as processed once we've handled it.\n\nBut how to avoid processing the same edge twice. For example, when processing node u, we look at edge (u, v), and process it. When processing node v, we should not process the same edge again.\n\nTo handle this, perhaps for each edge, we can mark it as processed once we have assigned a direction. So, during the processing of the adjacency list, when we process an edge, we mark it as processed, so that when we reach the other end, we don't process it again.\n\nBut how to track this. One approach is to have a boolean array for each edge, indicating whether it has been processed. Initially, all are False.\n\nSo, during the processing of node u, for each adjacent edge (u, v, ci, index), if not processed:\n\n   process it.\n\n   mark as processed.\n\nBut how to represent the adjacency list. For example, for each node u, the adjacency list contains entries for each edge connected to u. Each entry has the neighbor, the index of the edge in the original input, and the ci value.\n\nSo, during the processing, when we process an edge between u and v, we mark it as processed. Then, when processing v's adjacency list, we will not process it again.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead m edges, storing them in a list. For each edge, store ai, bi, ci.\n\nBuild adjacency lists. For each node u, the adjacency list contains entries of (v, edge_index, ci).\n\nAlso, create an array processed_edges of size m, initialized to False.\n\nCompute the balance for each node. For node 1, balance is sum of all ci of edges connected to it. Similarly for node n. For other nodes, balance is zero.\n\nInitialize a queue with node 1 if balance[1] is not zero. Wait, balance[1] is S, which is positive.\n\nThen, perform BFS-like processing:\n\nwhile queue not empty:\n\n   u = dequeue()\n\n   for each (v, idx, ci) in adj[u]:\n\n      if processed_edges[idx] is True: continue\n\n      if balance[u] > 0:\n\n          direction is u -> v. So, for the original edge (ai, bi), if ai is u and bi is v, then di is 0. Else, if ai is v and bi is u, then di is 1. Wait, no. The original edge is stored as ai, bi. So for the edge between u and v, regardless of which is ai or bi, we need to decide whether the direction is u to v or v to u.\n\nBut for the purpose of storing the direction, we need to know whether the direction is ai → bi (di=0) or bi → ai (di=1).\n\nBut how to track that. For each edge, when we decide the direction, we can set the output accordingly.\n\nSo, for example, during processing, when we process the edge between u and v, and decide to direct it from u to v, then:\n\nif the original edge was (ai, bi) = (u, v), then di is 0.\n\nif the original edge was (ai, bi) = (v, u), then di is 1.\n\nBut how to know which one it is. For each edge in the adjacency list, we need to know the original ai and bi.\n\nAh, right! The adjacency list entries need to store the original ai and bi for the edge, not just the neighbor. Because, when we process the edge between u and v, we need to know whether the original edge was (u, v) or (v, u) to determine the direction.\n\nSo, the adjacency list for each node u should contain entries of (v, original_ai, original_bi, index, ci). Wait, but for the edge between u and v, the original_ai and original_bi could be either (u, v) or (v, u). So, when building the adjacency list, for each edge (ai, bi, ci), we add to adj[ai] an entry (bi, ai, bi, index, ci), and to adj[bi] an entry (ai, ai, bi, index, ci). Because for the edge (ai, bi), when you are at node bi, the edge connects to ai, and the original ai and bi are known.\n\nSo, during processing, when we process an edge between u and v (original ai and bi are stored), and decide to direct it from u to v, then:\n\nif the original ai is u and bi is v, then di is 0.\n\nelse, if the original ai is v and bi is u, then di is 1.\n\nBut how to determine this. For each edge, when we process it, we have the original ai and bi. So, for example, the edge is stored as (v, ai, bi, idx, ci). So, during processing, when we decide to direct the edge from u to v, we check if ai is u and bi is v. If yes, then di is 0. Else, if ai is v and bi is u, then di is 1. But wait, the edge could be between u and v, and the original ai and bi could be (u, v) or (v, u). So, the original ai and bi are stored in the adjacency list entry.\n\nThus, for each edge in the adjacency list, we have the original ai and bi. So, during processing, when we decide to direct the edge from u to v (u and v are the current nodes in the adjacency list entry), we can compare with the original ai and bi.\n\nBut how to get u and v. For example, when processing the adjacency list entry for node u, the entry is (v, original_ai, original_bi, idx, ci). So, the edge connects u and v. The original ai and bi are stored as original_ai and original_bi. So, for example, if the original edge was (original_ai, original_bi) = (u, v), then directing it from u to v means di is 0. If the original edge was (v, u), then directing from u to v would mean di is 1.\n\nSo, in code, for each edge, when we decide to direct it from u to v, we check:\n\nif original_ai == u and original_bi == v → di is 0.\n\nelse → di is 1.\n\nBut how to handle this. So, during processing, for each edge, when we decide to direct it from u to v, we can compute di as follows:\n\nif original_ai == u and original_bi == v → 0.\n\nelse if original_ai == v and original_bi == u → 1.\n\nBut wait, the original edge could be between u and v, and the original_ai and original_bi could be either way. So, for example, if the edge was originally stored as (ai, bi) = (v, u), then directing it from u to v would be the opposite of the original direction, hence di is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code would need to store for each edge in the adjacency list, the original ai and bi, and the index.\n\nOnce the direction is decided, we can record the di for that index.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nImplement the adjacency list with the original ai and bi for each edge.\n\nInitialize the balance array.\n\nInitialize the queue with node 1 (if balance[1] is non-zero).\n\nProcess the queue.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut for large n and m (up to 2e5), we need to use efficient data structures. For example, using deque for the queue.\n\nBut how to build the adjacency list. Let's think.\n\nFor each of the m edges, we have ai, bi, ci. For each edge, we add to adj[ai] a tuple (bi, ai, bi, index, ci), and to adj[bi] a tuple (ai, ai, bi, index, ci). Wait, no. Wait, for the edge between ai and bi, when added to adj[ai], the entry is (bi, ai, bi, index, ci). When added to adj[bi], the entry is (ai, ai, bi, index, ci). Because for the entry in adj[bi], the original ai and bi are the original ones. So, for example, for the original edge (ai, bi), the entries in adj[ai] and adj[bi] both have the original ai and bi.\n\nYes. So, for each edge, when added to adj[ai], the original ai and bi are stored as (ai, bi). Similarly for adj[bi], the original ai and bi are stored as (ai, bi). So, when processing an edge in adj[u], the original_ai and original_bi are the original ai and bi of the edge.\n\nSo, during processing, when we process an edge between u and v (which is stored as (v, original_ai, original_bi, idx, ci)), and decide to direct it from u to v, then:\n\nif original_ai is u and original_bi is v → di is 0.\n\nelse, if original_ai is v and original_bi is u → di is 1.\n\nBut how to check this. Because the original_ai and original_bi are the original values of the edge. So",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to direct the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conservation conditions and is acyclic. The key challenge is ensuring that each vertex (except the source and sink) has equal incoming and outgoing flow, while also maintaining an acyclic structure.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to store the graph, including the original endpoints of each edge for later reference.\n2. **Balance Calculation**: Calculate the initial balance for each node based on the flow values. The source (node 1) should have a positive balance, and the sink (node n) should have a negative balance, while all other nodes start with zero balance.\n3. **Queue Processing**: Use a queue to process nodes starting from the source. For each node, direct edges in a way that balances the flow requirements. If a node has a positive balance, direct edges away from it; if negative, direct edges towards it.\n4. **Edge Direction Assignment**: Track the direction of each edge as it is processed to ensure the flow conservation conditions are met and the graph remains acyclic.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    m = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    edges = []\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for idx in range(m):\n        ai = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        bi = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ci = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        edges.append((ai, bi, ci))\n        # Add to adj[ai]\n        adj[ai].append((bi, ai, bi, idx, ci))\n        # Add to adj[bi]\n        adj[bi].append((ai, ai, bi, idx, ci))\n\n    balance = [0] * (n + 1)\n    # Compute balance for source and sink\n    for u in range(1, n + 1):\n        if u == 1:\n            total = 0\n            for (v, a, b, idx, c) in adj[u]:\n                total += c\n            balance[u] = total\n        elif u == n:\n            total = 0\n            for (v, a, b, idx, c) in adj[u]:\n                total += c\n            balance[u] = -total\n\n    result = [0] * m\n    processed = [False] * m\n\n    q = deque()\n    if balance[1] != 0:\n        q.append(1)\n\n    while q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        for entry in adj[u]:\n            v, original_ai, original_bi, idx, ci = entry\n            if processed[idx]:\n                continue\n            if balance[u] > 0:\n                # direct from u to v\n                result[idx] = 0 if (original_ai == u and original_bi == v) else 1\n                balance[u] -= ci\n                balance[v] += ci\n                processed[idx] = True\n                if balance[v] != 0:\n                    q.append(v)\n            elif balance[u] < 0:\n                # direct from v to u\n                result[idx] = 1 if (original_ai == u and original_bi == v) else 0\n                balance[u] += ci\n                balance[v] -= ci\n                processed[idx] = True\n                if balance[v] != 0:\n                    q.append(v)\n            else:\n                # This should not happen as per problem statement\n                pass\n\n    for d in result:\n        print(d)\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Graph Representation**: The adjacency list `adj` stores each edge along with its original endpoints and index for later reference when determining the direction.\n- **Balance Calculation**: The balance for each node is initialized based on the sum of flows connected to the source and sink nodes.\n- **Queue Processing**: Using a queue, nodes are processed to direct edges such that their balances are adjusted appropriately.
