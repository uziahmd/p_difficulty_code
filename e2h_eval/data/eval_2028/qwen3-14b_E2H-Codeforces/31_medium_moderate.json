Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have a sum, and we need to add some cards such that their total sum cancels out the existing sum. But each added card must have a value between -x and x, inclusive. And we need the minimal number of cards for that.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero, so the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of cards (each with absolute value ≤x) that sum up to T. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, if T is 0, then no cards are needed. Otherwise, what's the minimal number?\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible sum per card. Each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or -x (if negative). So, to reach T, the minimal number of cards would be determined by how much T is and how much each card can contribute.\n\nLet me take the absolute value of T. Let's say |T| is the value we need to reach. Each card can contribute up to x towards this. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, maybe not exactly. Because if T is 5 and x is 2, then 5/2 is 2.5, so ceil is 3. Which would be 2+2+1? But wait, each card can be any value between -x and x. So for example, to get a sum of 5, with x=2, you can use two cards: 2 and 3? No, wait, the maximum per card is 2. Oh right. So maximum per card is x. So for T=5, the minimal number of cards is 3 (2+2+1, but since each card can be any value as long as absolute value is <=x). Wait, but 2 + 2 + 1 is 5. But each card can be 2, 2, 1. But 1 is allowed because it's within x=2. So yes. But how to find the minimal number of cards?\n\nSo the minimal number of cards required is ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, let's think. For example, if T is 3, x is 2. Then 3 / 2 is 1.5, so ceil is 2. Which is possible with 2+1 (but each card can be 2 and 1, which are allowed). So yes, two cards. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but what if T is 4 and x is 2. Then 4/2 is 2, so two cards. Which is possible with 2+2. So that works. So the formula is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, what if T is 1 and x is 2. Then 1/2 is 0.5, ceil is 1. Which is correct. So the minimal number is 1.\n\nBut what if T is 0? Then zero cards. So the formula is:\n\nif T is zero, then 0. Otherwise, the minimal number is ceil( |T| / x ), but wait, maybe there's a case where you can't reach exactly T with that number of cards. Wait, no. Because for example, if you have |T| = k * x + r, where r is between 0 and x-1. Then, you can take k cards with x, and one card with r. But if r is zero, then k cards. But in that case, the total is k * x + r = |T|. So the minimal number of cards is k + (r != 0 ? 1 : 0). But that's exactly ceil( |T| / x ). Because for example, if |T| is 5, x is 2. 5 / 2 is 2.5, ceil is 3. Which is 2 + 2 + 1. So yes.\n\nBut wait, what if |T| is 3 and x is 2. Then 3/2 is 1.5, ceil is 2. Which would be 2 + 1. But 1 is allowed. So that's correct.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but only if T is not zero. But wait, what if T is 1 and x is 1. Then 1/1 is 1, so one card. Which is correct. If T is 2 and x is 1, then 2/1 is 2. So two cards. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 3 and x is 3. Then 3/3 is 1. So one card. Which is correct. So yes.\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\nCalculate the sum S of the given cards. Then T = -S. If T is zero, answer is zero. Else, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, wait. Let me think again. Because the sum of the new cards must be exactly T. So the minimal number of cards is the minimal k such that k * x >= |T|. Because each card can contribute up to x. So the minimal k is ceil( |T| / x ). So that's correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute the sum of the given cards. Let's call it sum_cards.\n\n- Compute T = -sum_cards.\n\n- If T is zero, output 0.\n\n- Else, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( abs(T) / x )\n\nBut wait, let me check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input: 3 2; cards are -1, 1, 2. Sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. So |T| is 2. x is 2. So 2/2 = 1. So answer is 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSecond sample input: 2 3; cards are -2, -2. Sum is -4. T is 4. |T| is 4. x is 3. 4 / 3 is 1.333..., ceil is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: if T is 5 and x is 2. Then 5/2 is 2.5, ceil is 3. So 3 cards.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 0? Then the answer is 0.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the list of numbers.\n\nsum_cards = sum of the list.\n\ntarget = -sum_cards.\n\nif target == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_target = abs(target)\n\n    min_cards = ceil( abs_target / x )\n\n    print( min_cards )\n\nWait, but how to compute ceil in Python?\n\nFor example, in Python, to compute ceil(a / b), where a and b are integers, we can do (a + b - 1) // b.\n\nYes. Because for example, 5/2 is 2.5. (5 + 2 -1 ) // 2 = 6//2=3. Which is correct.\n\nSo for abs_target and x, the minimal number of cards is (abs_target + x -1 ) // x.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nsum_cards = sum( list_of_numbers )\n\ntarget = -sum_cards\n\nif target == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_t = abs(target)\n\n    print( (abs_t + x -1 ) // x )\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nsum_cards is 2. target is -2. abs_t is 2. x is 2. (2 + 2 -1 ) // 2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSample 2: sum_cards is -4. target is 4. x is 3. (4 +3 -1 )//3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: T is 5, x=2. (5+2-1)/2 =6/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: T is 3, x=2. (3 +2-1)/2=4/2=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: T is 1, x=1. (1 +1-1)/1=1/1=1. Correct.\n\nWhat if T is 0? Then output 0.\n\nBut what if sum_cards is zero? Then target is zero, output 0.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nBut wait, what if x is zero? Wait, no. The problem says x is at least 1. Because in the input, x is given as 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000.\n\nSo no division by zero here.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: sum_cards is zero. Output 0.\n\nCase 2: sum_cards is 1, x is 1. Then target is -1. abs_t is 1. (1 +1 -1 )//1 = 1//1=1. Correct.\n\nCase 3: sum_cards is 3, x is 1. Then target is -3. abs_t is 3. (3 +1-1)/1 =3. So 3 cards. Which is correct (each card is -1, three times).\n\nAnother case: sum_cards is 4, x is 3. target is -4. abs_t is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 =6/3=2. So two cards. For example, 3 and 1. Or 2 and 2. But since the maximum per card is 3. So yes, possible.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and x from input.\n\nRead the list of n integers.\n\nCompute sum_cards = sum of the list.\n\nCompute target = -sum_cards.\n\nif target is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute (abs(target) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nSo the code can be written in Python as follows.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as two lines. First line has n and x. Second line has n integers.\n\nBut looking at the example input given in the problem:\n\nThe first example input is:\n\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\nWait, but the input is given as two separate test cases? Or is that part of the code's input? Wait, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and x, the second line contains the list of numbers.\n\nBut the sample input shows two examples. But the code is supposed to read from stdin. So for the code, the input is two lines. For example, in the first sample input, the first line is \"3 2\", the second line is \"-1 1 2\".\n\nSo the code should read two lines from stdin. The first line is split into n and x. The second line is split into n integers.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the first line as input().split(), then n and x.\n\nThen read the second line as list of integers.\n\nSo:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_cards = sum(cards)\n\ntarget = -sum_cards\n\nif target == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    abs_t = abs(target)\n\n    print( (abs_t + x -1 ) // x )\n\nWait, but what about when the sum_cards is zero? For example, if the sum is zero, then target is zero, so output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nn=3, x=2. cards [-1,1,2]. sum is 2. target is -2. abs_t is 2. (2 + 2-1)//2 = (3)//2 = 1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=2, x=3. cards [-2,-2]. sum is -4. target is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1 and the card is 0. sum is 0. target is 0. output 0.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1 and card is 1. sum is 1. target is -1. abs_t is 1. (1 +1-1)//1 = 1//1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: sum is 5, x=3. target is -5. abs_t=5. (5+3-1)/3=7/3=2.333 floored to 2. So 2 cards. 3 + 2 = 5. So yes.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what if x is larger than the target?\n\nLike, sum_cards is 3, x is 5. Then target is -3. abs_t is 3. (3 +5-1)/5 = 7//5=1. Which is correct. One card with -3.\n\nYes, which is allowed since x is 5, so -3 is within the range.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the code is as described.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the newly found ones) equals zero. The cards can have values ranging from -x to x, where x is a given maximum absolute value.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum needed to balance the current sum to zero is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Check for Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards Required**: If the target sum is non-zero, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula derived from the maximum possible contribution per card. This is done by dividing the absolute value of the target sum by the maximum allowed absolute value (x), rounding up to ensure we cover any remainder.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\ncards = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_cards = sum(cards)\ntarget = -sum_cards\n\nif target == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    abs_t = abs(target)\n    print((abs_t + x - 1) // x)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers, `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value on a card). The second line contains the list of integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards.\n3. **Target Calculation**: Determine the target sum needed to balance the current sum to zero. This is simply the negative of the current sum.\n4. **Zero Target Check**: If the target sum is zero, print 0 as no additional cards are needed.\n5. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: If the target sum is non-zero, calculate the minimum number of cards required using integer arithmetic to simulate the ceiling of division. This ensures that even if there's a remainder when dividing the target sum by the maximum card value, we account for it by rounding up.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum number of cards required using basic arithmetic operations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
