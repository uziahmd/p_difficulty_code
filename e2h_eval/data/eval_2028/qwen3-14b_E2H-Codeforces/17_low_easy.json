He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that matches the assignments.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the main idea: For each possible candidate string s (of length n), check if all the given strings are its prefixes or suffixes. But since n can be up to 100, generating all possible candidates might not be feasible directly. However, perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, meaning that there exists at least one s. So maybe we can find the correct s by considering the longest possible prefixes and suffixes.\n\nAnother observation: The longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be such that their combination can form the original string. For example, if the original string is s, then the longest prefix is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is s[1..n-1]. So, these two strings must overlap in such a way that their combination forms s.\n\nWait, but how can I find s? Because the given list includes two strings of length n-1. One of them is the prefix, the other is the suffix. So, for example, if I take the two strings of length n-1, and check if they can be combined to form a string s of length n. How?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that the correct s has a prefix of length n-1, say P, and a suffix of length n-1, say S. Then, the original string s must be P + last character (but that's not correct). Wait, no. The prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the first character of the suffix is s[1], and the last character of the prefix is s[n-2]. So the original string s must be the prefix plus the last character of the suffix. Wait, but the prefix is length n-1, so the original string is prefix + (the last character of the suffix?), no. Let me think again:\n\nIf the prefix is of length n-1, then the original string s is that prefix plus one more character. But the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s. So the suffix is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the original string s can be constructed as the prefix (s[0..n-2]) concatenated with the last character of the suffix (s[n-1]).\n\nBut the suffix is s[1..n-1], which is of length n-1. So the original string s would be equal to (prefix) + (last character of suffix). Also, the suffix is (s[1..n-1]), which is the same as the original string s without the first character. Therefore, the prefix (length n-1) and the suffix (length n-1) must satisfy that the prefix's last character is the same as the suffix's first character? No, because the prefix is s[0..n-2], and the suffix is s[1..n-1]. The prefix's last character is s[n-2], and the suffix's first character is s[1]. These two are not necessarily related. However, the original string s is the prefix plus the last character of the suffix. Wait, no. The original string s is prefix plus one character. That one character is the last character of the suffix. Because the suffix is s[1..n-1], which is length n-1. So the original string s is s[0] s[1] ... s[n-2] s[n-1]. The suffix is s[1] ... s[n-1], so the last character of the suffix is s[n-1]. Therefore, the original string can be formed by taking the prefix (s[0..n-2]) and appending the last character of the suffix (s[n-1]).\n\nSo, if I have two strings of length n-1, one being a prefix and the other a suffix,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct combination of the longest prefix and suffix to reconstruct the original string and then validating all other given strings against this reconstructed string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest prefix and suffix of the unknown string `s` are of length `n-1`. There are exactly two such strings in the input. By checking all possible pairs of these strings, we can determine a candidate for the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct Original String**: For each valid pair of the longest prefix and suffix, reconstruct the original string `s` by combining the prefix with the last character of the suffix.\n3. **Validate All Strings**: Once a candidate string `s` is reconstructed, validate all given strings to check if they are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n4. **Determine Assignments**: Based on the validation, assign 'P' for prefixes and 'S' for suffixes accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find all strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all possible pairs of these two strings as prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # Reconstruct the possible original string\n            # The original string is prefix_candidate + (last char of suffix_candidate)\n            possible_s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Now check if all strings are either prefix or suffix of possible_s\n            assignment = []\n            valid = True\n            for s in strings:\n                is_prefix = possible_s.startswith(s)\n                is_suffix = possible_s.endswith(s)\n                if not is_prefix and not is_suffix:\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n                # If both are true, we can choose either, but need to make sure that the count of P and S is equal\n                # However, since the problem says that there exists at least one valid assignment, we can just pick one\n                # Here, we'll choose 'P' if it's a prefix, else 'S'\n                if is_prefix and is_suffix:\n                    # Need to decide which to choose.

If valid, the corresponding 'P' or 'S' is assigned.\n5. **Output**: The valid assignment of 'P' and 'S' is printed once a valid configuration is found.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignments by leveraging the properties of prefixes and suffixes of the original string.",
