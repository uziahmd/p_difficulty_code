He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's indicating for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix. And there might be multiple valid answers, but we just need to output any one that's correct.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. For example, in the first sample input, n=5. Then there are 8 strings. Each of the lengths from 1 to 4 (since n-1=4) appears exactly twice. So for each possible length, there are two strings. But they can be in any order.\n\nThe key is to find a way to assign each of these strings as either a prefix or suffix such that there exists a string s of length n that has all the assigned prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how do I find such an assignment?\n\nLet me think: The actual string s must have certain properties. For example, the longest prefix (length n-1) must be the first n-1 characters of s, and similarly for the longest suffix. Also, for each possible length l, there are two strings. One of them is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. Wait, no. Because for each length l from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. But for the actual string s, there's exactly one prefix of each length l (from 1 to n-1) and exactly one suffix of each length l. So the given list contains all those prefixes and suffixes, but we don't know which is which.\n\nSo the approach is to find a way to assign for each length l, one of the two strings as prefix and the other as suffix, such that there exists a string s that satisfies all these assignments.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way is to find the actual string s. Once we know s, then for each input string, check if it is a prefix or suffix of s. Then assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how to find s? Well, since the input gives all the prefixes and suffixes of s, but not which is which, maybe the correct s can be determined by looking for the unique string that has all the given strings as prefixes and suffixes. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be such that there exists at least one string s. So our job is to find any possible s that fits, then assign the labels accordingly.\n\nBut how to find s?\n\nLet me think: The correct s must have the following properties. For example, the prefix of length n-1 must be the first n-1 characters of s, and the suffix of length n-1 must be the last n-1 characters of s. Also, the prefix of length 1 must be the first character of s, and the suffix of length 1 must be the last character of s.\n\nBut since the input includes all the prefixes and suffixes, perhaps the correct s can be determined by considering that the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must overlap in some way. For example, the first n-1 characters of s (prefix) and the last n-1 characters of s (suffix) must share some overlapping parts. So perhaps the correct s is the combination of the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length 1, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, here's an idea: The correct s must be such that the prefix of length l and the suffix of length l for each l must agree on their overlapping parts. For example, for l=1, the prefix of length 1 is the first character of s, and the suffix of length 1 is the last character. So those two strings are the first and last characters of s. But since the input gives two strings for length 1, one of them is the first character, and the other is the last.\n\nBut how to find which one is which?\n\nAlternatively, for the entire problem, perhaps the correct s is the one that can be built by taking the prefix of length n-1 and adding the suffix of length 1. Or the suffix of length n-1 and adding the prefix of length 1. But how?\n\nLet me take the first example. The input for n=5 is:\n\nba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba.\n\nThe correct s is ababa. Let's see:\n\nThe prefixes of s are:\n\nlength 1: 'a'\n\nlength 2: 'ab'\n\nlength 3: 'aba'\n\nlength 4: 'abab'\n\nThe suffixes are:\n\nlength 1: 'a'\n\nlength 2: 'ba'\n\nlength 3: 'aba'\n\nlength 4: '",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct string `s` and then classifying each input string as either a prefix or a suffix of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Correct String `s`**: \n   - The correct string `s` can be derived by considering the longest proper prefix and suffix. For a string `s` of length `n`, the longest proper prefix has length `n-1` and the longest proper suffix also has length `n-1`. The correct string `s` can be formed by combining these two strings such that they overlap correctly.\n\n2. **Classify Input Strings**:\n   - Once we have the correct string `s`, we check each input string to see if it is a prefix or suffix of `s`. This classification helps us generate the required output string of 'P' and 'S'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the possible candidates for the full string s\n    # The full string s must be such that:\n    # - There exists a prefix of length n-1 and a suffix of length n-1\n    # So we can try all combinations of the two strings of length n-1\n    # Then check if the rest of the strings are prefixes or suffixes of s\n    \n    from collections import defaultdict\n\n    # Group strings by their lengths\n    length_map = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        length_map[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Get the two candidates for the longest prefix and suffix (length n-1)\n    candidates = length_map[n-1]\n    for candidate1 in candidates:\n        for candidate2 in candidates:\n            if candidate1 == candidate2:\n                continue\n            # Try to build s by combining the prefix and suffix\n            # The first n-1 characters are candidate1, the last n-1 are candidate2\n            # So the full string s should be candidate1[0] + candidate2[1:]\n            # Or candidate2[0] + candidate1[1:]?
