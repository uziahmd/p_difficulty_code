Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between two blocks. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a block here. Since the roads are infinite lines, they divide the plane into regions. Each block is a region bounded by these lines. The key thing is that moving from one block to another requires that they share a common border of non-zero length. So, if two blocks are adjacent along a line segment (part of a road), you can move between them in one step.\n\nBut how do I model the blocks and their adjacency? It seems impossible to represent all possible blocks directly because there are infinitely many regions. However, since we only need to find the shortest path between two specific blocks (home and university), maybe we can model this as a graph where each node represents a region (block) and edges represent adjacency. But how to represent regions without enumerating them?\n\nWait, here's an idea: For any given point (like home or university), the regions can be represented by the signs of the equations of the roads. Because each road divides the plane into two halves. For example, for a road ax + by + c = 0, a point (x,y) will be on one side or the other. So, each region can be uniquely determined by the sign of each road's equation evaluated at that point. \n\nBut since there are n roads, each with two possible signs, the total number of regions is 2^n. However, this is only true if all roads are in general position, but even if not, the regions can be represented by these sign combinations. However, some sign combinations might not be possible (like if two roads are parallel, etc.), but regardless, for our problem, we can model each region by the sign vector of the roads. \n\nBut how do we determine which regions are adjacent? Two regions are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if two regions differ in exactly one road's sign, then they are separated by that road. So, moving across that road would allow a step between them. However, if two regions differ in more than one road's sign, then they are not adjacent. \n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. Suppose two regions differ in exactly one road's sign. Then, they are separated by that road. So their common border is that road. Therefore, they are adjacent and can be moved between in one step. If two regions differ in two roads' signs, then perhaps they are separated by two roads, but maybe their adjacency is not direct. So the adjacency graph is such that two nodes (regions) are connected if their sign vectors differ in exactly one road's sign. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to modeling the regions as nodes, each represented by the sign vector of the roads. Then, the home and university are each in specific regions (their sign vectors). We need to find the shortest path between these two nodes, where each edge represents flipping exactly one sign (i.e., crossing a road). \n\nBut how do we compute the sign vectors for the home and university points? For each road, evaluate the equation ax + by + c. Since the home and university are not on any road, the value will be positive or negative. For each road, we can note the sign (positive or negative) for the home and for the university. \n\nThen, the problem becomes: find the minimum number of steps to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, where each step changes exactly one bit (flips a sign). Wait, no. Because each step corresponds to crossing a road, which would flip the sign of that road's equation. So, the difference between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector is the number of roads where their signs differ. However, since each step can flip one sign, the minimal steps would be the number of differing signs divided by something? No, that's not right. Because if you have multiple differing signs, you need to find a path where each step flips one sign, and you need to reach the target. \n\nWait, but the problem is similar to finding the minimum number of bit flips needed to convert one binary string to another, but here each flip can be done in any order. However, the minimal steps would be the number of differing bits. Because each differing bit can be flipped once. \n\nWait, but that's only if the differing bits can be flipped independently. However, in this case, each flip corresponds to crossing a road. But each road can be crossed once. However, in reality, the regions are connected such that flipping any single sign (crossing a road) takes you to a neighboring region. So, the minimal steps between two regions is the Hamming distance between their sign vectors. Because each differing bit requires a flip. For example,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a starting block (home) to a destination block (university) in a plane divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Blocks and Roads**: Each road divides the plane into two regions. The position of a point relative to a road can be determined by evaluating the equation of the road at that point. The sign of the result tells us which side of the road the point is on.\n2. **Sign Vectors**: For both the home and university points, we compute a sign vector based on their position relative to each road. Each element of this vector indicates whether the point lies on one side or the other of the corresponding road.\n3. **Hamming Distance**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the Hamming distance between their sign vectors. This is because each differing sign in the vectors indicates a road that needs to be crossed, and crossing each road corresponds to one step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    \n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Function to compute sign vector for a point\n    def get_signs(x, y):\n        signs = []\n        for a, b, c in roads:\n            val = a * x + b * y + c\n            signs.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n        return tuple(signs)\n    \n    home_signs = get_signs(x1, y1)\n    univ_signs = get_signs(x2, y2)\n    \n    # Compute Hamming distance\n    diff = sum(h != u for h, u in zip(home_signs, univ_signs))\n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home and university, along with the equations of the roads.\n2. **Sign Vector Calculation**: For both the home and university points, we compute a sign vector. Each element in this vector is determined by evaluating the corresponding road equation at the point's coordinates. A positive result indicates the point is on one side of the road, while a negative result indicates it is on the other side.\n3. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The minimum number of steps required is determined by counting the number of positions where the sign vectors of the home and university differ. Each difference corresponds to a road that must be crossed, hence each difference contributes one step to the total.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps using the properties of sign vectors and Hamming distance, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
