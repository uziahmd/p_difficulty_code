After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of successful students. A successful student is one who is the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, the approach here is to check for each student if there's at least one subject where they have the maximum mark for that subject.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line is n and m. Then there are n lines each with m characters. Each character is a digit from 1-9. So, for example, if the input is '223', that's the first student's marks for three subjects.\n\nThe plan is:\n\n1. For each subject (columns), find the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if in any of the subjects they have the maximum mark for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nWait, but how do I process the data? Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, I need to process the gradebook. Let's think of it as a 2D array. Each row is a student, each column is a subject.\n\nSo for each column (subject), find the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in a subject is equal to the maximum of that subject. If at least one exists, then the student is successful.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the next n lines, each line being a string of m digits. Convert each line into a list of integers, perhaps. Or maybe just process them as strings, but comparing characters as digits.\n\nBut for comparison, we can treat each character as an integer. For example, for the first student's marks, the first subject is the first character, etc.\n\nSo, for each subject j (from 0 to m-1), find the maximum value among all students' j-th marks.\n\nOnce I have the maximums for each subject, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any subject equals the maximum for that subject. If yes, count them.\n\nSo, the first thing is to compute the maximum for each subject.\n\nLet me think about how to get the maximum for each column. For example, for the first sample input:\n\nSample 1:\nn=3, m=3\nstudents' marks:\n2 2 3\n2 3 2\n1 1 2\n\nSo the subjects are columns 0, 1, 2.\n\nFor column 0: 2, 2, 1 → max is 2.\nColumn 1: 2, 3, 1 → max is 3.\nColumn 2: 3, 2, 2 → max is 3.\n\nThen, for each student:\n\nStudent 0: has marks 2, 2, 3. For column 0, he has 2 which is equal to max. So he is successful. Also, column 2 has 3 which is max. So he's successful.\n\nStudent 1: marks 2,3,2. Column 1 has 3 (max), so he's successful.\n\nStudent 2: marks 1,1,2. None of these are equal to the max of their respective columns. So not successful. So total is 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen, read n lines, each line is a string. Let's store them as a list of lists. For example, for each line, convert it into a list of integers. So, for each row in the input, we can process it as [int(c) for c in line].\n\nOnce we have that, for each column j, find the maximum value.\n\nSo for j in 0 to m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max( [row[j] for row in gradebook] )\n\nOnce we have max_marks, then for each student (each row in gradebook), check if any of their elements in any column is equal to max_marks for that column.\n\nIf at least one, then count +=1.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string. Then, process each into a list of integers.\n\nCompute max_marks for each column.\n\nInitialize a counter to 0.\n\nFor each student in the gradebook:\n\n   for each column j:\n\n      if student's j-th mark == max_marks[j], then mark this student as successful and break out of the loop.\n\n   if any column meets the condition, increment counter.\n\nSo, how to code this.\n\nIn Python, for the first part:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen, read n lines:\n\ngradebook = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    gradebook.append(row)\n\nThen, compute max_marks for each column.\n\nmax_marks = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    col_max = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if gradebook[i][j] > col_max:\n            col_max = gradebook[i][j]\n    max_marks.append(col_max)\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\nmax_marks = [max(row[j] for row in gradebook) for j in range(m)]\n\nYes, that's better.\n\nOnce we have max_marks, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any column equals the max_marks for that column.\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in gradebook:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nWait, but for each student, we check each column. If any of them is equal to the max_marks[j], then we count the student once.\n\nYes. So for each student, we loop through their marks. If any of them is equal to the max of that column, then we add 1 to count and break.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 3 3, then 223, 232, 112.\n\ngradebook would be:\n\n[[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks for columns:\n\ncolumn 0: 2, 2, 1 → max 2\n\ncolumn 1: 2,3,1 → max 3\n\ncolumn 2: 3,2,2 → max 3\n\nso max_marks is [2,3,3]\n\nNow for each student:\n\nstudent 0: 2,2,3 → check column 0 (2 == 2 → yes). So count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: 2,3,2 → column 1 (3 == 3 → yes). count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: 1,1,2 → none of the columns match. So no.\n\nTotal is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is 3 5, and the lines are 91728, 11828, 11111.\n\nSo gradebook is:\n\n[ [9,1,7,2,8], [1,1,8,2,8], [1,1,1,1,1] ]\n\nmax_marks for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9,1,1 → max 9.\n\ncolumn 1: 1,1,1 → max 1.\n\ncolumn 2:7,8,1 → max 8.\n\ncolumn 3: 2,2,1 → max 2.\n\ncolumn 4: 8,8,1 → max 8.\n\nmax_marks = [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nNow for each student:\n\nstudent 0: has 9 (col0) which is max. So yes.\n\nstudent 1: in column 2, 8 is max. So yes.\n\nstudent 2: check each column. column 1 has 1 (max is 1). So yes. So all three students are counted. Hence output is 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, m=1. Then the student is successful because they are the best in the only subject.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. Both have same marks. Then both are successful since they are the best (since no one has higher).\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Student 1 has [5,5], student 2 has [5,5]. Then for each column, max is 5. So both students are successful.\n\nAnother case: when a student has multiple max in different subjects. But it's still counted once.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in the code, the way to read the input. For example, in the first sample input, the first line is '3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112'.\n\nBut when reading via input(), each line is read as per the input. So, for example, in the first sample, the code would read n=3, m=3, then read three lines, each being '223', '232', '112'.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother thing to note: the input may have leading or trailing spaces? No, according to the problem statement, each of the next n lines is a string of m characters. So the input lines are exactly m characters long, no spaces.\n\nSo, the code for reading each line as a string, stripping any whitespace (but probably not needed, but perhaps better to use .strip() to avoid any leading/trailing whitespace, though the problem says that each line is exactly m characters).\n\nBut in practice, when reading via input().strip(), for example, if the line is '223', then it's correct. So the code is okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string, and convert into a list of integers.\n\nThen compute max_marks for each column.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max for that column.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this.\n\nBut in Python, for the code, the code will be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen:\n\ngradebook = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    gradebook.append(row)\n\nThen:\n\nmax_marks = [max(row[j] for row in gradebook) for j in range(m)]\n\nThen count = 0\n\nfor student in gradebook:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this code with the samples.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, m=3.\n\ngradebook is [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_marks for columns 0: max(2,2,1) = 2; column 1: max(2,3,1) = 3; column 2: max(3,2,2) =3. So [2,3,3].\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0: 2,2,3 → check j=0: 2 == 2 → yes. count increases by 1.\n\nstudent 1: 2,3,2 → j=1: 3 == 3 → yes. count increases by 1.\n\nstudent 2: 1,1,2 → none. So no. Total is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=3, m=5.\n\ngradebook:\n\n[9,1,7,2,8]\n\n[1,1,8,2,8]\n\n[1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_marks for columns:\n\ncol0: 9,1,1 → 9\n\ncol1: 1,1,1 →1\n\ncol2:7,8,1 →8\n\ncol3:2,2,1 →2\n\ncol4:8,8,1 →8.\n\nso max_marks is [9,1,8,2,8].\n\nstudent 0: has 9 in col0 → yes. count +=1.\n\nstudent1: has 8 in col2 (8 ==8) → yes. count +=1.\n\nstudent2: has 1 in col1 (which is 1 == max 1). So yes. count +=1. Total 3.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, m=1. Input is 1 1 followed by 5. Then the output is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. Input is 2 1 followed by 5 and 5. Then each student is best in the subject. So output is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. Input is 2 2 followed by 12 and 21. Then max_marks for column 0 is 2, column 1 is 2. Student 1 has 2 in column 0, student 2 has 2 in column 1. So both are successful. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, the code needs to read from stdin. So the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines.\n\nBut in Python, sometimes when reading input, after reading the first line, the next lines are read with input(). So the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngradebook = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    gradebook.append(row)\n\nmax_marks = [max(row[j] for row in gradebook) for j in range(m)]\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in gradebook:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nYes.\n\nThis should work.\n\nNow, testing for the sample input given.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\nWait, but the code is supposed to read from standard input. So when the code is run, the input is read as per the input lines.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is a list of two test cases. But the problem says that the code must read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases? Wait, no. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says that the input is given as follows. The first line contains n and m. Then n lines follow. So the code is for a single test case. However, in the sample input provided, there are two test cases. But in the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of two examples, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. So the sample input is for two different test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case per run.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first line with n and m, then n lines of m digits. The output is a single number.\n\nSo the code is supposed to process one test case. The sample input shows two examples, but each is a separate test case. So the code should process one test case, not multiple.\n\nSo the code as written is correct.\n\nBut the user provided the sample input as a list of two examples, but the code is supposed to process one. So when the code is run, it reads from stdin, which for the first example would be:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nand outputs 2.\n\nSimilarly for the second example.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best in a subject means no other student has a higher grade in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: First, read the number of students (n) and the number of subjects (m). Then, read the gradebook which consists of n lines, each containing m digits representing the grades of students in different subjects.\n2. **Determine Maximum Grades per Subject**: For each subject (column in the gradebook), compute the maximum grade achieved by any student.\n3. **Check Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum grade in any subject. If they have, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\ngradebook = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    gradebook.append(row)\n\nmax_marks = [max(row[j] for row in gradebook) for j in range(m)]\n\ncount = 0\nfor student in gradebook:\n    for j in range(m):\n        if student[j] == max_marks[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line. The first line contains the integers n and m. The subsequent n lines are converted into lists of integers representing the grades of each student.\n2. **Finding Maximum Grades**: For each subject (column), we determine the highest grade using a list comprehension. This helps in quickly checking if a student is the best in any subject.\n3. **Counting Successful Students**: For each student, we check their grades against the maximum grades for each subject. If a student's grade matches the maximum grade in any subject, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging the maximum grades for each subject, resulting in an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n and m up to 100).",
