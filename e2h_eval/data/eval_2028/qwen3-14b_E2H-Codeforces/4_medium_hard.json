The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players over n rounds. Each player has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. For each round, we need to determine who wins and count the number of times each player gets pinched (i.e., loses a round). The challenge is to compute this efficiently given that n can be as large as 2e9, which is way too big for a straightforward simulation.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since directly simulating each of the n rounds is impossible due to time constraints, we need to find a pattern or cycle that can be computed once and then multiplied by the number of repetitions.\n\nFirst, let's understand how the moves are determined. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of his sequence. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of his sequence.\n\nThe key here is that the sequence of moves for both players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So, the pattern of moves between the two players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds. Therefore, if we can compute the number of losses for each player in one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, we can multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds and then add the result for the remaining rounds.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call this period_length.\n2. For each round in 0 to period_length - 1, compute the moves of A and B, determine the outcome, and count the number of losses for each player in this period.\n3. Calculate how many full periods fit into n rounds (full_cycles = n // period_length), and the remaining rounds (remainder = n % period_length).\n4. Multiply the counts from one period by full_cycles.\n5. Then simulate the remaining 'remainder' rounds and add their counts to the total.\n\nBut wait, what if the period_length is very large? For example, if m and k are both 1000, then LCM(m, k) could be up to 1e6. But since m and k are up to 1000, LCM(m,k) can be up to 1e6. And for each period_length, we can process each of the period_length rounds. Since 1e6 is manageable for processing once, even for n up to 2e9, this approach would be feasible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute the number of rounds in the full period (period_length = LCM(m, k)).\n\nCompute the number of full cycles (full_cycles) and remainder rounds (remainder).\n\nCompute the total losses for each player in one period (period_nik, period_poly).\n\nThen total_nik = full_cycles * period_nik + losses_in_remainder_nik.\n\nSame for total_poly.\n\nNow, how to compute the LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So we need to compute GCD first.\n\nIn Python, we can compute GCD using math.gcd, but note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for Python 3.5+. Also, since m and k are positive integers, this is straightforward.\n\nOnce we have the period_length, we can loop through each of the period_length rounds, compute the moves for each player, and determine the outcome.\n\nNow, for each round in 0 to period_length-1:\n\nNikephoros's move is A[ (i) % m ] ?\n\nWait, for the first round (i=0?), the first move is a1, then a2, etc. Let's assume that the rounds are 0-based. For example, for i-th round (starting from 0), Nikephoros uses A[i % m], and same for B.\n\nYes. So for each i in 0 to period_length-1, we can get the moves.\n\nNow, for each pair of moves (a, b), determine who wins.\n\nLet me think about the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock. So:\n\nIf a == b: draw, no loss.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a is R and b is S) → Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\nif (a is S and b is P) → Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\nif (a is P and b is R) → Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\nOtherwise, Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), we can check which case it is.\n\nAlternatively, we can create a helper function that takes a and b and returns who wins.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for all possible pairs.\n\nFor example, for a and b:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a, b) is (R, S) → Nikephoros wins → Polycarpus gets +1.\n\nif (a, b) is (S, P) → Nikephoros wins → Polycarpus gets +1.\n\nif (a, b) is (P, R) → Nikephoros wins → Polycarpus gets +1.\n\nElse, Nikephoros gets +1.\n\nSo, for each pair, we can check these conditions.\n\nSo, during the simulation of the period_length rounds, for each round, we can compute the moves and check who wins, and accumulate the counts.\n\nOnce we have the counts per period, multiply by full_cycles and then process the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A as a string, m is len(A).\n\nRead B as a string, k is len(B).\n\nCompute the period_length = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute the counts for one period.\n\nThen compute full_cycles = n // period_length.\n\nremainder = n % period_length.\n\nThen, total_nik = full_cycles * period_nik + remainder_nik.\n\nSame for total_poly.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nImplement a function to compute LCM.\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd exists, so:\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to handle 0? Well, since m and k are >=1, no problem.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\nCompute period_length.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to period_length-1:\n\nget a = A[i % m]\n\nget b = B[i % k]\n\ndetermine outcome.\n\nSo, for each i in 0 to period_length-1:\n\nBut for m and k up to 1000, period_length can be up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce we have the counts for the period, multiply by full_cycles.\n\nNow, for the remainder, we need to simulate the first 'remainder' rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the remainder rounds?\n\nWell, for the first remainder rounds, i ranges from 0 to remainder-1.\n\nSo, for each i in 0 to remainder-1:\n\nsame as before.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nCompute period_length.\n\nCompute the counts for one period (period_nik, period_poly).\n\nfull_cycles = n // period_length\n\nremainder = n % period_length\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * period_nik\n\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * period_poly\n\nThen, simulate the first 'remainder' rounds, adding to total_nik and total_poly.\n\nBut how to simulate those rounds?\n\nWell, for each i in 0 to remainder-1:\n\nget a = A[i % m]\n\nget b = B[i % k]\n\ncheck outcome, add to total_nik and total_poly.\n\nBut for remainder up to 1e6, this is manageable.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, and period_length up to 1e6, the remainder is up to 1e6-1, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, A is \"RPS\" (m=3), B is \"RSPP\" (k=4).\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo, period_length is 12.\n\nThen, simulate 12 rounds.\n\nBut the sample input has n=7, which is less than 12, so full_cycles is 0, remainder is 7. So simulate the first 7 rounds.\n\nWhich matches the example explanation.\n\nBut according to the sample output, the answer is 3 and 2.\n\nSo, in the first 7 rounds, Nikephoros has 3 losses, and Polycarpus has 2.\n\nSo, the code should compute that.\n\nNow, let's think about the helper function.\n\nLet me code a helper function that given a and b returns (nik, poly) where nik is 1 if Nikephoros loses (so poly gains a point), and 0 otherwise. Or perhaps, for each round, we can calculate how much each player's loss count increases.\n\nFor example, for a and b:\n\nif a == b: no change.\n\nelse:\n\nif Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets +1.\n\nElse, Nikephoros gets +1.\n\nSo, for each round, we can compute:\n\nif a beats b: then Polycarpus gets a spot (Nikephoros loses) → so add 1 to Nikephoros's count (since he lost).\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nthe loser gets pinched. So, for each round, if Nikephoros loses, he gets a spot. If Polycarpus loses, he gets a spot.\n\nSo, for each round, the number of spots for Nikephoros is increased by 1 if he loses, and same for Polycarpus.\n\nSo, for the pair (a, b):\n\nif a wins → Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's count is not increased, but Polycarpus's count is increased by 1).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the winner is determined. The loser is the one who gets pinched.\n\nSo, for example, if Nikephoros's move beats Polycarpus's move, then Polycarpus is the loser. So Nikephoros's count of red spots is not increased, but Polycarpus's count is increased by 1.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nthe loser gets pinched. So, for each round, the loser is the one who gets a spot.\n\nSo, for each round:\n\nif Nikephoros wins → Polycarpus gets a spot (so add 1 to Polycarpus's count).\n\nif Polycarpus wins → Nikephoros gets a spot (add 1 to Nikephoros's count).\n\nif draw → nothing.\n\nSo, the code for each a and b:\n\nif a == b: pass.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a beats b):\n\nthen Polycarpus's count +=1\n\nelse:\n\nNikephoros's count +=1\n\nSo, how to check if a beats b?\n\nWe can create a helper function:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, so b is loser. So Polycarpus gets a spot (since b is his move?)\n\n        # Wait, a is Nikephoros's move, b is Polycarpus's move.\n\n        # So, if a beats b, then Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses → Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # Nikephoros loses, so his count increases by 1.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes. So for each pair (a, b), this returns (nik_spots, poly_spots) added for that round.\n\nSo, in code, for each round, we can compute this.\n\nNow, let's proceed with the code.\n\nNow, for the sample input:\n\nIn the first sample:\n\nn=7.\n\nA is RPS (m=3), B is RSPP (k=4).\n\nSo for each round from 0 to 6 (since remainder is 7):\n\ni=0:\n\na = A[0%3] = A[0] = R\n\nb = B[0%4] = B[0] = R → same → no spots.\n\ni=1:\n\na = A[1%3] = A[1] = P\n\nb = B[1%4] = B[1] = S.\n\nP vs S: S beats P? Wait, no. Wait:\n\nRock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock.\n\nSo, S (scissors) beats P (paper). So in this case, a is P, b is S. So b (S) beats a (P). So Nikephoros loses → his count increases by 1.\n\nSo the result is (1, 0).\n\nBut according to the sample explanation:\n\nRound 2 (assuming rounds are 1-based?), but the example explanation says:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (since S beats P). So Nikephoros gets a spot. So the sample says in the first sample, Nikephoros has 3 losses. Let me check the example.\n\nIn the example explanation:\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R-R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (because S beats P). So Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nRound 3: S vs P → Nikephoros's move is S, Polycarpus's is P. S beats P → Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nRound 4: R vs P → Nikephoros's R loses to P → Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nRound 5: P vs R → Nikephoros's P beats R → Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nRound 6: S vs S → draw.\n\nRound 7: R vs P → Nikephoros's R loses to P → his count increases by 1.\n\nSo total for Nikephoros: 3 (rounds 2,4,7). Polycarpus: 2 (rounds 3,5).\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 3 2.\n\nSo in the code, for i=1 (second round?), the code would generate (1, 0) → Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to process all these steps.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the code.\n\nBut first, let's think about handling the input.\n\nWait, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem's example. Because in the actual input, the first line is n, second is A, third is B. So the sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nWhich is the first example. The output is 3 2.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nWhich outputs 0 0.\n\nBecause in each round, both play R, so all draws.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n as int(input()).\n\nThen A = input().strip()\n\nThen B = input().strip()\n\nNow, compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period_length = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each of the period_length rounds, the number of spots for each.\n\nNow, code:\n\nCompute the LCM.\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd is available in Python 3.5+.\n\nBut since m and k can be up to 1000, the LCM can be up to 1e6.\n\nSo:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nThen, period_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\nNow, simulate for period_length rounds:\n\nperiod_nik = 0\n\nperiod_poly = 0\n\nfor i in range(period_length):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    # compute result\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\n        period_poly +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        # Nikephoros loses, so he gets a spot.\n\n        period_nik +=1\n\nOnce that's done, compute full_cycles = n // period_length\n\nremainder = n % period_length\n\nThen, total_nik = full_cycles * period_nik\n\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * period_poly\n\nThen, simulate the first 'remainder' rounds:\n\nfor i in range(remainder):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        total_poly +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        total_nik +=1\n\nThen print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the period_length is 12. But n is 7, which is less than 12. So full_cycles is 0, and remainder is 7. So the code simulates 7 rounds.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the code for the sample input.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nn=5, A is RRRRRRRR (m=8), B is R (k=1). So LCM(8,1) is 8.\n\nIn each round, the moves are R vs R. So no spots. So for the period_length of 8 rounds, period_nik and period_poly are 0. So for n=5, full_cycles is 0, remainder is 5. Simulate 5 rounds, all draws. So output 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if n is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nAnother case: when m=1 and k=1. So period_length is 1. So for each round, check once.\n\nAnother case: when the sequences are such that in the period, there are some wins and losses.\n\nNow, what about the case where the period_length is very large, say 1e6, but n is 2e9. Then, full_cycles would be 2e9 / 1e6 = 2000, and remainder is 0. So the code would compute period_nik and period_poly once, multiply by 2000, and add zero. Which is efficient.\n\nSo the code is efficient.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, for the case where the period_length is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1, so LCM is at least 1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nperiod_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\nperiod_nik = 0\nperiod_poly = 0\n\nfor i in range(period_length):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        period_poly += 1\n    else:\n        period_nik += 1\n\nfull_cycles = n // period_length\nremainder = n % period_length\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * period_nik\ntotal_poly = full_cycles * period_poly\n\nfor i in range(remainder):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        total_poly += 1\n    else:\n        total_nik += 1\n\nprint(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the code would compute period_length as LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nThen, for the 7 rounds in the remainder, the code loops from 0 to 6 (i in 0..6). Let's see:\n\ni ranges from 0 to 6 (7 rounds). Which is correct.\n\nTesting the first sample:\n\nLet me compute the period_nik and period_poly for 12 rounds. But since n is 7, the code skips that part and processes the remainder.\n\nBut let's think about the code's correctness.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nBut let me test another scenario. Suppose n is equal to the period_length. Then, remainder is zero. So the code adds full_cycles * ... and nothing else.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible error: in the code, when i is in the range of period_length, which is up to 1e6, but for m and k up to 1000, the i%m and i%k are correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother possible error: in the code, the for loops for the period_length and remainder. But in Python, range(period_length) is 0-based, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, considering that the code may have to process up to 1e6 steps for the period_length, and up to 1e6 steps for the remainder, but given that 1e6 is manageable in Python, even for the worst case.\n\nBut for the constraints of m and k up to 1000, LCM(m, k) can be up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n",

Handle the remaining rounds separately to ensure accuracy.\n5. **Efficiency**: By leveraging the repeating nature of the sequences, the solution efficiently handles up to 2 billion rounds without simulating each round individually, ensuring optimal performance.",
