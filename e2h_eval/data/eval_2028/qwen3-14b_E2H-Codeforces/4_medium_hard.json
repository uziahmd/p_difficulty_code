The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Nikephoros and Polycarpus play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Their moves are based on their sequences A and B, which they cycle through. I have to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., how many times they lose each round).\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. Each character is R, S, or P.\n\nThe problem is that n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round step by step. So simulating each round one by one is impossible because it would take O(n) time, which would be way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how the sequences repeat. For each round i (starting from 0?), Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nSo the key is to find for each round, which of the two players wins, and count the number of times each loses.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, so that we can compute the total without checking every single round.\n\nThe idea is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let's call this LCM(m, k) = L. Because after L rounds, both sequences A and B will have completed an integer number of cycles. So the pattern of moves between the two players will repeat every L rounds. Therefore, if we can compute the number of losses for each player in one L-length cycle, then multiply that by the number of full cycles in n rounds, and then add the result for the remaining rounds (n mod L), that would be efficient.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute L = LCM(m, k). But how to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So first compute GCD of m and k.\n\nBut for m and k up to 1000, their LCM could be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000=1e6). So even if n is 2e9, the LCM is manageable. Because for example, if L is 1e6, then the number of full cycles is (n // L), and the remainder is (n % L). So for each full cycle, we can compute the number of losses for each player, multiply by the number of full cycles, then compute the remaining rounds (up to L-1) and add those.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Find the LCM of m and k. Let's call it L.\n\n- For each of the first L rounds, determine for each round whether Nikephoros wins, loses, or draw. Then sum up the total for each player in this L-length period.\n\n- Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // L.\n\n- The remaining rounds are rem = n % L.\n\n- So the total losses for Nikephoros is (total_cycles * loss_n_in_L) + loss_n_in_rem.\n\nSame for Polycarpus.\n\nBut how to compute the losses in L rounds? Well, for each of the L rounds, we can compute the moves for both players, check who wins, and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut L can be up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1e3 each). So for each L up to 1e6, processing each of the L rounds is O(L), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute for each round i from 0 to L-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\nCheck who wins. For each such pair, increment the counts for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nOnce we have the counts for one full L rounds, multiply by total_cycles.\n\nThen process the first rem rounds (from 0 to rem-1) and add their counts.\n\nSo the main challenge is to compute the LCM, and then process the rounds for the LCM period.\n\nNow, the next thing is to figure out for each pair of moves (a, b) who wins.\n\nLet me think about the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beat paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nIf same, draw.\n\nSo for a given a and b:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nElse:\n\nif a beats b: Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (since he lost).\n\nElse: Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), we can determine which one wins.\n\nSo for example, if a is R and b is S: Nikephoros wins. So Nikephoros's loss count increases by 0, Polycarpus's by 1.\n\nWait no: the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser. So Nikephoros's count (number of red spots) is incremented by 0, and Polycarpus's count is incremented by 1.\n\nWait the problem says:\n\nthe loser gets pinched. So for each round, if there's a winner, the loser gets a spot. So for each round, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus has a spot. If Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros has a spot. If draw, nothing.\n\nSo for each round, we can check if there is a winner, and then increment the respective counts.\n\nSo, for a given a and b, how to determine who wins?\n\nWe can write a helper function:\n\ndef get_winner(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 'draw'\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 'a_wins'\n\n    else:\n\n        return 'b_wins'\n\nSo for example, if a is R and b is S, a wins. So Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\nSo in code, for each pair (a, b), we can check and increment the counts.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM of m and k.\n\nCompute the total number of full cycles (total_cycles = n // L), and rem = n % L.\n\nFor the full cycles, compute how many times each player loses in one L-length cycle. Multiply by total_cycles.\n\nThen compute for the rem rounds, how many times each player loses in the first rem rounds. Add that.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nCompute the LCM.\n\nCompute the counts for one LCM cycle.\n\nMultiply by total_cycles.\n\nAdd the counts for the first rem rounds.\n\nNow, how to compute LCM?\n\nIn Python, we can compute GCD using math.gcd, but note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for Python 3.5+. Also, since m and k are positive integers, we can compute LCM as m * k // gcd(m, k).\n\nBut need to import math.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut for m and k, which are the lengths of A and B.\n\nOnce we have L = lcm(m, k), then for each i in 0..L-1:\n\nget a_i = A[i % m], b_i = B[i % k]\n\nthen check who wins, and count for each.\n\nOnce we have the counts for L rounds, then multiply by total_cycles.\n\nBut what if L is larger than n? Like, for example, when n is smaller than L. Then total_cycles is zero, and rem is n.\n\nSo the code needs to handle that.\n\nSo the code outline is:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nm = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute L = lcm(m, k).\n\nCompute total_cycles = n // L\n\nrem = n % L\n\nCompute for the full L rounds: count_n (number of times Nikephoros loses) and count_p (number of times Polycarpus loses).\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, compute count_rem_n and count_rem_p.\n\nTotal_n = total_cycles * count_n + count_rem_n\n\nTotal_p = total_cycles * count_p + count_rem_p\n\nOutput total_n and total_p.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing count_n and count_p for L rounds, and then for rem rounds.\n\nNow, how to compute count_n and count_p for L rounds?\n\nWell, for each i in 0 to L-1:\n\nget a = A[i % m], b = B[i % k]\n\ncheck who wins.\n\nIf a wins: then Polycarpus gets a spot (so count_p += 1)\n\nIf b wins: Nikephoros gets a spot (count_n +=1)\n\nElse: no change.\n\nSo for each i in 0 to L-1, we can loop and compute that.\n\nBut L can be up to 1e6 (since m and k are up to 1e3 each, their LCM is up to 1e6). So for 1e6 iterations, that's acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, for rem rounds, which can be up to L-1 (so up to 1e6 steps), which is manageable.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\" (m=3), B is \"RSPP\" (k=4). LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo for each of the 12 rounds, we compute the moves and counts.\n\nBut the sample has n=7 rounds. So total_cycles is 7//12=0, rem=7.\n\nSo we need to compute the counts for the first 7 rounds.\n\nLet's see:\n\nRound 0: i=0.\n\nA[0%3] = A[0] = R\n\nB[0%4] = B[0] = R → draw. No spots.\n\nRound 1: i=1.\n\nA[1%3] = A[1] = P\n\nB[1%4] = B[1] = S → P vs S. S beats P (since S beats P?), wait no:\n\nWait, according to the rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beat paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nSo for a = P (paper), b = S (scissors): S beats P. So B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. So count_n increases by 1.\n\nIn the sample explanation, the first round is R-R (draw). Then round 2 is P vs S (sample says Nikephoros loses, which would be count_n +=1. Wait the sample's explanation shows the first round is round 1? Or maybe the rounds are 0-based or 1-based? Let me check the sample explanation.\n\nIn the first sample input, the rounds are 7, and the explanation shows the rounds as:\n\nRound 1: R-R (draw)\n\nRound 2: P vs S (Nikephoros loses)\n\nRound 3: S vs P (Polycarpus loses)\n\nRound 4: R vs P (Nikephoros loses)\n\nRound 5: P vs R (Polycarpus loses)\n\nRound 6: S vs S (draw)\n\nRound 7: R vs P (Nikephoros loses)\n\nSo the total for Nikephoros is 3 losses (rounds 2,4,7), and Polycarpus has 2 (rounds 3,5).\n\nSo in the first sample, the code should compute for the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut according to our code, for rem=7, we loop i from 0 to 6 (since rem is 7, the first 7 rounds are i=0 to 6).\n\nSo let's check each of these:\n\ni ranges from 0 to 6 (7 rounds):\n\ni=0:\n\nA[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw. No change.\n\ni=1:\n\nA[1%3] = P, B[1%4] = S → S beats P → B wins. So Nikephoros (A) loses. count_n +=1.\n\ni=2:\n\nA[2%3] = S, B[2%4] = P → S beats P → A wins. So Polycarpus (B) loses. count_p +=1.\n\ni=3:\n\nA[3%3=0] = R, B[3%4=3] = P → P beats R → B wins. Nikephoros loses. count_n +=1.\n\ni=4:\n\nA[4%3=1] = P, B[4%4=0] = R → P beats R → A wins. B loses. count_p +=1.\n\ni=5:\n\nA[5%3=2] = S, B[5%4=1] = S → draw. No change.\n\ni=6:\n\nA[6%3=0] = R, B[6%4=2] = P → P beats R → B wins. Nikephoros loses. count_n +=1.\n\nSo total for the 7 rounds:\n\ncount_n is 3 (i=1, 3, 6). count_p is 2 (i=2,4). Which matches the sample output of 3 2.\n\nSo the code seems to work for that case.\n\nAnother sample is the second input:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). LCM(8,1)=8.\n\nn=5 rounds. So total_cycles = 5//8=0, rem=5.\n\nFor each of the first 5 rounds:\n\nA[i%8] is R for all i, and B[i%1] is R for all i. So all rounds are draws. So count_n and count_p are 0. Hence output 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut first, note that for very large n (like 2e9), but L is up to 1e6, then the code would process 1e6 steps for the LCM cycle, and then rem steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n from input. Then read A and B.\n\nBut the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nWait, in the example input given in the problem, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nBut perhaps that's a way to represent the input. So the actual input is:\n\nFirst line is n, then second line is A, third line is B.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nThen m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM.\n\nThen compute the counts for L rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the counts for L rounds?\n\nInitialize count_n_full = 0, count_p_full = 0.\n\nfor i in range(L):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    determine the winner.\n\n    if a wins: count_p_full +=1 (because B loses)\n\n    elif b wins: count_n_full +=1 (because A loses)\n\n    else: pass\n\nThen, for rem rounds:\n\ncount_rem_n = 0, count_rem_p = 0\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    same as above.\n\nBut for rem, it's possible that rem is 0, which means no steps.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nOnce we have L, total_cycles = n // L\n\nrem = n % L\n\nThen compute the full counts and rem counts.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut for very large L (like 1e6), looping through L steps is acceptable.\n\nBut for m and k up to 1e3, L can be up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the helper function for checking the winner.\n\nBut perhaps better to code directly in the loop.\n\nSo:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)  # no loss for either\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # a wins, so B loses (so Nikephoros's loss count is 0, Polycarpus's is +1?)\n\n        # Wait, Nikephoros is A. So if A wins, then B (Polycarpus) is the loser. So Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # B wins, so Nikephoros (A) is loser. His count increases by 1.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nWait, the function returns (n_loss, p_loss) for each round.\n\nSo for each round, we can add these numbers.\n\nSo for the code:\n\ncount_n_full = 0\n\ncount_p_full = 0\n\nfor i in range(L):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    dn, dp = get_result(a, b)\n\n    count_n_full += dn\n\n    count_p_full += dp\n\nSimilarly for the rem rounds.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, code steps.\n\nNow, in Python, for the LCM.\n\nBut for m and k, compute LCM.\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd returns the greatest common divisor. So:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut note that for Python versions, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since a and b are positive, no problem.\n\nSo, putting all together.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return (0, 1)  # A wins, B loses (so Polycarpus has a spot)\n\n    else:\n\n        return (1, 0)  # B wins, Nikephoros has a spot\n\nlcm_val = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n\n# compute counts for one LCM cycle\n\ncount_n_full = 0\n\ncount_p_full = 0\n\nfor i in range(lcm_val):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    dn, dp = get_result(a, b)\n\n    count_n_full += dn\n\n    count_p_full += dp\n\ntotal_cycles = n // lcm_val\n\nrem = n % lcm_val\n\n# compute counts for rem rounds\n\ncount_rem_n = 0\n\ncount_rem_p = 0\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    dn, dp = get_result(a, b)\n\n    count_rem_n += dn\n\n    count_rem_p += dp\n\ntotal_n = total_cycles * count_n_full + count_rem_n\n\ntotal_p = total_cycles * count_p_full + count_rem_p\n\nprint(total_n, total_p)\n\nWait, but what if lcm_val is zero? No, since m and k are at least 1.\n\nTesting with sample input 1:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=7, A=RPS (m=3), B=RSPP (k=4). LCM(3,4)=12.\n\ncount_n_full and count_p_full are computed for 12 rounds.\n\nBut in the sample, the first 7 rounds are processed in the rem part.\n\nBut in the code, for the sample, total_cycles is 7//12=0, so total_n is 0 * count_n_full + count_rem_n (which is 3). total_p is 0 * count_p_full + count_rem_p (2). Which gives 3 2. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input is 5, A is RRRRRRRR (length 8), B is R (length 1). LCM(8,1)=8. rem is 5. For each of the 5 rounds, the moves are R vs R. So all are draws. So count_rem_n and count_rem_p are zero. So output is 0 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when n is exactly equal to LCM. For example, n=12. Then rem is zero, and the counts are total_cycles=1, so total_n = count_n_full * 1, etc.\n\nBut what if the LCM is larger than n? Like n=5, LCM is 12. Then rem is 5.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when m or k is zero? No, the constraints say 1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000. So no problem.\n\nBut what about the case where m or k is 1?\n\nYes, code handles that.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\nCase where all rounds are draws. Then output is 0 0.\n\nCase where one sequence is longer than the other.\n\nAnother case: n is 0? But according to the problem statement, n ≥ 1.\n\nSo code is okay.\n\nNow, what about performance?\n\nFor m and k up to 1e3, LCM is up to 1e6. So for each LCM, the code runs 1e6 steps. For each of the rem steps, up to 1e6 steps. So total steps are O(2e6) which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, the code is O(1e6) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the code with the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThe code computes:\n\nm=3, k=4. LCM is 12.\n\nThen for the 12 rounds:\n\nLet's compute count_n_full and count_p_full.\n\nBut for the code, during the 12 rounds, each round's moves:\n\nLet me compute them.\n\nFor i from 0 to 11:\n\ni | A[i%3] | B[i%4] | result\n\n0: A[0] = R, B[0] = R → draw → (0,0)\n\n1: A[1] = P, B[1] = S → A wins (P beats S?), wait:\n\nWait the code says:\n\nif (a == R and b == S) or (a == S and b == P) or (a == P and b == R) → a wins.\n\nSo for a=P, b=S: check if (P and S). The condition is (a == P and b == R)? No. So for a=P and b=S, the condition is not met. So the else clause: B wins.\n\nWait, what is the code's logic here?\n\nFor a = P, b = S:\n\na is P, b is S. So the code checks if (a == R and b == S) → no. Or (a == S and b == P) → no. Or (a == P and b == R) → no. So the condition is false. So else clause: returns (1, 0). So B wins. Which would mean that Nikephoros (A) loses. So in the first sample, for i=1, the code returns (1,0) ?\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, in the second round (i=1?), Nikephoros loses. Which would be count_n increases by 1. Which is what the code does here.\n\nWait, but in the sample explanation, for the second round (i=1?), the code's result is (1,0) → Nikephoros's count increases by 1. So that's correct.\n\nBut let me re-examine the code's get_result function.\n\nIn the code, get_result(a, b) returns (dn, dp) where dn is the number of times Nikephoros (A) loses, and dp is the number of times Polycarpus (B) loses.\n\nSo when a wins, B loses → dp increases by 1.\n\nWhen b wins, A loses → dn increases by 1.\n\nSo for a = P, b = S:\n\na is P, b is S. What's the outcome?\n\nAccording to the rules: scissors beats paper. So S beats P. So B's move (S) beats A's move (P). So B wins. Thus, Nikephoros (A) loses → dn increases by 1. So the code returns (1, 0). Which is correct.\n\nBut according to the code's condition, the code returns (0,1) only when a wins. Else returns (1,0).\n\nSo in this case, the code returns (1,0) which is correct.\n\nSo for i=1, the code adds dn=1 to count_n_full, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother example: when a is S and b is P. Then a wins (S beats P). So B loses → dp increases by 1. So code returns (0,1).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of each round is infeasible due to the potentially large number of rounds, so we use an optimized approach based on the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their strategies.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. We need to determine the number of times each player loses over `n` rounds.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: Since both players use cyclic sequences, their move patterns will repeat every LCM of the lengths of their sequences. This allows us to compute the results for one full cycle and then extrapolate this result for the total number of cycles within `n` rounds.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By calculating the results for one LCM cycle, we can multiply these results by the number of full cycles in `n` rounds and add the results from the remaining rounds after the full cycles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def get_result(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return (0, 0)\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            return (0, 1)  # A wins, B loses\n        else:\n            return (1, 0)  # B wins, A loses\n    \n    lcm_val = (m * k) // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    count_n_full = 0\n    count_p_full = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm_val):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        dn, dp = get_result(a, b)\n        count_n_full += dn\n        count_p_full += dp\n    \n    total_cycles = n // lcm_val\n    rem = n % lcm_val\n    \n    count_rem_n = 0\n    count_rem_p = 0\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        dn, dp = get_result(a, b)\n        count_rem_n += dn\n        count_rem_p += dp\n    \n    total_n = total_cycles * count_n_full + count_rem_n\n    total_p = total_cycles * count_p_full + count_rem_p\n    \n    print(total_n, total_p)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values for the number of rounds and the sequences of moves for both players are read.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is computed to determine the cycle length after which both sequences repeat their moves.\n3. **Cycle Analysis**: For each round in the LCM cycle, the moves of both players are determined, and the results (losses) are counted.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder Handling**: The total number of full cycles within `n` rounds is calculated, and the results from these cycles are multiplied by the number of full cycles. The remaining rounds after the full cycles are processed separately.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The total losses for each player are computed by combining the results from the full cycles and the remaining rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the players' strategies, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
