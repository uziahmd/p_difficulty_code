Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. So, the key here is to check for each possible perfect matching whether all the line segments between matched pairs are non-intersecting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. Since R and B are up to 10, the total number of possible perfect matchings is manageable. For example, when R=B=10, the number of permutations is 10! which is around 3.6 million. Wait, but 10! is 3,628,800. For each permutation, we need to check if all the line segments between the matched pairs don't intersect. But since 10! is manageable for small values, maybe this approach is feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all possible perfect matchings between the R spaceships and B bases. Since R must equal B for a perfect matching, the first check is if R != B, then output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nWait, the input says R and B can be up to 10. But the problem says that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base. So the first thing is that R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible. So in the code, first check if R != B. If so, output No.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is given with R and B. So for example, in the sample input, the first case is 3 3, which is okay. The second case is 2 1, so output is No.\n\nSo that's the first check. Then, if R equals B, generate all possible permutations of the bases (or spaceships) and check for each permutation if all the line segments between the i-th spaceship and the i-th base in the permutation do not intersect.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments intersect? Well, since the problem states that no three points are colinear, that might simplify things. Because if two line segments cross each other, they must form a proper intersection (not just touching at endpoints).\n\nSo for each permutation, we need to check all pairs of line segments (from the matched pairs) to see if any two intersect.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect?\n\nI remember that there's a computational geometry method to check this. The standard approach is to use the orientation method. The steps are:\n\n- Check if the two line segments AB and CD intersect by checking if the orientations of (A, B, C), (A, B, D), (C, D, A), (C, D, B) are such that one is clockwise and the other is counter-clockwise, and also ensuring that the points are not colinear (which is already handled by the problem's condition that no three points are colinear).\n\nAlternatively, there's a function that can determine if two line segments AB and CD intersect. Let me think about implementing that.\n\nSo, first, we need to compute the orientation of three points. The orientation can be determined by the cross product. For three points p, q, r:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1])*(r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # colinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2  # clockwise or counter-clockwise\n\nBut the problem says that no three points are colinear, so in our case, the orientation will never be zero. So for any two line segments, their endpoints are not colinear.\n\nThen, the function to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect:\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n\n    # General case: if the points are on opposite sides of each other\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases where a point lies on the other segment\n    # But since the problem says no three points are colinear, this can't happen. Because if a point lies on the segment, then the orientation would be zero. So maybe we don't need to handle these cases.\n\n    # However, the problem says that no three points are colinear, so the only way two segments can intersect is if they cross each other, which is the general case. Therefore, the above condition is sufficient.\n\nWait, but what if the segments are overlapping? But since no three points are colinear, the only way two segments could overlap is if they share an endpoint. But since the problem says that no two points coincide, the endpoints are distinct. So, the segments can't overlap except at endpoints. But the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching, so each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base. So, in the matching, each line segment is from a spaceship to a base. So, if two segments share an endpoint, that would imply that two different bases are assigned to the same spaceship, which can't happen. So, in the generated permutations, each segment is between a unique spaceship and a unique base. Therefore, no two segments share an endpoint. So, the only way two segments can intersect is if they cross each other, which is the general case.\n\nTherefore, the segments_intersect function can be implemented as checking whether the orientations are different for both pairs.\n\nBut wait, perhaps the code should also check if the endpoints are colinear. But according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear. So, for example, if two line segments are AB and CD, then if A, B, C are colinear, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, that can't happen. So the code can safely assume that the four points are in general position, and that the only way two segments can intersect is if they cross each other.\n\nSo, the function segments_intersect returns True if the two line segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nNow, for each permutation of the bases (assuming that the spaceships are ordered in some way), we need to check all pairs of line segments in the permutation. For example, if we have a permutation that assigns spaceship 1 to base 1, spaceship 2 to base 2, etc., then we need to check for all pairs (i, j) where i < j, whether the line segment between spaceship i and base i intersects with the line segment between spaceship j and base j.\n\nIf any pair of segments in the permutation intersect, then this permutation is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid, and we can return \"Yes\".\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\nCheck if R != B. If so, output No.\n\nElse:\n\nGenerate all permutations of the B bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of bases to spaceships). For each permutation, check if all pairs of segments between spaceship i and base permutation[i] do not intersect. If any permutation passes, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nBut how to represent the spaceships and bases? Let's say that the spaceships are stored in a list called rebels, and the bases in a list called bases. For a permutation p (which is a list of indices of the bases), then for each i, the spaceship i is connected to the base p[i].\n\nWait, but in Python, the permutations would be generated for the list of bases. For example, if the bases are stored as a list, then each permutation is a reordering of the bases. So for each permutation, the i-th spaceship is connected to the i-th base in the permutation.\n\nBut since the order of the spaceships is fixed (assuming that the first spaceship is connected to the first base in the permutation, etc.), then for each permutation, we can check all pairs of line segments.\n\nBut generating all permutations of the bases is O(B!) time. For B=10, that's 3.6 million permutations. For each permutation, checking all pairs of line segments. How many pairs? For B=10, it's (B choose 2) = 45 pairs. For each pair, checking if the segments intersect.\n\nSo total operations for B=10 is 3.6e6 * 45 = 1.6e8 operations. That's acceptable for Python, considering that each operation is simple.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. However, given the constraints, this approach is feasible.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\nElse, read R points for rebels, then B points for bases.\n\nThen generate all permutations of the B bases. For each permutation, check if all pairs of line segments between the i-th rebel and the i-th base in the permutation are non-intersecting.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies this, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nBut how to generate permutations of the bases. For example, in Python, itertools.permutations can generate all possible orderings of the bases. Each permutation is a tuple of the base points.\n\nBut the problem is that the bases are given as a list. So, for example, if bases is a list of coordinates, then itertools.permutations(bases) would generate all possible orderings.\n\nBut wait, the bases are given as a list of B elements. So, for each permutation, we can take the permutation as the list of bases in the order that they are assigned to the rebels.\n\nSo for each permutation, we have to check all pairs of segments (i, j) where i < j, and check if the segment between rebels[i] and perm[i] intersects with the segment between rebels[j] and perm[j].\n\nSo, the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # returns 1 if clockwise, 2 if counter-clockwise\n    val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1])*(r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    # check if segment ab intersects with segment cd\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    # General case\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx +=1\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        rebels.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    # Now generate all permutations of bases\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        # Check all pairs of segments\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # check if segment rebels[i] - perm[i] intersects with rebels[j] - perm[j]\n                a = rebels[i]\n                b = perm[i]\n                c = rebels[j]\n                d = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut wait, in the code above, the permutations are generated for the bases. However, the problem says that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base. So, for the permutation, each base is used exactly once. So, the permutations are correct.\n\nBut for example, if the bases are [b1, b2, b3], then each permutation is a rearrangement of these bases, and each permutation represents a possible assignment of bases to the rebels. So for the i-th rebel, we assign perm[i].\n\nBut in the code, the 'perm' is a permutation of the bases. So, for each perm, the code checks all pairs of line segments between the i-th rebel and perm[i], and j-th rebel and perm[j].\n\nBut wait, the code uses 'R' as the loop variable. Since R = B, and the code is in the case where R = B.\n\nSo, that's correct.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nRebels are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nBases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nThe first permutation is the original order. So, the assignment is:\n\nRebel 0 -> (-2,1)\n\nRebel 1 -> (0,3)\n\nRebel 2 -> (2,2)\n\nCheck if any of the pairs of segments intersect.\n\nCheck between rebel 0 and base 0, and rebel 1 and base 1.\n\nSegments (0,0)-(-2,1) and (2,0)-(0,3). Do they intersect?\n\nLet me calculate the orientations.\n\nFor segment AB (A=(0,0), B=(-2,1)), and segment CD (C=(2,0), D=(0,3)).\n\nCheck orientation of AB with C and D.\n\nOrientation of A, B, C: (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x)\n\nB.x - A.x is -2 - 0 = -2. C.y - A.y is 0 - 0 = 0. So first part is -2*0 = 0.\n\nB.y - A.y is 1-0=1. C.x - A.x is 2 - 0 = 2. So the second part is 1 * 2 = 2. So overall value is 0 - 2 = -2. Which is negative. So orientation is 2 (counter-clockwise? Or depends on sign.)\n\nWait the function returns 1 if val>0, else 2. So for val=-2, returns 2.\n\nThen orientation of A,B,D (D is (0,3)):\n\nSame calculation. Let's compute:\n\nval = (B.x - A.x)*(D.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(D.x - A.x)\n\nB.x - A.x = -2, D.y - A.y = 3-0=3. So first term is -2 * 3 = -6.\n\nB.y - A.y is 1, D.x - A.x is 0 - 0 = 0. So second term is 1 * 0 = 0. Val is -6 - 0 = -6. So orientation is 2 again.\n\nSo o1 and o2 are same. So the first condition (o1 != o2) is false. So the segments AB and CD do not intersect.\n\nThen check for other pairs. For example, between AB and the third segment (rebel 2 and base 2: (3,1) to (2,2)).\n\nBut perhaps in the sample input, the first permutation is valid. So the code would find that and return Yes.\n\nAnother example is the second input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. So output is No, because R != B. So the code correctly outputs No.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the second input is:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWhich is R=2, B=1. So the code checks R != B and outputs No.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut what about when R=B=2, but there's no valid permutation.\n\nFor example, if the rebels are at (0,0) and (2,2), and the bases are at (0,2) and (2,0). Then, the two permutations are:\n\nperm1: [(0,2), (2,0)] → connect (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0). These two segments are vertical lines, which don't cross.\n\nWait, but the segments are (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0). These are parallel lines, so no intersection. So this is valid. So output Yes.\n\nAnother case where the two permutations are:\n\nperm2: [(2,0), (0,2)]. Then the segments are (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). These are horizontal lines, which don't cross. Also valid. So output is Yes.\n\nBut if the bases are arranged such that in any permutation, the two segments cross. For example, rebels at (0,0) and (2,2), bases at (1,1) and (1,2). Then, any permutation would have one segment from (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,2) to (1,2). These two segments would cross?\n\nWait, the first segment is from (0,0) to (1,1), the second from (2,2) to (1,2). Do they cross?\n\nThe first segment is along y=x. The second segment is from (2,2) to (1,2), which is a horizontal line. They meet at (1,1) and (1,2) — no, the first segment ends at (1,1), and the second is from (2,2) to (1,2). The line segments are (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,2)-(1,2). Do they cross?\n\nThe first line is from (0,0) to (1,1). The second line is from (2,2) to (1,2). The two lines are not crossing. Because the first line is going up diagonally, and the second is going left horizontally. The only possible intersection is if the lines cross. But the lines would cross if they are not parallel. Let's compute the equations.\n\nFirst line: y = x.\n\nSecond line: y = 2 (since it's from (2,2) to (1,2)), so y=2. The intersection is at x=2, but the first line's x ranges from 0 to 1. So no intersection. So the segments do not cross. So in this case, the code would return Yes.\n\nBut suppose the bases are arranged such that in any permutation, the two segments cross. How?\n\nFor example, rebels at (0,0) and (2,0), and bases at (1,1) and (1,-1). Then, any permutation would have:\n\nEither:\n\n(0,0)-(1,1) and (2,0)-(1,-1). Do these cross?\n\nLet me check. The first segment is from (0,0) to (1,1), the second from (2,0) to (1,-1). The lines would cross. Let's compute the orientations.\n\nFor the two segments AB (A=(0,0), B=(1,1)) and CD (C=(2,0), D=(1,-1)).\n\nCheck orientations:\n\norientation(A, B, C) → (B.x - A.x)*(C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(C.x - A.x) = (1)*(0) - (1)*(2) = -2 → val is -2 → orientation 2.\n\norientation(A, B, D) → (B.x - A.x)*(D.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y)*(D.x - A.x) = (1)*(-1 - 0) - (1)*(1 - 0) = 1*(-1) - 1*(1) = -1 -1 = -2 → orientation 2. So o1 and o2 are same. So the segments don't cross.\n\nWait, but the two segments are AB and CD. Are they crossing?\n\nAB is from (0,0) to (1,1). CD is from (2,0) to (1,-1). Let me draw them. AB is going up to the right. CD is going down to the left. They might cross somewhere.\n\nBut according to the segments_intersect function, since o1 and o2 are same (both 2), then the function returns False. So the code would think that they don't cross. But maybe they do?\n\nWait, the function returns True only if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4). So in this case, o1 and o2 are same. So the function returns False. So the code would consider that the segments do not intersect. But perhaps they do?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the function. Let me think again.\n\nThe segments_intersect function returns True only if the two segments cross each other. The code checks if the orientations are different for both segments. But perhaps I need to check for the special cases where one of the endpoints lies on the other segment. But according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear. So that can't happen. So the code is correct.\n\nBut in this example, the two segments AB and CD may cross. Let me compute the actual lines.\n\nLine AB: parametric equations x = t, y = t, t in [0, 1].\n\nLine CD: parametric equations x = 2 - t, y = 0 - t, t in [0, 1].\n\nFind if there's a solution where t and s are in [0,1] such that:\n\nt = 2 - s\n\nt = -s\n\nFrom the second equation, t = -s. Substitute into first equation:\n\n-s = 2 - s → 0 = 2? No. So no solution. Therefore, the segments do not intersect. So the code is correct.\n\nSo, the function works correctly.\n\nAnother example: two segments that cross. Let's say AB is from (0,0) to (2,2), CD is from (0,2) to (2,0). These cross at (1,1). Let's check the function.\n\nFor AB and CD:\n\nCheck orientation of A, B, C (C is (0,2)):\n\nval = (2-0)*(2-0) - (2-0)*(0-0) → 2*2 - 2*0 =4 → positive → orientation 1.\n\nOrientation of A, B, D (D is (2,0)): val = (2-0)*(0-0) - (2-0)*(2-0) → 2*0 - 2*2 = -4 → orientation 2.\n\nSo o1 != o2. Then check orientation of C, D, A: (D.x - C.x)*(A.y - C.y) - (D.y - C.y)*(A.x - C.x). \n\nD.x - C.x = 2-0 = 2. A.y - C.y = 0 - 2 = -2. So first term is 2*(-2) = -4. D.y - C.y = 0-2 = -2. A.x - C.x = 0-0=0. So second term is (-2)*0=0. Val is -4 - 0 = -4 → orientation 2.\n\nOrientation of C, D, B: B is (2,2). \n\nC, D, B: D.x - C.x is 2, B.y - C.y is 2-2=0. So first term 2 * 0 = 0. D.y - C.y is -2. B.x - C.x is 2-0=2. So second term is -2 * 2 = -4. Val is 0 - (-4) = 4 → positive. So orientation 1.\n\nThus, o3 and o4 are different. So the function returns True. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, considering that for each permutation, the code checks all pairs of segments. But for the code to work, the permutations must be generated correctly.\n\nBut in Python, permutations(bases) will generate all possible orderings of the bases. However, in the case where there are duplicate points, but the problem says that no two points coincide. So the bases are all unique, and the code is okay.\n\nNow, testing the first sample input. The code would generate all permutations of the three bases. One of them is the original order, which is valid. So the code returns Yes.\n\nAnother case: if there are two permutations, but one is invalid and another is valid.\n\nBut the code checks all permutations and returns as soon as one is found.\n\nNow, the code is written. But in the code, the 'segments_intersect' function is called for each pair of segments. However, the code may have a mistake in the parameters. For example, in the code, the function is called with a, b, c, d, which represents segments AB and CD. But in the code, the segments are between a and b, and between c and d.\n\nYes. So, in the code, for the i-th and j-th pairs, the code checks the segment between rebels[i] and perm[i], and between rebels[j] and perm[j].\n\nSo, the parameters to the function are:\n\na = rebels[i], b = perm[i]\n\nc = rebels[j], d = perm[j]\n\nThus, the segments are a-b and c-d. Which is correct.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nAnother edge case: R = B = 1. Then, there's only one possible permutation, and no segments to check. So output is Yes.\n\nAnother case: R = B = 2. Two rebels and two bases. If the two segments cross, then no valid permutation. But if there's a permutation where they don't cross, then output is Yes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code uses permutations from itertools.permutations. However, for B=10, this is 10! = 3,628,800 permutations. For each permutation, checking 45 pairs. Each pair requires 4 orientation checks and some conditionals. But Python can handle that.\n\nBut in practice, for B=10, this may be slow. However, given the constraints (R and B up to 10), it's acceptable.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign Rebel spaceships to bases such that each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base and no two connecting paths (line segments) intersect. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Equal Numbers**: First, check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B).

This is done using a geometric approach involving orientation checks to determine if line segments intersect.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n    o1 = orientation(a, b, c)\n    o2 = orientation(a, b, d)\n    o3 = orientation(c, d, a)\n    o4 = orientation(c, d, b)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                a = rebels[i]\n                b = perm[i]\n                c = rebels[j]\n                d = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a, b, c, d):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Orientation Check**: The `orientation` function calculates the orientation of three points using the cross product. This helps determine if points are clockwise, counter-clockwise, or collinear.\n2. **Segment Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses the orientation results to determine if two line segments intersect by checking if their endpoints straddle each other.\n3. **Permutation Generation**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible assignments of bases to spaceships are generated. For each permutation, every pair of line segments is checked for intersections.\n4. **Validation**: If any permutation is found where no segments intersect, the answer is \"Yes\". If none are found after checking all permutations, the answer is \"No\".\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible assignments are checked efficiently given the constraints, leveraging permutation generation and geometric checks to determine valid configurations.",
