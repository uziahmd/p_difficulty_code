    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum value of a function f(x) where x ranges from 0 to m, inclusive. The function f(x) is calculated by summing the array elements a_i for each bit set in x's binary representation. So, for example, if x has the i-th bit set, we add a_i to the sum.\n\nThe challenge here is to find the maximum possible sum given the constraints of x not exceeding m. Let's think about how to approach this efficiently, especially considering that n can be up to 1e5, which suggests that brute-force methods (like checking all x up to m) are impossible because m can be as large as 2^1e5, which is way beyond any computational feasibility.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to do is figure out an efficient way to compute the maximum sum without iterating through every possible x up to m.\n\nLet me think about the properties of the function f(x). Each bit in x contributes a certain value (a_i) if it's set. Therefore, the maximum sum would be achieved by selecting as many high-value a_i's as possible, but under the constraint that the binary representation of x doesn't exceed m.\n\nBut how do I model that? It seems like a problem where we need to select a subset of bits (positions) such that their combination forms a number ≤ m, and the sum of their corresponding a_i's is maximized.\n\nThis feels similar to a knapsack problem, but with the twist that the items are bits, and each item can be chosen or not, but the selection must form a valid number (i.e., the binary representation of the selected bits must be ≤ m).\n\nBut even that approach might not be feasible for n up to 1e5. Wait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think about the bits of m and how to greedily select the bits.\n\nLet me consider the binary representation of m. For each bit position, we can decide whether to include it in the x, but ensuring that the resulting x is ≤ m. However, including a bit higher than some position might affect lower bits.\n\nFor example, suppose m is 1010 (binary). If I want to set the third bit (value 8), that's allowed. But if I set the third bit and then set the second bit (4), that would make 12, which is larger than 10 (which is m=10). So, perhaps the approach is to process the bits from the highest to the lowest, and at each step decide whether to take the bit or not, based on whether taking it would allow the rest of the bits to be set optimally.\n\nWait, but how do we handle that? This sounds like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach combined with some backtracking. However, for large n, even that might be challenging.\n\nAlternatively, since the function f(x) is simply the sum of the a_i's for the bits set in x, the maximum possible sum is the sum of all a_i's where the corresponding bit is set in some x ≤ m. But how to select which bits to set?\n\nLet me think: the optimal x is the one that includes as many high-value a_i's as possible, but without making the binary number exceed m.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to sort the bits in order of their a_i values, and try to include them, but ensuring that the resulting x is ≤ m. However, this isn't straightforward because including a certain bit may require other bits to be set or not, depending on the binary representation of m.\n\nAnother angle: the maximum sum is the sum of all a_i where the bit i is set in x, and x is <= m. So, the problem reduces to choosing a subset of bits (each bit can be 0 or 1) such that the binary number formed is <= m, and the sum of a_i's for those bits is maximized.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be approached using dynamic programming. However, given that n can be up to 1e5, even O(n) algorithms are acceptable, but anything more than that would be problematic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of the bits in the binary representation of m and try to construct the optimal x bit by bit.\n\nLet me think about the binary digits of m. Let's say m is represented as b_0 b_1 ... b_{n-1}, where b_0 is the least significant bit. Wait, no. Wait, the input gives s as the binary representation of m. For example, in the first sample input, the binary is \"10\", which is 2, but the note says m is 20. Oh wait, no, in the first example, the input is '10' for the binary string. Wait, the problem says that m is equal to the binary number s.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum value of a function $ f(x) $ for all integers $ x $ in the range $ 0 \\leq x \\leq m $, where $ f(x) $ is calculated by summing the elements of an array corresponding to the bits set in the binary representation of $ x $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Function**: The function $ f(x) $ sums the elements of the array at indices corresponding to the positions of set bits in the binary representation of $ x $. For example, if $ x $ has the 0th bit set, we include $ a_0 $ in the sum.\n2. **Binary Representation of m**: The input provides the binary representation of $ m $, which we convert to an integer.\n3. **Greedy Strategy with Bit Manipulation**: We use a greedy approach to maximize the sum by considering each bit from the most significant to the least significant. For each bit position, we check if setting that bit (and possibly others) results in a valid number (≤ m) and whether it contributes to a higher sum.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    s = input[idx]\n    \n    # Convert binary string s to integer m\n    m = int(s, 2)\n    \n    # Sort the array with their indices, but we need to consider the bits in order\n    # However, since we need to process from highest bit to lowest, we can precompute the bits\n    # Let's find the positions where a_i is positive and sort them in descending order of their bit positions\n    # Because including higher bits (with higher values) is better if possible\n    \n    # Precompute the bits of m\n    bits = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        bits.append((i, (m >> i) & 1))\n    \n    # Create a list of a_i and their bit positions, sorted by bit position descending\n    # We want to try to set the bits with higher a_i first, but need to ensure that the number doesn't exceed m\n    # But how?
