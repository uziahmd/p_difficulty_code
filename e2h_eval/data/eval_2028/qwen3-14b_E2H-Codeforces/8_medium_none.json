Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the flow is a valid maximum flow. The conditions are that for each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the incoming flow equals outgoing flow. Also, the source has no incoming edges, the directed graph must be acyclic, and the flow is maximum.\n\nWait, but how do we approach this? Let me think. Since the flow values are already given for each edge, our job is to assign directions so that the flow conservation holds and the graph is acyclic.\n\nFirst, the flow conservation for vertices except source and sink. For each such vertex v, the sum of flows on incoming edges must equal the sum on outgoing edges. So for each edge, the direction determines whether it contributes to the inflow or outflow of its endpoints.\n\nBut how do we find such directions? Also, the directed graph must be acyclic. Oh right, because if there's a cycle, then maybe the flow can't be properly conserved. But the problem says that the solution exists, so we need to find a way to direct the edges correctly.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Since the graph is connected and we need to assign directions such that there are no cycles, perhaps we can model this as a DAG. Also, the source (vertex 1) must have all edges directed away from it, since it can't have incoming edges. Similarly, the sink (vertex n) must have all edges directed towards it?\n\nWait, not necessarily. Because the sink can have outgoing edges, but in a maximum flow scenario, the sink's outgoing edges would have zero flow. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the flow is maximum. So the sink's outflow should be zero, but the problem says that for the sink, the flow conservation isn't required. Wait, the problem says that for vertices 1 < v < n, the inflow equals outflow. So for the sink (n), there's no such condition. So, for the sink, the inflow can be more than the outflow. But since it's a maximum flow, the sink's inflow is the total flow value.\n\nBut how does that help us? Maybe we need to model the flow as a directed acyclic graph where the source is the only one with no incoming edges, and the sink is the only one with no outgoing edges (or something like that). But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the vertices in a topological order. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from the earlier vertex in the topological order to the later one. However, how to ensure that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nAlternatively, think of the flow as a DAG where each edge's direction contributes to the flow balance. For each vertex except source and sink, the sum of the flows on edges leaving it must equal the sum of flows entering it. So, for each vertex v (not source or sink), the net flow (outflow minus inflow) must be zero.\n\nBut how to model this. Let me think about the flow conservation. For each vertex v (excluding 1 and n), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. Which implies that the total flow leaving v is equal to the total flow entering it.\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where we have to assign directions to edges so that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on outgoing edges equals the sum on incoming edges. But how?\n\nWait, maybe we can model this as a directed graph where the flow is a circulation except for the source and sink. But since the flow is maximum, perhaps the flow is such that the source's outflow equals the sink's inflow, and all other nodes have zero net flow.\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges to satisfy this. Let me think about the problem in terms of building a directed acyclic graph with these properties.\n\nAnother thought: since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the vertices in a topological order. Let's say the topological order starts with the source (vertex 1) and ends with the sink (vertex n). Then, all edges go from earlier vertices to later ones. This way, the graph is acyclic.\n\nIf we can arrange the directions in such a way that the flow conservation holds for each node except source and sink, then this would solve the problem.\n\nBut how to determine the topological order and assign directions accordingly. Let's think about the flow conservation.\n\nFor each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges going into v must equal the sum of flows going out of v. Let's consider that in the directed graph, each edge is directed from u to v, where u comes before v in the topological order.\n\nSo, for each node v (excluding source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v (from predecessors) must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v (to successors).\n\nBut how to compute this. It feels like a problem where we can model this with some kind of flow constraints and build the directions accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed tree. Wait, but the graph may not be a tree. However, since the graph is connected and we need to assign directions without cycles, perhaps we can construct a DAG where each node (except the source) has a path from the source. But again, not sure.\n\nWait, here's another idea: The flow conservation equations for the intermediate nodes can be viewed as a system of equations. For each such node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it must equal the sum of flows directed towards it. But since the flow is given for each edge, the direction determines which side of the equation they contribute to.\n\nBut solving this system directly might be difficult. However, since the problem states that a solution exists, perhaps we can find a way to assign directions based on some traversal of the graph.\n\nLet me think of the graph as a flow network. Since the flow values are given, perhaps the direction of each edge depends on the direction of flow in the maximum flow. But since the original graph is undirected, how to determine the direction?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the flow is a maximum flow. So the flow values are fixed, and we need to assign directions such that the flow is valid. So the flow is already determined, and the directions need to be chosen to fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow conservation holds. For the intermediate nodes, the sum of flows on edges leaving the node must equal the sum on edges entering. So, for each node v (not source or sink), the net flow (sum of outgoing flows minus incoming flows) must be zero.\n\nBut how to assign directions. Let's think of this as a problem where each edge's direction contributes to the net flow of its endpoints.\n\nFor example, if an edge between u and v is directed from u to v, then for u, this contributes +c (outgoing) and for v, +c (incoming). But since for each node except source and sink, the net flow (outgoing - incoming) must be zero, we can model this as a system where for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of c_i for edges directed away from v equals the sum of c_i for edges directed towards v.\n\nBut how to assign directions to satisfy this.\n\nLet me think about the net flow for each node. For the source, the net flow is the total flow (since it's the source, all outgoing edges contribute to the net flow). For the sink, the net flow is negative of the total flow. For other nodes, net flow is zero.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's consider that for each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. So, for each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges incident to v, multiplied by their direction (either +1 or -1) must be zero.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each edge, the direction choice affects the net flow of its two endpoints. Let's model this as a problem where we need to assign a direction to each edge such that the net flow for each intermediate node is zero.\n\nBut how to find such assignments. This seems like a problem that could be modeled as a graph with certain constraints. However, solving this directly for large graphs (up to 2e5 nodes and edges) would be computationally expensive unless there's a clever approach.\n\nAnother idea: since the graph is connected and the solution exists, perhaps we can construct a directed acyclic graph by building a spanning tree and directing the edges in a certain way. For example, build a tree rooted at the source, and direct all edges away from the root. Then, for the non-tree edges, direct them in a way that maintains the acyclic property and satisfies the flow conservation.\n\nBut how would that work? Let's think. Suppose we have a spanning tree rooted at the source. For each node in the tree, we can direct the tree edges from parent to child. Then, for non-tree edges, we can direct them from the node with lower depth to higher depth, or something like that. But how to ensure flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the flow is a valid flow. The flow conservation for each node (except source and sink) is that the inflow equals outflow. So, for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed into v equals the sum of flows directed out of v. So, for each node v, the sum of flows on edges incident to v (with direction considered) is zero. Except for the source and sink.\n\nBut how to assign directions. Let's imagine that for each node, the sum of flows on edges that are directed away from it must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards it. This is equivalent to the sum over all edges incident to v of (direction * c_i) being zero, where direction is +1 if the edge is directed away from v, and -1 if directed towards v. But since each edge is between two nodes, the direction for one node determines the direction for the other. For example, if an edge between u and v is directed from u to v, then for u, the contribution is +c, and for v, it's -c.\n\nSo, for each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of all contributions from edges incident to it must be zero. That's the same as saying that the net outflow is zero.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to assigning directions to edges such that for each node v (other than 1 and n), the net outflow is zero. How can this be achieved?\n\nThis seems like a system of equations. Let me think of variables for each edge, which can be either +1 (directed from ai to bi) or -1 (directed from bi to ai). Then, for each node v, the sum over all edges incident to v of (direction * c_i) must be zero. However, solving this system for large m and n is computationally challenging.\n\nBut given that the problem states that a solution exists, perhaps there's a way to model this as a graph and find a solution using some traversal.\n\nLet me think of this as a problem of finding an Eulerian orientation. Wait, in an Eulerian graph, each node has even degree. But here, the problem is different. However, the concept of orienting edges to satisfy flow conservation might be similar.\n\nWait, the flow conservation for each node (other than source and sink) requires that the sum of flows on edges directed away from the node equals the sum directed towards it. Which implies that the total flow through the node is zero. So for each such node, the sum of flows on all edges incident to it must be even? No, that's not necessarily true. Because the sum of flows on edges directed away from the node is equal to the sum directed towards it. So the total sum of flows on edges incident to the node is 2 * (sum of flows directed away from the node). Which must be even. Therefore, the sum of flows on edges incident to the node must be even. But the problem says that a solution exists, so this must hold.\n\nBut how do we know that? Well, the problem says that the input is such that a solution exists, so we don't have to check that.\n\nBut how to use this. Let's think of the problem as follows: For each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even. But that's already given.\n\nBut how to assign directions. Let me think of this as a problem of building a directed graph where for each node (except source and sink), the outflow equals inflow. Which is the same as the net outflow being zero. So, for each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on edges leaving v must equal the sum of flows on edges entering v.\n\nThis is similar to the concept of a flow network where the flow conservation holds. But how to assign directions.\n\nAnother idea: think of the entire graph as a flow network. The maximum flow from source to sink is already computed (the sum of flows on edges leaving the source, which is the same as the sum entering the sink). Now, the problem is to assign directions to the edges such that the flow is valid. So, perhaps the direction of each edge is determined by the direction of the flow in the maximum flow.\n\nBut how to find that direction without knowing the actual flow? Well, the problem gives us the flow values for each edge. So, perhaps the direction is determined by the flow's direction in the maximum flow. But how to reconstruct that.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the flow values are given. So, for each edge, the flow is ci. So, the maximum flow is the sum of flows leaving the source. The direction of the edge in the flow network would be from the source side to the sink side.\n\nBut how to find that. Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed from the source's side to the sink's side, and the flow is determined by the residual capacities. But without knowing the actual flow, how to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as finding an orientation of the edges such that the resulting directed graph is acyclic and satisfies the flow conservation. To ensure acyclicity, perhaps we can perform a topological sort. But how to find the topological order.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n- Construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with the source as the first node and the sink as the last node. Assign directions to edges such that all edges go from earlier nodes in the topological order to later ones. Then, for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed out of the node must equal the sum on edges directed into the node (for intermediate nodes).\n\nBut how to choose the topological order and assign directions accordingly.\n\nWait, suppose we can assign a potential to each node. Let's say, for each node v, we assign a value p(v) such that for any edge between u and v, the direction is from the node with lower potential to the node with higher potential. Then, the graph is acyclic. Now, the question is to assign potentials such that for each intermediate node, the sum of flows on edges going out equals the sum on edges coming in.\n\nLet me think of this. For each node v, the sum over all edges incident to v of (if u is the other end of the edge, then if p(v) > p(u), then the edge is directed from u to v, contributing to the inflow of v. Or wait, if p(u) < p(v), then the edge is directed from u to v. So, for node v, the sum of flows on edges directed into v is sum_{u where p(u) < p(v)} c_uv, and the sum of flows directed out of v is sum_{u where p(u) > p(v)} c_uv. For intermediate nodes, these two sums must be equal.\n\nBut how to find such potentials. Let's denote for each node v, the difference between the sum of flows on edges directed out of v and the sum directed into v. For intermediate nodes, this difference must be zero. For the source, the difference is the total flow (since all edges are directed out of it, assuming potentials are set so that source is the lowest). For the sink, the difference is negative of the total flow.\n\nSo, for each node v (excluding source and sink), we have:\n\nsum_{edges directed out} c - sum_{edges directed in} c = 0.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{edges directed out} c = sum_{edges directed in} c.\n\nBut since the edges are directed based on the potentials, for each edge between u and v, if p(u) < p(v), then the edge is directed from u to v. So, the sum directed out of v is the sum of c_uv for edges where p(v) > p(u), and the sum directed into v is the sum of c_uv for edges where p(u) > p(v).\n\nThus, for each intermediate node v, the sum over all edges incident to v of [if p(v) > p(u), then c_uv, else if p(v) < p(u), then -c_uv] must equal zero.\n\nBut how to find such potentials. This looks like a system of equations. However, solving this for large n and m is challenging.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where the potentials p(v) are such that for each node v, the sum of c_uv * (p(v) - p(u)) for all edges uv is zero. Wait, let's see:\n\nFor each edge uv, the direction is from u to v if p(u) < p(v), and from v to u otherwise. The contribution to the net outflow for node v would be:\n\nif p(v) > p(u): +c_uv (outflow)\nif p(v) < p(u): -c_uv (inflow)\nif p(v) = p(u): ??? Well, but since the potentials are integers, perhaps we can avoid that by ensuring that all potentials are unique.\n\nAssuming that p(v) are unique, for each edge uv, the direction is determined by the comparison of p(u) and p(v). Then, the net outflow for node v is sum_{edges} (if p(v) > p(u) then c_uv else -c_uv if p(v) < p(u) else 0).\n\nBut for intermediate nodes, this net outflow must be zero. So:\n\nsum_{edges incident to v} [c_uv * (sign(p(v) - p(u)))] = 0.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, if we think about the sum over all edges incident to v of c_uv * (p(v) - p(u)) = 0, then this would imply that the net outflow is zero. Because:\n\nEach term c_uv * (p(v) - p(u)) equals c_uv * (p(v) - p(u)).\n\nIf p(v) > p(u), then this term is positive. If p(v) < p(u), then it's negative. And for each edge, this term is exactly c_uv multiplied by the direction's contribution to the net outflow (since for direction u->v, the contribution to outflow is +c_uv, which is equivalent to p(v) - p(u) = positive. So the sum over all edges incident to v of c_uv*(p(v) - p(u)) = sum_{edges} (outflow - inflow) for v. Which for intermediate nodes must be zero. So:\n\nFor each intermediate node v, sum_{edges incident to v} c_uv (p(v) - p(u)) = 0.\n\nRearranging this:\n\nsum_{edges incident to v} c_uv * p(v) - sum_{edges incident to v} c_uv * p(u) = 0.\n\nWhich can be written as:\n\np(v) * (sum_{edges incident to v} c_uv) - sum_{edges incident to v} c_uv p(u) = 0.\n\nRearranged:\n\np(v) * (sum_{edges incident to v} c_uv) = sum_{edges incident to v} c_uv p(u).\n\nLet me denote S_v as the sum of c_uv for all edges incident to v. Then:\n\np(v) * S_v = sum_{u adjacent to v} c_uv * p(u).\n\nDividing both sides by S_v (assuming S_v is not zero, which it isn't since the graph is connected):\n\np(v) = [sum_{u adjacent to v} c_uv * p(u)] / S_v.\n\nThis looks like an equation that can be solved using some kind of iterative method. However, for a general graph, this might not be straightforward. But what if we model this as a system where the potentials are determined by the weighted average of their neighbors' potentials?\n\nThis suggests that the potentials p(v) are determined by a system of linear equations. However, solving this for large graphs may be computationally intensive. But given that the graph is connected and a solution exists, perhaps we can find a way to assign the potentials.\n\nAlternatively, think of the potentials as a function that satisfies for each node v:\n\np(v) = (sum_{u} c_uv * p(u)) / S_v.\n\nBut this seems like a system that can be solved with a linear equation. However, solving this system would require O(n^3) time, which is not feasible for n up to 2e5.\n\nHmm. So this approach may not be feasible. Need another idea.\n\nLet me think back to the problem's constraints. The directed graph must be acyclic. So, perhaps we can arrange the nodes in a certain order, and assign directions based on that order. For example, arrange the nodes in a topological order, and direct all edges from earlier nodes to later ones. Then, the graph is acyclic. Now, the question is how to choose the topological order such that the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nLet me consider the following approach:\n\nWe can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the source, and assign levels to each node. Then, direct the edges from lower levels to higher levels. But how to ensure flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where the edges are directed from the source towards the sink, and for each intermediate node, the inflow equals outflow. This resembles the concept of a flow decomposition into paths.\n\nIn a maximum flow, the flow can be decomposed into paths from source to sink. Each edge is part of some number of paths. The direction of the edge would be along the direction of the paths. But how to find such paths.\n\nBut since the flow values are given, perhaps the direction of the edge is determined by whether it's part of a path from source to sink. However, without knowing the actual paths, it's unclear.\n\nAnother idea: since the graph is connected and undirected, and we need to assign directions to make it a DAG, perhaps we can build a directed tree rooted at the source. For example, perform a BFS or DFS from the source, and direct all edges in the tree away from the source. Then, for non-tree edges, direct them from the node with lower depth to higher depth. This would ensure that the graph is acyclic. However, how to ensure flow conservation.\n\nBut how to handle the flow conservation. For example, suppose during BFS traversal, we assign directions to edges. For each node, the sum of flows on edges directed out of it must equal the sum directed into it. But this may not be possible unless the flow is specifically arranged.\n\nWait, but the flow is already given. So, for example, if a node v has a certain amount of flow entering it from the tree edges, then it must have the same amount exiting through other edges (tree or non-tree). But how to ensure that.\n\nThis seems too vague. Perhaps I need to think of the problem in terms of building a directed graph that is a DAG, and for each node, the inflow equals outflow. This is similar to having the in-degree and out-degree adjusted to balance the flow.\n\nBut again, how to compute this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where each edge is directed from the source to the sink. Then, for each node, the net outflow must be zero (except for source and sink). This can be modeled as a system of equations, but again, solving it for large n is not feasible.\n\nWait, but what if we model this as a directed graph where the direction of each edge is determined by the difference in the \"potential\" of the nodes. For example, assign to each node a value (like potential) such that for each edge between u and v, the direction is from the node with lower potential to higher potential. This ensures the graph is acyclic if all potentials are distinct. Now, the potential must be chosen so that for each intermediate node, the sum of flows on edges directed out of it equals those directed into it.\n\nBut how to compute such potentials. Let's think of this as a system where for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed out of v is equal to the sum on edges directed into v. This can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{edges directed out of v} c = sum_{edges directed into v} c.\n\nWhich implies that sum_{edges incident to v} c * (direction) = 0, where direction is +1 if directed out, -1 if directed in.\n\nBut since the direction depends on the potential, this becomes a system that we need to solve for potentials.\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where each node has a potential p(v), and for each edge between u and v, if p(u) < p(v), then the edge is directed from u to v. Now, for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed out of v is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed into v. This can be expressed as:\n\nsum_{edges incident to v} c * (if p(u) < p(v) then +1 else if p(u) > p(v) then -1 else 0) = 0.\n\nBut this is the same as:\n\nsum_{edges incident to v} c * sign(p(v) - p(u)) = 0.\n\nThis seems like a complex equation, but perhaps there's a way to assign potentials that satisfy this.\n\nLet me consider that the potentials are such that for each node v, the sum over all edges incident to v of c_uv * (p(v) - p(u)) = 0.\n\nAs previously derived, this leads to:\n\np(v) * S_v = sum_{u} c_uv * p(u), where S_v is the sum of c_uv for all edges incident to v.\n\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n\nS_v * p(v) - sum_{u} c_uv * p(u) = 0.\n\nWhich is:\n\nsum_{u} ( -c_uv * p(u) ) + S_v * p(v) = 0.\n\nBut this seems like a system of linear equations. Let me think of this as:\n\nFor each node v, sum_{u} ( -c_uv * p(u) ) + S_v * p(v) = 0.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{u} ( -c_uv * p(u) + delta_{uv} * S_v * p(v) ) = 0.\n\nBut this seems messy. However, notice that for each edge between u and v, the term appears in both u's and v's equations.\n\nBut if we consider all nodes, this forms a system of linear equations. However, solving this for large n is impractical with standard methods.\n\nBut given that the problem guarantees a solution exists, perhaps there's a way to assign potentials incrementally. For example, start with the source and sink, and assign potentials based on their positions.\n\nLet's think about the source (node 1) and the sink (node n). For the source, the net outflow is the total flow. For the sink, the net inflow is the total flow. For other nodes, net outflow is zero.\n\nAssume that the source has potential 0, and the sink has potential 1. Then, for each edge, the direction is determined by comparing potentials. But this may not satisfy the equations for other nodes. However, perhaps we can adjust the potentials iteratively.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where the potentials are determined by the flow. For example, the potential of a node is the amount of flow that passes through it from the source. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: since the graph is connected, we can perform a BFS starting from the source. For each node, assign a potential equal to the distance from the source. Then, direct all edges from lower distance to higher distance. However, this may not satisfy the flow conservation equations. But perhaps with some modifications.\n\nBut how to adjust the potentials to satisfy the equations.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the problem in terms of a directed graph where each edge is directed from u to v if the flow is going from u to v. In such a case, the flow conservation holds for the intermediate nodes. But how to find such a direction.\n\nBut this is exactly what the problem is asking for. So, the challenge is to find such a direction.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Build a directed graph by choosing directions for edges such that the flow conservation holds and the graph is acyclic.\n\nTo achieve this, perhaps we can perform a topological sort of the graph and assign directions based on the topological order. But how to ensure flow conservation.\n\nWait, suppose we have a topological order where the source is first and the sink is last. For each node in the order, we can direct all edges to nodes that come after it. This ensures the graph is acyclic. Now, for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed into it (from previous nodes) must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of it (to later nodes).\n\nHow can we ensure this? Perhaps we can process the nodes in topological order and adjust the directions of edges accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute this. Let's think of it this way: when processing a node v in the topological order, we know that all edges from v to nodes processed before it are already directed (but since the topological order is such that earlier nodes come before later ones, this would mean that v cannot have edges directed to earlier nodes, since they are already processed). Wait, no. If the topological order is such that all edges go from earlier to later, then for node v, all edges are either to nodes that come after it (directed from v to them) or to nodes that come before it (which would be impossible in a topological order). Thus, all edges are directed from v to later nodes.\n\nBut this would mean that for node v, the sum of flows on edges directed out of it is the sum of all edges incident to v that are directed out. But how to ensure that this sum equals the sum of flows on edges directed into v (which, in this case, would be zero, since no edges are directed into v from later nodes). This would only be possible if the sum of flows on edges directed out of v is zero, which is not the case for the source or sink.\n\nSo this approach doesn't seem to work.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let's look at the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n3 3\n3 2 10\n1 2 10\n3 1 5\n\nThe output is 1, 0, 1. Let's see what that means. The edges are directed as follows:\n\nEdge 1: 3→2 (original was 3-2, direction is 1 → reverse, so 2←3? Wait, the output is 1 for the first edge, which means the direction is bi→ai. Original edge was ai=3, bi=2. So direction is bi→ai → 2→3? Or wait, the output di is 0 if the direction is ai→bi, and 1 otherwise. So for the first edge, di is 1, meaning the direction is bi→ai → 2→3.\n\nSecond edge: di is 0 → direction is ai→bi → 1→2.\n\nThird edge: di is 1 → direction is bi→ai → 1→3?\n\nWait, original third edge is ai=3, bi=1. So if di is 1, direction is bi→ai, which is 1→3.\n\nSo the directed edges are 2→3, 1→2, 1→3. This forms a DAG with no cycles. For node 2 (which is not source or sink), the inflow is 10 (from 1→2) and the outflow is 10 (to 3). So it's balanced. The source (1) has outflow 10+5=15, which is the total flow. The sink (3) has inflow 10+5=15.\n\nSo the directed graph is acyclic. How was this achieved? The directions were chosen such that the flow is balanced at node 2, and the graph is acyclic.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nMaybe the solution involves building a directed tree where the source is the root and the sink is a leaf. For each node, the sum of flows on edges directed out of it equals the sum directed into it. But again, how to do this.\n\nWait, another observation: the flow conservation for each intermediate node v implies that the total flow through v is zero. This is similar to the concept of a flow network where the flow is conserved at each node. In such a case, the flow can be represented as a set of paths from the source to the sink, and the flow on each edge is the sum of the flows of the paths passing through it.\n\nBut how to use this. Perhaps we can find a way to assign directions to the edges based on the paths.\n\nBut without knowing the actual paths, this is difficult.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\n- Treat the graph as a directed graph with edges directed from the source to the sink. We need to ensure that for each intermediate node, the inflow equals the outflow.\n\nThis is similar to finding a flow decomposition into paths from source to sink. Each edge's direction is determined by the direction of the paths it is part of.\n\nBut how to find such a decomposition.\n\nAlternatively, since the flow is already given, perhaps we can treat the problem as a directed graph where each edge has a capacity equal to its flow, and the direction is determined by the flow. But again, how to determine the direction.\n\nWait, here's a possible solution inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be acyclic. We can perform a topological sort on the graph, and direct the edges in such a way that they follow the topological order. But how to ensure flow conservation.\n\nLet's assume that we have a topological order of the nodes. For each node v (except the source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum on edges directed out of v. Let's denote for each node v, the inflow is equal to the outflow. \n\nLet's think of this as a system where for each node v (not source or sink), the inflow is equal to the outflow. So, the inflow is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed into v, and the outflow is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. \n\nNow, if we have a topological order, we can process the nodes in order, and for each node, ensure that the outflow is equal to the inflow. For example, for the source, all edges are directed out. For each subsequent node, we can direct the edges in such a way that the outflow equals the inflow.\n\nBut how to calculate this.\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n1. Choose a topological order where the source is first, the sink is last, and all other nodes are in between.\n\n2. For each node v in the topological order (excluding the source and sink), calculate the inflow from already processed nodes. The inflow is the sum of flows on edges from already processed nodes to v. The outflow must be equal to this inflow. So, for edges connecting v to unprocessed nodes, we direct them from v to the unprocessed nodes, and the sum of these flows must equal the inflow. \n\nBut how to ensure that this is possible. Let's see.\n\nFor example, when processing node v, all edges from v to nodes that come after it in the topological order are directed from v to those nodes. The sum of flows on these edges is the outflow of v. This must equal the inflow, which is the sum of flows on edges from earlier nodes to v.\n\nBut how to ensure that this is possible. This requires that the sum of flows on edges from v to later nodes equals the inflow. However, the inflow is determined by the edges already processed. But what if the sum of flows on edges from v to later nodes is not equal to the inflow?\n\nThis seems like a problem. But since the problem states that a solution exists, perhaps this approach is viable.\n\nLet's think of it step by step.\n\nStart with the source. All edges from the source are directed out, as it has no incoming edges.\n\nThen, process the next node in the topological order. Let's call it v. The inflow to v is the sum of flows from edges that connect v to already processed nodes (which are earlier in the topological order). These edges are directed from the earlier nodes to v. The outflow from v must equal this inflow. So, for edges from v to unprocessed nodes, we direct them from v to those nodes, and the sum of their flows must equal the inflow.\n\nBut how to ensure that the sum of flows on edges from v to unprocessed nodes is equal to the inflow. This seems to require that the sum of flows on edges incident to v (connecting to unprocessed nodes) is equal to the inflow. But how to know this in advance.\n\nHowever, since the problem guarantees that a solution exists, perhaps this is always possible.\n\nBut how to choose the topological order. This seems like a chicken-and-egg problem.\n\nAlternatively, the topological order can be determined dynamically based on the flow conservation requirements. For example, we can use a priority queue or some other data structure to select the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph is a valid maximum flow configuration. The conditions include ensuring flow conservation at each intermediate vertex, no incoming edges at the source, and an acyclic directed graph.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using adjacency lists for efficient traversal.\n2. **Topological Sorting**: Use a topological sort approach to ensure the graph remains acyclic. This involves processing nodes in a specific order starting from the source (vertex 1) to the sink (vertex n).\n3. **Flow Conservation**: For each node (except the source and sink), ensure that the sum of flows on incoming edges equals the sum of flows on outgoing edges. This is achieved by dynamically adjusting edge directions based on the current state of processed nodes.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = []\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for i in range(m):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges.append((a, b, c, i))\n        adj[a].append((b, c, i))\n        adj[b].append((a, c, i))\n\n    # We'll use a priority queue to process nodes with zero inflow first\n    # But since the problem guarantees a solution, we can perform a BFS-like approach\n    # Start with the source node 1\n    in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    out_flow = [0] * (n + 1)\n    direction = [0] * m  # 0 means original direction, 1 means reversed\n\n    # Build the initial graph with all edges undirected, but track which are processed\n    # We'll use a queue to process nodes in topological order\n    queue = deque()\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    # Initialize the in_degree for each node\n    # But how?
