Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum radius d for the lanterns so that the entire street is covered. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The street is from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up a segment from (ai - d) to (ai + d). We need to find the minimal d such that all points from 0 to l are covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. So the key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's imagine that the lanterns are sorted in order. Because if they are not sorted, the gaps between them might not be properly considered. For example, if we have lanterns at positions 3 and 5, but there's another one at 1, then the gaps between 1 and 3, and 3 and 5 are important. But if the lanterns are not sorted, we can't just look at consecutive elements. So the first step must be to sort the array of lantern positions.\n\nOnce sorted, the idea is that between two consecutive lanterns, there's a certain distance. For each such pair, we need to calculate the maximum distance between them, and then determine what d is needed to cover that gap.\n\nWait, but how? Suppose two consecutive lanterns are at positions a and b (a < b). The distance between them is (b - a). The maximum distance between any two points in this interval would be the middle point between a and b. Because if the lanterns are covering their areas, the worst case is the point exactly in the middle of the two lanterns. For example, if two lanterns are at positions 0 and 5, then the middle is at 2.5. The distance from each lantern to that point is 2.5. So d must be at least 2.5 to cover that point. But if the lanterns are spaced more than that, then that's the critical point.\n\nBut wait, what if the lanterns are not adjacent? Like, if there's a gap between two lanterns that's larger than the gaps between others. So the maximum of these gaps divided by two would be the required d. But also, we have to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is important. Similarly, if the last lantern is not at l, then the distance from the last lantern to l is important.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from 0 to the first lantern. That's a candidate for the maximum required d.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to l. Another candidate.\n4. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them, divide by two. That's the required d for that gap. Take the maximum of all these values.\n5. The overall answer is the maximum between the first part (the ends) and the second part (the gaps between lanterns).\n\nWait, but why divide by two? Because the middle point between two lanterns is (a + b)/2. The distance from each lantern to that point is (b - a)/2. So the required d must be at least that. So for each consecutive pair, the required d is (b - a)/2. So the maximum of these values across all consecutive pairs is the maximum required for the middle gaps. Then compare that with the first and last parts.\n\nYes. So for example, in the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, the positions are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. \n\nCheck the first part: 0 to first lantern is 0. So no problem. The last lantern is at 15, which is the end of the street. So the last part is zero. Then check the consecutive gaps:\n\nBetween 0 and 3: 3-0 = 3. Divided by two is 1.5.\n\nBetween 3 and 5: 2/2=1.\n\nBetween 5 and 7: 1.\n\nBetween 7 and 9: 1.\n\nBetween 9 and 14: 5. Divided by two is 2.5.\n\nBetween 14 and 15: 1/2=0.5.\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. Which matches the sample output. So yes, that's correct.\n\nIn the second sample input:\n\nInput is 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5].\n\nFirst part: distance from 0 to 2 is 2. The last part is 5 to 5 (since l is 5) is zero. Then the consecutive gap between 2 and 5 is 3. Divided by two is 1.5. So the maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which is the sample output. Correct.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nNow, the steps to code this:\n\nFirst, read n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nThen, compute the initial max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0. So that's a candidate. Similarly, the last lantern's position is a[-1], the distance from a[-1] to l is l - a[-1]. So those are two candidates.\n\nThen, for each consecutive pair in the sorted array, compute the difference (current - previous), divide by two. Compare with the current max_d.\n\nFinally, the answer is the maximum between the max_d and the two end distances.\n\nWait, but the first and last parts are the distances from the ends of the street to the first and last lanterns. Because if the first lantern is at position x, then the area from 0 to x - d must be covered. Wait, no. Because the lantern's coverage is from ai -d to ai +d. So for the first lantern, the left end of the street (0) must be covered. So 0 must be within [a_0 -d, a_0 +d]. Which implies that a_0 -d <= 0 <= a_0 +d. So the maximum distance from 0 to a_0 is a_0 - 0. So d needs to be at least that. Because if a_0 is at position x, then 0 is x -d. So d must be >=x. Because if d is x, then the left end is covered. Similarly for the last lantern. So the first and last parts are the distances from 0 to a[0], and from a[-1] to l.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nmax_d = max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nthen, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ngap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent = gap / 2\n\nif current > max_d, then update max_d.\n\nAt the end, return max_d.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1, l=5, and a is [3]. Then the max_d is max(3, 5-3=2) → 3. Which is correct because the lantern is at 3, so the left end is 0, which is 3 units away. So d must be 3. The right end is 5-3=2. So the maximum is 3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=1, l=0. Well, according to input constraints, l is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as the maximum between a[0] and (l - a[-1]).\n\nThen loop through the sorted array, checking consecutive elements. For each pair, compute (current - previous) / 2, and compare to max_d.\n\nFinally, output the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what about when the lanterns are not covering the entire street? For example, if there are two lanterns at positions 1 and 3, and l is 4. Then the first part is 1, the last part is 4 -3 = 1. The gap between 1 and 3 is 2, divided by two is 1. So the max is 1. But the street is from 0 to 4. The lanterns' coverage would be from 0 to 2 (for the first lantern, d=1) and 2 to 4 (for the second lantern). So the entire street is covered. So yes, correct.\n\nAnother example: if the lanterns are at 0 and 3, l is 5. Then the first part is 0, last part is 5-3=2. The gap between 0 and 3 is 3/2=1.5. So the max is 2. Which is correct. Because the lanterns would cover up to 3 + 2 = 5. So the d is 2.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, coding in Python.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. Wait, the sample input shows two examples, but perhaps the actual input is per test case. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. Wait, the original problem's input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen the second example is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. So the code should process one test case. Wait, but in the sample input, there are two test cases. But perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l... \n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows two separate test cases. So maybe the actual problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, but looking at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that the user has to process multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases. But the problem's original input is for a single test case. Wait, perhaps the problem is that in the original problem, the input is a single test case, but the sample input shows two test cases. But that's not possible. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. Therefore, the sample input is two separate test cases. But how is that possible? Maybe the sample input is two test cases, but the problem expects that the code reads a single test case. Or perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's original input is not clear. However, looking at the sample input and output, the user probably has to process multiple test cases. But that's not stated in the problem. Wait, looking at the problem's input and output description:\n\nIn the problem's input, the first line is n and l. Then the next line is the list of a_i. So the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the user is to read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the original problem's input may have multiple test cases. But the problem's input description doesn't mention that. That's confusing. However, the sample input shows two test cases, and the sample outputs have two answers. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how to know? Let me check the original problem's source.\n\nLooking back, the problem is from Codeforces, perhaps. For example, the problem \"Vanya and Lanterns\" is a Codeforces problem. Let me think. The original problem is Codeforces Round #296 (Div. 2), problem C. Let me check.\n\nBut regardless, the sample input shows two test cases, but the problem's input description says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows that the user is supposed to read two test cases. But perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first line is the number of test cases. But no, the problem's input description doesn't say that.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai. So the code is supposed to read a single test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. How is that possible?\n\nAh! Oh, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first input is for the first test case, and the second is for the second. But the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description does not mention this. But perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input is unclear. But given that the sample input shows two test cases, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description says that the input is for a single test case. So this is a contradiction.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input provided in the problem:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen another line:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut perhaps the problem's sample input is written as two separate test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So the code should read a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is written as two separate test cases, but the actual input is for a single test case. But then why would the sample input have two test cases?\n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, looking at the sample output, which has two outputs. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code processes multiple test cases. But how many? How to know?\n\nBut looking back at the original problem's input and output, the problem says that the input is for one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. That suggests that the problem may have multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not specify that. So this is a problem.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check the problem statement again. The user provided the following:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains two integers n and l, the next line contains n integers. Then the sample input is given as two examples, perhaps indicating that the code should process multiple test cases. However, in the problem's original version, it's possible that the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first line is the number of test cases, but that's not mentioned in the problem statement. However, in the problem's sample input, the first line is '7 15' which is n and l. So that can't be the number of test cases.\n\nThis is a confusion. However, the user's problem says that the code should read input from stdin and print the desired outputs. So perhaps the problem is that the code should read a single test case, and the sample input shows two test cases as two separate examples. But in practice, the code will process a single test case.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows two test cases, but the problem's input description says that the input is for a single test case, perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not state that. This is conflicting.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original input and output:\n\nIn the problem statement's input, the first line contains n and l. The next line contains the list of a_i. The output is a single line with the answer.\n\nSo the code should process a single test case. Therefore, the sample input must be two separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. However, the sample input may have been formatted in a way that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how to know?\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output given by the user:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\nSo the user is providing two test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how many? How to know?\n\nBut in the problem statement's input description, there is no mention of multiple test cases. So this is a problem. But given that the sample input shows two test cases, and the code is expected to process them, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. For example, the sample input may have been written as two separate test cases, but the actual problem is for a single test case. So the code should read a single test case.\n\nIn this case, the code would read n and l from stdin, then the list of a_i, process it, and output the result.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. However, the user's problem says that the code should read input from standard input and output the desired outputs.\n\nAssuming that the code is supposed to process a single test case, then proceed with the code.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead n and l from input.\n\nRead the next line as list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen iterate over consecutive pairs, compute (a[i] - a[i-1])/2, and take maximum.\n\nFinally, output the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut what about if n is 0? No, the constraints say that n is at least 1.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nThen read the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute max_d.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut in Python, reading from stdin can be done via input().split() etc. However, sometimes the input may have multiple lines. For example, for the first test case, the input is two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# first part\nmax_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n# last part\nmax_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but for the first part, the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0, which is a[0]. So yes.\n\nBut what if the first lantern is at 0? Then a[0] is 0, so that part is 0. Similarly for the last lantern.\n\nBut this code would work.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=7, l=15. a = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d starts as max(0, 15-15=0) → 0.\n\nThen for the consecutive pairs:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5 → max_d is 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 9-7=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 14-9=5 → 2.5 → max_d becomes 2.5.\n\nThen 15-14=1 → 0.5 → no change.\n\nSo the max_d is 2.5, which is correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=2, l=5. a=[2,5]. sorted is [2,5].\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then check the gap between 5-2=3 → 1.5. So the max is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then max_d is max(3, 5-3=2) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Then the max_d is max(0, 5-5=0) → 0. Then the gap between 0 and 5 is 5/2=2.5. So the answer is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[0, 3]. Then the first part is 0, last part is 5-3=2. The gap between 0 and 3 is 3/2=1.5. So the maximum is 2. Which is correct. Because the second lantern covers up to 3+2=5. So yes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, l=0. But according to input constraints, l is at least 1. So no.\n\nEdge case 2: n=1, l=1, a=[0]. Then the max_d is max(0, 1-0=1) → 1. Which is correct. The lantern at 0 must cover up to 1, so d is 1.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. The gap between them is 10, so 5. So the answer is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. The gaps between 0 and 5 is 2.5, between 5 and 10 is 2.5. The max_d is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 3, 10]. The first part is 0. The last part is 0. The gaps between 0 and 3 is 1.5, between 3 and 10 is 7/2=3.5. So the answer is 3.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin. However, sometimes, when reading multiple lines, sometimes there are leading or trailing spaces. But the code uses split(), which handles that.\n\nBut for the input, when the code reads the second line, it must read exactly n integers. So the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = 0.0\n    # Check first and last\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    # Check consecutive pairs\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in Python, when you print floating points, you need to make sure that it's printed with enough decimal digits. For example, if the value is an integer like 2, it should be printed as 2.0000000000.\n\nThe format string {0:.10f} will do that.\n\nBut what about when the maximum is something like 2.5, which is exactly representable as a float? Well, Python's formatting should handle it.\n\nBut in some cases, due to floating point precision, perhaps the code could have issues. However, since the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-9, using floating points should be okay.\n\nBut what about when the maximum is something like 0.5? The code would output 0.5000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nAfter processing, max_d is 2.5. The output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2: max_d is 2.0 → output 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nBut what about when the lanterns are not sorted? For example, the first input in the first sample is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0], which after sorting becomes [0,3,5,7,9,14,15], which is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ that lanterns must have to ensure that the entire street is illuminated. The street is represented as a line segment from 0 to $ l $, and there are $ n $ lanterns placed at various positions along this segment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street ($ l $). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius $ d $.\n3. **Check Consecutive Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum required radius for these gaps is half the size of the largest gap, as the midpoint of the gap would be the farthest point from either lantern.\n4. **Determine the Maximum Radius**: The result is the maximum value among the distances calculated from the endpoints and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = 0.0\n    # Check the first and last parts\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    # Check consecutive pairs\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to efficiently check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Endpoint Check**: The initial check ensures that the ends of the street are covered by the lanterns' illumination range.\n- **Gap Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted positions, we calculate the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. The required radius for each gap is half the gap's size because the farthest point from both lanterns in the gap is at the midpoint.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with 10 decimal places to meet the problem's precision requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum radius required to illuminate the entire street using a combination of endpoint checks and gap analysis. The complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is $ O(n \\log n) $, making it efficient for the given constraints.",
