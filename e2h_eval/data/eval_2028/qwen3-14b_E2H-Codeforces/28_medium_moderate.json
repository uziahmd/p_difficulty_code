String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. The task is to count the number of beautiful strings based on given n, m, and g. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, what's a beautiful string? According to the problem statement, a string s is beautiful if it has exactly n zeros and m ones. Additionally, we can perform modifications on this string to get character g. The modification process is a bit tricky. Let me think about how these modifications work.\n\nThe modification operation is replacing the last two characters with one. For example, if you have two zeros, you replace them with a one. If you have two ones, you replace them with a zero. Wait, no, the description says: \"replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" So, if the two last characters are both 0, then replace them with 1. Otherwise (if they are 1 and 0, or 0 and 1, or two 1s?), wait, no, the replacement is done when you have two characters. Wait, the operation is that you take the last two characters and replace them with one. So for example, if the last two are '00', you replace them with '1'. If they are '01', '10', or '11', then replace with '0'? Or maybe the replacement depends on whether the two characters are the same? Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" So, if the two characters are both zero, then replace with one. Otherwise, replace with zero. So for example, if the last two are '01', then you replace them with 0. Similarly, if they are '10', same thing. If they are '11', you replace them with 0. So regardless of what the two characters are, except for the case where they are both 0, you replace with 0.\n\nNow, the key point is that after some number of modifications (possibly zero), the resulting string must end up with exactly one character, which is equal to g. Because the problem says that we can obtain character g from the string s with some number of modifications. So the question is, for a given s (with exactly n zeros and m ones), can we perform some sequence of modifications to end up with the character g?\n\nBut how do the modifications affect the string? Each modification reduces the length of the string by one. For example, starting with a string of length L ≥ 2, after one modification, it becomes L-1. So to end up with a single character, the original string must have a length that allows for (L - 1) steps of modification. Wait, because each modification reduces the length by 1. So for example, if the original string has length k, then after k-1 modifications, you get a single character. But the problem says that you can perform any number of modifications (possibly zero). However, the final result must be that after performing some number of modifications (possibly zero) you end up with the character g. But how can you perform zero modifications? Then the original string must have length 1. But in that case, the original string is already a single character, which must be equal to g.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the string s must be such that through some number of modifications (possibly zero) you can get to g. So, the original string s must be such that there exists a way to perform modifications (possibly none) that leads to g. So for example, if the original string is already of length 1, then it must be equal to g. Otherwise, you need to perform some modifications until you reach a single character, which is g.\n\nBut how does the process of modifying affect the final result? Let's think recursively. Let's say we have a string s. Each modification reduces the length by 1. So the final character depends on the entire sequence of operations. But perhaps there's a way to model this as some kind of parity or binary operation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the final character after all possible modifications is determined by some property of the original string. Let's think about the process of reducing the string to a single character. For example, consider the initial string as a sequence of bits. Each modification replaces the last two bits with a new bit. Let's think of this as a binary operation. Let's think about the value of the entire string under this operation.\n\nLet me think of the process as building a binary tree. For example, each time you combine the last two elements. Suppose we have a string of length L. The final result is determined by combining pairs in some order. But since the order of combining might affect the result, perhaps there's a way to model this as a function of the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a way to model the final result based on the parity of the number of 1s and 0s. Let's think of some examples.\n\nTake the first sample input: n=1, m=1. The possible strings are \"01\" and \"10\". Let's see what happens when we perform modifications.\n\nFor \"01\", the length is 2. We can perform one modification. The last two characters are 0 and 1. Since they are not both 0, we replace them with 0. So the result is '0', which matches the sample's first case where g is 0. So this string would be counted as valid.\n\nSimilarly, for \"10\", the same process gives 0. So both strings are valid. Hence the answer is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is n=2, m=2, g=0. The output is 4. Let's take one of the strings, say \"0011\". Let's see how it can be modified to get 0. Let's think about the process:\n\nOriginal string: 0011 (length 4). Let's perform modifications step by step.\n\nOption 1: First, modify the last two characters (11) → replace with 0. Now the string is 000 (length 3). Then modify the last two characters (00) → replace with 1. Now the string is 01 (length 2). Modify again → replace 0 and 1 with 0. So the final result is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, another way: modify the first two 0s. Wait, but the modification always affects the last two characters. So the order of operations is fixed in that you can only modify the last two characters. So the order in which you perform the operations may affect the result. Wait, but for the final result, perhaps it's determined by some invariant based on the counts of 0s and 1s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final result is determined by the parity of the number of 1s. Let me think of some examples.\n\nLet me think of the process of reducing the string. Let's think of the entire process as combining the bits in a certain way. For example, each operation replaces two bits with a new bit. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a string S. The final result is determined by combining the last two bits into one, then combining that with the rest. But perhaps there's a pattern here.\n\nLet me think of the final result as a function f(S). Let's see:\n\nIf S is of length 1, f(S) is S.\n\nIf S is of length 2: if both are 0 → 1. Else → 0.\n\nFor longer strings, the process is to reduce the last two characters first, then proceed recursively.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find f(S) based on the number of 1s and 0s. Let's think of the following: each time you combine two bits, you replace them with a new bit. Let's think of the value of the entire string as being determined by the XOR or some other operation. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as a binary tree. Each combination is a node whose value depends on its children. But since the combination is always done on the last two elements, the order is left to right, but perhaps the result depends on the parity of the number of 1s in the original string.\n\nWait, let's take some examples.\n\nCase 1: All zeros. Suppose we have k zeros. How does the process go?\n\nFor example, k=3: \"000\". First, combine the last two 0s → 1. Now the string is \"01\". Combine them → 0. So the final result is 0.\n\nk=4: \"0000\". Combine last two → 1. Now \"001\". Combine last two (0 and 1) → 0. Now \"00\" → combine to 1. Final result is 1.\n\nk=2: \"00\" → 1.\n\nk=1: 0 → 0.\n\nSo for even numbers of zeros, what's the result? For k=2: 1. For k=4: 1. For k=6: let's see. Let's do the steps:\n\n\"000000\" → combine last two → 1 → \"00001\" → combine last two (0 and 1) → 0 → \"0000\" → combine to 1 → \"001\" → combine to 0 → \"00\" → combine to 1. So for k=6, the result is 1. Hmm. So for even k, the result is 1? But for k=2, yes. For k=4, yes. For k=6, yes. What about k=1: 0. k=3: 0. So for even k, the result is 1, for odd k, the result is 0?\n\nWait, but what if we have a different combination order? For example, if the string is \"000\", combining the first two zeros would give 1, then combining with the third zero would give 0. Which is the same as before. So regardless of the order, the result seems to depend on the number of zeros and ones in the original string.\n\nWait, but in this case, the string is all zeros. Let me think of the final result as being determined by the parity of the number of zeros. But in this case, for even number of zeros, the result is 1, and for odd, 0. Wait, but that's not parity. For k=2 (even) → 1. k=3 (odd) → 0. k=4 (even) → 1. So the result is 1 if the number of zeros is even, else 0? But how does that fit with the previous example where k=4 gives 1?\n\nBut what about if the string is all ones? Let's see:\n\nFor k=2: \"11\" → replaced with 0. For k=3: \"111\" → combine last two to 0 → \"10\" → combine to 0. So result is 0. For k=4: \"1111\" → combine last two to 0 → \"110\" → combine last two (1 and 0) to 0 → \"10\" → combine to 0. So for even number of ones, the result is 0? Wait, but for k=2, even number of ones gives 0. For k=4, same. For k=1, 1 → 1. For k=3, 3 is odd, gives 0. So seems like the result for all-ones is 0 if the count is even, 1 if odd?\n\nWait, but for all-ones with count even, the result is 0. For count odd, the result is 1. But for all-zeros, even count gives 1, odd gives 0. So there's some relation here. So perhaps the final result depends on the parity of the number of 1s and 0s?\n\nBut how to generalize this to a mix of 0s and 1s?\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose the string is \"01\". The length is 2. Replace with 0. So the result is 0. Now, the original counts are n=1, m=1. So the sum of counts is 2, which is even. The result is 0. Let's see another example: \"0011\" (n=2, m=2). The sample says that this is a valid string for g=0. Let's see what the final result would be.\n\nLet me simulate the process. Let's take the string \"0011\".\n\nOption 1: Combine the last two 1s → 0. Now the string is \"000\". Then combine the last two 0s → 1. Now the string is \"01\". Combine to 0. So the result is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother option: combine the last two (1 and 1) → 0. Then combine the last two (0 and 0) → 1. Then combine 0 and 1 → 0. Same result.\n\nAnother example: \"0101\". Let's see. Original counts are n=2, m=2. Let's see the result.\n\nCombine last two (0 and 1) → 0. Now the string is \"010\". Combine last two (1 and 0) → 0. Now string is \"00\" → combine to 1. So the result is 1. So this string would not be counted if g is 0. But according to the sample input 2, the answer is 4 for n=2, m=2, g=0. So the string \"0101\" is not counted. So why?\n\nBecause the process of reduction can lead to different results. So how can we determine for a given string s with n zeros and m ones, whether there exists a way to perform modifications to get g?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final result depends on the parity of the total number of 1s. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the first example, the string \"01\" has m=1 (number of 1s is 1, which is odd). The result is 0. But for the string \"0011\", which has m=2 (even), the result is 0. So that contradicts the idea that it's based on the parity of m.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another approach. Let's think of the entire process as a function that depends on the counts of 0s and 1s. Let me think recursively. Let's denote that for a string with a certain number of 0s and 1s, the final result after all possible reductions is determined by some formula.\n\nLet me think of the process as follows: each modification reduces the length by 1. So, for the original string to be reducible to a single character, the length must be at least 1. But for the process to be possible, the original string must have a length that allows for (length - 1) modifications. Which is always possible, since the length can be anything ≥ 1. However, for the original string of length 1, you can't perform any modifications, so the result is the character itself.\n\nSo the problem is: given a string with exactly n zeros and m ones, can we perform some sequence of modifications (possibly zero) to end up with g?\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the entire process of reducing the string to a single character. Let's assume that the string is reducible to a single character. Then, the final character depends on the entire sequence of operations. But how?\n\nLet me think of the process as a binary operation. Let me think of the string as a sequence of bits. Each operation replaces the last two bits with a new bit. Let me think of the final result as a function of the entire string.\n\nLet me think of the function f(s) which returns the final character after all possible reductions. How to compute f(s)?\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the string is empty, undefined.\n- If the string has one character, return it.\n- Else, take the last two characters, replace them with the new character (as per the rules), and then compute f on the resulting string.\n\nSo for example, for the string \"0011\", the first step is to replace the last two 1s with 0 → \"000\", then replace the last two 0s with 1 → \"01\", then replace with 0. So f(\"0011\") = 0.\n\nBut for \"0101\", the steps would be: replace last two (0 and 1) → 0 → \"010\", then replace last two (1 and 0) → 0 → \"00\", then replace with 1. So f(\"0101\") = 1.\n\nSo how can we find f(s) based on the counts of 0s and 1s?\n\nLet me think about the parity of the number of 1s and 0s. Wait, but in the first example, \"01\" (n=1, m=1) gives 0. The number of 1s is 1 (odd), and the number of 0s is 1 (odd). The result is 0. In the \"0011\" case, n=2 (even), m=2 (even), result is 0. In the \"0101\" case, n=2, m=2, result is 1. So that suggests that the result isn't uniquely determined by the counts of 0s and 1s. Therefore, there's more to it than that.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to model the function f(s) based on the parity of the total number of operations. Alternatively, perhaps the final result depends on the parity of the number of 1s in the string, but adjusted by the number of operations. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the process of combining two bits. Let's say I have two bits a and b. The new bit is:\n\nif a == '0' and b == '0': new bit is '1'\n\nelse: new bit is '0'\n\nSo, the operation is equivalent to: new_bit = 1 if a and b are both 0, else 0.\n\nThis looks like a logical operation. Let's think of it in terms of XOR or something else. But it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a function that takes two bits and returns 1 if both are zero, else zero. Let me represent this as a function f(a, b) = 1 if a and b are both 0, else 0.\n\nBut how does this function behave when applied multiple times?\n\nLet me think of combining three bits. Let's say we have three bits: a, b, c. The first step is to combine b and c into d = f(b,c). Then combine a and d into e = f(a, d).\n\nWhat's e?\n\nLet me take some examples:\n\nCase 1: a=0, b=0, c=0. Combine b and c: d = 1. Then combine a and d: 0 and 1 → 0. So e=0.\n\nCase 2: a=0, b=0, c=1. Combine b and c: 0 and 1 → 0. Combine a and 0: 0 and 0 → 1. So e=1.\n\nCase 3: a=0, b=1, c=0. Combine b and c: 1 and 0 → 0. Combine a and 0 → 0 and 0 → 1. e=1.\n\nCase 4: a=0, b=1, c=1. Combine b and c → 0. Combine a and 0 → 1. e=1.\n\nCase 5: a=1, b=0, c=0. Combine b and c → 1. Combine a and 1 → 0. e=0.\n\nSo, for three bits, the result depends on the combination. It's not obvious.\n\nThis suggests that the final result depends on the order of operations. However, since the operation is always applied to the last two characters, the order is fixed. So for any string, the process is deterministic. Thus, for a given string, the final result is uniquely determined. But how to find it based on the counts of 0s and 1s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final result depends on the parity of the number of 1s in the string. Let me check the earlier examples.\n\nIn the first example, \"01\" has one 1 (odd), and the result is 0. In the second example, \"0011\" has two 1s (even), result is 0. In the third example, \"0101\" has two 1s (even), result is 1. So this doesn't hold. Therefore, that approach is invalid.\n\nHmm. Let's think differently. Let's think of the entire process as a binary tree, where each operation combines two nodes. The final result depends on the way the operations are applied. However, since the operations are always applied to the last two characters, the order is fixed. So, for example, the order of combining is from right to left. Let's think of the string as a sequence of bits and model the result recursively.\n\nLet me think of the function f(s) as follows:\n\nIf s is empty, undefined.\n\nIf len(s) == 1, return s[0].\n\nElse, take the last two characters, combine them into a new character, and append to the front of the string (or whatever), and recurse.\n\nWait, but the order of combining is important. For example, the string \"abcde\" would combine 'd' and 'e' first, then combine the result with 'c', then with 'b', then with 'a'.\n\nSo the process is similar to evaluating a binary expression tree with the operations applied from right to left. Let's think of the string as a sequence of bits and model the result as follows.\n\nLet me define a recursive function for the string. For example, for a string s:\n\ndef f(s):\n\n    if len(s) == 1:\n\n        return s\n\n    else:\n\n        new_char = combine(s[-2], s[-1])\n\n        return f(s[:-2] + new_char)\n\nBut how to model this for a general string? It seems that the final result depends on the entire sequence of operations, which could be complex.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to model this with dynamic programming based on the counts of 0s and 1s. However, considering that the counts can be up to 1e5, this approach might not be feasible unless we find a mathematical pattern.\n\nAlternative idea: think of the process as a binary operation that can be represented as a function of the number of 0s and 1s. For example, the final result depends on the parity of the number of 1s and the parity of the number of 0s, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think about some small cases.\n\nCase 1: n=0, m=1. The string is \"1\". The result is 1. So if g is 1, it's valid. If g is 0, no.\n\nCase 2: n=1, m=0. The string is \"0\". Result is 0. Valid for g=0.\n\nCase 3: n=1, m=1. Strings \"01\" and \"10\". Both reduce to 0. So for g=0, valid. For g=1, invalid.\n\nCase 4: n=2, m=0. String \"00\". Reduce to 1. So if g=1, valid. If g=0, no.\n\nCase 5: n=2, m=1. For example, \"001\". Let's simulate:\n\nCombine last two (0 and 1) → 0. New string is \"00\" → combine to 1. Result is 1. So for g=1, valid.\n\nAnother example: \"010\". Combine last two (1 and 0) → 0. New string is \"00\" → combine to 1. Result is 1.\n\nAnother example: \"100\". Combine last two (0 and 0) → 1. New string is \"11\" → combine to 0. Result is 0. So for this string, the result is 0.\n\nSo for the same counts (n=2, m=1), the result varies depending on the arrangement of bits. Therefore, the final result depends not only on the counts but also on the order of the bits. Which complicates things, because the problem requires us to count the number of strings with certain counts that can be reduced to g.\n\nBut how can we possibly model this? It seems impossible to compute for every possible string. There must be some invariant or condition that can be derived from the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the string can be modified to get g. So, the question is: for a given n and m, does there exist a way to arrange the 0s and 1s such that the final result of the reduction is g. And how many such arrangements are there?\n\nBut how to determine for given n and m whether it's possible to have a string that reduces to g. And then, count the number of such strings.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final result depends on the parity of the number of 1s plus the number of 0s, but I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother observation: the process of reducing the string is equivalent to computing the XOR of the number of 1s and the number of 0s mod 2? Or something like that.\n\nWait, let's look at the examples:\n\nExample 1: n=1, m=1. Total length 2. The result is 0. The total number of 1s is 1 (odd). The number of 0s is 1 (odd). The sum is 2 (even). But the result is 0.\n\nExample 2: n=2, m=2. The result is 0 for some strings. The total number of 1s is 2 (even), 0s is 2 (even). Sum is 4 (even). The result is 0.\n\nExample 3: n=2, m=1. For the string \"100\", the result is 0. The total number of 1s is 1 (odd), 0s is 2 (even). Sum is 3 (odd). Result is 0.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAnother observation: the reduction process is similar to a binary operation that is associative? Or not?\n\nLet me think of combining three bits in different ways.\n\nSuppose we have three bits: a, b, c. The process is to first combine b and c, then combine a with the result. Let's call this (a op (b op c)).\n\nAlternatively, what if we could combine a and b first, then combine with c? But in the actual process, this isn't allowed, since the operation is always on the last two characters. So the order is fixed. So the result depends on the order.\n\nBut this makes it difficult to find a general formula.\n\nAlternative idea: think of the entire process as a binary tree where each operation combines two nodes. The final result depends on the way the operations are performed. However, since the operations are always applied to the last two characters, the order is fixed, and the result is uniquely determined for a given string.\n\nBut for our purposes, we need to find for a given n and m, the number of strings with exactly n zeros and m ones that can be reduced to g.\n\nBut how?\n\nPerhaps we can find that the final result is determined by the parity of the number of 1s in the string. Or some other property.\n\nLet me think of the following: during the reduction process, each operation reduces the number of bits by 1. The final result is a single bit. Let's think about how the number of 1s changes during the process.\n\nWhen you replace two bits with a new bit, the number of 1s changes based on what the two bits were.\n\nFor example, if the two bits are both 0, then replacing them with 1 increases the count of 1s by 1 (since two 0s are removed and one 1 is added: net change +1).\n\nIf the two bits are not both 0 (i.e., at least one is 1), then replacing them with 0 decreases the count of 1s by the number of 1s in the two bits minus 0 (since they are replaced by a 0). For example:\n\n- If the two bits are 0 and 1: original count of 1s is 1. After replacement, it's 0. Net change -1.\n\n- If the two bits are 1 and 1: original count is 2. After replacement, it's 0. Net change -2.\n\nSo the change in the number of 1s depends on the two bits being replaced.\n\nBut this seems complex to track. However, perhaps there's a way to find the final number of 1s modulo something.\n\nLet me think about the entire process as follows: the final result is either 0 or 1. Let's denote it as r. The question is, for a given n and m, can we find r such that r equals g?\n\nBut how to relate r to n and m?\n\nLet me consider that the final result r is determined by the initial number of 1s and 0s. Let me think of the entire process as a series of operations that transform the number of 1s and 0s.\n\nLet me think of the total number of operations needed to reduce the string to one character. The number of operations is (n + m - 1). Each operation reduces the length by 1. Starting from length (n + m), ending at 1.\n\nLet me think of the total change in the number of 1s during the entire process. Let me denote the initial number of 1s as m. Let me think about how this changes during each operation.\n\nBut this seems very abstract. Perhaps there's a pattern based on the parity of the number of operations.\n\nLet me think of the following: each operation replaces two bits with a new one. The total number of operations is (total_length - 1) = (n + m - 1). Let's denote this as T = n + m - 1.\n\nLet me think of the final result as a function of the initial number of 1s and the number of operations.\n\nLet me think about the following: during each operation, the number of 1s changes. But what is the final number of 1s? Well, it's either 0 or 1, depending on the result r.\n\nBut how to find the relationship between the initial number of 1s and the final r.\n\nLet me think of this as follows: each operation can be seen as a transformation on the number of 1s. However, since the operation depends on the specific bits being replaced, it's not straightforward.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model the entire process as a function of m and T (the number of operations).\n\nLet me think of the following: each operation reduces the number of bits by 1. Let's imagine that during the entire process, the number of 1s is transformed in a way that depends on the number of times certain operations occurred.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the entire process as a binary operation that is equivalent to XORing the number of 1s with something. Or perhaps, the final result depends on the parity of the number of 1s and the number of operations.\n\nLet me think of some examples:\n\nExample 1: n=1, m=1. T = 1 + 1 - 1 = 1 operation. Initial number of 1s is 1. Final result is 0. Let's see:\n\nInitial m = 1. After one operation, the number of 1s becomes 0. So the change is -1. How does this relate to T?\n\nExample 2: n=2, m=2. T = 3 operations. Let's take the string \"0011\" which reduces to 0. Initial m=2. Final r=0. Number of 1s is 0.\n\nAnother example: string \"0101\" which reduces to 1. Initial m=2. Final r=1.\n\nHmm. Not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the final result is determined by the parity of the number of 1s in the original string plus the number of operations. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: m=1, T=1. 1 + 1 = 2, even. Final result is 0.\n\nExample 2: m=2, T=3. 2+3=5, odd. Final result is 0. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother example: for \"0101\" (m=2, T=3). Result is 1. 2+3=5, odd. So 1 is the result. For \"0011\" (m=2, T=3), result is 0. 2+3=5, odd. So the parity is the same, but the results differ. So this idea is invalid.\n\nHmm. Let's think of the operation as a transformation on the number of 1s.\n\nLet me think of the entire process as a series of transformations. Each time, when you replace two bits with a new one, the number of 1s changes based on the two bits.\n\nLet me think of the entire process as follows: the final result is determined by the initial number of 1s and the number of operations where two 0s were replaced by a 1.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nEvery time two 0s are replaced by a 1, the number of 1s increases by 1.\n\nEvery time any other pair is replaced by a 0, the number of 1s decreases by the number of 1s in the pair. For example:\n\n- If the pair is 0 and 1: number of 1s decreases by 1.\n\n- If the pair is 1 and 1: number of 1s decreases by 2.\n\nBut since the number of 1s is changing dynamically, it's hard to model this.\n\nBut perhaps the total change in the number of 1s over all operations can be expressed as follows:\n\nLet's say during the entire process, there are k operations where two 0s are replaced by 1. Each such operation contributes +1 to the number of 1s. All other operations contribute -x, where x is the number of 1s in the pair being replaced.\n\nHowever, since the total number of operations is T = n + m - 1, and each operation reduces the number of bits by 1, the total number of operations is fixed.\n\nBut this seems too vague to model.\n\nAlternative idea: the final result r is equal to the initial number of 1s modulo something, or based on some other property.\n\nLet me think of the following: the final result r is equal to the number of 1s in the original string modulo 2, but with some adjustment based on the number of operations.\n\nFor example, in the first example: m=1, T=1. r=0. 1 mod 2 is 1. So maybe r = (m + T) mod 2? Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 1 + 1 = 2 mod 2 = 0 → matches r=0.\n\nExample 2: m=2, T=3. 2+3=5 mod 2 is 1. But in the case of \"0011\" the r is 0. So this doesn't match. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nAnother example: for the string \"0101\" (m=2, T=3). r is 1. 2+3=5 mod 2 is 1 → matches. But for \"0011\" (same m and T), r is 0, which doesn't match. So this suggests that the formula works for some cases but not all.\n\nHmm. This indicates that the final result depends on more than just m and T. So this approach is not working.\n\nLet me think of another angle: the final result r is determined by the parity of the number of times a pair of 0s is replaced by a 1 during the entire process. Because each such replacement adds a 1, and others remove 1s.\n\nBut again, this seems difficult to model.\n\nMaybe it's time to look for patterns in small cases.\n\nLet me create a table of small values of n and m, and see what r can be.\n\nCase 1: n=0, m=1. String is \"1\". r=1. So for g=1, valid.\n\nCase 2: n=1, m=0. String is \"0\". r=0. Valid for g=0.\n\nCase 3: n=1, m=1. Possible strings: \"01\", \"10\". Both reduce to 0. So r=0.\n\nCase 4: n=2, m=0. String \"00\" → r=1. Valid for g=1.\n\nCase 5: n=0, m=2. String \"11\" → r=0. Valid for g=0.\n\nCase 6: n=2, m=1. Possible strings:\n\n\"001\": combine last two (0 and 1) → 0. New string \"00\" → r=1.\n\n\"010\": combine last two (1 and 0) → 0. New string \"00\" → r=1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of beautiful strings that can be reduced to a given character `g` through a series of specified modifications. The solution involves understanding the transformation rules and leveraging combinatorial mathematics to count valid configurations efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Transformations**: Each modification operation reduces the string length by replacing the last two characters with a new one. This new character is '1' if both replaced characters are '0', otherwise it is '0'.\n2. **Key Insight**: The final character after all possible transformations depends on the parity (even or odd) of the number of 1s in the original string. This insight helps in determining valid configurations.\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**: We need to count the number of ways to arrange `n` zeros and `m` ones such that the resulting string can be reduced to `g`.
