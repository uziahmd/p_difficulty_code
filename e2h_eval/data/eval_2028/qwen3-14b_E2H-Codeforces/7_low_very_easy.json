The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure of such a graph.\n\nSo, according to the problem statement, the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those leaves) are each connected to k new vertices. And this step must be done at least once. So the process is like building layers.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Let's model the number of vertices after each step.\n\nInitially, there's 1 vertex. Let's call this level 0.\n\nFirst step: connect it to k new vertices. Now total vertices is 1 + k. These new vertices are leaves (each has degree 1). But the initial vertex now has degree k.\n\nThen, the next step is to take each leaf (which are the k vertices added in the first step) and connect each to k new vertices. So each of these k leaves adds k new vertices. So the total vertices now is 1 + k + k*k. But wait, each of the k leaves is connected to k new nodes. So that's k * k new nodes. So total is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut then, the process says that this step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we do this once. So for example, the minimal snowflake for k=4 would have 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1+4+16=21 vertices? But the example given says for n=6, the answer is NO. Wait, let me check the sample input.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nSample input includes n=6, output is NO. Let's see why. Let's think about possible k values.\n\nFor example, let's consider possible steps. Let's think about the possible numbers of vertices.\n\nThe snowflake can be constructed in different ways. Let me think of the general formula.\n\nThe snowflake construction can be thought of as having multiple layers. The first layer is the initial node. Then, each time we add a layer, each existing leaf is expanded into k new nodes.\n\nWait, but the process is that after the initial step (adding the first layer), we need to perform the step of adding new vertices to each leaf at least once. So the minimal number of steps is two steps: initial step (adding k nodes) and then adding another layer.\n\nBut maybe the process can be done multiple times. For example, after adding the second layer, you could again take all leaves (which are the ones added in the second layer) and add k nodes to each of them. So the total number of vertices depends on how many layers we have.\n\nLet me model this. Suppose the snowflake is built with m layers. Let's think:\n\nLayer 0: 1 node (the root).\n\nLayer 1: Each node in layer 0 (which is 1 node) adds k nodes. So layer 1 has k nodes. Total so far: 1 + k.\n\nBut then, for the next layers, each node in the previous layer (which are leaves) adds k new nodes. Wait, no. Wait, the process is that each time, any node that is connected to only one other node (i.e., a leaf) is connected to k new nodes. So each time, all leaves are processed.\n\nWait, the way the snowflake is built is that after the initial step (the first layer), each subsequent step involves adding new nodes to each leaf. So each step adds a new layer. For example:\n\n- Step 0: 1 node.\n\n- Step 1: add k nodes. Now total is 1 + k. The leaves are those k nodes.\n\n- Step 2: add k nodes to each of those leaves. So adding k * k nodes. Now total is 1 + k + k^2. The leaves are those new nodes.\n\n- Step 3: add k nodes to each of those leaves. So adding k^3 nodes. Now total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. And so on.\n\nBut the problem says that the step of adding to the leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal number of steps is two steps (step 1 and step 2). So the minimal snowflake is 1 + k + k^2. But for example, if k=2, then the minimal is 1+2+4=7 nodes.\n\nBut what if we stop after step 1? That would be 1 +k nodes. However, according to the problem statement, the step of adding to the leaves must be done at least once. So that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can be constructed based on the given rules. The snowflake graph is built in layers starting from a single vertex and expanding each leaf node by adding `k` new vertices in each subsequent layer. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex. Each subsequent layer adds `k` new vertices to each leaf node. The process of adding new vertices to leaves must be performed at least once.\n2. **Formulating the Total Vertices**: The total number of vertices after `m` layers can be represented as a geometric series. For `m` layers, the total number of vertices is `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`. However, the minimum number of layers required is 2 (since the step of adding to leaves must be done at least once).\n3. **Check for Validity**: For a given `n`, we need to check if there exists some integer `k > 1` such that `n` can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series starting from 1 with ratio `k` for some number of terms.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    # Check for possible k values\n    # Try different numbers of layers (m)\n    # For each m >= 2, check if there exists a k > 1 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n\n    # But since m can be large, we need an efficient way\n    # The sum is (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)\n    # We can iterate over possible m (number of layers), but since n is up to 1e18, m is limited\n    # Let's try m from 1 to 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18)\n    for m in range(1, 61):\n        # For each m, find if there's a k such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n\n        # sum = (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)\n        # We need to find k such that this equals n\n        # For m >= 1, since the minimal steps require m >= 2 (layers 0,1,2)\n        # Wait, original problem requires that the step (adding to leaves) is done at least once.
