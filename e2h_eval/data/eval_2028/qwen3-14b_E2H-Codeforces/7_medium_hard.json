    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given number n can be the number of vertices in a snowflake graph as defined. Let's think about what the snowflake structure looks like.\n\nThe problem says that the snowflake is built in a certain way. Let me try to understand the construction steps again. \n\nInitially, there's one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to it. So after the first step, there are 1 + k vertices. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) must be connected to k new vertices. And this step has to be done at least once. So for example, the minimal case for k=4 would be:\n\nStart with 1 node. Add 4 nodes connected to it. Now, each of those 4 nodes has only one connection, so each must get k new nodes. So each of them adds 4 new nodes. That gives 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 +4 + 16 = 21? Or wait, maybe the process is done once. Wait the problem says that the step should be done at least once. So for the minimal case, after the initial step (adding k nodes), we do that step once. So that step is: for each node that has degree 1 (the ones added in the first step), add k new nodes connected to them. So that step adds k * (number of such nodes). \n\nSo the structure is a tree. Let me model the number of nodes.\n\nLet me think recursively. The snowflake is built in layers. Let's say that the initial node is layer 0. Then layer 1 consists of k nodes connected to it. Then each node in layer 1 has k children in layer 2. Then each node in layer 2 has k children in layer 3, etc. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding new nodes to the leaves (those with only one connection) must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would have two layers. For example, the initial node (layer 0) connected to k nodes (layer 1), and then each of those k nodes is connected to k new nodes (layer 2). So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k*k = 1 + k + k². But wait, the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to the leaves must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding the first k nodes) is required. Then the step of adding new nodes to the leaves (which are the first k nodes) is done once. So the minimal snowflake has 1 +k +k² nodes. But what if the process is done more than once?\n\nWait, the construction rules are:\n\nInitially, one vertex. Then, add k new vertices connected to it. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (i.e., the ones added in the previous step) is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So the process is:\n\nStart with 1 node.\n\nStep 1: add k nodes connected to it. Now, the total is 1 +k.\n\nThen, perform the step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) at least once. So the first time, we take the leaves (the k nodes from step 1) and add k new nodes to each. That gives us k *k new nodes. Total becomes 1 +k + k^2. \n\nBut then, if we do the step again, we take all the leaves (the nodes added in the previous step, which are k^2 in number) and add k new nodes to each. So each step adds k times the number of leaves from the previous step. \n\nSo the structure can be thought of as a tree where each node (except the leaves) has exactly k children. But the construction requires that the process of adding to the leaves is done at least once. So the snowflake can have multiple layers. \n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of steps after the initial step. Wait, no. Because the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, each step adds k * (number of leaves from previous step). Let me think again.\n\nLet me model the number of nodes. Let's consider that the construction is done for m levels. Let me think of the process:\n\n- The initial node (level 0). \n- Level 1: k nodes. \n- Level 2: each node in level 1 has k children. So level 2 has k * k = k² nodes.\n- Level 3: each node in level 2 has k children. So k³ nodes.\n...\nSo the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m is the number of levels. But according to the problem's construction rules, the step of adding new nodes to the leaves must be done at least once. Which means that the construction must have at least two levels. Wait:\n\nThe initial step (adding the first k nodes) is part of the construction. Then, the step of adding new nodes to the leaves (the k nodes) must be done once. So the minimal case is when m is 2 levels (level 0, 1, 2). So the total nodes is 1 + k + k². \n\nBut the problem allows for more steps. So the total number of nodes can be 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2? Or is m the number of steps? Let me think again.\n\nWait the initial step is adding the first k nodes. Then, the step of adding k nodes to each leaf is done once. So that's adding k² nodes. Then, if we do it again, adding k³ nodes, etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k*(1 + k + k² + ... + k^{t}) ), where t is the number of steps after the first. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think:\n\nThe initial step is 1 node. Then, add k nodes (level 1). Then, the step is done once: add k nodes per node in level 1 (so level 2, size k²). Then, if we do the step again, add k nodes per node in level 2 (so level 3, size k³). So the total nodes is 1 + k + k² + ... +k^m, where m is the number of layers minus 1. But the construction requires that the step (adding new nodes to leaves) is done at least once. So the minimal case is when m is 2 (so 1 +k +k²). However, the construction could have any number of steps as long as the step is done at least once. \n\nThus, the total number of nodes for a snowflake is of the form S = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1), where m ≥ 1. Because:\n\nsum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). \n\nBut m must be at least 1. Because when m=1, the sum is 1 +k. But according to the problem, the step of adding new nodes to the leaves must be done at least once. Wait, let's check:\n\nIf m=1, the sum is 1 +k. That would be the case where the initial step is done (adding k nodes) but the step of adding new nodes to leaves is not done. Because the step is done once. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem's construction rules:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. \n\nSo the initial step is adding k nodes (so 1 +k nodes). Then, the step is done once. So that step is adding k new nodes to each of the current leaves (which are the k nodes from the first step). Thus, the total becomes 1 +k +k*k = 1 +k +k². \n\nSo the minimal number of nodes is 1 +k +k². So the sum for m=2 steps (initial step plus one step of adding to leaves). Wait, perhaps the formula is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2? No, because for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k². So the sum is for m+1 terms. So the formula is sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). And for the snowflake to be valid, m must be ≥ 2? Or m must be ≥ 1?\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k nodes (so the first step). Then the step of adding new nodes to leaves is done once. So that's adding another layer. So the total number of layers is 2. So the sum is 1 +k +k². So the sum is for m=2, where m is the maximum exponent. So the general formula is S = (k^{d} - 1)/(k-1), where d ≥ 3? Because when d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k². \n\nWait, for d being the number of terms. Let me think again. For example, if d=1, sum is 1. d=2, sum is 1 +k. d=3, sum is 1 +k +k². So for the snowflake, the sum must be for d ≥3? Because the step of adding to leaves is done once. Because when d=2, sum is 1 +k, but that would require that the step of adding new nodes to leaves is not done. Because the initial step is adding the k nodes (so the first step). Then, the step (adding new nodes to leaves) must be done at least once. So the sum must have at least three terms. So d ≥ 3. Therefore, the total number of nodes is (k^d - 1)/(k-1), where d ≥3 and k ≥2. \n\nBut wait, the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to the leaves is done at least once. So after the initial step (adding the first k nodes), the step is done once. Which adds the next layer. So the sum is 1 +k +k². Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). Because (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k². So yes, d=3. So for the snowflake to exist, n must be equal to (k^d -1)/(k-1) for some integers k ≥2 and d ≥3. \n\nWait, but what if the step is done more than once? For example, after adding the second layer (k² nodes), we can do the step again, adding k³ nodes. Then the total is 1 +k +k² +k³ = (k^4 -1)/(k-1). So for d=4. So in general, n must be equal to (k^d -1)/(k-1) for some integers k≥2 and d≥3. \n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written in this form for some k≥2 and d≥3. \n\nSo the task is, given n, check if there exists integers k ≥2 and d ≥3 such that n = (k^d -1)/(k-1). \n\nNow, the challenge is to check for each n whether this is possible. Given that n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to check this. \n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For each test case, we need to check if n can be expressed in the above form. \n\nFirst, note that for each d ≥3, we can try to find a k such that (k^d -1)/(k-1) = n. Let me denote this expression as f(k, d) = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{d-1} } = (k^d -1)/(k-1). \n\nFor each possible d ≥3, we can try to find k such that f(k,d) = n. \n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need to find all possible d's that could be feasible. \n\nWhat's the maximum possible d for which there exists k ≥2 such that f(k,d) ≤ 1e18?\n\nFor example, for d=3, the minimal value is 1 +2 +4 =7. For d=60, even k=2, f(2,60) is 2^60 -1, which is way larger than 1e18. So for each n, the possible d's are limited. For example, the maximum d is log_2(n) + 1. Since for k=2, f(2, d) = 2^d -1. So for n up to 1e18, d can be up to around 60. Because 2^60 is about 1e18. \n\nSo for each n, we can iterate d from 3 up to 60 (since 2^60 is 1.15e18, which is larger than 1e18). For each d, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that f(k,d) =n. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n can be expressed as (k^d -1)/(k-1) for some d ≥3 and k ≥2.\n\nTo do this:\n\nLoop d from 3 to max_d (like 60). For each d, perform a binary search on k to see if there's a k such that f(k,d) =n. \n\nBut how to compute f(k,d) efficiently? Well, for a given k and d, f(k,d) is sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i. \n\nBut for a given d, and a given k, we can compute this sum. However, since k can be up to something like n^(1/(d-1)), since for d fixed, the sum is O(k^{d-1}).\n\nBut for each d, the possible k is between 2 and some upper bound. For example, for d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k². So for a given n, solving 1 +k +k² =n. The maximum possible k is sqrt(n). \n\nBut for each d, the upper bound for k is such that f(k,d) ≤n. \n\nSo for each d, we can perform a binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound. \n\nBut how to compute f(k,d) without overflow? Since n can be up to 1e18, and d can be up to 60, for k up to say 1e9, but even then, for d=60, k^d would be way larger than 1e18. So during the binary search, we need to compute the sum incrementally and check for overflow. \n\nLet me think. For a given k and d, compute the sum s = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{d-1}. \n\nWe can compute this sum iteratively, adding each term. If during the computation, the sum exceeds n, we can break early and return that it's too big. \n\nSo for each d, binary search for k in [2, ... upper], and for each candidate k, compute the sum. \n\nSo the steps for each d:\n\nlow = 2, high = something (like n^(1/(d-1)) + 1). \n\nBut how to find the upper limit for k? Well, since the sum for k is 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} ≥k^{d-1} (since all terms are positive). So k^{d-1} ≤n → k ≤n^{1/(d-1)}. So the upper bound for k can be set as n^(1/(d-1)) + 1. But since n can be up to 1e18, and d can be up to 60, for d=3, the upper bound is sqrt(n) which can be up to 1e9. For d=60, the upper bound is n^(1/59), which is about 1e18^(1/59) which is small. So for each d, binary search can be feasible. \n\nBut how to compute the sum for a given k and d? Let's think about the code. \n\nFor example, for a given k and d, compute the sum s. We can compute it as follows:\n\ns = 0\n\nfor i in 0 to d-1:\n\n    s += k^i \n\nBut calculating k^i for large exponents could be expensive. However, since d is up to 60, and for each step, we can compute it incrementally. Also, during the calculation, if the sum exceeds n, we can break early and return that it's too big. \n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum as (k^d -1) // (k-1) if k !=1. But since k ≥2, this is valid. However, calculating k^d may be problematic for large k and d. For example, k=1e9 and d=60, k^d is way beyond 1e18. But since we have to check if this equals n, which is up to 1e18, we can compute the sum incrementally and stop if it exceeds n. \n\nSo here's the approach for checking if for a given d and k, the sum equals n:\n\nInitialize current_sum = 0, current_term = 1 (which is k^0). For each of the d terms:\n\ncurrent_sum += current_term \n\nif current_sum > n: return too big \n\ncurrent_term *=k \n\nBut wait, for the sum 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{d-1}, which has d terms. So for d steps. \n\nYes. For example, d=3: terms are 1, k, k². \n\nSo for each d, the loop runs d times. \n\nSo during the binary search, for each candidate k, we can compute the sum in O(d) time. \n\nNow, the steps for solving the problem:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nCheck if n is 1: output NO (since for d ≥3, the minimal sum is 1 +2 +4 =7). \n\nElse, for d from 3 up to max_d (like 60):\n\n   perform binary search on k in [2, ... upper] to see if there exists a k such that the sum equals n. \n\nIf for any d and k, the sum equals n, return YES. \n\nOtherwise, after checking all possible d's, return NO. \n\nBut what about the case where d is not fixed? For example, for some n, there might be multiple d's and k's that could satisfy the equation. \n\nBut the code needs to check all possible d's. \n\nNow, the question is, what is the maximum possible d to check? Let's find the maximum d such that for k=2, the sum is <=1e18. \n\nFor k=2, the sum for d is 2^d -1. \n\nWe need 2^d -1 <=1e18 → 2^d <=1e18 +1 → d <= log2(1e18) ≈ 60. So for d up to 60. So in the code, for each test case, we can loop d from 3 to 60. \n\nBut what about higher d? For example, for k=1, but k must be ≥2. So no. So for d up to 60 is sufficient. \n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nif n == 1 → output NO (since the minimal is 7 for d=3 and k=2)\n\nelse:\n\n   for d in 3 to 60:\n\n      check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n. \n\n      if yes, return YES. \n\n   if none found, return NO. \n\nNow, how to implement the check for each d. \n\nFor each d, we need to find k such that sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i =n. \n\nLet me think about the binary search for k. \n\nThe minimal possible k is 2. The maximum possible k can be found by considering that the sum is at least k^{d-1} (since the sum includes k^{d-1} as the last term). So k^{d-1} ≤n → k ≤ n^{1/(d-1)}. \n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, and d can be up to 60, for d=3, the upper bound is sqrt(n) which is up to 1e9. For d=60, the upper bound is n^(1/59) which is about 1e18^(1/59) ≈ 1e(18/59) ≈ 1e0.3 ≈ 2. So for d=60, the upper bound is small. \n\nSo for binary search, the upper bound can be set as n^(1/(d-1)) + 1. But how to compute that in Python? Well, using integer exponentiation. However, for large exponents, we can use binary search for k. \n\nAlternatively, for binary search, we can set low=2, high= some value. For example, high can be 2, and then we can double it until the sum is larger than n. \n\nBut perhaps it's easier to compute the upper bound as follows. Since sum is 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} ≥k^{d-1} → k ≤n^(1/(d-1)). So for binary search, the upper bound can be set as n^(1/(d-1)) + 1. However, in Python, taking the integer part of n^(1/(d-1)) can be done via exponentiation. But since n can be up to 1e18, and d-1 can be up to 59, this is manageable. \n\nBut for cases where n is small, like n=7 (d=3, k=2), the upper bound is 7^(1/2) ~ 2.64, so high can be 3. \n\nSo for binary search, the steps are:\n\nlow = 2, high = initial_upper (like n^(1/(d-1)) + 1). \n\nBut how to compute the initial_upper? \n\nIn Python, we can compute it as something like:\n\ninitial_upper = int(n ** (1.0/(d-1))) + 2 \n\nBut since floating point operations can be imprecise, perhaps better to use binary search to find the upper bound. Alternatively, we can just set high to 2, and keep doubling until the sum for k=high is larger than n. \n\nBut for the sake of code efficiency, perhaps it's better to use binary search with high as 2, and then doubling until the sum exceeds n. \n\nBut for the code, perhaps the following approach for each d:\n\nlow = 2 \n\nhigh = 2 \n\nwhile compute_sum(high, d) < n:\n\n    high *=2 \n\nOnce we have high such that compute_sum(high, d) >=n, then perform binary search between low and high. \n\nBut how to compute compute_sum(k, d) without overflow? Well, during the computation, we can check if the sum exceeds n. \n\nSo, the code for compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0 \n\n    current_term = 1 \n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current_term \n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return total \n\n        current_term *=k \n\n    return total \n\nBut for this function, if the total is exactly n, then return it, else, if it's larger than n, return something larger. \n\nBut during the binary search, we need to check if for a given k, compute_sum equals n. \n\nSo during the binary search for a given d, for each mid value, compute the sum. If the sum is equal to n, return True. If it's less than n, we need to search higher. If it's greater than n, search lower. \n\nBut during the binary search, the function can return whether the sum is equal, less than, or greater than. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each d in 3 to 60:\n\n   find if there exists a k ≥2 such that compute_sum(k, d) ==n. \n\nSo, the code for each d:\n\nlow = 2 \n\nhigh = 2 \n\nwhile compute_sum(high, d, n) < n:\n\n    high *=2 \n\nOnce high is found, perform binary search between low and high. \n\nBut during the binary search, for mid = (low + high) // 2, compute the sum. \n\nIf compute_sum(mid, d, n) ==n → return True. \n\nIf compute_sum(mid, d, n) <n → need to search higher. \n\nElse → search lower. \n\nBut there's a possibility that even after high is doubled, the compute_sum(high, d, n) is still less than n. But for that, since for k=high, the sum is 1 +k + ... +k^{d-1} ≥k^{d-1} ≥ (high)^{d-1}. But since we are doubling high until the sum exceeds n, but perhaps for some cases, even with high being very large, the sum is still less than n. However, for k approaching infinity, the sum approaches infinity. So eventually, the high will be found. \n\nBut for code purposes, perhaps the loop can run for a limited number of steps. For example, for d=3 and n=1e18, the maximum k is sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. So doubling from 2 to 1e9 would take about 30 steps. Which is acceptable. \n\nOnce the binary search is done, if any d and k is found, return YES. \n\nNow, let's think about edge cases. \n\nFor example, the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n9\n\n1 → output NO\n\n2 → NO\n\n3 → NO\n\n6 → NO\n\n13 → YES (for d=3, k=3: 1 +3 +9=13)\n\n15 → YES (for d=4, k=2: 1+2+4+8=15)\n\n255 → YES (for d=8, k=2: sum 2^8 -1)/(2-1) = 255. So 2^8-1 = 255. So d=8, since sum is 1+2+...+2^7 = 2^8-1 =255. So d=8, which is ≥3. \n\nAnother sample input is 10101 → output YES. \n\nAnother sample is 1e18 → output NO. \n\nNow, for n=1, the answer is NO. \n\nAnother example: n=7 (d=3, k=2 → 1+2+4=7. So output YES. \n\nSo the code needs to check for all possible d from 3 to 60. \n\nNow, let's think about the code. \n\nImplementing this in Python. \n\nBut first, note that for each test case, n can be up to 1e18, but for each d up to 60, the binary search is manageable. \n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nRead t test cases. \n\nFor each n in test cases:\n\n   if n ==1: print NO\n\n   else:\n\n      flag = False \n\n      for d in 3 to 60:\n\n          if check_d(n, d):\n\n              flag = True \n\n              break \n\n      print YES if flag else NO \n\nNow, the function check_d(n, d) returns True if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n. \n\nImplementing check_d(n, d):\n\ndef check_d(n, d):\n\n    # find if there exists k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i =n \n\n    low = 2 \n\n    high = 2 \n\n    # find upper bound \n\n    while compute_sum(high, d, n) < n:\n\n        high *=2 \n\n    # now binary search between low and high \n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2 \n\n        s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n        if s ==n:\n\n            return True \n\n        elif s <n:\n\n            low = mid +1 \n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1 \n\n    return False \n\nBut the compute_sum function needs to be implemented. \n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0 \n\n    current_term = 1 \n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current_term \n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return total \n\n        current_term *=k \n\n    return total \n\nWait, but for example, for d=3 and k=2, compute_sum returns 1+2+4=7. \n\nYes. \n\nBut for cases where the sum is exactly n, returns n. Else, returns a value that is either larger than n or smaller. \n\nBut during the binary search, the code checks for equality. \n\nBut in the code, when compute_sum returns a value greater than n, the binary search will adjust accordingly. \n\nBut what about when the sum is exactly n? For example, when the sum equals n, returns n. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, let's think about the sample input where n=13. For d=3, the code would check for k. \n\nFor d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k². \n\nWe can solve k² +k +1 =13 →k² +k -12=0 →k = [ -1 ± sqrt(1 +48)] /2 → [ -1 +7 ] /2 = 3. So k=3. \n\nSo the code would find this. \n\nAnother example, n=15, d=4. The sum is 1 +k +k² +k³. For k=2, 1+2+4+8=15. So yes. \n\nNow, the code for check_d(15,4) would find k=2. \n\nNow, let's think about the case where d=3 and n=7. \n\nYes, returns True. \n\nNow, what about n=6? For d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k². Let's see possible k=2: sum is 7>6. So no. k=1 is invalid. So no solution. Hence, output is NO. Which matches the sample input. \n\nNow, for the sample input where n=255. For d=8, k=2. The sum is 2^8 -1 = 255. So yes. \n\nNow, the code for d=8 would find k=2. \n\nAnother case: n=15. For d=4, the code would find k=2. \n\nSo the code seems correct. \n\nNow, what about when d is larger than needed? For example, n=7. For d=4, the code would check for possible k. \n\nFor d=4, sum is 1 +k +k² +k³. Let's see for k=1, sum is 4. For k=2, sum is 1+2+4+8=15>7. So no solution. So code returns false. \n\nSo the code would not find any solution for d=4. \n\nNow, what about for d=3 and k=2, sum=7. So code returns true. \n\nNow, the code should handle all these cases. \n\nNow, the code must also handle large exponents. For example, when d=60 and k=2, the sum is 2^60 -1. Which is 1,152,921,504,606,846,975. Which is larger than 1e18. So for n=1e18, the code would check for d up to 60. For d=60, the code would try to find k. \n\nBut for k=2, the sum is 2^60 -1 which is larger than 1e18. So during the binary search, it would find that even for k=2, the sum is larger than n. So the code would return false. \n\nNow, what about n=1e18? The sample input says that for 1e18, the output is NO. \n\nSo the code should correctly return NO. \n\nNow, what about n=255? For d=8, the code would find k=2. \n\nAnother case: n=3. For d=3, the sum is 1 +k +k². Let's see k=1: sum is 3. But k must be ≥2. So no. Hence, output is NO. \n\nNow, the code for n=3 would check all d from 3 to 60. For each d, check if possible. For d=3, the minimal sum is 7. So no. For higher d, the sum is even larger. Hence, returns NO. \n\nNow, the code seems correct. \n\nBut what about when the sum equals n for some d and k, but the d is larger than 3? For example, n=15 can be achieved with d=4 and k=2. \n\nYes. \n\nNow, what about n=31? It can be achieved with d=5 and k=2: 1+2+4+8+16=31. So the code would find this. \n\nSo, the code would check for d=5. For that d, during the binary search, k=2 would be found. \n\nNow, the code seems to handle that. \n\nNow, what about when n is a sum for multiple (d, k) pairs? For example, n=31 can be achieved with d=5 and k=2, but also for d=3 and k=5? Let's check:\n\nFor d=3, sum is 1 +5 +25 =31. Yes. So for n=31, both possibilities exist. \n\nThe code would find this during the check for d=3. \n\nSo, the code would return YES. \n\nNow, the code must check all possible d's. \n\nNow, the code for Python:\n\nImplement the functions as discussed. \n\nBut for handling very large exponents, the compute_sum function must be careful not to overflow. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, but during the computation, the code checks if the total exceeds n and returns early. \n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t. \n\nFor each test case:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n ==1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    flag = False \n\n    for d in range(3, 61):\n\n        # check for this d \n\n        # perform binary search for k \n\n        # first find upper bound \n\n        low = 2 \n\n        high = 2 \n\n        # find high \n\n        while True:\n\n            s = compute_sum(high, d, n)\n\n            if s >=n:\n\n                break \n\n            high *=2 \n\n        # now binary search between low and high \n\n        left = 2 \n\n        right = high \n\n        found = False \n\n        while left <= right:\n\n            mid = (left + right) //2 \n\n            s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n            if s ==n:\n\n                found = True \n\n                break \n\n            elif s <n:\n\n                left = mid +1 \n\n            else:\n\n                right = mid -1 \n\n        if found:\n\n            flag = True \n\n            break \n\n    if flag:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut how to implement compute_sum?\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0 \n\n    current_term = 1 \n\n    for _ in range(d):\n\n        total += current_term \n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return total \n\n        current_term *=k \n\n    return total \n\nBut in Python, this can be implemented as a helper function inside the code. \n\nBut for code efficiency, since t can be up to 1e4, and for each test case, up to 58 d's (from 3 to 60), and for each d, binary search steps, which are O(log(high)), which is acceptable. \n\nBut for very large n (like 1e18), and d=3, the binary search can take up to 30 steps (since high can be up to 1e9). \n\nBut given that t is 1e4, and for each test case, 58 d's, and each d's binary search is O(30) steps, and each step is O(d) steps (for compute_sum), which is O(60) steps. So overall, for t=1e4, total operations are 1e4 * 58 * 30 * 60 = 1e4 * 1e5 = 1e9 operations. Which is too slow. \n\nWait, this may be a problem. Because 1e4 * 5",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a snowflake graph as defined. A snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and we need to check if there exists a valid configuration of vertices for any $ k > 1 $ and depth $ d \\geq 3 $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Snowflake Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding layers of vertices. Each vertex added in a layer connects to $ k $ new vertices in the subsequent layer. The total number of vertices for such a structure can be represented as a geometric series sum $ S = \\frac{k^d - 1}{k - 1} $, where $ d $ is the depth (number of layers) and $ k $ is the branching factor.\n\n2. **Constraints on Parameters**: For each test case, we need to check if $ n $ can be expressed in the form of the geometric series sum for some $ k \\geq 2 $ and $ d \\geq 3 $. The maximum possible value for $ d $ is determined by the constraint that $ 2^d $ must be less than or equal to $ 10^{18} $, which gives us a practical upper bound of 60 for $ d $.\n\n3. **Binary Search for Valid $ k $**: For each depth $ d $ from 3 to 60, perform a binary search on $ k $ to check if the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $. This involves checking if the sum of the first $ d $ terms of the geometric series with ratio $ k $ equals $ n $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n    total = 0\n    current_term = 1\n    for _ in range(d):\n        total += current_term\n        if total > n:\n            return total\n        current_term *= k\n    return total\n\ndef check(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    for d in range(3, 61):\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find upper bound\n        while True:\n            s = compute_sum(high, d, n)\n            if s >= n:\n                break\n            high *= 2\n        left = 2\n        right = high\n        found = False\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n            if s == n:\n                found = True\n                break\n            elif s < n:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n        if found:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    for i in range(1, t+1):\n        n = int(input[i])\n        if check(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **compute_sum Function**: This function calculates the sum of the geometric series up to depth $ d $ for a given $ k $, ensuring it does not exceed $ n $ to avoid overflow.\n- **check Function**: For each depth $ d $ from 3 to 60, it uses binary search to find a valid $ k $ such that the geometric series sum equals $ n $.
