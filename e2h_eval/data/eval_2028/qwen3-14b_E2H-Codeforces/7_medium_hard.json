The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such a graph.\n\nFrom the description, the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) must be connected to k more new vertices. And this process is done at least once. So, the construction is like a tree where each node added in a certain step has exactly k children, but the process is repeated multiple times.\n\nLet me think about the structure. Let's model the number of nodes generated through each step.\n\nThe first step: Start with 1 node. Then add k nodes connected to it. So after step 1, total nodes is 1 + k.\n\nBut then, each of those k nodes (which are leaves) must be connected to k new nodes. So step 2 adds k * k nodes. Now the total is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that this step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) should be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we do this once. For example, for k=4, the minimal snowflake would have 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 +4 +16 = 21 nodes? But the example input shows that for n=13, the answer is YES. Hmm, maybe my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait the example input says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Let's see. Let's think of possible k and steps.\n\nLet me think again. The construction process:\n\nThe snowflake is built as follows:\n\n- Start with 1 node (level 0).\n- Then, add k nodes connected to it (level 1). Now total nodes is 1 + k.\n- Then, for each node that is a leaf (i.e., has degree 1), connect them to k new nodes. This step must be done at least once. So, after the first step, the leaves are the level 1 nodes. So when we perform this step once, each of those k nodes gets k new children. So adding k * k nodes. Now total is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut maybe there are more steps. For example, after that, the leaves are the nodes added in the second step. So if we do another iteration, they each get k new children. So the total would be 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on.\n\nSo the snowflake can be constructed with m levels, where m ≥ 2. Because the first step (adding level 1) is required, and then the second step (adding level 2) is required at least once. Wait, the problem says that the step of connecting each leaf (those that are connected to only one other node) to k new nodes must be done at least once. So the minimal construction is two steps: initial step (level 1) and then one more step (level 2). So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut what about for higher steps? For example, if you do three steps: 1 +k +k² +k³. Or even more steps.\n\nSo for a given n, we need to check if there exists some integer k>1 and some integer m ≥ 2 such that n equals 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m. Because each step adds another level of k nodes multiplied by the previous level's count.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then each step adds k times the number of leaves from the previous step. Let me think again:\n\nThe initial node is level 0. Then level 1 has k nodes. Each of those is a leaf. Then, each of those is connected to k nodes, which becomes level 2. So level 2 has k *k nodes. Then, each of those level 2 nodes is a leaf. So next step would add k *k *k nodes. So the total nodes after m steps (where m is the number of steps beyond the initial step) would be 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m} ?\n\nWait, the initial step is step 0? Or perhaps the steps are as follows:\n\nThe first step (after the initial node) is adding k nodes (so step 1). Then, step 2 adds k^2 nodes. Step 3 adds k^3 nodes, etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2. Because the step must be done at least once. Wait, the initial step (adding k nodes) is required, and then the next step (adding k^2 nodes) must be done once. So m is the number of steps. So for m steps, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m? No. Because the initial node is 1, then step 1 adds k nodes (total 1 +k), step 2 adds k^2 (total 1 +k +k²), etc. So the total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i. But the problem says that the step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal m is 2? Because the first step is adding k nodes (step 1), and then step 2 is adding k² nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k². So m is the number of steps, which must be ≥ 2. Therefore, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k² + ... +k^m where m ≥ 2. Or perhaps m is the number of times the step is done. Let me re-express:\n\nThe construction process:\n\nStart with 1 node.\n\nStep 1: add k nodes connected to the root. Now, the total is 1 +k.\n\nThen, for each leaf (the k nodes added in step 1), add k nodes. So step 2 adds k *k nodes. Total is 1 +k +k².\n\nThen, for each leaf (the k² nodes added in step 2), add k nodes. So step 3 adds k^3 nodes. Total is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2. Because step 2 must be done at least once (so m ≥ 2 steps? Or m is the number of steps after the initial step?)\n\nWait, the problem says that the step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding the first k nodes) is required. Then, the step of adding k new nodes to each leaf (the ones from the first step) must be done at least once. So the minimal number of steps is 2 steps (initial step plus one more step). So the total number of nodes would be 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for any valid n, it must be equal to 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2 and k ≥ 2. Wait, but m can be larger than 2. For example, if m is 3, then the total is 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2 and k ≥ 2.\n\nAlternatively, the sum 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m is equal to (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k - 1) - 1 + 1? Wait, the formula for the sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). So the sum from i=1 to m is (sum from 0 to m) minus 1. Which is (k^{m+1}-1)/(k-1) - 1. But our total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i. Wait, no. Wait, the initial node is 1. Then sum from i=1 to m of k^i. So the total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i = sum_{i=0}^m k^i. Which equals (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the total number of nodes is S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m ≥ 1. Wait, because for m=1, the sum is 1 +k. Which would be (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = (k-1)(k+1)/(k-1) ) = k+1. So yes. But according to the problem's rules, the step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) must be done at least once. Which corresponds to m ≥ 2 steps? Or m ≥ 1?\n\nWait, let's re-examine. The initial step (adding k nodes) is part of the construction. Then, the step of adding k new nodes to each leaf (those that are connected to only one other node) must be done at least once. So the initial step is required. Then, the next step is required once. So for the sum, the minimal case is when m is 2 steps. Because:\n\nOriginal node (1) + step 1 (k) + step 2 (k^2). Which is 1 +k +k² = sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. Which would correspond to m being 2. So the formula S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) with m ≥ 2?\n\nNo, because when m=2, the formula gives (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k² +k +1. Which is correct. So the problem requires that m ≥ 2? Because the step must be done at least once. So the original step (adding k nodes) is the first step, and then the second step (adding k^2) is the required one. So the total is for m=2 steps (steps 1 and 2), which gives S = (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1.\n\nBut according to the example input:\n\nIn the sample input, for n=13, the answer is YES. Let's see. Let's check if 13 can be written as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some k≥2 and m≥2.\n\nLet's try m=2. Then the formula is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k² +k +1. So solving k² +k +1 =13 → k² +k -12=0. The discriminant is 1 +48=49. sqrt(49)=7. So k = [-1 ±7]/2. Positive solution is (6)/2=3. So k=3. So yes. So 3^2 +3 +1= 9+3+1=13. So that works. Hence, the answer is YES.\n\nAnother example: n=6. The output is NO. Let's check. For m=2, k^2 +k +1 =6 →k² +k -5=0. Discriminant is 1 +20=21. sqrt(21) is not integer. So no integer k. What about m=1? Then S would be (k^2-1)/(k-1) =k+1. So for m=1, S=k+1. But according to the problem's rules, m must be ≥2. So for n=6, can't be achieved with m=2. Are there other possibilities?\n\nWhat about m=3. Let's see. For m=3, the formula is (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k² +k +1. So for n=6, solving k^3 +k² +k +1 =6 →k^3 +k² +k -5=0. Trying k=1: 1+1+1-5=-2. k=2: 8+4+2-5=9≠0. So no solution. So no.\n\nHence, n=6 is not possible. Which matches the sample input's output.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if there exists integers k≥2 and m≥2 such that n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut how do we check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nFirst, note that for each possible k ≥2, we can check for possible exponents m ≥2. However, since n can be up to 1e18, trying all possible k and m is not feasible unless we find a smart way.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible k ≥2, find if there exists m ≥2 such that (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n. But since k can be up to sqrt(n) or something, perhaps we can iterate over possible k's and check for each whether there exists an m.\n\nBut how to find for a given k, whether there exists m ≥2 such that the equation holds.\n\nLet me rephrase the equation:\n\nn = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m ≥2.\n\nWhich is the same as n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut for each k ≥2, we can compute for various m ≥2 whether this equals n.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor a fixed k, the sum increases exponentially with m. So for each k, we can compute the sum until it exceeds n. For example, for k=2, the sum for m=2 is 1 +2 + 4 =7. For m=3, 1+2+4+8=15, etc. So for each k, we can compute the sum until it's larger than n. If during this process, the sum equals n, then return yes.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 1e18, and t can be up to 1e4, this approach may be feasible if the number of possible k's is small.\n\nBut how many possible k's do we need to check?\n\nFor a given n, the minimal possible value of k is 2. The maximum possible k can be found as follows: For m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k² =n. So k^2 +k +1 =n. So k^2 ~n →k ~sqrt(n). So for each n, the possible k's are up to sqrt(n). But since n can be up to 1e18, sqrt(n) is up to 1e9, which is way too big for t=1e4 test cases.\n\nThis approach would be O(t * sqrt(n)), which is not feasible for 1e4 * 1e9 operations.\n\nWe need a better way.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible m ≥2, check if there exists a k ≥2 such that n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo for each possible m, we can check if there exists a k ≥2 such that this equation holds.\n\nBut what values of m do we need to consider?\n\nSince for m ≥2, and k ≥2, the minimal sum is when m=2, k=2: 1 +2 +4 =7. So for n <7, the answer is no. Which matches the sample input where for n=1, 2,3,6 the answer is no.\n\nNow, for a given m, the equation is:\n\nn = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) → which can be rewritten as:\n\nn = 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m.\n\nBut solving this for k is challenging. However, for each m, we can binary search k in the range [2, ... , upper_bound] to see if there's a k that satisfies the equation.\n\nThe question is, for which m values do we need to check?\n\nWell, for a given n, the maximum possible m is log_2(n). Because for k=2, the sum for m steps is 2^{m+1} -1. So m+1 can be up to log2(n +1). For example, if n=1e18, m can be up to around 60.\n\nSo for each test case, we can iterate m from 2 up to say 60, and for each m, perform a binary search on k to see if there's a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nThis seems feasible.\n\nLet me think about the steps for a given n:\n\nFor each m in 2 to max_m (like 60):\n\n   compute the sum s = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\n   We need to check if there exists a k ≥2 such that this equals n.\n\n   How to find k for given m and n?\n\n   For a fixed m, the function f(k) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing in k ≥2. Because as k increases, the sum increases. So for each m, we can binary search k in the range [2, ... , upper_k], where upper_k can be determined.\n\n   For example, for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k² =n →k² +k +1 =n →k² +k =n-1 →k^2 ~n →k_max can be up to sqrt(n).\n\n   So for each m, binary search k in [2, ... , upper_k], and check if the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and m without overflow?\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, and m is up to 60, for each k and m, the sum can be calculated as follows:\n\nsum = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut when k=1, the denominator is zero. However, since k≥2, this is okay.\n\nBut calculating k^{m+1} could be up to (1e18)^(60) which is way beyond 1e18. However, since we are comparing to n, which is up to 1e18, we can compute the sum incrementally and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nAlternatively, for a given k and m, we can compute the sum as follows:\n\nInitialize sum = 0.\n\ncurrent_term = 1 (k^0)\n\nfor i in 0 to m:\n\n   sum += current_term\n\n   current_term *=k\n\nBut this would be for sum = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. Which is exactly what we need.\n\nBut for m up to 60, and k up to ... let's see, for example, for m=2 and n=1e18, the maximum k would be sqrt(1e18) = 1e9, which is manageable for binary search steps.\n\nBut for each m, the binary search would take O(log (upper_k)) steps. And for each step, the sum calculation is O(m) steps. Since m is up to 60, this is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n <7 → answer is NO (since for m=2 and k=2, sum is 7).\n\n   else:\n\n      for m in 2 to 60:\n\n         perform binary search on k ≥2 to see if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\n         if found, return YES.\n\n      if none found, return NO.\n\nBut how to handle the case where m can be larger than 60? Well, for m=60, the minimal sum is when k=2: sum is 2^61-1/(2-1) = 2^61-1 ≈ 2e18. Which is larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, m can't be larger than 60. Because for m=60, even with k=2, the sum is already 2^61-1 which is 2,251,799,813,685,247,752 which is larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, m can be up to 59.\n\nSo the maximum m to check is 60 (or maybe 60).\n\nSo for each test case, we can iterate m from 2 to 60, and for each m, perform binary search for k.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement a function that, given m and n, checks if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to perform the binary search:\n\nFor a given m, the sum as a function of k is strictly increasing. So for binary search, we can find the minimal and maximal possible k.\n\nThe minimal k is 2. The upper bound for k can be determined as follows: for a given m, the sum for k is S(k) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. For k ≥2, S(k) increases with k. So for the upper bound, we can find a k such that S(k) >n. For example, start with k=2, and keep multiplying by 2 until S(k) exceeds n. But this can be done in binary search.\n\nAlternatively, for binary search, the upper bound can be set as n. Because for m ≥2, and k ≥2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m ≥ 1 +k +k² ≥ 1+2+4=7. For k ≥2, the sum is at least 7, but for a given n, the maximum possible k for a given m is such that k^m ≤n. So for example, k can be up to n^(1/m). But for binary search, we can set the upper bound as n, since for k ≥n, the sum would be larger than n.\n\nBut for binary search, we can set low=2 and high= some value. Let's proceed.\n\nSo for each m:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = ?\n\nWe can set high to be 2, and while the sum for k=high is less than n, multiply high by 2. Once we have a high where sum >=n, then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for a given k and m?\n\nImplement a helper function that, given k and m, returns the sum. But since m can be up to 60, and k can be up to 1e9 (for example), the sum can be calculated as follows:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(m+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        current *=k\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n    return total\n\nBut wait, for m steps, the loop runs m+1 times (from 0 to m). So for m=2, it's 3 terms: 1, k, k^2.\n\nBut in the code, for a given k and m, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. So the helper function returns this sum. However, for large k and m, this can overflow. But since in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, this is not a problem. However, for performance, we need to check early if the sum exceeds n, and return early.\n\nBut given that m is up to 60, even for k=1e9, the sum would be 1 +1e9 + ... +1e9^60, which is way larger than n (up to 1e18). So during the computation, once the sum exceeds n, we can break and return infinity.\n\nSo in the helper function, during the loop, if the total exceeds n, return something larger than n.\n\nOnce the helper function is implemented, for each m, perform a binary search for k in [low, high], where low is 2, and high is determined by doubling until compute_sum(high, m) >=n.\n\nOnce the binary search is done, check if there exists a k such that compute_sum(k, m) ==n.\n\nNow, the steps for each test case:\n\nCheck if n is 1, 2, 3, 6, etc. For example, for n=1, the answer is no. Because the minimal snowflake is 1 +k +k^2. For k=2, m=2, sum is 7. So for n <7, answer is no.\n\nSo for each test case:\n\nif n <7 → output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for m in 2 to 60:\n\n      perform binary search on k to see if there's a k ≥2 such that compute_sum(k, m) ==n.\n\n      if yes → return YES.\n\n   after checking all m, if none found → return NO.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nTest case 1: n=1 → output NO.\n\nTest case 2: n=2 → NO.\n\nTest case 3: n=3 → NO.\n\nTest case 4: n=6 → NO.\n\nTest case 5: n=13 → YES (as discussed earlier).\n\nLet's see for m=2:\n\ncompute_sum(k, 2) = 1 +k +k². For k=3, 1+3+9=13 → yes.\n\nSo during the binary search for m=2, we'll find k=3.\n\nAnother sample input is n=15. Output is YES. Let's see:\n\nFor m=2, 1 +k +k² =15 →k² +k -14=0. Discriminant 1 +56=57. Not square. So no.\n\nFor m=3, sum is 1 +k +k² +k³. Let's see for k=2: 1+2+4+8=15. Yes! So m=3, k=2. So yes.\n\nSo during the code, for m=3, the code will find k=2.\n\nAnother sample input is 255. Output is YES.\n\nLet me see. For example, 255 is 2^8 -1. So 2^8-1 = 255. Let's see for m=7, sum is 1 +2 + ... +2^7 = (2^8 -1)/(2-1) = 255. So m=7, k=2. So yes.\n\nAnother sample input: 10101 → output YES. Let's think. Maybe for m=2, k= 100? Let's see 1 +100 + 100^2 = 1+100 +10000= 10101. Yes! So m=2, k=100. So yes.\n\nAnother sample input is 1e18 → output NO. Let's see why. For example, for m=2, 1 +k +k² = 1e18 →k² +k +1 =1e18. Solving for k, approximate k is sqrt(1e18) =1e9. Let's check k= 999999999. Then k² is ~ 1e18. But adding k and 1 would be negligible. So perhaps there's a k for m=2. But maybe not. However, the code would check for all possible m and k.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output for 1e18 is NO. So the code must not find any k and m for that case.\n\nSo the code approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement the helper function compute_sum(k, m, n) which returns the sum, and stops early if it exceeds n.\n\nBut in Python, for each k and m, we can compute the sum as follows:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(m + 1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return n + 1  # something larger than n\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nBut note that for m steps, the loop runs m+1 times. So for m=2, the loop runs 3 times (terms 1, k, k^2).\n\nNow, for each test case:\n\nRead n.\n\nif n <7 → print NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for m in 2 to 60:\n\n      perform binary search for k in [2, ... ].\n\n      find if there's a k such that compute_sum(k, m, n) ==n.\n\n      if found, return YES.\n\n   after all m, return NO.\n\nNow, the binary search for a given m:\n\nWe need to find if there exists a k ≥2 such that compute_sum(k, m, n) ==n.\n\nBut since compute_sum is increasing with k, we can perform binary search between low=2 and high= some upper limit.\n\nTo find the upper limit for high, we can start with high=2, and double until compute_sum(high, m, n) >=n.\n\nOnce we have the low and high, perform binary search.\n\nLet me code this logic.\n\nFor example, in code:\n\nfor each m in 2..max_m:\n\n    low = 2\n\n    high = 2\n\n    while compute_sum(high, m, n) < n:\n\n        high *=2\n\n    # Now, binary search between low and high.\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n\n        if s ==n:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif s <n:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    # after binary search, check if found.\n\nBut in code, for each m, we have to perform this.\n\nBut what if during the compute_sum, the sum overflows? But since in Python, integers are arbitrary precision, no problem.\n\nNow, the code can be structured as follows.\n\nBut first, for the test case n=1, etc.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut note that for m up to 60, and for each m, the binary search is O(log(high)), which for high up to say 1e9 would be manageable.\n\nBut for some cases, the high can be very large. For example, for m=2 and n=1e18, the k is about sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. So the doubling steps would take log2(1e9) steps, which is about 30 steps. For each m, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n <7:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        continue\n\n    found = False\n\n    for m in range(2, 61):\n\n        # perform binary search for k\n\n        low = 2\n\n        high = 2\n\n        # find upper bound\n\n        while True:\n\n            s = compute_sum(high, m, n)\n\n            if s >=n:\n\n                break\n\n            high *=2\n\n        # now binary search between low and high\n\n        left = 2\n\n        right = high\n\n        while left <= right:\n\n            mid = (left + right) //2\n\n            s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n\n            if s ==n:\n\n                found = True\n\n                break\n\n            elif s <n:\n\n                left = mid +1\n\n            else:\n\n                right = mid -1\n\n        if found:\n\n            break\n\n    if found:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut need to implement compute_sum.\n\nBut note that for the compute_sum function, when m is up to 60, and k is up to high, which for n=1e18 and m=2 is 1e9, the loop runs 61 times (for m=60, m+1=61 steps). So for each compute_sum call, it's O(60) steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut for very large m and k, the sum could be huge, but the code checks if the sum exceeds n and returns early.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut also, note that in the code, for each m, after finding that there's a possible k, we can immediately return \"YES\".\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample input for n=13:\n\nm=2:\n\nbinary search for k.\n\nInitially, high=2. compute_sum(2, 2, 13) is 1+2+4=7 <13. So high doubles to 4.\n\ncompute_sum(4, 2, 13) is 1+4+16=21>13. So binary search between 2 and 4.\n\nmid=(2+4)//2=3. compute_sum(3, 2, 13) is 1+3+9=13 → yes. So found.\n\nThus, returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=15. For m=3:\n\ncompute_sum(2, 3, 15) is 1+2+4+8=15 → yes.\n\nSo code would find this.\n\nAnother sample input is n=255. For m=7, k=2:\n\nsum is 1+2+4+...+2^7= 2^8-1=255.\n\nSo code would find this.\n\nAnother sample input is 1000000000000000000 (1e18). The code would check for all m from 2 to 60. Let's see if any of them can find a k.\n\nFor example, for m=2, the equation is 1 +k +k² =n. Let's solve for k.\n\nk² +k +1 =1e18 →k² +k = 1e18 -1. Approximate k is sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. Let's compute k= 999999999:\n\nk² = (1e9 -1)^2 = 1e18 - 2e9 +1. Adding k gives 1e18 -2e9 +1 + 1e9 -1 = 1e18 -1e9. Which is less than 1e18-1. So k² +k = 1e18 -1e9 < 1e18 -1. So need a larger k. Let's try k= 1e9.\n\nk=1e9 →k² +k +1 = 1e18 + 1e9 +1. Which is larger than 1e18. So the solution for m=2 is between 999,999,999 and 1e9. But since k must be integer, there's no solution here. Hence, for m=2, no solution.\n\nSimilarly for other m's. So code would return NO for 1e18.\n\nNow, the code seems correct. Let's think about edge cases.\n\nAnother test case: n=7. For m=2, k=2: 1+2+4=7. So answer is YES.\n\nAnother case: n=15. As discussed.\n\nWhat about n= 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m where m=2 and k=2 → 7, m=2 and k=3 →13, m=3 and k=2 →15, m=3 and k=3 → 1+3+9+27=40.\n\nSo code would handle these.\n\nNow, implement the code.\n\nBut in Python, for the compute_sum function, we can code it as follows:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(m + 1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return n + 1\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nBut in Python, for each m and k, this is called.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t, then for each test case.\n\nBut for handling very large numbers, the code should be efficient. Let's proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t.\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    if n <7:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        continue\n\n    found = False\n\n    for m in range(2, 61):\n\n        # find for this m if possible\n\n        low = 2\n\n        high = 2\n\n        # find upper bound for high\n\n        while True:\n\n            s = compute_sum(high, m, n)\n\n            if s >=n:\n\n                break\n\n            high *=2\n\n        # binary search between low and high\n\n        left = 2\n\n        right = high\n\n        while left <= right:\n\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n\n            s",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem constraints. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and we need to check if there exists any valid configuration of $ k $ (where $ k > 1 $) and depth $ m $ (where $ m \\geq 2 $) such that the total number of vertices equals $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex and each subsequent level adds $ k $ new vertices to each leaf node from the previous level. The total number of vertices after $ m $ levels can be represented as the sum of a geometric series: $ 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m $.\n\n2. **Geometric Series Formula**: The sum of the geometric series $ 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^m $ can be written as $ \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} $. We need to check if this sum equals the given $ n $ for some $ k \\geq 2 $ and $ m \\geq 2 $.\n\n3. **Efficient Search**: For each possible depth $ m $ (from 2 to 60, since $ k=2 $ and $ m=60 $ gives a very large number exceeding $ 10^{18} $), perform a binary search on $ k $ to check if the sum equals $ n $.\n\n4. **Early Termination**: If for any valid $ m $ and $ k $, the sum matches $ n $, we immediately return \"YES\". If no such configuration is found after checking all possible values, we return \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(m + 1):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return n + 1\n        current *= k\n    return total\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    for m in range(2, 61):\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find upper bound for high\n        while True:\n            s = compute_sum(high, m, n)\n            if s >= n:\n                break\n            high *= 2\n        # Binary search between low and high\n        left = 2\n        right = high\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, m, n)\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n    return False\n\nt = int(input())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input())\n    if is_possible(n):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **compute_sum Function**: This function calculates the sum of the geometric series up to $ m $ levels for a given $ k $. It stops early if the sum exceeds $ n $ to avoid unnecessary computations.\n\n2. **is_possible Function**: This function checks for each possible depth $ m $ (from 2 to 60) if there exists a $ k $ such that the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $. It uses binary search to efficiently find the appropriate $ k $ for each $ m $.\n\n3. **Main Execution**: The main part reads the input, processes each test case, and uses the `is_possible` function to determine if a valid snowflake graph can be formed with the given number of vertices $ n $.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all potential configurations without iterating through all possible values of $ k $ and $ m $ directly, leveraging mathematical properties and binary search for performance.",
