    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements. So, the goal is to figure out which element to remove so that this difference is as small as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach. The initial idea is that the instability of the array after removing one element depends on which element we remove. For example, if the array is sorted, maybe removing the first or last element would help reduce the instability.\n\nWait, but how do I efficiently check all possibilities? Because for each element, I need to calculate the max and min of the remaining elements. But doing that naively for each element would take O(n^2) time, which isn't feasible for n up to 1e5.\n\nSo I need a smarter way. Let's think about the sorted array. If the array is sorted, then the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. When you remove an element, the new instability would be the max of the remaining elements minus the min of the remaining elements. But if the array is sorted, then removing elements from the ends might affect the max or min.\n\nFor example, if the array is sorted, then:\n\nIf I remove the first element, the new min is a[1], and the max is a[-1]. The instability is a[-1] - a[1].\n\nIf I remove the last element, the instability is a[-2] - a[0].\n\nBut what if I remove an element in the middle? Then the max and min remain the same as the original array. Wait, no. If the array is sorted, and you remove any element except the first or last, then the max and min are still a[0] and a[-1], so the instability remains the same. Therefore, the only candidates for the optimal removal are the first and last elements. Because removing any other element doesn't change the max and min, so the instability remains the same as the original array.\n\nWait, but that's only if the array is sorted. So perhaps the optimal solution is to sort the array, and then check for each possible element to remove, but considering that only the first and last elements can influence the instability.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose the array is sorted. The original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. Now, if I remove one element, the new instability could be:\n\nIf I remove the first element, then the new instability is a[-1] - a[1].\n\nIf I remove the last element, it's a[-2] - a[0].\n\nIf I remove any other element, say the k-th element (where 1 < k < n-1), then the max and min are still a[-1] and a[0], so the instability remains a[-1] - a[0].\n\nTherefore, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]). But wait, what if there are multiple elements with the same value?\n\nFor example, consider the array [1,3,3,7]. When sorted, it's [1,3,3,7]. If we remove the 7, the instability is 3-1=2. If we remove the first element (1), then the instability is 7-3=4. If we remove one of the 3s, then the array becomes [1,3,7], which has instability 6, which is worse than removing 7. So in this case, the best is to remove the 7, which gives the instability of 2. Which is the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1] = 7-3=4) and (a[-2] - a[0] =3-1=2). So the answer is 2.\n\nSo according to this, the minimal instability is the minimum between the two possibilities: removing the first element (so the new min is a[1], max remains a[-1]), or removing the last element (so the new max is a[-2], min remains a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The original instability is 4. If I remove the first element, the instability is 4-2=2. If I remove the last element, it's 3-1=2. So the answer is 2. Which is better than keeping the original instability of 4. So this approach seems to work.\n\nBut what about if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Then the original instability is 5. If I remove the first element, the instability is 5 (6-2=4?), wait wait. Wait, original array is [1,2,3,4,5,6]. Remove first element, the array is [2,3,4,5,6], instability is 6-2=4. Remove last element, array is [1,2,3,4,5], instability is 4. So the minimum is 4. Which is better than original instability of 5.\n\nSo the conclusion is that when the array is sorted, the minimal instability after removing one element is the minimum between (max of the array minus the second min) and (second max minus the min). Because removing the first element gives us the second min as the new min, and the max remains. Removing the last element gives us the second max as the new max, and the min remains.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what if the array has only two elements? Like the second example in the problem statement: input is 2 elements, 1 and 100000. When sorted, removing either element gives the other element, so instability is 0. Which is the min between (a[-1] - a[1] = 100000 - 1 (but a[1] is 100000, since n=2, a[-1] is 100000, a[1] is 100000. So a[-1] - a[1] is 0. Similarly a[-2] - a[0] is 1 - 1 = 0. So the answer is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo for n=2, the answer is always 0, because after removing one element, the array has one element, so the instability is zero.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nIf n == 2, then the answer is 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but why not consider other possibilities? Like, for example, if there are multiple elements that are the same. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 3, 3, 7]. Then removing the first element gives a[-1] - a[1] = 7 - 3 = 4. Removing the last element gives a[-2] - a[0] = 3 - 1 = 2. But if you remove one of the middle 3s, the instability is 7-1=6. So the best is to remove the last element. So the approach is correct.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 3, 4]. The options are:\n\nRemove first element: instability is 4-2=2.\n\nRemove last element: 3-1=2.\n\nSo the answer is 2.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 1, 1, 1]. Then the answer is 0, because no matter which element you remove, the instability is 0.\n\nSo the approach of checking the two possibilities (removing first or last element) works.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\nSort the array.\n\nIf n == 2, return 0.\n\nElse, compute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nWait, but why not check other possibilities? For example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 4, 5]. Original instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 2, the array is [1,4,5], instability 4. If we remove 4, the array is [1,2,5], instability 4. So the answer is 4. However, according to our approach, the minimum between (5 - a[1] = 5-2=3) and (a[-2] - a[0] = 4-1=3). So the answer would be 3. But that's not possible. Wait, what's the actual scenario here?\n\nWait, the array is [1,2,4,5]. So when sorted, the options are:\n\nIf we remove the first element (1), the array is [2,4,5], instability is 5-2=3.\n\nIf we remove the last element (5), the array is [1,2,4], instability is 4-1=3.\n\nSo the answer would be 3. But according to the previous example where I thought of removing 2 or 4, which gives instability 4. But in this case, the minimal is 3. So our approach is correct. So the answer would be 3. Which is better than removing any other element. So the approach is correct.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum between the two options: removing the first element or the last element. Because when you remove any other element, the instability remains the same as the original array. So the minimal possible is the minimum between those two options.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nSort the array.\n\nIf n == 2: return 0.\n\nElse, compute min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] )\n\nBut wait, what if the array is [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]. Then the original instability is 6. If we remove 7, the instability is 4-1=3. If we remove 1, the instability is 7-3=4. So the minimal is 3. Which is a[-1] - a[1] (7 - 3 =4?), wait no. Wait the array is sorted as [1,3,4,5,7]. So a[-1] is 7, a[1] is 3. So 7-3=4. But the actual instability after removing 7 is 5-1=4. So why is that?\n\nAh, because when you remove the last element, the new array is [1,3,4,5], so instability is 5-1=4. But according to the approach, the a[-2] is 5, a[0] is 1. So 5-1=4. Which is correct. So the min between 4 and 4 is 4. But in this case, the minimal instability is 4, but if you remove 1, the instability is 7-3=4. So the code returns 4, which is correct.\n\nBut what if there's a scenario where removing an element in the middle gives a better result? For example, let's say the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Original instability is 5. If you remove 3, the array is [1,2,4,5,6], instability is 5. If you remove 2, the array is [1,3,4,5,6], instability is 5. So no improvement. But according to the approach, the min between (6 - 2) =4 and (5 -1)=4. So the answer is 4, which is correct.\n\nSo the approach works. Thus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it. If n is 2, output 0. Else, compute the minimum between (last element - second element) and (second last element - first element).\n\nWait, but why is that? Because when you remove the first element, the new array's min is a[1], and max is a[-1]. So the instability is a[-1] - a[1]. Similarly, when you remove the last element, the instability is a[-2] - a[0]. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]).\n\nBut wait, what about when n is larger than 2, but after removing some element in the middle, the instability is even smaller? For example, suppose the array is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. If you remove 5, the instability is 7-1=6. But if you remove the first element, the instability is 9-3=6. If you remove the last element, it's 7-1=6. But the original instability is 8. So the minimal is 6. Which is the same as the approach.\n\nAnother example: [1, 2, 5, 6, 7]. If you remove 5, the instability is 7-1=6. But if you remove the first element, the instability is 7-2=5. If you remove the last element, it's 6-1=5. So the answer is 5. Which is the minimum between (7-2=5) and (6-1=5). So the code works.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Then removing the first element gives 7-4=3. Removing the last element gives 6-1=5. So the minimum is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n, then list a. Sort a. If n == 2, print 0. Else, compute min( a[-1] - a[1], a[-2] - a[0] )\n\nWait, but what about when n is 3?\n\nLike, for example, n=3, array [1, 2, 100]. The options are:\n\nremove 1 → [2, 100], instability 98.\n\nremove 2 → [1, 100], instability 99.\n\nremove 100 → [1, 2], instability 1.\n\nSo the minimal is 1. According to the code, a[-1] - a[1] = 100 - 2 = 98, a[-2] - a[0] = 2 - 1 = 1. So min(98, 1) is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, [1, 3, 5]. The code would compute min(5-3=2, 3-1=2). So the answer is 2. Which is correct, because removing any of the elements gives instability 2 (if you remove 1, [3,5] → 2; remove 3 → [1,5] → 4; remove 5 → [1,3] → 2. So the minimal is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo now, the code can be written.\n\nNow, for the input:\n\nIn the first example, input is 4 elements [1,3,3,7]. Sorted as [1,3,3,7]. So a[-1] - a[1] is 7-3=4. a[-2] - a[0] is 3-1=2. So min is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSecond example: n=2, [1, 100000], output 0.\n\nSo the code handles these cases.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n from input, then the list of numbers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nIf n == 2: print 0.\n\nElse: compute min between a[-1] - a[1] and a[-2] - a[0].\n\nBut wait, what if n is 3? For example, n=3, the array is [1, 2, 3]. Then the code computes min(3-2=1, 2-1=1) → 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The code returns min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead n from stdin.\n\nThen read the array as list of integers.\n\nSort the array.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 1? Well, according to the input constraints, n is at least 2.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, array [1,3,3,7]. sorted is [1,3,3,7].\n\noption1 = 7 - 3 =4.\n\noption2 = 3 -1=2. min is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=2, array [1, 100000]. Output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 1, 1]. sorted is [1,1,1]. option1 is 1-1=0, option2 is 1-1=0. min is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 2, 3]. min between 3-2=1 and 2-1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. min between 5-2=3 and 4-1=3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]. option1 is 9-3=6, option2 is 7-1=6. min is 6. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nThus, this approach should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently determining the potential minimum and maximum values after removing one element.\n2. **Check Edge Case for n=2**: If the array has only two elements, removing either element results in an array with a single element, hence the instability is zero.\n3. **Evaluate Instability After Removing End Elements**: For arrays with more than two elements, the optimal strategy involves considering the removal of either the first or the last element of the sorted array. This is because removing these elements can potentially reduce the instability by adjusting the maximum or minimum values of the array.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\nif n == 2:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    option1 = a[-1] - a[1]\n    option2 = a[-2] - a[0]\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Array**: By sorting the array, we can easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are crucial for calculating instability.\n- **Handling n=2**: Directly return 0 since removing one element from a two-element array leaves a single element, resulting in zero instability.\n- **Evaluating Options**: After sorting, the instability when removing the first element is calculated as `a[-1] - a[1]` (max remains the last element, min becomes the second element). Similarly, removing the last element results in instability `a[-2] - a[0]` (min remains the first element, max becomes the second last element). The minimum of these two values gives the optimal result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum possible instability in O(n log n) time due to sorting, which is optimal for the given constraints.",
