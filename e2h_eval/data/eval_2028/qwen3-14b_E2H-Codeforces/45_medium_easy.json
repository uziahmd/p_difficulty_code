There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key constraint here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a balanced bracket. But here, the structure isn't fixed. We need to arrange the matches in such a way that the winner plays as many games as possible, following that rule.\n\nLet me look at the examples. For n=3, the output is 2. How does that work? The winner plays two games. Let's see: first, maybe player 1 beats player 2. Then, player 1 can't play against player 3 immediately because player 3 has 0 games, and player 1 has 1. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So they play, and the winner (player 1) has two games. That's allowed. So the maximum is 2.\n\nBut for n=4, the output is 2. Wait, why not 3? Because in a normal knockout, you need 3 games (since 4 players: first two rounds, then final). But according to the note, the answer is 2. Oh right, because the tournament grid is arranged in a way that the winner can't play more than 2 games. Wait, why?\n\nThe note says that for n=4, the maximum is 2. The example explanation says that if you pair (1,2) and (3,4), then the winners play. So the winner would have played two games. But if you arrange it differently, like having the winner play three games? How?\n\nWait, maybe it's impossible. Because for the winner to play three games, they must have played three matches. Let's think: each time they play, they have to have opponents who have played either the same number of games or one less. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a binary tree. Each game is a node, and the winner proceeds. But the constraints on the number of games played by the players when they meet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum number of games the winner can play is the largest k such that the sum of the first k numbers (like Fibonacci?) is less than or equal to n. Wait, maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games. Let's denote f(k) as the minimal number of players needed so that the winner can play k games.\n\nFor example:\n\n- To have 1 game, you need 2 players. So f(1)=2.\n- For 2 games: the winner has to play two matches. Let's think. First, he plays one game (so needs 2 players). Then, for the second game, he needs an opponent who has played either 1 or 0 games. But to get to that point, maybe the opponent has to have played 1 game. So that requires that there's another player who has won once. So the total players would be 2 (for first round) + 1 (the opponent) ? No, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, when the winner plays their second game, they must have an opponent who has played either 1 or 0 games. Suppose the opponent has played 1 game. That means that opponent had to have won one game. So for the second game of the winner, we need another player that has a path of 1 game. So the minimal case would be that the winner's first game is against someone (player A), and then the second game is against someone else (player B) who has already played once. But how does that happen?\n\nLet me think recursively. For the winner to play k games, each time they play, they need to have an opponent that has played either the same number of games as them (but since they are going to play, that's the next step) or one less. \n\nThis feels similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let me think. Let's say that for the winner to play k games, the minimal number of players required is f(k). How is f(k) determined?\n\nFor the first game, the winner plays against someone. So that's 2 players. For the second game, the winner has to have an opponent who has played 1 game (since the winner has already played 1 game). How do we get that opponent? That opponent must have played one game, which implies that they had to have a previous match. So for the second game, the opponent's path requires f(1) players. So the total players for the winner to play 2 games would be f(1) + f(1) = 2+2=4? But that's not matching the example. Because for n=3, the answer is 2. So maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps f(k) is the minimal number of players needed so that the winner can play k games. Then:\n\nTo play k games, the winner must have played k-1 games before the last one. So for the k-th game, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. Wait, but the opponent can't have played more than the winner. So the opponent must have played either k-1 (same as the winner's previous count) or k-2 (one less than the winner's previous count). \n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think of the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games. For the first game, it's 2 players. For the second game, the winner must have an opponent who has played 1 game (since the winner has played 1 game). To get that opponent, you need a subtree where that opponent has played 1 game, which requires 2 players. But then, the total players would be 2 (for the first game) + 2 (for the opponent's subtree) - 1 (since the opponent is part of the total players). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the winner's path requires that each time they play a game, they have an opponent. For the first game, the opponent is someone who hasn't played before. For the second game, the opponent must have played 1 game. So that opponent must have come from a subtree where they played 1 game. So the minimal players for the winner to have two games would be 2 (for the first game) + 1 (the opponent's subtree). Wait, but the opponent's subtree would require 2 players (since to have played one game, that requires two players). So the total players would be 2 (from first game) plus 2 (from the opponent's subtree) minus 1 (since the opponent is part of the players). Hmm, maybe not. Let's think of it as the winner's path requires that for each game, the opponent comes from a subtree. So for the first game, the opponent is one player. For the second game, the opponent is someone who has played one game. So that requires that there's a subtree with that player. So for the second game, the minimal players is f(1) + f(1) ?\n\nWait, maybe f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because, for the winner to play k games, they have to play in the k-th game against someone who has played k-1 games (so that the difference is 0) or k-2 games (difference 1). But to get that opponent, the minimal number of players would be f(k-1) + f(k-2) ?\n\nWait, this sounds like the Fibonacci sequence. Let's check:\n\nf(1) = 2 (needs 2 players)\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0)? Wait, what is f(0)? Maybe f(0) is 1 (the winner has played zero games, but that's just one player). But for f(2), the minimal players would be f(1) + f(1) ?\n\nWait, if the winner has to play two games, then in the first game, they have an opponent (so 2 players). Then, for the second game, the opponent must have played one game. That requires that there's a subtree where that opponent has played one game. Which requires 2 players. So total players would be 2 + 2 - 1 = 3? Because the winner is part of both subtrees. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the case where the winner plays two games. For example, with n=3. The winner plays two games. So the minimal players is 3, which is f(2) = 3. Then, according to the formula f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2), if f(1) is 2, f(2) would be f(1)+f(0). Assuming f(0) is 1, then f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3. Which matches. Then f(3) would be f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5. So for the winner to play 3 games, you need 5 players. Let's see: for n=5, the maximum number of games is 3. Then for n=5, the answer is 3. \n\nLet me test this with the sample input. For example, when n=3, the answer is 2. Which would be the case for k=2, since f(2) is 3. So for n=3, the maximum possible is 2. Which matches the sample. For n=4, the maximum is 2, because f(2) is 3, and f(3) is 5. So 4 is between 3 and 5. So the maximum k is 2. Which matches the sample. For n=5, the answer would be 3. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k such that f(k) ≤ n, where f(k) is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number? Let me think again. Let's compute the values:\n\nLet me define f(k) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games. Then:\n\nf(0) = 1 (no games, just one player)\nf(1) = 2 (two players, one game)\nf(2) = 3 (as in the example)\nf(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5\nf(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 5 + 3 = 8\nf(5) = 8 +5 = 13\nand so on.\n\nSo the sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... which is the Fibonacci sequence starting from f(0)=1, f(1)=2, etc. So the recurrence is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2), with base cases f(0)=1, f(1)=2.\n\nSo the problem becomes, given n, find the maximum k such that f(k) ≤ n.\n\nFor example, when n=2, f(1)=2, so k=1. Which matches the sample. For n=3, f(2)=3, so k=2. For n=4, the next value is f(3)=5>4, so the maximum k is 2. For n=10, f(4)=8 ≤10, f(5)=13>10, so k=4. Which matches the sample input where n=10 gives output 4.\n\nYes! So the approach is to generate the Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n, and find the maximum k where f(k) ≤n.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci numbers in the sequence f(k) as defined above, until the value exceeds 1e18 (since n can be up to 1e18).\n\n2. For a given n, find the maximum k such that f(k) ≤n.\n\nBut how to compute this for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1) = 2\n\nf(2) = 3\n\nf(3) = 5\n\nf(4) = 8\n\nf(5) = 13\n\nf(6) = 21\n\nf(7) = 34\n\nf(8) = 55\n\n...\n\nSo the sequence is the Fibonacci numbers starting from 1, 2, 3, 5, etc. So the k-th term is Fib(k+2) if we take the standard Fibonacci sequence starting with Fib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, etc. Wait, perhaps not. Let me check:\n\nStandard Fibonacci numbers:\n\nFib(0) = 0\n\nFib(1) = 1\n\nFib(2) = 1\n\nFib(3) = 2\n\nFib(4) = 3\n\nFib(5) = 5\n\nFib(6) = 8\n\nFib(7) = 13\n\nFib(8) = 21\n\nFib(9) = 34\n\nSo our f(k) is Fib(k+2) ?\n\nFor example:\n\nk=0: f(0) = 1 = Fib(2) = 1\n\nk=1: f(1)=2 = Fib(3) = 2\n\nk=2: f(2)=3 = Fib(4) = 3\n\nk=3: f(3)=5 = Fib(5) =5\n\nYes. So f(k) = Fib(k+2), where Fib is the standard Fibonacci sequence.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) ≤n.\n\nSo, given n, we need to find the maximum k where Fib(k+2) ≤n.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nWe can precompute the Fib numbers up to the point where Fib(m) exceeds 1e18, then for a given n, find the maximum m such that Fib(m) ≤n. Then subtract 2 to get k.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nWe want to find the maximum k such that Fib(k+2) ≤n. So for example, if Fib(m) is the largest Fib number ≤n, then k is m-2.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nCompute all Fib numbers up to the maximum possible (which is up to 1e18). For example, Fib(85) is about 2.1e17, Fib(86) is 3.4e17, Fib(87) is 5.5e17, Fib(88) is 8.9e17, Fib(89) is 1.44e18, Fib(90) is 2.33e18, etc. So for n up to 1e18, we need to generate Fib numbers up to around Fib(90) or so.\n\nOnce we have that list, for a given n, we can perform a binary search to find the maximum m where Fib(m) <=n. Then the answer is (m-2). However, we need to check if Fib(m) is indeed <=n.\n\nBut wait, let's take the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: n=2. The Fib numbers are:\n\nFib(0)=0, Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, etc.\n\nSo for n=2, the largest Fib(m) <=2 is Fib(3)=2. So m=3. Then k = m-2 =1. Which is correct.\n\nSample Input 2: n=3. Largest Fib(m) is Fib(4)=3. m=4. k=4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4. The Fib numbers are Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5. So largest is Fib(4)=3. m=4, k=2. Which is correct.\n\nSample Input 4: n=10. Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13. So largest is Fib(6)=8. m=6. k=6-2=4. Which matches the sample output of 4.\n\nYes. So the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the list of Fib numbers up to the maximum possible (say, up to 1e18).\n\n- For a given n, find the maximum m where Fib(m) <=n.\n\n- The answer is m-2.\n\nBut how to handle cases where n is not exactly a Fib number? For example, n=4, which is between Fib(4)=3 and Fib(5)=5. So the answer is m=4, which gives k=2.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, generate the Fib numbers. Let's generate them in a list. Start with Fib[0] = 0, Fib[1] =1, and so on. Let's generate until Fib[m] exceeds 1e18.\n\nOnce the list is generated, for a given n, find the largest m where Fib[m] <=n. Then the answer is m-2.\n\nBut how to generate the Fib numbers?\n\nLet's think:\n\nInitialize a list, say fibs = [0, 1]. Then while the next number is <= 1e18, append it.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, let's compute the Fib numbers:\n\nLet me compute the Fib numbers up to Fib(90):\n\nLet me compute Fib(0) =0, Fib(1)=1.\n\nFib(2)=1\n\nFib(3)=2\n\nFib(4)=3\n\nFib(5)=5\n\nFib(6)=8\n\nFib(7)=13\n\nFib(8)=21\n\nFib(9)=34\n\nFib(10)=55\n\nFib(11)=89\n\nFib(12)=144\n\nFib(13)=233\n\nFib(14)=377\n\nFib(15)=610\n\nFib(16)=987\n\nFib(17)=1597\n\nFib(18)=2584\n\nFib(19)=4181\n\nFib(20)=6765\n\nFib(21)=10946\n\nFib(22)=17711\n\nFib(23)=28657\n\nFib(24)=46368\n\nFib(25)=75025\n\nFib(26)=121393\n\nFib(27)=196418\n\nFib(28)=317811\n\nFib(29)=514229\n\nFib(30)=832040\n\nFib(31)=1346269\n\nFib(32)=2178309\n\nFib(33)=3524578\n\nFib(34)=5702887\n\nFib(35)=9227465\n\nFib(36)=14930352\n\nFib(37)=24157817\n\nFib(38)=39088169\n\nFib(39)=63245986\n\nFib(40)=102334155\n\nFib(41)=165580141\n\nFib(42)=267914296\n\nFib(43)=433494437\n\nFib(44)=701408733\n\nFib(45)=1,134,903,170\n\nFib(46)=1,836,311,903\n\nFib(47)=2,971,215,073\n\nFib(48)=4,807,526,976\n\nFib(49)=7,778,742,049\n\nFib(50)=12,586,269,025\n\nFib(51)=20,365,011,074\n\nFib(52)=32,951,280,099\n\nFib(53)=53,316,291,173\n\nFib(54)=86,267,571,272\n\nFib(55)=139,583,862,445\n\nFib(56)=225,851,433,717\n\nFib(57)=365,435,296,162\n\nFib(58)=591,286,729,879\n\nFib(59)=956,722,026,041\n\nFib(60)=1,548,008,755,920\n\nFib(61)=2,504,730,781,961\n\nFib(62)=4,052,739,537,881\n\nFib(63)=6,557,470,319,842\n\nFib(64)=10,610,209,857,723\n\nFib(65)=17,167,680,177,565\n\nFib(66)=27,777,890,035,288\n\nFib(67)=44,945,570,212,853\n\nFib(68)=72,723,460,248,141\n\nFib(69)=117,669,030,460,994\n\nFib(70)=190,392,490,709,135\n\nFib(71)=308,061,521,170,129\n\nFib(72)=498,454,011,879,264\n\nFib(73)=806,515,533,049,393\n\nFib(74)=1,304,969,544,928,657\n\nFib(75)=2,111,485,077,978,050\n\nFib(76)=3,416,454,622,906,707\n\nFib(77)=5,527,939,700,884,757\n\nFib(78)=8,944,394,323,791,464\n\nFib(79)=14,472,334,024,676,221\n\nFib(80)=23,416,728,348,467,685\n\nFib(81)=37,889,062,373,143,906\n\nFib(82)=61,305,790,721,611,591\n\nFib(83)=99,194,853,094,755,497\n\nFib(84)=160,500,643,816,367,088\n\nFib(85)=259,695,496,911,122,585\n\nFib(86)=420,196,140,727,489,673\n\nFib(87)=679,891,637,638,612,258\n\nFib(88)=1,100,087,778,366,101,931\n\nFib(89)=1,779,979,416,004,714,189\n\nFib(90)=2,880,067,194,370,816,120\n\nSo for n=1e18, Fib(89) is 1.779...e18, Fib(90) is 2.88...e18. So for n=1e18, the maximum m is 89, and the answer is 89-2=87.\n\nSo the code needs to generate these Fib numbers up to when they exceed 1e18.\n\nOnce we have this list, for a given n, we can perform a binary search to find the largest m where Fib[m] <=n.\n\nBut how to generate the list? Let's think of generating it in a loop.\n\nNow, in Python, even for big numbers, it's manageable. Let's proceed.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nGenerate the list of Fib numbers as follows:\n\nfib_list = [0, 1]\n\nwhile the next Fib number is <= 1e18:\n\n    append it to fib_list.\n\nOnce the list is generated, find the maximum m such that fib_list[m] <=n.\n\nThen, the answer is m-2.\n\nBut wait, for example, for n=2, the Fib list is [0,1,1,2,3,...]. So the index m is 3 (since Fib[3]=2). So m is 3, answer is 3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nBut for n=3, m is 4 (Fib[4]=3), answer is 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nNow, how to generate the Fib list.\n\nInitialize a and b as 0 and 1. Then, generate the next numbers until they exceed 1e18.\n\nBut in code:\n\nfib = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_num > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nBut in Python, 1e18 is a float, but for integers, we can use 10**18.\n\nBut for n up to 1e18, which is 10^18.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can generate the list as follows.\n\nOnce we have the list, we can perform a binary search to find the maximum m where fib[m] <=n.\n\nBut for n=1, which is not possible here since n starts from 2.\n\nWait, the input n is between 2 and 1e18.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nGenerate the fib list as described.\n\nThen, find the largest m such that fib[m] <=n.\n\nBut how to find this m? Since the list is sorted, we can perform a binary search.\n\nBut in Python, the bisect module can help. For example, using bisect_right.\n\nFor example, using bisect.bisect_right(fib, n) -1.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nSuppose the list is [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...], and n is 3.\n\nbisect_right finds the insertion point after the existing entries of 3. For example, in the list [0,1,1,2,3,5], bisect_right(fib, 3) returns 5 (since the first element after 3 is 5). So the index is 5-1=4, which is the correct m.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfib = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_num > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\n# Now find the largest m where fib[m] <=n\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(fib, n) -1\n\nif index < 2:\n\n    # For example, if n is 1, but n starts from 2.\n\n    # But for n=2, fib is [0,1,1,2, ...]\n\n    # So index is 3, which is 3-2=1.\n\n    # But for index <2, like if n is 0 or 1, but n >=2.\n\n    # So for n=2, the index is 3.\n\n    # So for the given constraints, n is >=2.\n\n    # So in this case, the code will handle.\n\nans = index -2\n\nprint(ans)\n\nWait, but let's check for n=2. The fib list is [0,1,1,2,3,5,...]. bisect_right(fib, 2) returns 4, since the elements are 0,1,1,2,3,5. The bisect_right returns the insertion point after the existing 2. So for example, the list is [0,1,1,2,3,5], and n=2, bisect_right returns 4. Then index is 4-1=3. ans is 3-2=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example, n=3: bisect_right returns 5 (since after 3, which is at index 4, the next element is 5). So index is 5-1=4. ans=4-2=2. Correct.\n\nn=4, the bisect_right returns 5 (since 4 is between 3 and 5). index=5-1=4. ans=4-2=2. Correct.\n\nn=10: the fib list includes 8 (at index 6?), let me check:\n\nfib is [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,...]. So for n=10, bisect_right returns the index where 10 would be inserted. Since 8 is at index 6, and 13 is at index 7. So bisect_right returns 7, index is 7-1=6. ans=6-2=4. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code should work.\n\nBut what about when n is exactly a Fib number?\n\nYes, it's handled correctly.\n\nNow, what about the case when n is 1? Well, according to the problem statement, n starts at 2, so no need to handle it.\n\nBut what about n=2?\n\nYes, handled.\n\nBut let's think about the Fib list generation. Let's make sure that the code generates all the Fib numbers up to 1e18.\n\nBut in Python, 1e18 is a float. So comparing integers to it may be problematic. So better to use 10**18 as an integer.\n\nSo in code, the loop is:\n\nfib = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_num > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nBut for numbers up to 1e18, this is okay.\n\nNow, for the sample input:\n\nSample Input: 2 → Output 1.\n\nSample Input: 3 → Output 2.\n\nSample Input: 4 → Output 2.\n\nSample Input: 10 → Output 4.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let's test for n=5. The Fib list includes 5 as Fib[5] =5. So index is 5, ans=5-2=3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5, the answer is 3. Which is correct.\n\nNow, what about n=6? The largest Fib number <=6 is 5. So index is 5, ans=3. Which is correct, since the maximum number of games is 3.\n\nBut how? Let's think. For n=6, the Fib sequence is 0,1,1,2,3,5,8... So m is 5 (Fib[5]=5). So answer is 5-2=3. So the maximum number of games is 3.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nYes. Let's think: for k=3, the minimal number of players is 5. So for n=6, which is larger than 5, the maximum is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that for n=1, which is not allowed, but the code will handle it. But since the input constraints are n ≥2, it's okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn = int(input())\n\nfib = [0, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n\n    if next_num > 10**18:\n\n        break\n\n    fib.append(next_num)\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(fib, n) - 1\n\nprint(index - 2)\n\nWait, but let's test for n=2. The fib list is [0,1,1,2,3,5, ...].\n\nbisect_right(fib, 2) returns 4 (since the list is [0,1,1,2,3,5...], and the insertion point after the 2 is at index 4. So index is 4-1=3. 3-2=1. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when n is 1? But input n is at least 2.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, check for n=3, the code returns 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, returns 3. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=8, returns 6-2=4? Let's see:\n\nfib list for 8 is Fib[6] =8. So bisect_right finds 8 in the list. Let's say the list is [0,1,1,2,3,5,8, ...]. bisect_right(fib, 8) returns 7 (since the next element is 13). So index is 7-1=6. 6-2=4. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code works.\n\nNow, what about n=1?\n\nBut input is 2 ≤n ≤1e18. So no problem.\n\nBut what if n is 1? Well, the code would return index-2. For example, if n=1, the bisect_right returns 2 (since 1 is found in the list. The list is [0,1,1,2,...]. bisect_right(fib,1) returns 3. index is 3-1=2. 2-2=0. Which is wrong. But n=1 is not allowed.\n\nThus, the code is correct for the given constraints.\n\nSo this should solve the problem.\n\nNow, let's code it.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific constraint on the difference in the number of games played by opponents. The key insight is to recognize that this problem can be reduced to finding the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the given number of players, `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Constraint**: The problem requires that two players can only compete if the difference in the number of games they have already played is at most one. This structure resembles a Fibonacci sequence where each subsequent game requires an increasing number of players.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a Fibonacci-like sequence. Specifically, the `k`-th term in this sequence corresponds to the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number in the standard sequence starting from 0 and 1.\n3. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: Generate all Fibonacci numbers up to a value that exceeds the maximum possible input (10^18) to efficiently check against any input value.\n4. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to quickly find the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the given number of players, `n`, which allows us to determine the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    fib = [0, 1]\n    while True:\n        next_num = fib[-1] + fib[-2]\n        if next_num > 10**18:\n            break\n        fib.append(next_num)\n    index = bisect.bisect_right(fib, n) - 1\n    print(index - 2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate Fibonacci numbers up to a value exceeding 10^18. This ensures we can handle the upper constraint of the input efficiently.\n2. **Binary Search**: Using the `bisect` module, we find the position where the given number of players, `n`, would fit in the precomputed list of Fibonacci numbers. This helps determine the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`.\n3. **Result Calculation**: The maximum number of games the winner can play is derived by adjusting the index of the found Fibonacci number. This adjustment accounts for the offset in the sequence relative to the standard Fibonacci numbers.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and provides the correct result using precomputation and binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n`.",
