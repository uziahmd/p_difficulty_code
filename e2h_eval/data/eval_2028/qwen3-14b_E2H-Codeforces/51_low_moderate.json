Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine all the letters from the guest and host names, the pile should have exactly those letters, no more, no less. So, any extra letters in the pile or missing letters would result in a \"NO\".\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the combined letters of the guest and host names match exactly with the letters in the pile. How to do that?\n\nHmm. One way is to count the frequency of each character in the combined string of guest and host, and compare it with the frequency in the pile. If they are the same, output YES, else NO.\n\nRight. So for each test case, we take the first two lines (guest and host), concatenate them, then check if the count of each character in that concatenated string matches the count in the third line (the pile).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Combine the first two into a single string.\n3. Count the frequency of each character in this combined string.\n4. Count the frequency of each character in the third line.\n5. Compare the two frequency dictionaries. If they are identical, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nWell, in Python, we can use the collections.Counter class. Because Counter is a convenient way to count elements. So for example, Counter(guest + host) would give the counts of each character in the combined string. Similarly for the pile.\n\nBut wait, what about the order? No, since Counter compares the counts, not the order. So if the counts are the same, then the answer is YES.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nRead the three lines as guest, host, pile.\n\nThen:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nif Counter(guest + host) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about cases where the lengths are different? For example, if the combined length of guest and host is different from the pile's length. Because in that case, even if the counts are same, but the total letters are different, but that's impossible. Because if the counts are same, the total length must be same. Because sum of counts for each character in Counter is the total length. So comparing the counts would automatically check the length. So maybe no need to check the length separately.\n\nBut perhaps, for efficiency, but in Python, the Counter comparison would take care of that. So for example, if the combined string is length 5 and the pile is length 6, then the Counter comparison would return false, because the counts would not match.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nBut let me think about some test cases.\n\nTake the first example from the problem:\n\nInput lines:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined guest + host is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count the letters.\n\nBut the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me check the counts.\n\nBut perhaps the code would correctly compare them.\n\nAnother example: the second input in the sample:\n\nPAPAINOEL\nJOULUPUKKI\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined guest + host is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Let's count letters.\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's see:\n\nIn the combined string, the count for 'P' is 2 (from PAPAINOEL). Let's see:\n\nOriginal guest is PAPAINOEL: letters P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L. So P appears twice. Host is JOULUPUKKI: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I. So P appears once. So total P's in combined is 2+1=3.\n\nIn the pile, JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's count P's. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the pile string: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's break it down:\n\nLetters:\n\nJ, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nWait, how many P's? There's two P's here. So the combined has 3 P's, pile has 2. So the counts would differ, leading to output NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code would catch that.\n\nAnother case: the third sample input.\n\nBABBONATALE\nFATHERCHRIST",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door can be rearranged to form the combined names of the guest and the host. This involves checking if the frequency of each letter in the pile matches exactly with the frequency of letters in the combined names of the guest and host.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three lines of input which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Character Counting**: Use a frequency counter to count the occurrences of each character in the combined string of the guest and host names.\n3. **Comparison**: Compare the frequency of characters in the combined string with the frequency of characters in the pile of letters.\n4. **Result Determination**: If both frequency counters match, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the three lines from input\n    guest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    host = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    # Combine guest and host names\n    combined = guest + host\n    \n    # Create counters for both combined and pile\n    combined_counter = Counter(combined)\n    pile_counter = Counter(pile)\n    \n    # Compare the counters\n    if combined_counter == pile_counter:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `sys.stdin.readline()` to ensure we handle each line correctly, stripping any extraneous whitespace or newline characters.\n- **Combining Names**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string to form the combined set of characters that should be present in the pile.\n- **Counting Characters**: Using `collections.Counter`, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile of letters.\n- **Comparison**: By comparing the two counters, we check if the pile contains exactly the same characters in the same frequencies as the combined names. If they match, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of characters required, leveraging Python's built-in data structures for simplicity and performance.",
