The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. Moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement.\n\nLet me think about the approach. Let's consider the sequence of tasks. For each task, she must be at a_i. But since tasks are processed in order, each task depends on the previous ones. So the order of the tasks is fixed as given. But the problem says that she can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, she doesn't need to move between them. So the movement is only between consecutive tasks that are in different houses.\n\nBut how to compute the time between each consecutive pair of tasks?\n\nLet me think. Let's take the first example:\n\nInput is 4 3, and the tasks are 3, 2, 3.\n\nThe path is 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. Let's break down the steps between tasks.\n\nFirst task is 3. She starts at 1. How to get to 3? Since it's clockwise, moving from 1 to 2 to 3. That's 2 steps. Then, second task is 2. From 3 to 2: since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, she has to go from 3 →4 →1 →2. That's 3 steps. Then third task is 3 again. From 2 to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is, for each consecutive pair of tasks (prev and current), compute the time needed to move from prev's position to current's position, considering the ringroad's circular nature.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet's think about the movement between two positions, say from a to b. Since the movement is clockwise, the number of steps is (b - a) mod n if moving forward. Wait, no. Because if a is 3 and b is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - a + b) steps? Let me think.\n\nFor example, n=4. From 3 to 2: moving clockwise, you go 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Which is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4? Let's see: (2 -3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. So yes. So the formula for steps from a to b is (b - a) if b >=a, else (b -a + n). But that's equivalent to (b - a) % n. Wait, but in Python, modulo can be negative. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nIf a is current position, and b is target. The minimal steps moving clockwise is (b - a) if b >= a, else (b - a + n). So that's (b - a) % n if we use modulo. But wait, for example, when a=3, b=2, n=4: (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the steps between a and b is (b - a) % n. But wait, what if a is 1 and b is 1? Then steps is zero. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the problem, the tasks are given as a list. So for each task, we need to track the current position, and accumulate the steps between the previous position and the current task's position.\n\nBut wait, the initial position is 1. So the first task is a_1. The steps from 1 to a_1 is (a_1 - 1) mod n? Or wait, no. Because if a_1 is 3, then steps are 2. Which is (3-1) mod 4 is 2. Correct. If a_1 is 2, steps are 1. So yes.\n\nSo the general approach is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each task in a:\n\n    steps = (current_position to task's position) \n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current_position = task's position\n\nBut how to compute steps? For each step, steps is (task_pos - current_pos) if task_pos >= current_pos, else (task_pos - current_pos + n). Which can be written as (task_pos - current_pos) % n ?\n\nWait, but in Python, modulo can be negative. Let me see:\n\nFor example, (2 - 3) % 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, (task_pos - current_pos) % n gives the correct steps.\n\nBut wait, let's test for some cases:\n\nCase 1: current is 3, task is 2. n=4. (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3. Correct.\n\nCase 2: current is 2, task is 3. (3-2) mod 4 is 1. Correct.\n\nCase 3: current is 1, task is 1. (1-1) mod 4 is 0. Correct.\n\nSo yes. So the formula is (task_pos - current_pos) % n.\n\nBut wait, why not just compute the difference and add n if it's negative? Well, the modulo approach handles that.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntime = 0\n\nfor each ai in the list a:\n\n    delta = (ai - current) % n\n\n    time += delta\n\n    current = ai\n\nreturn time\n\nBut wait, let's check the first example.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) mod 4 is 2. time is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod4 = 3. time becomes 5. current is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1. time becomes 6. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So the code would work.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 3, a is [2,3,3]. Let's see.\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: (2-1) mod4 =1. time=1. current=2.\n\nSecond ai is3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. time=2. current=3.\n\nThird ai is3: (3-3) mod4=0. time remains 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nSo the approach is straightforward. Now, the code needs to read n and m, then read the list of a's. Then process as above.\n\nBut wait, what about the constraints? n and m can be up to 1e5. So the code must be O(m) time, which this approach is.\n\nNow, let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All tasks are in the same house. For example, n=5, m=3, a = [1,1,1]. The total time is 0.\n\nEdge case 2: Tasks require moving around the circle multiple times. For example, n=5, a = [1, 5, 1, 5]. Let's see:\n\nInitial current is 1.\n\nFirst task is 1: 0 steps. current is 1.\n\nSecond task is 5: (5-1) mod5 =4. time is 4. current is 5.\n\nThird task is 1: (1-5) mod5 = ( -4 ) mod5 =1. So time is 4+1=5. current is 1.\n\nFourth task is 5: (5-1) mod5=4. time is 5+4=9. So total is 9.\n\nWhich is correct: 1→5 (4 steps), 5→1 (1 step), 1→5 (4 steps). Total 4+1+4=9.\n\nAnother edge case: when the initial position is 1, and the first task is 1. So no steps.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Time is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Time is (1→2) steps: 1 step. Then (2→2) steps: 0. Total 1.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of m integers a.\n\nInitialize current = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each ai in a:\n\n    delta = (ai - current) % n\n\n    total_time += delta\n\n    current = ai\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operation returns a non-negative result. For example, (-1) %4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nYes, so the code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent =1, time=0.\n\nFirst ai=3: (3-1) mod4= 2 → time=2. current=3.\n\nSecond ai=2: (2-3) mod4= -1 mod4=3 → time=5. current=2.\n\nThird ai=3: (3-2) mod4=1 → time=6. Output 6. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3.\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nFirst ai=2: (2-1) mod4=1 → time=1. current=2.\n\nSecond ai=3: (3-2)=1 → time=2. current=3.\n\nThird ai=3: (3-3)=0 → time remains 2. Output 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that the input is given as two lines. The first line is n and m, the second line is m integers.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings, but in actual code, we need to read from stdin.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen process as above.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n and m:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    total_time += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nWait, but wait, what about the case where the list a is empty? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. Because m is given as 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. So no problem.\n\nBut let's check the case when m is 0? Well, the problem says m is ≥1. So no need to handle that.\n\nYes.\n\nThis code should handle all cases.\n\nLet me test another example.\n\nTest case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2].\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst step: (1-1) mod2 =0 → time 0. current is 1.\n\nSecond step: (2-1) mod2=1 → time 1. So total is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, m=3, a=[5,1,5]. Let's see:\n\ncurrent =1.\n\nFirst ai=5: (5-1) mod5 =4 → time 4. current=5.\n\nSecond ai=1: (1-5) mod5 = ( -4 ) mod5 =1 → time 4+1=5. current=1.\n\nThird ai=5: (5-1) mod5=4 → total 5+4=9. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and needs to move clockwise to complete tasks. Each task must be completed in the specified house, and she can only move to adjacent houses one at a time.\n2. **Circular Movement Calculation**: The time to move from one house to another on a circular road can be computed using modulo arithmetic. For moving from house `current` to house `target`, the time required is `(target - current) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses. This formula handles both clockwise and counter-clockwise movements efficiently.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task in the sequence, compute the time required to move from the current house to the target house of the task, accumulate the total time, and update the current position.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n    total_time += delta\n    current = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks), followed by a list of `m` integers representing the house numbers for each task.\n2. **Initialization**: Start from house 1 with `total_time` initialized to 0.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road. Accumulate this time and update the current position to the target house.\n4. **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that each movement is calculated in constant time, leading to an overall time complexity of O(m), which is efficient given the problem constraints.",
