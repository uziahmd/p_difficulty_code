The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Xenia moving around a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement. But how?\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are at 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1. First task is at 3. How long does it take? From 1 to 3 clockwise: 2 steps (1→2→3). Then, the second task is at 2. But since she's at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around: 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Then third task is at 3 again. From 2 to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is that for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to calculate the time to move from the current position to the next task's house, considering the direction (clockwise only). But since the movement is clockwise, the time between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the time between two positions? Let's say Xenia is currently at position curr, and needs to move to next_pos. Since the movement is clockwise, the number of steps is (next_pos - curr) mod n if that's the shortest path? Wait no. Because if curr is 3 and next_pos is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - curr + next_pos) steps. For example, n=4, curr=3, next_pos=2: 3→4→1→2 is 3 steps. Which is (4 - 3 + 2) = 3. So the formula for steps between curr and next_pos is (next_pos - curr) if next_pos >= curr, else (n - curr + next_pos). Or more generally, (next_pos - curr) % n? Wait, no. Because if next_pos is less than curr, then (next_pos - curr) is negative. For example, curr=3, next_pos=2: (2-3) = -1, mod 4 would be 3. Which is correct. So the steps between curr and next_pos is (next_pos - curr) if next_pos >= curr, else (next_pos - curr + n). Which can be written as (next_pos - curr) % n if the result is positive? Wait, no. Because in Python, the modulo operation returns a non-negative result. For example, (2-3) %4 is 3. So yes, the steps between curr and next_pos is (next_pos - curr) % n. Wait, but in the case where next_pos is greater than curr, like next_pos=3 and curr=1, (3-1) is 2, which is correct. So yes, the steps needed is (next_pos - curr) % n. But wait, what if next_pos is equal to curr? Then it's zero steps. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So, for example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then she doesn't need to move. So the steps between them is zero.\n\nSo the approach is: we need to process the list of tasks in order. For each task, starting from the initial position (which is 1), compute the steps needed to get from the previous position to the current task's house. Then accumulate that.\n\nBut the initial position is 1. So the first task is a_1. The steps from 1 to a_1 is (a_1 - 1) mod n? Wait, no. Because for example, if a_1 is 3 and n=4, then (3-1) is 2 steps. Which is correct. If a_1 is 2, then (2-1) is 1 step. Correct. If a_1 is 1, then 0 steps. So yes, the formula (a_i - prev_pos) % n gives the steps needed. But wait, no. Because (a_i - prev_pos) could be negative. For example, if prev_pos is 3, and a_i is 2. Then (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the formula for steps between prev_pos and a_i is (a_i - prev_pos) % n. But wait, when you do mod n, it's possible that (a_i - prev_pos) is negative. But in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative value. So yes, this formula works.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nFor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   steps = (a_i - current_position) % n\n\n   total_time += steps\n\n   current_position = a_i\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia must complete all tasks with numbers less than i before doing task i. So the tasks are processed in order, and each task is done in sequence. So the order of the tasks is important. So the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m is the order in which the tasks must be done. So the code should process the list in order.\n\nBut why in the first example, the steps are 2 (from 1 to 3), then 3 steps (from 3 to 2), then 1 step (from 2 to 3). Which totals 6. Let's check with the formula:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. steps = (3 - 1) %4 = 2. total is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. steps = (2-3) mod4 = (-1) mod4=3. total is 2+3=5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. steps = (3-2) mod4 = 1. total is 5+1=6. Which matches.\n\nYes. So that seems to work.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 4 3, and the tasks are 2,3,3. So the output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: steps (2-1) mod4=1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: (3-2) mod4=1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: steps 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes. So this approach works.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: iterate through the list of tasks, for each step calculate the steps from current position to the next task's position, add to the total, and update current position.\n\nNow, the problem is to read the input, process the list, and compute this sum.\n\nBut wait, what about the input format? The input is given as two lines. The first line has n and m. The second line has m integers. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich would be parsed as n=4, m=3, and a list [3,2,3].\n\nSo the code needs to read n and m, then read the list of m integers.\n\nNow, in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the first line as n and m.\n\nThen read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nThen process as per the algorithm.\n\nBut for the code, the code would be:\n\nRead from stdin. So in Python, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen, current_pos = 1\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    steps = (num - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current_pos = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nWait, but wait, in the first example, the steps are 2 + 3 +1 = 6. Which is correct. But according to the code, the first step is (3-1) mod4=2. Then (2-3) mod4= 3. Then (3-2) mod4=1. Sum 6. Correct.\n\nYes. So this code would work.\n\nBut let's test another case. Suppose n=2, m=2, and a=[2,1]. Then:\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst step: (2-1) mod2 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond step: (1-2) mod2 = ( -1 ) mod2 = 1. total is 2. So the answer is 2. Which is correct. The path is 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). Total 2.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, a=[1,1]. Then steps are 0 and 0. So total 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the constraints? n and m can be up to 1e5, which is manageable. The code runs in O(m) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut wait, in Python, for large m (like 1e5), using list(map(...)) may be okay. But the code is straightforward.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and m, then the list of a's. Then process as described.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 4 3, then 3 2 3.\n\nThe code would process as:\n\ncurrent_pos=1.\n\nFirst num is 3: steps (3-1) mod4 = 2. total is 2.\n\ncurrent_pos=3.\n\nSecond num is 2: (2-3) mod4 = 3. total 5.\n\ncurrent_pos=2.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1. total 6. Output 6. Correct.\n\nSample 2: input is 4 3, then 2 3 3.\n\ncurrent_pos=1.\n\nFirst num 2: (2-1) mod4=1. total=1.\n\ncurrent is 2.\n\nSecond num 3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. total 2.\n\ncurrent is 3.\n\nThird num 3: 0. total remains 2. Output 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for these examples.\n\nAnother test case: when the tasks are in the same position. Like n=5, m=3, a=[1,1,1]. The total time is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=3, a=[1, 5, 1]. Steps:\n\nFrom 1 to 1: 0. Then 5-1 is 4 mod5 is 4. Then from 5 to 1: (1-5) mod5 = -4 mod5 = 1. So total is 0+4+1=5.\n\nYes. Because moving from 5 to 1 is 1 step (clockwise: 5→1).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead n and m, then the list. Then loop through the list, accumulating steps.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. The movement is only allowed clockwise, and each task must be completed in sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1. Each task requires her to move to a specific house, and she can only move clockwise. The time taken to move from one house to another is determined by the number of steps required in the clockwise direction.\n2. **Modulo Operation**: The key insight is to use modulo arithmetic to compute the number of steps between two houses. If moving from house `current_pos` to house `next_pos`, the number of steps required is `(next_pos - current_pos) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses. This handles both cases where the next house is ahead or behind in the clockwise direction.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Iterate through each task in sequence, updating the total time required and the current position after each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total = 0\n    for num in a:\n        diff = (num - current) % n\n        total += diff\n        current = num\n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using standard input functions for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Initialization**: Start from house 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the number of steps required to move from the current position to the target house using modulo arithmetic. This ensures that the movement is always calculated in the clockwise direction.\n- **Update Total Time**: Accumulate the total time taken for all movements and update the current position after each task.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum time required by leveraging modulo operations to handle circular movement, ensuring an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
