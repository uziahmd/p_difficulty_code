При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The task is to determine if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an overlap. And if possible, output one possible s. But there are some conditions. Let me think.\n\nFirst, the error scenario: when two same messages are sent consecutively, they merge into one. The overlapping part must be such that the end of the first message and the start of the second message overlap by some positive number of characters, but less than the length of s. Also, the full overlap (where the entire s is overlapped) is not considered an error. Similarly, no overlap (just concatenation) isn't considered an error either. So for the input t, we need to check if it can be formed by such an overlapping.\n\nSo, how can I approach this?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. Let's say the original message was s. Then, after merging, the resulting string t would be s concatenated with s, but with some overlapping. For example, if s is \"abab\" and they overlap by 2 characters (the last two of the first s and the first two of the second s), then the merged string would be \"ababab\" (since the overlapping part is \"ab\" from the end of the first and start of the second).\n\nWait, but the merged string would be s + s with some overlapping. So the total length of t would be len(s) * 2 - k, where k is the length of the overlapping part. Since k must be at least 1 and less than len(s). So len(t) = 2*len(s) -k. Which implies that len(t) must be between len(s) + 1 (when k= len(s)-1) and 2*len(s) -1 (when k=1). But since len(s) is unknown, perhaps I need to find possible values of len(s) based on the length of t.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about possible lengths of s. Let's denote the length of t as n. For there to be an overlap, the original s must have a length such that 2*len(s) -k = n, where 1 <=k < len(s). Let me rearrange that equation:\n\nn = 2L -k, where L is len(s), and 1 ≤k < L. So substituting k, we get:\n\nn = 2L -k → k = 2L -n.\n\nBut since k must be between 1 and L-1 inclusive, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2L -n ≤ L-1.\n\nLet me solve these inequalities for L.\n\nFirst inequality: 2L -n ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ n +1 → L ≥ (n+1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2L -n ≤ L-1 → 2L -n ≤ L-1 → L ≤ n -1.\n\nSo combining these, L must be between (n+1)/2 and n-1, inclusive.\n\nBut since L must be an integer, possible values of L are in that range. For example, if n is even, say 6, then (n+1)/2 is 3.5, so L must be ≥4, and ≤5. So possible Ls are 4,5.\n\nBut for each possible L, we need to check if there exists a k (which is 2L -n) such that 1 ≤k < L.\n\nWait, because k is 2L -n. Let's see:\n\nFor example, for each possible L in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1], compute k = 2L -n. Then check if 1 ≤k < L.\n\nBut since L is chosen such that 2L -n is between 1 and L-1, then yes. Because:\n\nFrom the inequalities above, we derived that L must be between (n+1)/2 and n-1. So for each such L, k is 2L -n, and it's in [1, L-1].\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nLoop through all possible L values (possible lengths of s) that satisfy (n+1)/2 ≤ L ≤ n-1. For each L, check if the first L -k characters of t match the last L -k characters of t, where k is 2L -n. Wait, no. Wait, the overlapping part is k characters. Let me think again.\n\nThe merged string is formed by overlapping the end of the first s with the start of the second s. So the first s is of length L, the second is also L. The overlapping is k characters. So the merged string is of length L + (L -k) = 2L -k. Which equals n.\n\nSo the merged string t is equal to the first s concatenated with the second s, but overlapping the last k characters of the first s with the first k characters of the second s. Therefore, the entire t must be equal to s concatenated with s[k:], because the overlapping part is the same. So the first s is s, and the second s is s[k:] (since the first k characters of the second s are overlapping with the last k of the first s).\n\nBut how can we check this? For a given L (length of s), the t must be such that the first L characters (the first s) and the next L characters (the second s) have an overlapping part. But since the merged string is t, which is s + s[k:], then the entire t must be equal to s concatenated with s[k:].\n\nBut how do I check that? For example, given that the length of t is n = 2L -k. So, k = 2L -n. So for a given L, we can compute k. Then, the first s is the first L characters of t. The second s is the last L characters of t. But since the overlapping is k characters, the first s's last k characters must be equal to the second s's first k characters. Also, the entire t must be equal to the first s plus the second s's substring from k onwards.\n\nWait, but the entire t is s concatenated with s[k:]. So the length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n. So for the given L, the t must be equal to the first s (of length L) concatenated with the second s's part starting from index k. But the second s is of length L, so the part after the overlapping is L -k characters.\n\nBut how do I check that? Well, for a given L, the first s is the first L characters of t. The second s is the last L characters of t. But since the overlapping is k characters, the first s's last k characters must be equal to the second s's first k characters. Also, the entire t should be the first s followed by the second s's substring from position k onwards. But since the entire t is the first s plus the second s's substring from position k, which is of length L -k, then the total length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n, which matches.\n\nSo for the given L, the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute k = 2L - n. Since n is the length of t, and L is in the valid range, this k must be between 1 and L-1.\n\n2. Check if the first L characters (s_candidate) and the last L characters (s_candidate2) have their overlapping parts equal. That is, the last k characters of s_candidate must be equal to the first k characters of s_candidate2.\n\nIf this is true, then the entire t is formed by overlapping s_candidate and s_candidate2. But since s_candidate and s_candidate2 are both supposed to be s, then they must be the same. So, in this case, s_candidate must equal s_candidate2. Because both are the same s. So, the first L characters (s_candidate) must be the same as the last L characters (s_candidate2). But wait, that's not necessarily true. Because the overlapping part is k characters. So, the first s_candidate is s, and the second s_candidate2 is also s. So the overlapping part is the last k characters of s_candidate (which is s's last k) and the first k of s_candidate2 (which is s's first k). So these must be equal. Therefore, the first L characters (s_candidate) and the last L characters (s_candidate2) must be such that the last k of s_candidate equals the first k of s_candidate2. But since s_candidate is s and s_candidate2 is s, then this condition is equivalent to s's last k characters equals s's first k characters.\n\nSo, for a given L, the steps are:\n\nCompute k = 2L -n.\n\nCheck that k is between 1 and L-1 (which it will be, given the L's range).\n\nCheck that the first L characters (s_candidate) has its last k characters equal to the first k characters of the last L characters (s_candidate2). But since s_candidate2 is the last L characters of t, which is s_candidate2 = t[-L:]. However, since s_candidate is s and s_candidate2 is also s, then the entire t should be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how to check that? Well, if the first L characters are s_candidate and the last L characters are s_candidate2, then for the merged string to be t, we need that s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate2[k:] equals t. But since t is the merged string, which is exactly that. So, the way to check is:\n\nCheck if the first L characters (s_candidate) + s_candidate[k:] equals t. Because the second part is s_candidate2[k:] which is the same as s_candidate[k:] since s_candidate2 is s_candidate.\n\nWait, but s_candidate2 is the last L characters of t. But if the entire t is s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:], then the last L characters of t would be s_candidate[k:] + ... ?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the original two messages are s and s. When merged with an overlap of k characters, the merged string is s + s[k:]. The length of this is len(s) + len(s) -k = 2L -k. Which is equal to n.\n\nSo, the merged string t must be equal to s + s[k:]. Therefore, for the given L, the first L characters of t must be s, and the remaining part (t[L:]) must be s[k:]. So, the entire t must be s + s[k:]. Therefore, for the given L, we can take s_candidate as the first L characters of t, and check if the rest of the string (t[L:]) equals s_candidate[k:]. If that's true, then this is a valid case.\n\nSo, the approach for a given L is:\n\nCheck if t starts with s_candidate (the first L characters) and ends with s_candidate[k:] (the part after the overlapping). But how to check that?\n\nYes. For example, t must be equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. So, the entire string t should be equal to that concatenation.\n\nSo, for a given L, compute k = 2L -n. Then check if the first L characters (s_candidate) concatenated with s_candidate[k:] equals t.\n\nIf that's true, then return YES and s_candidate as the possible s.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Iterate over all possible L values (possible lengths of s) which are in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1], where n is the length of t.\n\n2. For each L in that range, compute k = 2L -n. Check if k is between 1 and L-1 (but since L is chosen according to the earlier constraints, this should be guaranteed).\n\n3. For each such L and k, check if the first L characters (s_candidate) concatenated with s_candidate[k:] equals t. If yes, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\n4. If none of the possible L values satisfy this condition, return NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible L values. For example, for the input 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (from the first example), the length is 19. Let's see:\n\nn = 19. Possible L ranges from (19+1)/2 = 10 to 18.\n\nSo L can be from 10 to 18. For each L, compute k = 2L -19. For example, when L is 11, k = 22 -19 =3. Then check if the first 11 characters (abrakadabra) concatenated with s_candidate[3:] (which is akadabra) equals the original t. Let's see:\n\nOriginal t is abrakadabrabrakadabra. The first 11 characters are 'abrakadabra' (length 11). Then s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[3:] which is 'akadabra' (length 8). So the concatenation is 11 + 8 = 19 characters. The original t is 19 characters. So the concatenation would be 'abrakadabra' + 'akadabra' = 'abrakadabraakadabra'? Wait, but the original t is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (the example says that the correct answer is 'abrakadabra', which is length 11. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (the first example input). Let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\n\"abrakadabra\" is 11 letters. Then the input is \"abrakadabrabrakadabra\" — which is 11 + 11 - 1 = 21? Or maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, the example says that the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the merged string. The output is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). Let's see: the merged string is formed by overlapping two 'abrakadabra's. For example, overlapping by 1 character. Then the merged string is 11 + 11 -1 = 21 characters. So the input in the first example has length 21. Oh, but the sample input shows the first input as 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters. So for that case, n is 21.\n\nSo for that case, possible L is between (21+1)/2 = 11 and 20. So L ranges from 11 to 20. For L=11, k=2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. Then check if the first 11 characters (abrakadabra) concatenated with s_candidate[1:] (brakadabra) equals the input. The input is abrakadabrabrakadabra. Let's see:\n\nabrakadabra + brakadabra would be abrakadabra brakadabra → but the input is abrakadabrabrakadabra. Let's see:\n\nThe first part is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). Then adding 'brakadabra' (10 letters) gives 21 letters. Let's check the actual input. The input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'. Let's split it into parts. The first 11 letters are 'abrakadabra', then the next letters are 'brakadabra' (assuming that the merged string is first s (abrakadabra) and then the second s starting from index 1, which is 'brakadabra' (so the merged string is abrakadabra + brakadabra → which is abrakadabra brakadabra. But the actual input is abrakadabrabrakadabra. Let me check the actual string:\n\nOriginal input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'. Let's split into parts. The first part is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). Then the next part is 'brakadabra' (10 letters). So the total is 11 + 10 = 21 letters. Which is the input. So the concatenation is correct. Therefore, for L=11, the check passes. Hence, the answer is YES and the s_candidate is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, how to implement this in code.\n\nFirst, read the input string t. Then compute n = len(t). Then iterate over possible L values.\n\nBut what if there are multiple possible L values? For example, in the second sample input 'acacacaca' (output is 'acaca').\n\nLet's see. The input is 'acacacaca' which is 9 characters. So n=9. Possible L is between (9+1)/2=5 and 8. So L can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nFor each L:\n\nFor L=5, k = 2*5 -9 = 1. So check if first 5 chars (acaca) concatenated with s_candidate[1:] (caca) equals t. The concatenation would be acaca + caca → acacacaca. Which is the input. So yes. So this is a valid case. So the answer is YES and s_candidate is 'acaca'.\n\nAnother possible L is 6. Then k= 2*6 -9 = 3. Check if first 6 characters (acacac) concatenated with s_candidate[3:] (cac) equals the input. The concatenation would be acacac + cac → acacaccac. Which is not equal to the input. So no.\n\nSimilarly for other L's. So in this case, L=5 is valid.\n\nSo the code needs to iterate through all possible L values and check for any of them.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead t.\n\nn = len(t)\n\nfor L in range( (n+1)//2 , n ):\n\n   k = 2*L -n\n\n   if k <1 or k >= L:\n\n       continue (but according to our earlier constraints, this shouldn't happen)\n\n   s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\n   # check if s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:] equals t\n\n   if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t:\n\n       print(\"YES\")\n\n       print(s_candidate)\n\n       exit()\n\nAfter checking all L's, if none found, print \"NO\".\n\nWait, but why the loop is from (n+1)//2 to n-1 inclusive?\n\nBecause L must be >= (n+1)/2 and <=n-1. Since L must be integer, the lower bound is (n+1)//2. For example, if n is even, like 6, (n+1)/2 = 3.5, so (n+1)//2 is 3 (if integer division). Wait, but in Python, (n+1)//2 for n=6 is (6+1)//2 = 3.5 floored to 3. But according to our previous calculation, L must be >= (n+1)/2. So for n=6, (n+1)/2 is 3.5. So L must be >= 4. So the code's current loop would miss that. Wait, this is a problem.\n\nWait, the code is written as for L in range( (n+1)//2 , n ). Let me think for n=6. (n+1)//2 is (6+1)//2 = 3.5 → 3 in integer division. But the correct lower bound is 3.5, so L must be >=4. So the code would loop from 3 to 5 (since n is 6, and the upper limit is n-1=5). But L=3 is not in the valid range. So the code would check L=3, which is invalid.\n\nThis is a mistake. So the loop needs to start from ceil( (n+1)/2 ), but how to compute that?\n\nWait, (n+1)/2 is the lower bound. For example, when n is even:\n\nn=6 → (n+1)/2 = 3.5 → L must be >= 4. So the minimum L is 4.\n\nWhen n is odd, say n=5 → (5+1)/2=3 → L starts at 3.\n\nSo the correct lower bound for L is math.ceil( (n+1)/2 ) ?\n\nWait, (n+1)/2 can be written as (n+1) divided by 2. So for even n:\n\nn=6 → (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4.\n\nFor odd n=5 → (5+1)/2=3 → ceil is 3.\n\nSo the correct lower bound for L is ceil( (n+1)/2 ). But how to compute that in Python?\n\nWell, in Python, (n + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for example:\n\nceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nSo for (n+1)/2, the ceil is ((n+1) + 2 -1 ) // 2 → (n+2) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for example, n=6:\n\n(n+1) is 7. Divided by 2 is 3.5. Ceil is 4. (n+2) // 2 = (6+2)/2 = 4 → yes.\n\nn=5: (5+1)/2 = 3 → ceil is 3. (5+2)//2= 7//2=3.5 → 3 in integer division? No, 7//2 is 3 in Python. So yes, (n+1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, the formula for ceil(a / b) is (a + b -1) // b.\n\nSo for a = n+1, b=2. So ceil( (n+1)/2 ) = ( (n+1) + 2 -1 ) // 2 = (n+2) // 2.\n\nYes. So the lower bound for L is (n + 2) // 2. Let me test:\n\nn=6 → (6+2)//2 = 8//2=4 → correct.\n\nn=5 → (5+2)//2 = 7//2=3 → correct.\n\nn=7 → (7+2)//2=9//2=4.5 → 4 in integer division? Wait, no. In Python 3, 9//2 is 4. So for n=7, (n+1)/2 is 4. So L starts at 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the correct loop is for L in range( (n+2)//2, n ). Because the upper bound is n-1. So the code should iterate L from (n+2)//2 up to n-1 inclusive.\n\nWait, in Python, range is exclusive of the upper limit. So to include up to n-1, the code should be:\n\nfor L in range( lower_bound, n ):\n\nBut lower_bound is (n+2)//2. So for example, when n=6, lower_bound is 4, and the loop runs L=4,5 (since upper limit is n=6, so range(4,6) is 4,5).\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nSo in code:\n\nlower_L = (n + 1 + 1) // 2 → no, lower_L = (n + 2) // 2.\n\nSo in code:\n\nn = len(t)\n\nfor L in range( (n + 2) // 2, n ):\n\n   k = 2*L -n\n\n   if k <1 or k >= L:\n\n       continue\n\n   # check the condition\n\nBut wait, given that L is in the correct range, then k should be between 1 and L-1. Because earlier analysis said that for L in that range, k is between 1 and L-1. So perhaps we don't need the check here. Let's confirm.\n\nFor example, for L in [(n+2)//2, ..., n-1], then:\n\nWe know that L >= (n+1)/2 → 2L >= n+1 → 2L -n >= 1 → k >=1.\n\nAlso, since L <= n-1:\n\nk = 2L -n <= 2(n-1) -n = 2n -2 -n = n-2.\n\nBut since L is <=n-1, then k = 2L -n. Let's find the maximum value of k.\n\nFor L =n-1:\n\nk = 2*(n-1) -n = 2n-2 -n = n-2.\n\nBut since L =n-1, then k must be less than L → n-2 < n-1 → yes. So k is in [1, L-1].\n\nThus, for all L in the loop, k is valid. So the code can proceed without checking.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead t.\n\nn = len(t)\n\nfor L in range( (n+2)//2, n ):\n\n    k = 2*L -n\n\n    s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n    if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        print(s_candidate)\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but let's check the sample input 'abcabc' which outputs 'NO'.\n\nSample input 'abcabc' has length 6. So n=6. lower_L is (6+2)//2 = 8//2=4. So L ranges from 4 to 5 (since upper limit is 6).\n\nFor L=4:\n\nk= 2*4 -6 = 8-6=2. Check if s_candidate (first 4 letters: 'abca') concatenated with s_candidate[2:] ('ca') equals 'abcabc'?\n\nabca + ca → abca ca → abcaca, which is not equal to 'abcabc'.\n\nFor L=5:\n\nk=2*5 -6=4. Check if first 5 letters 'abcab' concatenated with s_candidate[4:] (which is 'b') → 'abcab' + 'b' = 'abcabb' which is not equal to 'abcabc'. So no. Thus, output is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abababab' which outputs 'YES' with 'ababab'.\n\nLet's see. Input is 'abababab' (length 8). So n=8.\n\nlower_L = (8+2)//2 = 10//2=5. So L ranges from 5 to 7.\n\nCheck L=5: k=2*5 -8=2. So s_candidate is first 5 letters: 'ababa'. Check if 'ababa' + 'aba' (s_candidate[2:]) equals 'abababab'? Let's see:\n\n'ababa' + 'aba' is 'ababaaba' which is 5+3=8 letters. The input is 'abababab'. Let's compare:\n\nababaaba vs abababab → no.\n\nNext L=6: k=2*6-8=4. s_candidate is first 6 letters: 'ababab'. Check if s_candidate + s_candidate[4:] → 'ababab' + 'ab' → 'abababab' which matches the input. So yes. So the answer is YES and the s_candidate is 'ababab'.\n\nWhich is correct as per the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother sample is 'acacacaca' (input length 9). lower_L is (9+2)//2= 11//2=5. So L ranges from 5 to 8.\n\nFor L=5, k=2*5 -9=1. s_candidate is first 5 letters: 'acaca'. s_candidate[k:] is 'caca'. So concatenation is 'acaca' + 'caca' → 'acacacaca' which is the input. So yes.\n\nThus, the code would return YES and 'acaca'.\n\nAnother sample is 'tatbt' which outputs NO. Let's see.\n\nn=5. lower_L is (5+2)//2= 3.5 floored? Wait, (5+2)//2 is 7//2=3 in Python. So L ranges from 3 to 4.\n\nFor L=3: k=2*3 -5=1. Check first 3 letters 'tat' + 'at' (s_candidate[1:] is 'at') → 'tatat' which is not equal to 'tatbt'.\n\nFor L=4: k=2*4 -5=3. Check first 4 letters 'tatb' + s_candidate[3:] which is 'b' → 'tatb' + 'b' → 'tatbb' which is not equal to 'tatbt'. So no. So output is NO.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat about when n is 2? For example, input 'aa'. Then n=2. lower_L is (2+2)//2=2. So the loop is for L in range(2, 2), which is empty. So code outputs NO. Which is correct, because the error scenario requires that the two messages are merged with an overlap of at least 1. But for two messages of length 1, merging with overlap of 1 would result in a single 'a' (since the two messages are 'a' and 'a', overlapping by 1. So the merged string is 'a' (the first a, and the second a overlaps completely). But according to the problem statement, the full overlap is not considered an error. So the input 'aa' would not be considered as an error. So the code returns NO, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: input 'aaaaa' (n=5). Let's see. lower_L is (5+2)//2=3. So L ranges from 3,4.\n\nFor L=3: k=2*3 -5=1. Check first 3 letters 'aaa' + 'aa' (s_candidate[1:] is 'aa') → 'aaaaa' which is the input. So returns YES and 'aaa'.\n\nBut let's check: the original two messages are 'aaa' and 'aaa'. Overlapping by 1 character. So the merged string is 'aaa' + 'aa' → 'aaaaa' which is correct. So the code returns YES. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: input 'abab' (n=4). lower_L is (4+2)//2=3. So L ranges from 3 to 3 (since upper limit is 4-1=3). So L=3. k=2*3-4=2. Check first 3 letters 'aba' + s_candidate[2:] (a) → 'aba' + 'a' = 'abaa' which is not equal to 'abab'. So no. So code returns NO. However, what if the original messages were 'ab' and 'ab' with overlapping of 1 character. The merged string would be 'ab' + 'b' → 'abb', which is not the input. Alternatively, if the input is 'abab', then it can be formed by two 'ab's concatenated without overlapping (so no error). So code returns NO, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: input 'aaa' (n=3). lower_L is (3+2)//2=5//2=2. So L ranges from 2 to 2. For L=2, k=2*2 -3=1. Check first 2 letters 'aa' + s_candidate[1:] (a) → 'aaa' which is the input. So returns YES and 'aa'. Which is correct. Because two messages of 'aa' merged with overlap of 1 character. The merged string is 'aa' + 'a' → 'aaa'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the error is when two messages are merged with an overlap. The full overlap is not considered an error. For example, if the input is 'aa', which is two 'a's merged with full overlap (k=1, but since len(s) is 1, k must be less than len(s) (which is 1). But that's impossible. So the code for input 'aaa' returns YES, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nIn Python, the code reads a string from stdin. Then, process as above.\n\nBut note that in the sample input, the first example is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 characters. For that case, the code would find L=11, which is in the range (21+2)//2 = 23//2=11. So L starts at 11, up to 20.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead t from input.\n\nn = len(t)\n\nfor L in range( (n + 2) // 2, n ):\n\n    k = 2 * L - n\n\n    s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n    if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        print(s_candidate)\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper bound. So for example, when n is 5, the upper limit is n, which is 5. So the loop runs for L in range( (n+2)//2, n ), which for n=5 is range(3,5) → 3 and 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' → len is 21. So (21+2)//2=23//2=11. So L ranges from 11 to 20. For L=11, k=2*11 -21= 22-21=1. s_candidate is first 11 letters. Check if s_candidate + s_candidate[1:] equals t. Which is yes. So output YES and the s_candidate.\n\nSample Input 2: 'acacacaca' → len 9. (9+2)//2=5.5 → 5. So L=5,6,7,8. For L=5, k=1. s_candidate is first 5 letters 'acaca', then 'acaca'[1:] is 'caca', concatenated gives 'acacacaca' which matches input. So output YES.\n\nSample Input 3: 'abcabc' → len 6. (6+2)//2=4. L=4,5. For L=4, k=2*4-6=2. s_candidate is 'abca', check 'abca' + 'ca' → 'abca'+'ca' = 'abcaca' which is not 'abcabc'. For L=5, k=2*5-6=4. s_candidate is 'abcab', check 'abcab' + 'ab'[4:] → 'abcab' + 'b' → 'abcabb' != 'abcabc'. So output NO.\n\nSample Input 4: 'abababab' → len 8. (8+2)//2=5. So L ranges from 5 to 7. For L=6, k=2*6-8=4. s_candidate is first 6 letters: 'ababab'. s_candidate[k:] is 'ababab'[4:] → 'ab'. So 'ababab' + 'ab' → 'abababab' which is the input. So output YES.\n\nSample Input 5: 'tatbt' → len 5. (5+2)//2=3. So L=3,4. For L=3, k=2*3-5=1. s_candidate is 'tat', check 'tat' + 'at' → 'tatat' != 'tatbt'. For L=4, k=2*4-5=3. s_candidate is 'tatb', check 'tatb' + 'tatb'[3:] → 'tatb' + 'b' → 'tatbb' != 'tatbt'. So output NO.\n\nAll samples pass.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what about cases where multiple L's are possible? For example, in the second sample, the input is 'acacacaca' (len 9). The code would check L=5 first. It finds a solution, returns it. Other possible L's may also be valid, but the code returns the first one.\n\nAnother example: input 'aaaaa' (len 5). For L=3, k=1. s_candidate is 'aaa' + 'aa' → 'aaaaa'. So returns YES. Also, for L=4, k= 2*4 -5 = 3. s_candidate is 'aaaa' → check 'aaaa' + 'a' (s_candidate[3:] is 'a') → 'aaaaa' which is correct. So code would return the first possible L, which is 3. So the output is 'aaa'.\n\nBut the problem allows any possible s. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input as t = input().strip()\n\nThen proceed.\n\nSo the code:\n\nt = input().strip()\n\nn = len(t)\n\nfor L in range( (n + 2) // 2, n ):\n\n    k = 2 * L - n\n\n    s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n    if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n        print(s_candidate)\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"NO",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an overlap. If possible, we should output one possible value of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Overlap**: The error scenario involves merging two identical messages `s` such that they overlap by some positive number of characters, but less than the length of `s`. This means the resulting string `t` will be shorter than twice the length of `s` by the length of the overlap.\n\n2. **Determine Possible Lengths of `s`**: For a given length `n` of string `t`, the possible lengths of `s` (denoted as `L`) must satisfy the condition where the overlap `k` is between 1 and `L-1`. This translates to checking values of `L` in the range from `(n + 2) // 2` to `n - 1`.\n\n3. **Check Validity of Each Candidate**: For each valid length `L`, compute the overlap `k` and check if the first `L` characters of `t` (denoted as `s_candidate`) concatenated with the substring starting from index `k` of `s_candidate` equals `t`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nn = len(t)\n\nfor L in range((n + 2) // 2, n):\n    k = 2 * L - n\n    s_candidate = t[:L]\n    if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        print(s_candidate)\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: The loop iterates over possible lengths `L` for the original message `s`, starting from `(n + 2) // 2` to `n - 1`.\n3. **Calculate Overlap**: For each length `L`, calculate the overlap `k` using the formula `k = 2 * L - n`.\n4. **Check Validity**: For each candidate length `L`, check if the string formed by concatenating the first `L` characters of `t` with the substring starting from index `k` of these characters matches the original string `t`.\n5. **Output Result**: If a valid `s` is found, print \"YES\" followed by the candidate string `s_candidate`. If no valid candidate is found after checking all possibilities, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid lengths for `s` and ensures correctness by validating the overlap condition directly against the input string.",
