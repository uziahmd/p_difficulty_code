Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. So the task is to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how angles are formed in a regular polygon. Let me think. In a regular polygon, each vertex is equally spaced around a circle. The central angles between adjacent vertices are 360/n degrees. But when we form an angle at a vertex, like v2, with two other vertices v1 and v3, what's the measure of that angle?\n\nWait, for example, in a regular triangle (n=3), each internal angle is 60 degrees. But if you take three vertices, the angle at the middle vertex would be 60 degrees. For a square (n=4), each internal angle is 90 degrees. But if you take three vertices where the middle one is adjacent to the others, like 1,2,3, then the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But if you take vertices 1,2,4, then the angle at 2 is 45 degrees? Wait, how does that work?\n\nOh right, because the angle formed by three vertices depends on how many steps apart they are. For example, in a regular polygon, the angle at vertex v2 between v1 and v3 can be determined based on the number of sides between them.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the angle. Suppose we have a regular n-gon. Let's fix v2 as the vertex where the angle is formed. Let's say there are k steps between v1 and v2, and m steps between v3 and v2. Wait no, maybe it's better to think in terms of the number of edges between v1 and v2 along the perimeter. Because the angle depends on how far apart the points are.\n\nWait, for a regular polygon, the angle at vertex v2 between two other vertices v1 and v3 can be calculated using some formula. Let me think about this. For example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the angle is the internal angle of the polygon. For a regular polygon, the internal angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. But if v1 and v3 are further apart, then the angle changes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle can be found by considering the arcs between the points. Let me think: in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice that of the angle subtended at any point on the circumference. \n\nBut in this case, the regular polygon is inscribed in a circle. So, for three points on the circle, the angle at v2 depends on the arc between v1 and v3. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet's imagine that the polygon is inscribed in a unit circle. Let's consider the central angles between the points. Suppose that between v2 and v1, there are k steps clockwise, and between v2 and v3, there are m steps counter-clockwise. Wait, but since the polygon is regular and convex, the vertices are arranged in order. So, if we fix v2, then v1 and v3 must be on either side of v2. Wait, but the problem says that v1 and v3 lie on the sides of the angle. So, the angle is formed by two lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3, which are two different vertices. \n\nSo, the key is to find the number of vertices between v1 and v2, and between v3 and v2. Let me think. For example, suppose that between v1 and v2, there are k vertices (so the arc length from v1 to v2 is k+1 edges). Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of edges between v1 and v2 along the perimeter. For example, if v1 is adjacent to v2, then there's 1 edge between them. If there are two edges, then they are two steps apart.\n\nBut the angle at v2 depends on the arc that's opposite to it. Let me think again. Suppose we have three points A, B, C on a circle. The angle ABC (with B being the vertex) is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that does not contain B. Wait, no, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle ABC is equal to half the measure of the arc AC that is opposite to B. So, if the arc AC (not containing B) is θ degrees, then the angle ABC is θ/2 degrees.\n\nIn the case of a regular polygon, the arc between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. So, if between A and C there are k steps (i",

Or m?\n\n    # Let's take v2 as vertex 1. Then, v1 is vertex 2 (adjacent), and v3 is vertex (2 + m) % n? No, need to ensure that the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is exactly m steps.\n\n    # For example, if m=1, then between v1 and v3 there is one step (so they are adjacent). The angle is 180/n degrees.\n\n    # So, to get m steps between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2), we can set v1 as v2+1 and v3 as v2 + m + 1 (mod n).\n\n    # Let's choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + m.

So the vertices would be 2, 1, 4.\n\n    # But wait, in the sample input for n=4, a=67, the best angle is 45 degrees (m=1). For m=1, the angle is (1 * 180)/4 = 45 degrees. So the output is 4 1 2. That corresponds to v2=1, v1=4, v3=2. Which makes sense because the arc between 4 and 2 (not passing through 1) is 1 step (from 4 to 2, going through 3 is two steps, but the other way is one step). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\n    # Let's take n=4, m=1. So the arc between v1 and v3 (not containing v2) has m=1 steps. So, for example, if v2 is 1, then v1 is 2 and v3 is 4. The arc between 2 and 4 that doesn't contain 1 is 2 steps (through 3), which contradicts m=1. Hmm, this suggests that my earlier formula is incorrect.\n\n    # Let me re-derive the formula correctly. Suppose we have a regular n-gon inscribed in a circle. Let’s fix v2 as the vertex where the angle is formed. Let’s say that between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2, there are k edges. Then the central angle for that arc is k * (360/n) degrees. The angle at v2 is half of that, so (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\n    # So, the number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2 is k. So, for example, in n=4, if v2 is 1, v1 is 2, v3 is 4, then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 2 edges (from 2 to 3 to 4), so k=2. The angle would be (2 * 180)/4 = 90 degrees. But that's the internal angle of the square. However, in the sample input for n=4 and a=67, the best angle is 45 degrees. How is that achieved?\n\n    # In the sample input, when n=4 and a=67, the best angle is 45 degrees, which corresponds to k=1. So the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 1 edge. How can this happen? For example, if v2 is 1, then v1 is 2 and v3 is 3. The arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is from 2 to 3, which is 1 edge. The angle at v2 would be (1 * 180)/4 = 45 degrees. So this matches the sample.\n\n    # So the formula is correct. Therefore, for a given m (which is k), the angle is (m * 180)/n. And our task is to find m such that this is closest to a.\n\n    # So back to the code. Once best_m is determined, we can construct the triplet.\n\n    # Let's pick v2 as vertex 1. Then v1 is vertex 2, and v3 is vertex (2 + best_m). But wait, if best_m is 1, then v3 is 3. So the triplet would be 2,1,3. Which is the sample output for n=4, a=67.\n\n    # However, in the sample input for n=4 and a=67, the output is \"2 1 3\", which matches this choice. So yes.\n\n    # So the general approach is:\n    # - Find the best m (number of edges between v1 and v3 along the arc not containing v2)\n    # - Choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as 2 + m. But since the vertices are numbered up to n, we need to wrap around if necessary.\n\n    # Wait, for example, if m=3 and n=5, then v3 would be 2 + 3 = 5. So the triplet is 2,1,5.\n\n    # But what if m is larger than n-2? Well, in our earlier code, m ranges from 1 to n-2, so that's not possible.\n\n    # So the code for selecting the triplet is:\n\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = v1 + best_m\n    if v3 > n:\n        v3 = v3 - n\n\n    # Wait, but for example, n=4, best_m=1, then v3 = 2+1=3 which is correct. If best_m=2, then v3 = 2+2=4, which is correct. For best_m=3, which is not allowed since n-2=2, so m can't be 3.\n\n    # So the code should work.\n\n    # But what if best_m is zero? No, since m starts from 1.\n\n    # Now, what if there are multiple best_m values with the same difference? For example, if a is exactly halfway between two angles. In that case, we can choose any of them.\n\n    # Now, let's handle the case where best_m is not found (unlikely, since m_candidates includes at least 1 or n-2).\n\n    # Now, let's implement the code.\n\n    # First, compute the best_m.\n\n    # Edge cases:\n    # When n=3, the only possible m is 1.

In that case, we can choose any of them.\n\n    # Now, let's handle the case where best_m is not found (unlikely, since m_candidates includes at least 1 or n-2).\n\n    # Now, let's implement the code.\n\n    # First, compute the best_m.\n\n    # Edge cases:\n    # When n=3, the only possible m is 1. Because n-2=1. So angle is 1*180/3 = 60 degrees.
