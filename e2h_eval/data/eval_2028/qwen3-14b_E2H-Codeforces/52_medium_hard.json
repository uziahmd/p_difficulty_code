Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is a. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. For every b burned candles, he can make a new one. And this new one can be used again, which in turn becomes another burned candle after an hour. So it's like a process where we have to keep track of how many candles are available at each step.\n\nLet me think of the example given. For input 4 and 2: \n\nFirst, he uses 4 candles, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 burned candles can be converted into 4//2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 burned ones can be converted into 1 new candle. He uses that, adding 1 hour. Now, that one is burned, but he can't make any more since 1 < 2. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see:\n\nInitial 6 candles: 6 hours. Burned ones are 6. Then 6 /3 = 2 new. Use them, 2 hours. Burned now are 2. But 2 is less than 3, so no more. Wait, but sample output is 8. Wait 6+2=8? Oh right. But wait, what about the 2 burned candles? Wait, maybe there's a way to collect them again. Wait, no. Because 2 is less than 3. So total is 6+2=8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the total hours, and the number of burned candles. Then, whenever possible, convert them into new candles.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think. The process is:\n\n- Start with a candles. Each time you use a candle, it's burned and added to the collection. Then, whenever you have enough burned candles (>=b), you can make new ones.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of variables:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nburned_candles = 0\n\nWait, perhaps not. Because when you use a candle, it's consumed and becomes burned. So maybe:\n\nInitially, you have a candles. Each time you light a candle, it's used, so you subtract one from current_candles, add one to burned_candles. Then, whenever you have enough burned_candles, you can make new ones.\n\nBut that seems like a possible approach. However, the problem is that when you make new candles, you can use them immediately. So, for example, when you have 4 burned candles and b is 2, you can make 2 new ones. Those can be used immediately, adding 2 hours. But then, after burning those, you get 2 more burned candles, which can be combined again.\n\nSo the process is:\n\nWhile there are candles to burn (current_candles > 0), burn them, add to burned_candles. Then, whenever possible, convert burned_candles into new ones, adding to current_candles. But how to do this in code?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nEach time you have some number of burned candles, you can make new ones. But the process is iterative.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nStart with a candles. The initial steps:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nburned = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nwhile current_candles > 0:\n\n    burn one candle, so current_candles -= 1\n\n    total_hours +=1\n\n    burned +=1\n\n    then, check if burned >= b:\n\n        if yes, then make new_candles = burned // b\n\n        current_candles += new_candles\n\n        burned = burned % b \n\nBut wait, this would be a way to model it. But perhaps that's not the most efficient way. Because each time you burn a candle, you have to check if you can make new ones. But maybe we can do this in batches.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as:\n\nEvery time you have some number of burned candles, you can make new ones. So, the steps are:\n\ntotal_hours = a (since all initial candles are burned)\n\nburned = a\n\nthen, while burned >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned // b \n\n    total_hours += new_candles \n\n    burned = (burned % b) + new_candles \n\nSo this is a better approach. Because, for example, in the first case:\n\na=4, b=2. Initial total_hours is 4, burned is 4. \n\nThen, 4//2 = 2. So add 2 to total_hours (now 6). Then, burned is 4%2=0 + 2 = 2. \n\nAgain, 2 >=2. So new_candles = 2//2=1. Add 1 to total_hours (7). Burned is 0 +1 =1. Now, 1 <2, so stop. So total is 7. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3. Initial total_hours is 6. burned=6. \n\n6//3=2. Add 2 (total 8). burned is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So done. Total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: say a=5, b=3. Initial total is 5. burned=5. 5//3 is 1. Add 1, total 6. burned is 5%3=2 +1=3. Now, 3 >=3. So 3//3=1. Add 1 (total 7). burned is 0 +1=1. So done. So total is 7. \n\nYes, that works. So the algorithm is:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nburned = a\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned // b \n\n    total_hours += new_candles \n\n    burned = (burned % b) + new_candles \n\nSo this loop continues until burned is less than b.\n\nThis seems efficient. Because each time, the burned is being reduced by the division. Let's see for a=1000, b=2. Then the process would be:\n\ntotal_hours starts as 1000. burned=1000.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew_candles = 1000//2=500. total becomes 1500. burned is 0 +500=500.\n\nAgain, 500//2=250. total 1750. burned 250.\n\nAgain, 250//2=125. total 1875. burned 125.\n\nAgain, 125//2=62. total 1937. burned 125%2=1 +62=63.\n\n63//2=31. total 1937+31=1968. burned is 63%2=1 +31=32.\n\n32//2=16. total 1968+16=1984. burned 0+16=16.\n\n16//2=8. total 1992. burned 8.\n\n8//2=4. total 1996. burned 4.\n\n4//2=2. total 1998. burned 2.\n\n2//2=1. total 1999. burned 0+1=1. Now loop stops.\n\nSo total is 1999. Which seems correct.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead a and b.\n\ntotal = a\n\nburned = a\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new = burned // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burned = burned % b + new\n\nreturn total.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: a=1, b=2. Then, initial total is 1. burned is 1. Since 1 <2, loop doesn't run. So output is 1.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Initial total is 2. burned is 2. new is 1. total becomes 3. burned is 0 +1=1. loop ends. So output 3.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. Initial total is 3. burned is 3. new is 1. total is 4. burned is 0+1=1. loop ends. So output 4.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5. initial total is 5. burned is 5. new is 1. total is 6. burned is 1. loop ends. So output 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2. Let's see:\n\ntotal starts at 5. burned=5.\n\nloop:\n\nnew =5//2=2. total is 5+2=7. burned is 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nloop again: 3//2=1. total 7+1=8. burned is 3%2=1 +1=2.\n\nloop again: 2//2=1. total 8+1=9. burned is 0 +1=1. loop ends. So total is 9.\n\nLet me check manually:\n\nInitial 5 candles. 5 hours. Burned 5.\n\nMake 2 new (5//2=2). 2 hours. Now burned is 5-2*2=1 (wait no, the process is that when you make new candles, you take the burned ones. So initial 5 burned, make 2 new. So burned becomes 5 - 2*2 = 1? Or is it 5 % 2 = 1, plus the new candles?\n\nYes, the code uses burned = burned % b + new. So 5%2=1, plus 2 new. So 3. Then, 3//2=1. So burned is 3%2=1 +1=2. Then 2//2=1. Burned is 0+1=1.\n\nSo the code is correct. So the total is 5+2+1+1=9? Wait, how?\n\nOriginal total is 5. Then adding 2 (so 7), then adding 1 (8), then adding 1 (9). Yes. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead a and b from input. The input is two integers on a single line.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single line with two integers. The sample input shows two examples, but perhaps in the actual problem, each input is a single test case. Wait, the original problem says that the input is a single line with two integers. So for example, in the sample input, the first example is '4 2' and output is 7. The second example is '6 3' with output 8. But the user provided the input as ['4 2', '6 3'] and output as ['7', '8']. But that's probably because the user is showing multiple test cases. However, in the actual programming problem, the input is a single line. So the code must read a single line, split into a and b.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nThen compute as per the algorithm.\n\nSo in Python:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nburned = a\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new = burned // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burned = burned % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFor 4 2:\n\ntotal starts as 4, burned is 4.\n\nLoop:\n\nnew =4//2=2. total is 6. burned is 0 +2=2.\n\nLoop again: 2//2=1. total is 7. burned is 0+1=1. Loop ends. Output 7.\n\nFor 6 3:\n\ntotal starts as 6, burned 6.\n\nnew =6//3=2. total is 8. burned is 0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So done. Output 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=2. Output 9. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=1, b=2. Output 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Output 3. Correct.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. Output 4. Correct.\n\nSo the code should work. So this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can illuminate his room using candles, considering that he can reuse burned-out candles to create new ones. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and reusing the burned ones optimally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours initially.\n2. **Track Burned Candles**: After each hour, the burned candles are collected. These can be converted into new candles if there are enough of them.\n3. **Conversion Process**: For every `b` burned candles, a new candle can be made. This new candle can then be burned, contributing additional hours and potentially more burned candles for further conversion.\n4. **Iterative Conversion**: Continue converting burned candles into new ones until there are not enough burned candles left to make another new one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nburned = a\nwhile burned >= b:\n    new = burned // b\n    total += new\n    burned = burned % b + new\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: The initial number of hours is set to `a` because each of the initial candles burns for one hour.\n2. **Burned Candles Tracking**: After burning all initial candles, we start collecting the burned ones.\n3. **Conversion Loop**: While there are enough burned candles to make new ones (i.e., `burned >= b`), convert them into new candles. Each conversion adds to the total hours and updates the count of burned candles.\n4. **Update Counts**: After each conversion, update the total hours and adjust the count of burned candles to reflect the remaining ones after conversion and the new ones created.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of burning and reusing candles, ensuring optimal use of available resources to maximize the total illumination time. The algorithm runs in O(log a) time complexity due to the repeated division of burned candles, making it efficient even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
