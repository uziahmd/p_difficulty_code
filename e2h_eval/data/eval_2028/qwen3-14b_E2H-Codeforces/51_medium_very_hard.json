Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters from the first two lines (guest and host), they should exactly match the letters in the third line (the pile). That means the total count of each letter in the first two lines combined must equal the count in the third line.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n1. Read the three input lines.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines (guest + host) into a single string.\n3. Check if the concatenated string has the same character counts as the third line (the pile).\n4. If yes, output \"YES\"; else, \"NO\".\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to compare the counts. One way is to use a Counter from the collections module. For example, we can create a Counter for the combined guest and host names, and another Counter for the pile. Then, check if these two Counters are equal.\n\nWait, but what about the order? No, because Counter compares the counts of each element. So if both have the same counts for all characters, then it's a match.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\n- Read the three lines. Let's say, guest, host, pile.\n- Combine guest and host into a single string, say combined = guest + host.\n- Create a Counter for combined and a Counter for pile.\n- Compare the two Counters. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the combined length is different from the pile's length? For example, if the combined length is 5 and the pile's length is 6, then obviously it's impossible. But comparing the Counters would automatically take care of that, since the counts would differ. So checking the Counter equality is sufficient.\n\nYes. So that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python, we can read the three lines using input(). But since the input might have trailing newlines or other issues? Well, according to the problem statement, each line is not empty and contains only uppercase letters. So, perhaps reading via input().strip() is not necessary. Wait, but the input is given as three lines. So for example, in the sample input, the first case is:\n\nInput lines are:\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo, the first line is 'SANTACLAUS', the second 'DEDMOROZ', third 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nSo, in code, we can read them as:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nBut maybe the input could have leading or trailing whitespace? The problem says that all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. So, probably, the input lines don't have any whitespace except the newline. So, using input().strip() might be unnecessary, but perhaps better to use it to avoid any leading/trailing spaces. However, the problem says that the input lines consist of only uppercase letters. So perhaps the input() function will read each line correctly. But to be safe, perhaps using .strip() is better.\n\nBut maybe not. For example, if the input is given with a newline, then input() will read the line without the trailing newline. So, perhaps just using input() is sufficient. For example, in the sample input, the first line is 'SANTACLAUS', so input() would get that as a string.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\nThen, combine guest and host into combined = guest + host.\n\nThen, check if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile). If yes, output YES else NO.\n\nBut what about the case where the combined string has the same characters but different counts? For example, if combined has two 'A's and pile has three 'A's. Then the Counters would not match.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the combined length is different from the pile's length? For example, if combined is length 5 and pile is length 6. Then the Counter comparison would automatically return False, since the counts of all characters would not match. Because the sum of counts in combined is len(combined), and sum of counts in pile is len(pile). So if they are different, the Counters can't be equal.\n\nTherefore, this approach handles that case automatically.\n\nTesting the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS']\n\nWait, the first sample input is:\n\nFirst line: SANTACLAUS\n\nSecond line: DEDMOROZ\n\nThird line: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count the letters.\n\nLet me see:\n\nSANTACLAUS has letters:\n\nS, A, N, T, A, C, L, A, U, S.\n\nDEDMOROZ: D, E, D, M, O, R, O, Z.\n\nCombined letters:\n\nLet me count each letter.\n\nBut perhaps the third line is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nWait, the third line is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me check the length.\n\nBut perhaps the code would handle it.\n\nIn any case, the code would check if the combined counts match the pile's counts.\n\nSo for the first sample, the code would return YES.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is:\n\nPAPAINOEL\n\nJOULUPUKKI\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count letters.\n\nBut the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me check the counts. For example, the combined string has:\n\nPAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count the letters.\n\nBut maybe the code would find that the pile has an extra L. For example, the sample says that in the second case, the pile is missing a P and has an extra L.\n\nSo the code would detect that the Counters are different, hence output NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: the third input is BABBONATALE, FATHERCHRISTMAS, BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nCombined is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS.\n\nThe pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nLet me check the lengths. Let's see:\n\nCombined length: len(BABBONATALE) is 9 letters, len(FATHERCHRISTMAS) is 14 letters. Total 23.\n\nPile: len(BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER) ?\n\nLet me count:\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nBABCHRISTMAS is 10 letters (BABCHRISTMAS?), then BONATALLE is 8 letters (BONATALLE?), then FATHER is 6. Total 10 + 8 + 6 = 24? Or maybe I'm miscalculating. But in any case, the sample says that there's an extra L. So the code would detect that the counts are different.\n\nThus, the code would output NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: All three lines are empty? But according to the problem statement, all lines are non-empty. So no need to handle that.\n\nEdge case 2: All letters are same. Like guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\". Then code returns YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" â†’ YES. If pile is \"BA\", same thing. If pile is \"AAB\", then Counter would have 2 A's and 1 B. Combined has 1 A and 1 B. So code returns NO.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. But in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the input has leading or trailing whitespaces? According to the problem statement, the input lines consist of only uppercase letters and are not empty. So the .strip() may not be necessary. However, in some cases, if the input is given with leading or trailing whitespaces (though the problem says it's not), but perhaps the problem's test cases don't have that. However, the problem says that the input lines are correct. So perhaps using input().strip() is not needed, but perhaps it's better to use it to avoid any possible issues. For example, if the input has a trailing newline, but the input() function already reads the line without the trailing newline. So, perhaps using input().strip() is unnecessary, but perhaps better to use it to avoid any leading/trailing whitespaces. However, the problem says that the input lines contain only uppercase letters and are not empty. So, the input().strip() may not be needed, but perhaps it's better to use it. For example, if a line is read as 'SANTACLAUS\\n' (with a newline), then input().strip() would remove the newline. However, the input() function in Python reads the line without the trailing newline. So, for example, if the user enters \"SANTACLAUS\" followed by Enter, input() would return \"SANTACLAUS\" (without the newline). Therefore, perhaps the .strip() is not needed. However, in some cases, perhaps the problem's input may have leading or trailing whitespaces. But according to the problem statement, the input lines do not have any. So, perhaps it's better to not use .strip() and just read the lines as input(). However, perhaps in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing whitespaces. But the problem says that all lines are not empty and consist of uppercase letters only. Therefore, the code can safely read the lines as input().strip()? Or perhaps not. For example, if the input is given as '  SANTACLAUS  ', then the .strip() would remove the spaces, but according to the problem statement, the input lines do not have such spaces. So, perhaps the code should not use .strip().\n\nBut perhaps the problem's test cases have the correct input, so that the code can read the lines as input(). However, in practice, when using online judges, sometimes leading/trailing whitespaces can be present. But according to the problem statement, they are not. So perhaps the code can proceed without the .strip().\n\nBut to make sure, perhaps the code should use input().strip() to avoid any possible leading/trailing whitespaces. For example, if the input is given with a trailing newline, which is not part of the actual string.\n\nBut in Python, input() returns the line without the trailing newline. So, for example, if the input line is 'SANTACLAUS', then input() returns that string. So, perhaps the code can just read guest = input(), host = input(), pile = input().\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces. But according to the problem statement, the input lines consist of only uppercase letters and are not empty. Therefore, the code can safely read the lines as input().strip()? Or perhaps not. For example, if the input line is 'SANTACLAUS' (without any spaces), then input().strip() would return the same string. So, perhaps using .strip() is safe.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's test cases do not have any leading or trailing whitespaces, so the code can just read the lines as input(). However, to avoid any possible issues, perhaps using .strip() is better.\n\nIn any case, the code can be written as:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nBut perhaps the code would be better without the .strip(). For example, if the input has leading or trailing whitespaces, but according to the problem statement, that's not allowed. However, the problem says that the input lines are correct. So, perhaps the code can read the lines as input().\n\nBut in practice, when using online judges, sometimes people use input().strip() to avoid any possible leading/trailing whitespaces. So, perhaps it's better to include it.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as ['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'], which would be read as three lines. So, the code would read the first line as 'SANTACLAUS', the second as 'DEDMOROZ', third as 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nThus, the code would work.\n\nSo, the code is as follows.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written. Also, the problem says that the input is three lines, and the output is YES or NO.\n\nAnother thing to consider: the code must read from standard input. So, the code must read three lines from stdin.\n\nNow, the code in Python would be:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the combined string is empty? According to the problem statement, all lines are non-empty. So, guest and host are non-empty, so combined is non-empty. So, no problem.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count letters.\n\nBut the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nLet me check the counts.\n\nBut perhaps the code would compare the two.\n\nBut how can I be sure? Well, the sample says that the first case is YES.\n\nSo the code would return YES.\n\nSample 2:\n\nPAPAINOEL\nJOULUPUKKI\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count the letters in combined:\n\nPAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nP: 2 (from PAPAINOEL) + 1 (from JOULUPUKKI?) Wait, let's break it down.\n\nGuest is PAPAINOEL: letters are P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L â†’ counts:\n\nP: 2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nHost is JOULUPUKKI: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I â†’ counts:\n\nJ:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nP: 2+1=3?\n\nWait, guest's P is 2 (PAPAINOEL has P at first and third letters?), yes. Host's JOULUPUKKI has a P once. So combined P count is 3.\n\nIn the pile, JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count the letters in the pile:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me write down each character:\n\nJ, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nLet me count:\n\nJ:1\n\nO: 2 (positions 2 and 9?)\n\nU: 3 (positions 3, 14, 16?)\n\nL: 3 (positions 4, 11, 13?)\n\nN: 1\n\nA: 2 (positions 6 and 8)\n\nP: 2 (positions 7 and 15)\n\nO: 2?\n\nI: 2 (positions 10 and 18)\n\nE: 1 (position 12)\n\nK: 2 (positions 17 and 18?)\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. But according to the sample, there is a missing P and an extra L. So the pile has one less P than combined. Let me check:\n\nIn the combined string, P count is 3 (guest has 2, host has 1). In the pile, the count for P is 2. So that's missing one P. Also, the L count in combined is guest has 1, host has 1 â†’ total 2. In the pile, the count for L is 3. So that's an extra L. Hence, the code would detect that the Counters are not equal, and output NO.\n\nThus, the code works for that case.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, considering that the code uses Counter, which is part of the collections module. So, the code must import that.\n\nSo, the code is as written above.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is given as three lines, and the output is YES or NO.\n\nNow, the code is ready. Let me check for possible errors.\n\nAnother possible edge case: when the combined string is exactly the same as the pile. For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\". Then code returns YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"AB\", host is \"CD\", pile is \"ABCD\". YES.\n\nIf pile is \"ABDC\", same result.\n\nIf pile is \"ABCCD\", then the code returns NO.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. This involves checking if the character counts of the combined names match exactly with the character counts of the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Read Input**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combine Names**: Concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string.\n3. **Character Count Comparison**: Use a counter to compare the frequency of each character in the combined string with the frequency of characters in the pile. If both counters match, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\n# Read the three input lines\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\n# Combine the guest and host names\ncombined = guest + host\n\n# Check if the character counts match\nif Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `input().strip()` to ensure there are no leading or trailing whitespaces, although the problem guarantees that the inputs are clean.\n2. **Combining Strings**: The guest and host names are concatenated into a single string to facilitate character count comparison.\n3. **Counter Comparison**: Using `collections.Counter`, we count the occurrences of each character in both the combined string and the pile. If these counts match exactly, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names, resulting in \"YES\". Otherwise, it results in \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of character counts using a linear time complexity relative to the length of the strings involved, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
