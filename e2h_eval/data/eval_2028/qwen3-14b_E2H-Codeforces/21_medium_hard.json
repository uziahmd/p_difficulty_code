The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. Conversely, for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, count how many keys are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible is the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, right! Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, and each odd chest can be paired with an even key. But since each key can be used once and each chest once, we take the min of each pair.\n\nSo let's break it down:\n\n- Count even_chest = number of a_i even\n- odd_chest = n - even_chest\n- even_key = number of b_j even\n- odd_key = m - even_key\n\nThen the answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key). \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for the even chests, they can only be matched with odd keys. So the maximum possible for that part is the minimum of the two counts. Similarly for the odd chests and even keys.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n2. Read the list of a_i, count how many are even.\n3. Read the list of b_j, count how many are even.\n4. Compute the answer as min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=5, m=4\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\nLooking at a_i:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chest is 3 (14,6,2), odd_chest is 2 (9,11).\n\nb = [8,4,7,20]. Let's check even keys: 8,4,20 are even, 7 is odd. So even_key is 3, odd_key is 1.\n\nSo min(even_chest (3), odd_key (1)) is 1. Then min(odd_chest (2), even_key (3)) is 2. Total 3, which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input:\n\nn=5, m=1\na is [2,4,6,8,10], all even. So even_chest=5, odd_chest=0.\n\nb is [5], which is odd. So even_key=0, odd_key=1.\n\nSo min(5, 1) is 1. Then min(0, 0) is 0. Total 1, which matches the sample.\n\nThird example:\n\nn=1, m=4. a is [10], even. So even_chest=1, odd_chest=0.\n\nb is [20,30,40,50], all even. So even_key=4, odd_key=0. \n\nSo min(1, 0) is 0. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this approach works for the examples. \n\nNow, the code needs to compute these counts efficiently. Since n and m can be up to 1e5, but counting even and odd numbers is O(n) and O(m), which is acceptable.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the next line as a list of integers. Count even numbers in a.\n\nRead the next line as list of integers. Count even numbers in b.\n\nThen compute:\n\neven_chest = count_even_a\nodd_chest = n - even_chest\neven_key = count_even_b\nodd_key = m - even_key\n\nanswer = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n\nPrint the answer.\n\nYes. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nWait, but how to read the inputs? The input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. Oh, the input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first input is given as a string like ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50'].\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as per the standard input. However, the way the sample input is presented here is perhaps as a list of test cases. But in reality, the actual input is for each test case, the first line is n and m, then the second line is a_i, third line is b_j. But the sample input shows that the user provided multiple test cases. But in the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. But the sample input seems to have multiple test cases. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first example input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nThen another input is:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\nThen third input:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\nBut the sample output is ['3', '1', '0'].\n\nWait, but in programming competition problems, typically each test case is processed separately. However, the problem statement here may be structured such that the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input format is:\n\nThe first line contains n and m. Then second line has a_i, third line has b_j. So for each test case, three lines.\n\nBut the sample input seems to have three test cases. So perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem statement's input is not clear. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1...a_n.\n\nThird line contains m integers b_1...b_m.\n\nSo for each test case, three lines. But in the sample input, there are three test cases. So the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the sample input shows that the user input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the actual code should process each test case as per the input.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement's input description, it says that the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, looking back at the problem statement's original input description:\n\nThe first line contains n and m. Then the second line has a_i, third line has b_j. So for each test case. So the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the sample input shows that the first input is three lines, then another three lines, etc. So the code should read all test cases. But how many test cases are there? The problem statement isn't clear. However, looking at the sample input and output, the sample input has three test cases, and the output has three answers.\n\nBut in the problem statement's original input, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases, which suggests that perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is formatted as a list of test cases, but in reality, the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. But that's conflicting with the sample input. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', which is three lines. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but in reality, the actual input is a single test case. However, the problem's sample shows that the code must process multiple test cases. But that's not clear. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code needs to handle multiple test cases. For example, in the sample input, there are three test cases, and the output is three lines.\n\nBut in the problem statement's original input description, it's unclear. However, looking at the problem's original input description:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m. The second line contains n integers. Third line contains m integers. So for each test case. So the code must process multiple test cases. However, how many? Well, in programming competitions, sometimes the code is expected to process multiple test cases until EOF. But how to know?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input given in the problem, it's structured as three separate test cases. For example, the first input line is '5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20' which is three lines. Then the next is '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5' which is three lines, etc. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But how to read them?\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of strings, but perhaps in reality, the code should read from stdin, and each test case is given as three lines. So for example, the code should read until EOF, processing each test case as per the three lines.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nWell, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into groups of three lines, and process each group as a test case.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the original problem has only one test case, but the sample input shows multiple. However, the problem's sample input and output suggests that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's original input description:\n\nThe first line contains n and m. Then the second line has the a_i, third line has the b_j. So the code should process exactly one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases, which is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is not the actual input format. Maybe the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample output is given as a list of outputs for each test case.\n\nBut this is conflicting. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m...\n\nSo, the code should process a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the sample input is formatted as multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one. But that's not possible. For example, in the sample input, the first test case's output is 3, the second is 1, third is 0. But the problem's sample input shows that the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code should process one. But that's not possible. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three test cases, and the sample output is given as a list of three outputs. So the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m, etc. So this suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. But how many? How to read them?\n\nIn programming competitions, sometimes the code is supposed to process multiple test cases until the end of input. For example, for each test case, read three lines. So the code can read all lines from stdin, split into groups of three lines, and process each group.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nWell, the code can read all the input as a list of lines, then process them in groups of three. For example, for each i in 0, 3, 6, ...:\n\nTake lines[i], lines[i+1], lines[i+2] as the three lines of a test case.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the sample input is not the actual input. Maybe the problem is that the user is supposed to read one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the problem's original input is for a single test case. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original input and output:\n\nThe problem says that the input is for a single test case. So the sample input shows three test cases, but that's just for the example. For example, the sample input is given as three different test cases, and the output is three answers. But the code should read one test case, process it, and output one answer.\n\nBut that would not match the sample input. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is given in a way that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input description is ambiguous.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original note, the sample input is given as a list of test cases, and the sample output is given as a list of outputs. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how?\n\nIn programming contests, sometimes the code must process multiple test cases, but the problem statement doesn't specify. But in this case, the sample input shows that the code should process multiple test cases, so perhaps the code should process all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, for each test case, the code reads three lines: first line n and m, then the a_i, then the b_j.\n\nSo the code can read all lines from stdin, split into groups of three lines. For example, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nThen, for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n\nprocess lines[i], lines[i+1], lines[i+2]\n\nBut perhaps the problem's input is for multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input description may have been wrong. But given the sample input and output, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input, the first test case is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nWhich is three lines. Then the second test case is:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\nThird test case is:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\nSo each test case is three lines. So the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read all lines, group them into triplets, and process each triplet as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead all lines.\n\nFor each group of three lines:\n\nProcess the first line as n and m.\n\nSecond line as a list of a_i.\n\nThird line as list of b_j.\n\nCompute the answer for each test case.\n\nPrint the answer for each test case.\n\nBut how to handle if the number of lines is not a multiple of three? Well, the problem says that the input is correct, so probably the code can assume that.\n\nBut in the sample input, the lines are three, six, nine, etc. So for example, the sample input has three test cases, each with three lines.\n\nSo the code should process each group of three lines.\n\nBut how to read that in Python?\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n and m\n\n        n, m = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        b = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        # process this test case\n\n        even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\n        even_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\n        odd_key = m - even_b\n\n        odd_chest = n - even_a\n\n        ans = min(even_a, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_b)\n\n        print(ans)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first test case's output is 3, which is correct. Let me check.\n\nYes, as discussed earlier.\n\nBut what about the third test case:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na is [10], even. even_a is 1.\n\nb is [20,30,40,50], all even. even_b is 4. So odd_key = 4 - 4 = 0. odd_chest is 1 - 1 = 0. So min(1, 0) is 0. min(0, 4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this code would work for the sample.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the input is not grouped properly? Well, assuming that the input is correct as per the problem's description.\n\nBut why does the problem's sample input show multiple test cases? Because in the problem statement, perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows that the code must process multiple test cases. But without more information, perhaps the problem is that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement, the original input is given as per one test case. However, the sample input has multiple test cases. This is conflicting. However, the sample output shows that the code must output multiple answers. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to confirm this? Let's look at the problem's original sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nWhich is one test case. Then another test case, etc. So the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n and m. So this is confusing.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement's sample input is not properly formatted. Alternatively, perhaps the problem statement's input is for a single test case, and the sample input shows three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample output shows three answers, which would imply that the code must process three test cases.\n\nBut in programming contests, it's common to have multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous. However, given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all test cases, process each as per the three lines.\n\nThus, the code I wrote earlier is correct.\n\nBut in the problem statement's original input description, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem's input is multiple test cases. But how to know?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one. However, that's not possible. For example, the sample input for the first test case is given as:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nWhich would produce output 3. But if the code is supposed to process only one test case, then the sample input is given as three lines. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code I wrote is correct.\n\nSo the code will read all lines, process them in groups of three, and for each group, compute the answer as described.\n\nNow, testing for edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, m=1. a=[1], b=[2]. Then even_a is 0, even_b is 1. odd_key is 0. odd_chest is 1. So min(0, 0) + min(1, 1) → 0 + 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, m=1. a=[2], b=[3]. even_a=1, even_b=0. odd_key = 1. min(1, 1) → 1. odd_chest is 0. min(0, 0) → 0. total 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. a=[1, 3], b=[2, 4]. even_a=0, even_b=2. odd_key = 0. So min(0, 0) is 0. odd_chest is 2. even_b is 2. min(2, 2) is 2. total 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2. a=[1,2], b=[3,4]. even_a=1, odd_chest=1. even_b=1, odd_key=1. So min(1,1) + min(1,1) → 1 +1=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut in the code, the lines are read as per the groups of three. However, in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the code uses split(), which handles that.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number. This translates to pairing even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Pairing Condition**: A chest with an even number can only be opened by a key with an odd number, and vice versa. Therefore, we need to count how many even and odd numbers are present in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Count Even and Odd Numbers**: For each test case, count the number of even and odd numbers in the list of chests and keys.\n3. **Determine Maximum Pairs**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the minimum of the number of even chests and odd keys plus the minimum of the number of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Read n and m\n        n, m = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n        idx += 1\n        # Read a_i\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        # Read b_j\n        b = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        \n        even_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n        even_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n        \n        odd_key = m - even_b\n        odd_chest = n - even_a\n        \n        ans = min(even_a, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_b)\n        print(ans)\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing multiple test cases.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Values**: For each test case, we count how many even numbers are in the list of chests (`even_a`) and keys (`even_b`).\n3. **Calculating Possible Pairs**: Using the counts of even and odd values, we determine the maximum number of valid pairs. This is done by taking the minimum of even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys.\n4. **Output the Result**: For each test case, the result is printed immediately after processing.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum number of chests that can be opened by leveraging the properties of even and odd numbers, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the size of the input.",
