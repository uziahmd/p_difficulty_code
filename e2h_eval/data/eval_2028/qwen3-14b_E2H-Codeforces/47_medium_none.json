    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the problem. Let's denote x = a +k and y = b +k. Then, since k is non-negative, x and y are at least a and b respectively, but since k can be added, they can be larger. But wait, since a and b are given, maybe we can express the difference between x and y. Let's see: since x = a +k, y = b +k, then y -x = b -a. So the difference between the two numbers is fixed. Let me call d = |a - b|. Without loss of generality, let's assume that a ≤ b. So, if a is less than b, then d = b - a. Then, the two numbers x and y would be such that y = x + d. So, the problem reduces to finding x such that x and x + d have the smallest possible LCM. And then k is x - a (since x = a +k → k = x -a). But since x must be ≥ a (because k ≥0), and also y = x +d must be ≥ b. But since d is b -a (if a ≤ b), then x +d = x + (b -a) = (a +k) + (b -a) = b +k. Which is correct. So the problem becomes: find x ≥ a, such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized, then compute k as x -a. And since x can be as small as a (when k=0), but maybe that's not the optimal choice.\n\nSo the key is to find x such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized. Let's think about how to compute that.\n\nThe LCM of two numbers x and y is (x * y) / GCD(x, y). Since y = x +d, then LCM(x, x +d) = x*(x +d)/GCD(x, x+d). But GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). Because GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). So the LCM can be written as x*(x +d)/g, where g is GCD(x, d).\n\nSo the problem is to minimize this value. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nLet me consider that d is fixed. Let me denote d as the absolute difference between a and b. So first, I can compute d = |a -b|. Let's assume a ≤ b, so d = b -a. Then, the problem becomes to find x ≥ a such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized.\n\nBut how do I find x?\n\nLet me think about the LCM formula again. Since x and x +d differ by d, their GCD is GCD(x, d). So for each x, the LCM is x*(x +d)/g, where g = GCD(x, d). To minimize this, perhaps we can find x such that GCD(x, d) is as large as possible, but also x and x +d are as small as possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when x is a divisor of d, or something like that. Or maybe when x is chosen such that x and x +d share a large common divisor.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample input: a=6, b=10. Then d = 4. The optimal x is 8 (since k=2, 6+2=8, 10+2=12). Then, GCD(8,4)=4. So LCM is 8*12 /4 = 24. If x was 6, then GCD(6,4) is 2, LCM is 6*10/2=30. Which is higher. So choosing x such that GCD(x, d) is larger gives better results.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal x is such that x is a multiple of some divisor of d. Let's think: For any x, GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. So, if I can find x such that GCD(x, d) is as large as possible, then maybe the LCM will be minimized.\n\nBut how to find that x?\n\nAlternatively, since x and x +d have GCD equal to GCD(x, d), perhaps we can think of x as being a multiple of some divisor of d. Let me think. Let me denote g = GCD(x, d). Then, since x = g * m, and d = g * n, where GCD(m, n) = 1. Then, since x +d = g(m +n). So the LCM of x and x +d is LCM(gm, g(m +n)) = g * m(m +n) / GCD(m, m +n). Since m and m +n are coprime? Because GCD(m, m +n) = GCD(m, n) = 1. So yes. Therefore, the LCM is g * m*(m +n) = g*m*(m +n). But since d = g*n, then n = d/g. So substituting, the LCM becomes g * m (m + d/g ). But since x = g*m, and x must be ≥ a.\n\nBut how does this help us? Well, for each possible divisor g of d, we can try to find m such that x = g*m is as small as possible, and then compute the LCM.\n\nAlternatively, since the LCM is g * m * (m + (d/g)), perhaps for each divisor g of d, we can find the minimal m such that x = g*m ≥ a. Then compute the LCM for that case and find the minimum among all possibilities.\n\nWait, but what if d is zero? That's when a = b. Then, the LCM of (a +k) and (a +k) is (a +k), so the minimal is achieved when k is zero, so output 0.\n\nSo first, handle the case when a == b. Then, the answer is 0.\n\nOtherwise, proceed with d = |a -b|.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nIf a == b: return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute d = |a - b|.\n\nThen, for all possible divisors g of d, find the minimal x such that x is a multiple of g, and x >= a. Then compute the LCM for that x and x +d, and track the minimum.\n\nAdditionally, we need to check the case where x is such that x is not a multiple of any divisor of d, but perhaps that's already covered by considering all possible divisors of d?\n\nWait, no. Because for any x, the GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. So, for each x, there exists a divisor g of d, which is GCD(x, d). So, for each possible divisor g of d, we can find the minimal x that is a multiple of g, and then compute the corresponding LCM.\n\nBut how to find all possible divisors of d?\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\n- Generate all divisors of d.\n\n- For each divisor g of d, compute the minimal x such that x is a multiple of g, x >= a, and then compute the LCM for that x and x +d.\n\n- Also, perhaps consider other possibilities? Or is that sufficient?\n\nWait, for example, suppose that the optimal x is not a multiple of any divisor of d. But that's not possible because x's GCD with d is a divisor of d. So, for that x, there is a g which is GCD(x, d), which divides d. So, the optimal x must be considered under that g.\n\nSo, the idea is that for each possible divisor g of d, we can find the best x that is a multiple of g, and then compare all those possibilities.\n\nBut how to find the best x for each g?\n\nFor a given g, which is a divisor of d, we want to find the minimal x such that x is a multiple of g, x >= a, and then compute the LCM.\n\nBut why? Because for that x, the GCD(x, d) is at least g. Wait, no. If x is a multiple of g, then GCD(x, d) could be equal to g, or a multiple of g. But since g is a divisor of d, then d = g * k. So, if x is a multiple of g, then x = g * m. Then, GCD(g*m, g*k) = g * GCD(m, k). Since d = g*k, and k is d/g. So, for example, if we choose x = g*m, then GCD(x, d) = g * GCD(m, k), where k = d/g.\n\nBut in this case, for the LCM calculation, we have:\n\nLCM(x, x +d) = x*(x +d)/GCD(x, x +d) = x*(x +d)/g', where g' is GCD(x, d) = g * GCD(m, k).\n\nBut how does this relate to our previous approach?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal LCM occurs when GCD(x, d) is as large as possible. So for each possible g (divisor of d), we can find the minimal x that is a multiple of g, and then compute the LCM. But perhaps there's a way to find the optimal x for each g.\n\nWait, perhaps for each divisor g of d, the optimal x is the minimal x ≥ a such that x is a multiple of g. Because then, the LCM for that x would be minimal for that particular g.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's take an example.\n\nTake d = 4 (from the first sample). Its divisors are 1, 2, 4.\n\nLet's take g = 4. Then, x must be a multiple of 4. The minimal x ≥ a (which is 6). So x is 8. Then, x +d is 12. LCM(8,12) is 24.\n\nIf we take g=2. Then, x must be a multiple of 2. The minimal x ≥6 is 6. Then, x +d is 10. LCM(6, 10) is 30. Which is higher than 24.\n\nIf we take g=1. Then x can be 6. LCM(6, 10) is 30 again. So in this case, the minimal is found when g=4.\n\nAnother example: suppose d=6, and a=5. So, the possible divisors of d are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nFor g=6: x must be a multiple of 6, and >=5. So x=6. Then x +d is 12. LCM(6,12) is 12.\n\nFor g=3: x must be multiple of 3. Minimal x is 6. Then x +d is 6 +6=12. LCM is 12. Same as before. So, but perhaps there's a smaller x?\n\nWait, if x is 3, but since a is 5, x has to be >=5. So the minimal x for g=3 is 6.\n\nSo, in this case, both g=3 and g=6 give the same LCM. However, when choosing the minimal k, since k is x -a, for x=6, k is 1. So in this case, the minimal k is 1.\n\nBut what if there's another x that isn't a multiple of any divisor of d? Well, according to earlier reasoning, that's not possible. Because for any x, GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d, so it's covered by one of the divisors.\n\nThus, the approach would be:\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g of d, compute the minimal x that is a multiple of g, and x >= a. Then compute the LCM for x and x +d. Then, among all these possibilities, select the one with the minimal LCM. If there are multiple, select the one with the smallest k (i.e., the smallest x).\n\nBut wait, perhaps there are other candidates besides the minimal x for each divisor. For example, perhaps for some g, there is a larger x (but still a multiple of g) which gives a smaller LCM. How can we know?\n\nLet me think. Suppose for a given g, the minimal x is m. Then, perhaps taking x = m + t * (d/g) ?\n\nWait, since d = g * k, where k is d/g. Then, x is a multiple of g. Let me write x = g * m. Then, x +d = g*m + g*k = g*(m +k). So the LCM(x, x +d) is LCM(gm, g(m +k)) = g * LCM(m, m +k). Since m and m +k are coprime? No, because k = d/g. But since d = g*k, and g is a divisor of d, and k is d/g. But m can be any integer.\n\nBut LCM(m, m +k) = m*(m +k) / GCD(m, m +k) = m*(m +k)/GCD(m, k). Because GCD(m, m +k) = GCD(m, k). So the LCM becomes g * m*(m +k) / GCD(m, k).\n\nBut since k is fixed (for a given g), how can we minimize this expression?\n\nFor example, if we take m as small as possible (so x is minimal), then perhaps that gives the minimal value. Because increasing m would increase the product m*(m +k). So, perhaps the minimal x for each g is the best candidate.\n\nSo, for each divisor g of d, compute the minimal x (>=a) that is a multiple of g, and then calculate the LCM for that x and x +d.\n\nBut how to find the minimal x for each g?\n\nWell, for a given g, the minimal x >= a that is a multiple of g is:\n\nif a % g == 0, then x = a.\n\nelse, x = ((a // g) + 1) * g.\n\nOnce we have that x, compute the LCM.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nCompute d = |a -b|.\n\nIf d is 0, return 0.\n\nElse:\n\nFind all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g:\n\n   compute x_candidate = minimal multiple of g >=a.\n\n   compute y_candidate = x_candidate + d.\n\n   compute LCM(x_candidate, y_candidate).\n\n   keep track of the minimal LCM and corresponding k.\n\nAdditionally, there's another possibility: perhaps x_candidate is not the minimal for that g, but for some other x (like x_candidate - g?), but that would be less than a. So no, because x must be >=a.\n\nWait, but what if there's a x that is not the minimal multiple of g, but gives a smaller LCM? For example, let's say g is a divisor of d, and the minimal x is m. But if there's a larger x (like m + t * ...), which may have a higher GCD with d, leading to lower LCM?\n\nWait, but for that x, the GCD(x, d) would be higher than g? Because x is a multiple of g, but maybe of a higher divisor of d. For example, suppose d is 4, and g is 2. Then x_candidate is 6. But x_candidate is 6, which is a multiple of 2, but GCD(6,4) is 2. However, if we take x= 8, which is a multiple of 4 (another divisor of d), then GCD(8,4) is 4. So in that case, the LCM for x=8 is better than for x=6. But when we process g=2, we would have considered x=6, but when processing g=4, we would have considered x=8. So in that case, the code would have considered both possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the approach of considering all divisors of d and for each, the minimal x (multiple of g) >=a, is sufficient.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g in divisors:\n\n   compute x_candidate = smallest multiple of g >=a.\n\n   compute the LCM(x_candidate, x_candidate +d).\n\n   keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, select the k that gives the minimal LCM, and if there are ties, the smallest k.\n\nBut wait, what about when the optimal x is not a multiple of any divisor of d? But according to the earlier reasoning, that's not possible. Because x's GCD with d is a divisor of d, so it's covered in the list of divisors.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nCompute d = abs(a -b)\n\nif d == 0:\n\n   return 0\n\nelse:\n\n   generate all divisors of d\n\n   for each divisor g in divisors:\n\n       compute x_candidate as the minimal multiple of g >=a\n\n       compute the LCM of x_candidate and x_candidate +d\n\n       track the minimal LCM and corresponding k (x_candidate -a)\n\n   also, perhaps we need to check the same for the divisors of d, but also for the case where the minimal x is not a multiple of g but ... no, because the divisors cover all possibilities.\n\nBut how to generate all the divisors of d?\n\nWell, for that, we need to factorize d into its prime factors, then generate all possible products. But for d up to 1e9, this is feasible.\n\nBut how to generate all divisors of a number?\n\nFirst, find all primes factors of d, then generate all combinations.\n\nAlternatively, for numbers up to 1e9, trial division is feasible.\n\nSo, the code steps for generating divisors:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5)+1):\n\n        if n % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nWait, but this would generate all divisors of n.\n\nYes, for example, for 4, the divisors are 1, 2, 4.\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, we can process them.\n\nBut what about when d is 0? Well, that's handled earlier.\n\nNow, once we have all the divisors, for each of them, compute x_candidate.\n\nOnce we have all possible x_candidate and their corresponding LCMs, we can select the one with the minimal LCM. If there are multiple x_candidates with the same minimal LCM, we choose the one with the smallest k (i.e., the smallest x_candidate, since k = x_candidate -a).\n\nBut wait, for example, two different divisors g1 and g2 could lead to the same LCM. How to compare?\n\nSo, the code needs to track for all possible candidates (each generated from a divisor g) the LCM value, and the k value. Then, among all these candidates, find the one with the minimal LCM. If multiple, choose the one with the smallest k.\n\nSo, the code would generate all these candidates, collect them in a list, and then select the best one.\n\nBut what about cases where there's a better x that is not generated by any of the divisors? According to previous reasoning, that's not possible. So this approach should cover all possibilities.\n\nLet me test this with the sample input.\n\nSample 1: a=6, b=10 → d=4. Divisors are 1,2,4.\n\nFor each divisor:\n\ng=1:\n\nx_candidate is the minimal multiple of 1 >=6 → 6. Then, x_candidate +d is 10. LCM(6,10)=30.\n\ng=2:\n\nx_candidate is 6 (since 6 is multiple of 2). LCM(6, 10) is 30.\n\ng=4:\n\nx_candidate is 8. LCM(8, 12) is 24.\n\nSo the minimal is 24, with k=8-6=2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: input 5 10 → a=5, b=10. d=5. Divisors are 1,5.\n\nFor g=1: x_candidate is 5. LCM(5, 10) is 10.\n\nFor g=5: x_candidate is 5. LCM(5, 10) is 10. So same LCM. So the k is 0. Which is the correct answer.\n\nAnother sample input: 21 31. a=21, b=31 → d=10. Divisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\nFor each:\n\ng=1: x_candidate is 21. x_candidate +d=31. LCM(21,31) = 651.\n\ng=2: minimal multiple of 2 >=21 is 22. x_candidate=22. x_candidate +d=32. LCM(22,32) = 352.\n\ng=5: minimal multiple of 5 >=21 is 25. x_candidate=25. x_candidate +d=35. LCM(25,35) is 175.\n\ng=10: minimal multiple of 10 >=21 is 30. x_candidate=30. x_candidate +d=40. LCM(30,40)= 120.\n\nSo the minimal is 120. But the sample output is 9. Let's check what k is here. For x_candidate=30, k is 30-21=9. Which matches the sample output. So yes.\n\nSo the approach seems to work.\n\nNow, what about other possible candidates? Let's think of another example. Suppose a=3, b=5. d=2. Divisors are 1,2.\n\nFor g=1: x_candidate is 3. LCM(3,5) is 15.\n\nFor g=2: x_candidate is 4. LCM(4,6) is 12. So the minimal is 12, k=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=7, b=15 → d=8. Divisors of 8 are 1,2,4,8.\n\nFor each:\n\ng=1: x=7 → LCM(7,15)=105.\n\ng=2: x=8 → LCM(8, 16) = 16.\n\ng=4: x=8 → LCM(8, 16) = 16.\n\ng=8: x=8 → same as above.\n\nSo the minimal LCM is 16, with k=1.\n\nBut what if there is a better x that is not a multiple of any divisor of d? For example, suppose x= 8 is the minimal for g=2, but maybe x= 0? No, because x must be >=a=7. So no.\n\nSo the approach seems valid.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, handling the case when a and b are equal. Then, the answer is 0.\n\nNow, for generating the divisors of d. Let's code a function to generate all divisors of a number.\n\nBut for d=0? Well, the code handles that before.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d = abs(a -b).\n\nif d ==0:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   generate all divisors of d.\n\n   for each divisor g in divisors:\n\n       compute x_candidate = ?\n\n       then compute LCM of x_candidate and x_candidate +d.\n\n   find the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nBut how to compute LCM?\n\nIn Python, we can compute GCD using math.gcd, but note that math.gcd returns positive integers, and for Python 3.5+, it's in math.\n\nBut since LCM(a,b) = a*b // GCD(a,b).\n\nSo, for two numbers x and y, LCM is x*y // gcd(x,y).\n\nBut in our case, x_candidate and x_candidate +d.\n\nBut for each candidate, we can compute this.\n\nSo, for each divisor g, compute x_candidate as follows:\n\nx_candidate = ((a + g -1) // g) * g\n\nWait, yes. For example, if a is 6 and g is 4: (6 +4-1) //4 → (9)//4=2 → 2*4=8. Correct.\n\nIf a is 6 and g is 2: (6 +2-1)//2 →7//2=3 → 3*2=6. Correct.\n\nSo that formula works.\n\nOnce x_candidate is computed, compute y_candidate = x_candidate +d.\n\nThen compute LCM(x_candidate, y_candidate).\n\nNow, collect all these (LCM, k) pairs, and select the one with minimal LCM, and minimal k in case of tie.\n\nBut how to generate all the divisors of d?\n\nLet me code that.\n\nBut for d up to 1e9, the trial division is acceptable.\n\nSo, code:\n\ndef get_divisors(n):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) +1):\n\n        if n % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(n//i)\n\n    return divisors\n\nBut for n=0? Well, in our code, d is not zero here.\n\nOnce we have the divisors, process each of them.\n\nNow, collect all possible candidates.\n\nOnce all candidates are processed, select the best one.\n\nBut what about the case when there are multiple divisors leading to same LCM? For example, in the first sample, when d=4, the divisors 2 and 4. For g=4, x_candidate=8, LCM 24. For g=2, x_candidate=6, LCM 30. So the minimal is 24.\n\nSo, the code would generate all candidates, and select the best.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nCompute d = abs(a -b).\n\nif d == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    min_lcm = infinity\n\n    best_k = infinity\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        # compute x_candidate\n\n        x = ((a + g -1) // g) * g\n\n        y = x + d\n\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n        current_lcm = x * y // current_gcd\n\n        # compare with min_lcm\n\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and (x -a) < best_k):\n\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            best_k = x -a\n\n        # Also, perhaps check x_candidate - g? No, because that would be less than a.\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM? For example, if two different divisors generate same LCM but different k. We need to choose the smallest k.\n\nBut in the code above, for each candidate, we check if current_lcm is less than the current min, or equal but with smaller k.\n\nBut how to initialize min_lcm and best_k?\n\nInitially, min_lcm can be set to a very high value (like infinity), and best_k as infinity.\n\nBut in code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    d = abs(a - b)\n\n    if d == 0:\n\n        print(0)\n\n        return\n\n    def get_divisors(n):\n\n        divisors = set()\n\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) +1):\n\n            if n % i == 0:\n\n                divisors.add(i)\n\n                divisors.add(n//i)\n\n        return divisors\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    best_k = float('inf')\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        # compute x_candidate\n\n        x = ((a + g -1) // g) * g\n\n        y = x + d\n\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n        current_lcm = x * y // current_gcd\n\n        # compare\n\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and (x -a) < best_k):\n\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            best_k = x -a\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nWait, but what about when there are multiple divisors that generate the same LCM but different k? For example, in the case where two different divisors generate the same LCM but different k values, the code will pick the one with the smallest k.\n\nBut what if there are multiple candidates for the same divisor? For example, for a particular g, there might be multiple x_candidates? No, because for each g, we are considering only the minimal x_candidate (the smallest multiple of g >=a). So for each g, only one candidate is considered.\n\nBut is this sufficient? Are there cases where a higher x_candidate for a certain g would lead to a better LCM?\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nSuppose d=6, a=5. Divisors are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nFor g=3, the minimal x is 6. LCM(6, 6+6=12) is 12.\n\nBut what if x was 3? But since a is 5, that's invalid. So no.\n\nAnother example: d=6, a=3. Then for g=3, x_candidate is 3. LCM(3, 9) is 9. But what if x is 3 + 6 =9? Then LCM(9, 15) is 45. Which is worse. So taking the minimal x_candidate is better.\n\nAnother example: d=6, a=4. For g=3, the minimal x_candidate is 6. LCM(6, 12) is 12. If there was a higher x_candidate, say 6 + 6=12. Then LCM(12, 18) is 36. Which is worse.\n\nThus, taking the minimal x_candidate for each g is sufficient.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when there's a divisor g that is not considered? For example, suppose d=4, but the code generates all divisors. So no.\n\nBut let's test another example. Let's take a=7 and b=15. d=8. Divisors are 1, 2,4,8.\n\nFor each:\n\ng=1 → x_candidate=7. y=15. LCM(7,15)=105.\n\ng=2 → x_candidate=8. y=16. LCM(8,16)=16.\n\ng=4 → x_candidate=8. y= 16. LCM same as before.\n\ng=8 → x_candidate=8. same.\n\nSo the best is 16, k=1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=2, b=5. d=3. Divisors are 1,3.\n\nFor g=1: x_candidate=2. y=5. LCM 10.\n\nFor g=3: x_candidate is 3. y=6. LCM 6. So best is 6, k=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=5. d=2. Divisors are 1, 2.\n\nFor g=1: x_candidate=3 → LCM(3,5)=15.\n\nFor g=2: x_candidate=4 → LCM(4,6)=12. So best is 12, k=1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: a=4, b=7. d=3. Divisors 1,3.\n\ng=1: x_candidate=4. LCM(4,7)=28.\n\ng=3: x_candidate=6. LCM(6, 9) = 18. So k is 2.\n\nWhich is better.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nBut what about when the minimal LCM comes from a different divisor?\n\nBut according to the code, all divisors are considered.\n\nNow, what about when d is a large number, say 1e9. Then, the code will generate all divisors. For example, if d is a prime number, then the divisors are 1 and d. So the code will process those.\n\nBut for numbers with many divisors, the code may take longer, but for 1e9, the maximum number of divisors is manageable. For example, 1e9 = 2^9 * 5^9. The number of divisors is (9+1)*(9+1) = 100. So the code can handle that.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input where the answer is 0. For example, a=5, b=10. Then d=5. Divisors are 1,5.\n\nFor g=1: x_candidate is 5. LCM(5, 10) is 10.\n\nFor g=5: x_candidate is 5. LCM(5, 10) is 10. So the code will choose between them. Since both have same LCM, the code will select the one with the smallest k. Since x-a is 0 for both, the best_k is 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 21 31. d=10. Divisors are 1,2,5,10.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the code would generate for each g:\n\ng=1 → x=21 → LCM(21,31) = 651.\n\ng=2 → x=22 → LCM(22, 32) = 352.\n\ng=5 → x=25 → LCM(25,35)= 175.\n\ng=10 → x=30 → LCM(30,40) = 120.\n\nSo best is 120, k=30-21=9. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code must read the input, process as per above.\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since x and y are positive, no problem.\n\nBut also, note that when we compute x and y, since x = a +k, and y = b +k, and since a and b are positive, and k is non-negative, x and y are positive.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut also, note that in the code, the function get_divisors is inside the main function. But that's okay.\n\nWait, but in Python, the code may have to import math.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    d = abs(a - b)\n\n    if d == 0:\n\n        print(0)\n\n        return\n\n    def get_divisors(n):\n\n        divisors = set()\n\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) +1):\n\n            if n % i == 0:\n\n                divisors.add(i)\n\n                divisors.add(n//i)\n\n        return divisors\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    best_k = float('inf')\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        # compute x_candidate\n\n        x = ((a + g -1) // g) * g\n\n        y = x + d\n\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n\n        current_lcm = x * y // current_gcd\n\n        # compare\n\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and (x - a) < best_k):\n\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            best_k = x - a\n\n    print(best_k)\n\nBut wait, in the code, the divisors are generated as a set, but when iterating over them, the order is arbitrary. However, since for each divisor, the code checks all possibilities, the order doesn't matter.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM and different k?\n\nFor example, if two different divisors generate the same LCM but different k. The code will compare and take the one with smaller k.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing the code with the samples:\n\nSample 1: Input 6 10 → output 2. As discussed.\n\nSample 2: 21 31 → output 9.\n\nSample 3: 5 10 → output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=3, b=5 → output 1.\n\nAnother case: a=7, b=15 → output 1.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple divisors leading to same LCM?\n\nFor example, a=5, b=15. d=10. Divisors are",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest non-negative integer $ k $ such that the least common multiple (LCM) of $ a + k $ and $ b + k $ is minimized. If there are multiple values of $ k $ that yield the same minimal LCM, we choose the smallest $ k $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to minimize the LCM of two numbers $ a + k $ and $ b + k $. This can be transformed by recognizing that the difference between these two numbers is constant, equal to $ |a - b| $.\n2. **Key Insight**: The LCM of two numbers $ x $ and $ y $ can be expressed as $ \\text{LCM}(x, y) = \\frac{x \\cdot y}{\\text{GCD}(x, y)} $. Here, the difference between $ x $ and $ y $ is fixed, so we can focus on minimizing the LCM by considering divisors of this fixed difference.\n3. **Divisors of Difference**: By generating all divisors of the absolute difference $ d = |a - b| $, we can explore potential values of $ k $ that might minimize the LCM.\n4. **Optimal $ k $ Calculation**: For each divisor $ g $ of $ d $, compute the smallest value $ x $ such that $ x $ is a multiple of $ g $ and $ x \\geq a $. From this, derive the corresponding $ k $ and calculate the LCM for each candidate $ x $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    d = abs(a - b)\n    if d == 0:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    def get_divisors(n):\n        divisors = set()\n        for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                divisors.add(i)\n                divisors.add(n // i)\n        return divisors\n    \n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n    best_k = float('inf')\n    \n    for g in divisors:\n        # Compute the minimal x >= a that is a multiple of g\n        quotient = (a + g - 1) // g\n        x = quotient * g\n        y = x + d\n        current_gcd = math.gcd(x, y)\n        current_lcm = x * y // current_gcd\n        # Update the best_k if needed\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and (x - a) < best_k):\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n            best_k = x - a\n    \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values $ a $ and $ b $ are read from standard input.\n2. **Difference Calculation**: Compute the absolute difference $ d $ between $ a $ and $ b $. If $ a $ equals $ b $, the answer is immediately 0 since the LCM of the same number is the number itself.\n3. **Divisor Generation**: Generate all divisors of $ d $ using trial division up to the square root of $ d $.\n4. **Candidate Evaluation**: For each divisor $ g $, compute the smallest multiple of $ g $ that is at least $ a $. Calculate the corresponding $ y $ value and the LCM of the pair. Track the minimum LCM and the corresponding $ k $.\n5. **Result Output**: After evaluating all divisors, print the smallest $ k $ that yields the minimum LCM.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down potential candidates for $ k $ by leveraging properties of divisors and LCM, ensuring optimal performance even for large input values.",
