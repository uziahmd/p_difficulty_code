    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment during the file copying process. Both progress bars are updated after each byte is copied. The first bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, and the second shows the overall percentage across all files. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer.\n\nSo the task is to find all such numbers that exist in both progress bars at the same time.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key is to simulate all possible moments when a byte is copied and check for each moment what the two percentages are. Then collect all values that are present in both.\n\nBut since there are multiple files, each with up to 1000 bytes, and n up to 100, the total number of bytes could be up to 100 * 1000 = 100,000. For each byte, we can compute the two percentages and track when they are equal.\n\nWait, but even for 1e5 bytes, processing each one would be manageable. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, calculate the total size of all files, let's call it total_size. Then, for each byte copied (each x in each file), compute:\n\nFor the current file i, the current byte x (from 1 to a_i), the first percentage is floor(100 * x / a_i). But wait, the problem says that after copying the x-th byte of file i, the first bar shows that value. Also, the second bar shows floor(100 * (sum of previous files + x) / total_size).\n\nBut the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. So we need to include that as well. However, according to the problem statement, the initial state is considered as 0% for both. But when does that happen? At the very beginning, before any bytes are copied. Then, after each byte, the progress bars are updated.\n\nSo the possible moments are:\n\n- Before any bytes are copied: both are 0. So 0 is definitely in the answer.\n\nBut then, for each byte copied (each x in 1..a_1, then 1..a_2, etc.), we need to compute the two percentages.\n\nBut how do we track the sum of previous files?\n\nLet me think. For example, for the i-th file, the sum of previous files is sum_prev = a_1 + ... + a_{i-1}. Then, when we copy the x-th byte of the i-th file, the total bytes copied so far is sum_prev + x.\n\nSo for each file i, and for each x from 1 to a_i, we can compute:\n\ncurrent_percent = floor(100 * x / a_i)\noverall_percent = floor(100 * (sum_prev + x) / total_size)\n\nWe need to check if current_percent equals overall_percent. If so, add that value to the set of answers.\n\nAdditionally, we have the initial state (0%) which is always present. Also, after all bytes are copied, both bars show 100% (since for the last byte, the overall is sum_prev + x = total_size, so 100 * total_size / total_size = 100.0, which floors to 100. Similarly, for the current file, x is a_i, so 100 * a_i / a_i = 100. So 100 is also present.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the values are updated after each byte. So for the last byte, the progress bars are updated once. So 100% is included.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- Compute the total_size.\n\n- For each file i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n   - sum_prev = sum of a_1 to a_{i} (wait no, sum_prev is the sum of a_1 to a_{i-1}?)\n\nYes. For the i-th file (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), let's think of the files as 1-based. For the i-th file, sum_prev is the sum of the first i-1 files. Then, for each x in 1..a_i:\n\n   current_percent = floor( (100 * x) / a_i )\n\n   overall_percent = floor( 100 * (sum_prev + x) / total_size )\n\n   check if current_percent == overall_percent. If yes, add to the set.\n\nAdditionally, the initial 0% is present. Also, after all bytes are copied, both are 100% (so 100 is added).\n\nBut wait, when x is 0? Because the initial state is 0% for both. But according to the problem statement, the initial state is considered as both being 0. However, the problem says that the progress bars are updated after each byte. So the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So how do we capture that?\n\nWell, in our simulation, when x=0 for the first file (but that's not part of the loop). So perhaps we need to include 0% as a possible value. But how?\n\nBecause when all the bytes are copied, the final state is 100% for both. So for the initial state, we can add 0 to the set. But in the code, we need to make sure that 0 is included. However, during the simulation, when x=0, but that's not part of the loop. For example, when no bytes are copied, the sum_prev + x is 0, so the overall percent is 0. And the current percent is 0 (since x is 0, but that's not part of any file's x. So maybe the initial state is handled by checking if 0 is present. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the initial state is both 0. So that's a moment where both are 0. So 0 must be included in the answer. However, during the simulation, when we process each byte, we may miss that initial 0. So we need to add 0 to the set unless it's already captured by some other condition.\n\nBut in the simulation, when x=0 for the first file, but that's not part of the loop. So perhaps the code should start by adding 0 to the set. Then, process all the bytes, and check for the percentages. Also, after processing all bytes, check if 100 is present.\n\nWait, but in the case of the first example input, which is n=1, a_1=6. The output includes 0 and 100. So during the simulation, for each x from 1 to 6, the current percent is floor(100x/6), and the overall percent is floor(100*(x)/6). So for x=1, 100/6 is 16.666..., which floors to 16. So both are 16. So 16 is added. Similarly, for x=6, 100*6/6 = 100, which is 100. So 100 is added. So in the code, the initial 0 is added, and the 100 is added via the simulation. So the code must handle that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize a set of valid percentages. Start by adding 0 to the set.\n\nThen, for each file i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n   sum_prev = sum of the first i files (assuming 0-based here?)\n\nWait, let's think again. Let's say the files are stored in a list called a. For the i-th file (starting from 0 to n-1), the sum_prev is the sum of a[0] to a[i-1]. For example, for the first file (i=0), sum_prev is 0.\n\nThen, for each x in 1 to a[i], the total bytes copied is sum_prev + x. So for each x, compute the two percentages.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nCompute total_size = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set called result = {0}.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = sum of a[0] to a[i-1]\n\n   for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n       total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n       overall_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_size\n\n       if current_percent == overall_percent:\n\n           add to result\n\nAlso, after processing all the bytes, check if 100 is in the result. Because when x reaches the last byte of the last file, the overall percent is 100. But in the code above, for the last byte, the total_bytes is sum_prev + x = total_size, so 100 * total_bytes / total_size = 100.0, which is floored to 100. So for that x, the code will add 100 to the set. However, if the last byte is processed, then the code would have added 100. But what if the code doesn't? For example, if the total_size is zero? No, since a_i >=1.\n\nSo the code as described will capture 100% if it occurs during the simulation. However, the initial 0 is added, and the 100% is added if it occurs. But what if the code misses it? Let's take the first example. The code adds 0. Then, for x=6, the current percent is 100*6//6 = 100, and the overall percent is 100*6//6 = 100. So 100 is added. So the code includes 0 and 100.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the output includes 0 and 100. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if the total_size is 0? Well, the problem says that each a_i is at least 1. So total_size is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n, then the list a.\n\nCompute total_size = sum(a).\n\nInitialize a set, say, seen = {0}.\n\nThen for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = sum(a[0..i-1])\n\n   for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n       current_p = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n       total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n       overall_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_size\n\n       if current_p == overall_p:\n\n           seen.add(current_p)\n\nThen, after all that, collect all elements in seen, sort them, and output.\n\nWait, but what about the 100% case? For example, when the last byte is copied. Let's say the total_size is 1000. Then, when the last byte is copied, the total_bytes is 1000. So 100*1000/1000 = 100.0, which is floored to 100. So the code would add 100 to the set. But if the code is written as above, then yes.\n\nBut what if the last byte's current_p is 100, and the overall_p is 100. So yes, it is added.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the code adds 0, then for x=1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_p is 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. The overall_p is same as current_p. So all of these are added. So the set is {0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100} which matches the first sample output.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the next thing is to compute sum_prev for each i. How to compute sum_prev?\n\nWe can precompute a prefix sum array. For example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc. Then, for the i-th file (0-based), sum_prev is prefix_sums[i].\n\nFor example, for i=0 (the first file), sum_prev is prefix_sums[0] = 0.\n\nSo the code can compute prefix_sums as follows:\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, for the i-th file (0-based), sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the list a as integers.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nCompute total_size = prefix_sums[-1]\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nThen, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   file_size = a[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to file_size:\n\n       current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n       total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n       overall_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_size\n\n       if current_p == overall_p:\n\n           add to the set.\n\nOnce all that is done, collect the elements in the set, sort them, and print them separated by newlines.\n\nWait, but the sample input for the first case is:\n\nInput: 1\\n6\n\nOutput: 0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100\n\nWhich matches the code's approach.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nInput: 2\\n100 500\n\nTotal size is 600.\n\nFor the first file (100 bytes), sum_prev is 0.\n\nFor x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_p is (100x)/100 = x. So current_p is x.\n\noverall_p is (100*(0 + x)) / 600 = (x/6) floored.\n\nSo for current_p to equal overall_p, x must equal floor(x/6). But x ranges from 1 to 100.\n\nFor example, when x=0, but that's not part of the loop. For x=1: current_p is 1, overall_p is 0. Not equal. For x=6: current_p is 6, overall_p is 1. Not equal. For x=60: current_p is 60, overall_p is 60*100/600 = 10. So not equal. So during the first file, there are no matches except possibly when x=0 (which is already handled by the initial 0).\n\nThen, for the second file, sum_prev is 100. The file size is 500. For x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_p is (100x)/500 = x/5, floored.\n\noverall_p is (100*(100 +x )) / 600.\n\nSo for example, when x=500, total_bytes is 600. So overall_p is 100. current_p is 100*500 /500 = 100. So 100 is added.\n\nBut during the second file, when x is 500, it's added. Also, perhaps other values.\n\nBut according to the sample output for the second input, the output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. So how does that happen?\n\nWell, during the second file, let's see. Let's take x such that the overall_p is 95. Let's compute:\n\noverall_p = floor(100*(100 +x)/600) = 95.\n\nSo 95 ≤ 100*(100 +x)/600 < 96.\n\nMultiply all by 600:\n\n95*600 ≤ 100*(100 +x) < 96*600\n\n=> 57000 ≤ 100*(100 +x) < 57600\n\nDivide by 100:\n\n570 ≤ 100 + x < 576\n\nSubtract 100:\n\n470 ≤ x < 476.\n\nSince x ranges from 1 to 500, x can be 470 to 475 (inclusive). For those x, the overall_p is 95.\n\nAt the same time, current_p is floor(100x /500) = floor(0.2x).\n\nSo for x in 470-475:\n\n0.2x is 94, 94.0, 94.0, 94.0, 94.0, 94.0?\n\nWait 470 * 0.2 is 94.0. 475 * 0.2 is 95.0. So floor(0.2x) for x in 470 to 474 is 94, and for x=475, it is 95.\n\nSo for x=470-474, current_p is 94, which is not equal to overall_p (95). Only when x=475, current_p is 95. So overall_p is 95. So 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for other values.\n\nSo the code would capture these points. Thus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all possible cases. Now, the question is about efficiency. For n up to 100, and each a_i up to 1000, the total number of iterations is 100 * 1000 = 10^5, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n from stdin.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nCompute total_size.\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nProcess each file and x.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead input:\n\nBut the input is given as, for example, in the sample input, the first input is ['1\\n6', ...], but in reality, the input comes from stdin. So the code needs to read from stdin.\n\nWait, the user provided some examples of input and outputs. But the actual code should read from stdin. So the code should read n from stdin, then the next line as the list of a_i.\n\nIn Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen compute prefix_sums.\n\nprefix_sums = [0]*(n+1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\ntotal_size = prefix_sums[-1]\n\nseen = {0}\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    file_size = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n        current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n        overall_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_size\n        if current_p == overall_p:\n            seen.add(current_p)\n\nThen, collect the elements in seen, sort them, and print each on a separate line.\n\nBut wait, the sample output for the first input includes 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. So the code adds 0, then for each x, adds the current_p if equal to overall_p. For the first case, the code adds 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. So the set is {0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100} which is correct.\n\nBut what about the case when the same value is added multiple times? The set handles that.\n\nOnce the set is built, we need to output the elements in sorted order.\n\nSo:\n\nsorted_result = sorted(seen)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n\nBut wait, in the sample outputs, the first sample output is:\n\n0\n16\n33\n50\n66\n83\n100\n\nWhich matches the sorted list.\n\nBut what about the case when 100 is added? For example, the last byte of the last file. The code will add it if the current_p and overall_p are equal. Which they are.\n\nBut what if the code misses 100%? For example, if the last byte is copied, and the current_p is 100 and overall_p is 100. So yes, added.\n\nBut what if the code doesn't process the last byte? No, because for the last file, x runs from 1 to a[i], which includes the last byte.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, test the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nThe output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nLet me see. How does 95 get into the set?\n\nAs discussed earlier, during the second file, x=475.\n\ncurrent_p = (100 * 475) // 500 = (47500) // 500 = 95.\n\ntotal_bytes = 100 + 475 = 575. total_size is 600.\n\noverall_p = (100 * 575) // 600 = 57500 // 600 = 95.833... → 95. So yes, equal. So 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for other values.\n\nBut how do 96, 97, 98, 99 get added?\n\nLet me think for 96:\n\noverall_p = 96 → 96 ≤ 100*(sum_bytes)/total_size < 97 → sum_bytes is between (96 * 600)/100 = 576 and (97 * 600)/100 = 582. So sum_bytes is between 576 and 581 (inclusive).\n\nsum_prev is 100, so x = sum_bytes - 100. So x ranges from 576 - 100 = 476 to 581 - 100 = 481.\n\ncurrent_p is (100 * x) // 500 = (x * 100) // 500 = x // 5.\n\nFor x in 476 to 481:\n\nx//5:\n\n476 /5 = 95.2 → 95\n\n477 → 95.4 → 95\n\n478 → 95.6 → 95\n\n479 → 95.8 → 95\n\n480 → 96 → 96\n\n481 → 96.2 → 96\n\nSo for x=480 and 481, current_p is 96. So for sum_bytes = 100 + 480 = 580 → overall_p is 100 * 580 /600 = 96.666... → 96. So current_p is 96, which equals overall_p. So 96 is added.\n\nSimilarly for other values. So the code would capture these cases.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case when the same value is generated multiple times? The set takes care of duplicates.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nNow, check for edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, a=[1]. Then total_size=1. For x=1:\n\ncurrent_p = 100*1//1=100. overall_p=100*1//1=100. So 100 is added. So the set is {0,100}.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, a=[1,1]. total_size=2.\n\nFor first file:\n\nsum_prev=0, x=1:\n\ncurrent_p=100*1//1=100. overall_p=100*1//2 = 50. Not equal.\n\nFor second file, sum_prev=1. x=1:\n\ncurrent_p=100*1//1=100. overall_p= (100*(1+1))/2 = 100. So 100 is added. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[2, 2]. total_size=4.\n\nFirst file:\n\nsum_prev=0, x=1: current_p=50, overall_p= (1*100)/4 = 25 → not equal.\n\nx=2: current_p=100, overall_p= (2*100)/4=50 → not equal.\n\nSecond file:\n\nsum_prev=2.\n\nx=1: current_p=50. overall_p= (2+1)*100/4 = 75 → 75. Not equal.\n\nx=2: current_p=100. overall_p= (2+2)*100/4 = 100 → equal. So 100 added.\n\nSo the set is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[3, 3]. total_size=6.\n\nFirst file:\n\nx=1: current_p=33, overall_p= 100*1/6 = 16 → no.\n\nx=2: 66, 33 → no.\n\nx=3: 100, 50 → no.\n\nSecond file:\n\nsum_prev=3.\n\nx=1: current_p=33. overall_p= (3+1)*100/6 = 400/6=66.666 → 66. Not equal.\n\nx=2: current_p=66. overall_p= (3+2)*100/6= 500/6=83.333 → 83. Not equal.\n\nx=3: current_p=100. overall_p= (3+3)*100/6= 100 → yes. So 100 is added.\n\nSo the set is {0, 100}.\n\nBut what about when during the second file, for x=3, the current_p is 100 and overall_p is 100. So yes.\n\nAnother case: when during the process, some value is hit multiple times. For example, n=1, a=[2]. Then total_size=2.\n\nFor x=1: current_p=50, overall_p=50 → added. So the set is {0,50, 100}.\n\nThus, the code would capture that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut in Python, when reading the input, sometimes the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but split() handles that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(n):\n    prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\ntotal_size = prefix_sums[-1]\n\nseen = {0}\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    file_size = a[i]\n    for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n        current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n        overall_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_size\n        if current_p == overall_p:\n            seen.add(current_p)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(seen)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n\nWait, but in the sample input 2, the output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Let's see if the code would generate that.\n\nBut according to the code, for the second sample input, the code would add 0, and then during the processing of the second file, various values.\n\nBut how does 99 get added?\n\nFor example, let's take overall_p=99. So:\n\noverall_p = floor(100 * total_bytes / total_size) = 99.\n\ntotal_bytes is in [ (99 * total_size)/100 , (100 * total_size)/100 )\n\ntotal_size is 600. So:\n\n99 * 600 / 100 = 594.\n\n100 * 600 / 100 = 600. So total_bytes is in [594, 600).\n\nBut sum_prev is 100. So x = total_bytes - sum_prev = total_bytes - 100.\n\nSo total_bytes ranges from 594 to 599 (since 600 is excluded).\n\nx ranges from 594 - 100 = 494 to 599 - 100 = 499.\n\nFor x in 494 to 499:\n\ncurrent_p = (100 * x) // 500 = (x * 100) // 500 = x//5.\n\nLet's compute for each x:\n\nx=494: 494//5 = 98.8 → 98. So current_p=98. overall_p is 99. Not equal.\n\nx=495: 495//5 = 99. So current_p=99. overall_p is (100*(100+495))/600 = (100*595)/600 = 59500 / 600 = 99.166..., which is floored to 99. So current_p equals overall_p. So 99 is added.\n\nSimilarly for x=495, 496, 497, 498, 499?\n\nWait, for x=495: total_bytes = 100+495=595 → 595*100/600 = 99.166... → 99.\n\ncurrent_p is 495//5 = 99. So added.\n\nx=496: total_bytes = 596 → 596*100/600 = 59600 / 600 = 99.333... → 99. current_p is 496//5 = 99.2 → 99. So yes, added.\n\nSame for x=497: 497//5=99.4 → 99.\n\nx=498: 498//5=99.6 → 99.\n\nx=499: 499//5=99.8 → 99.\n\nSo all these x's (495-499) would have current_p=99 and overall_p=99. So 99 is added.\n\nThus, the code would add 99. Similarly for 95, 96, 97, 98, etc.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother edge case: when the total_size is 1. Then, for any x=1, the overall_p is 100. And current_p is 100. So 0 and 100 are in the set.\n\nAnother edge case: when all files are size 1. For example, n=3, a=[1,1,1]. total_size=3. For each byte:\n\nFirst file:\n\nx=1: current_p=100, overall_p= (1*100)/3 = 33. So no.\n\nSecond file: sum_prev=1. x=1: current_p=100, overall_p= (1+1)*100/3 = 66.666 → 66. No.\n\nThird file: sum_prev=2. x=1: current_p=100, overall_p= (2+1)*100/3=100 → yes. So 100 is added. Also, initial 0. So output is 0 and 100.\n\nThus, code seems correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars during the file copying process. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: Compute prefix sums to efficiently determine the cumulative size of files up to each point.\n3. **Simulate Copying Process**: For each byte copied in each file, calculate the current and overall progress percentages.\n4. **Check for Matching Percentages**: Track all values where both progress bars show the same percentage.\n5. **Output Results**: Print the sorted list of all such values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    \n    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n    \n    total_size = prefix_sums[-1]\n    seen = {0}\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n        file_size = a[i]\n        for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n            current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n            total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n            overall_p = (100 * total_bytes) // total_size\n            if current_p == overall_p:\n                seen.add(current_p)\n    \n    sorted_result = sorted(seen)\n    for num in sorted_result:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of files and their sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: This helps in quickly determining the cumulative size of files up to each file, which is necessary for calculating the overall progress percentage.\n3. **Simulating Copying Process**: For each byte copied in each file, we compute the current progress percentage for the file and the overall progress percentage across all files.\n4. **Tracking Matching Percentages**: Using a set, we track all values where both progress percentages match. This ensures that each value is only recorded once.\n5. **Output**: The results are sorted and printed in ascending order, ensuring the required format is met.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the copying process and checks for matching progress percentages, ensuring correctness and optimal performance given the constraints.",
