    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all n where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, no, the sample input was m=5, and the output was 5 numbers. Oh right, the first example input is m=5, and the output is 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Wait, but why?\n\nWait for m=5, the trailing zeros for 5! is 1 (since 5/5=1). But that's not matching. Oh wait, no, the sample input says that for m=5, the output is 5 numbers. Let me check that. Oh the sample input is given as ['1', '5'], which probably represents two test cases. The first input is 1, output is 5 numbers. Wait, no, the first sample input is m=1, and the output is 5 numbers? Wait the example says:\n\nInput is 1, output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. Wait, but for m=1, the numbers n where n! has exactly 1 trailing zero. Let's see:\n\nFor n=5: 5! = 120 → 1 zero. n=6: 720 → 1. n=7: 5040 → 1. n=8: 40320 → 1. n=9: 362880 → 1. Then n=10: 3628800 → 2 zeros. So yes, the numbers 5-9 inclusive (5 numbers) have exactly 1 trailing zero. So the first sample input is m=1, output is 5 numbers. But the example shows input as ['1', '5'], which perhaps is two test cases. The output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'] — so when m=5, the answer is zero? Or maybe that's another example. Well, regardless, the problem is to find for given m, the possible n's.\n\nSo the main idea is: For a given m, find all n such that the number of trailing zeros in n! is exactly m.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nFirst, let's think about how to find the possible n's. Let's think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nWe need to find all n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut for each m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 possible n's? Wait, in the sample case for m=1, there are 5 numbers. How does that happen?\n\nBecause when you increase n, the count of trailing zeros increases. However, when n crosses a multiple of 5, the count increases by more than 1. For example, when n=25, the count increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So, between certain ranges, the count may stay the same for several n's, but when you hit a multiple of 5, it jumps.\n\nWait, but for example, for numbers between 5 and 9, the count is 1. Then for n=10, it's 2. So, when m is 1, there are 5 numbers (5-9). But for m=2, the numbers would be 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Wait, but what about 15? Let's see. For 15! the count is floor(15/5) + floor(15/25) = 3 + 0 = 3. So 15 is part of m=3. So for m=2, the numbers would be 10-14, which is 5 numbers. But wait, what about when there's a jump of more than 1. For example, when n=24, the count is floor(24/5) + floor(24/25) = 4 + 0 =4. For n=25, it's 6 (since 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). So between 25 and 29, the count is 6. So for m=5, there is no n. Because between 24 (count 4) and 25 (count 6), there's a jump. So m=5 would have no solution. Hence the second sample input where m=5 gives output 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given m, whether there exists n's such that f(n)=m. And if so, how many, and what they are.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Then check if there are consecutive numbers after that which also have f(n) = m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the range of n's where f(n) equals m. But how to find that?\n\nThe key is to find the lower and upper bounds of n for which f(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think about binary search. For example, to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m, and then check if that value is exactly m. Similarly for the maximum n where f(n) = m.\n\nBut perhaps for a given m, there is a range of n's where f(n) equals m. For example, in the first case, m=1, the range is 5 to 9. So the count is 5 numbers.\n\nBut how to find the lower and upper bounds of n for which f(n) = m?\n\nLet me think. Let's first find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Then find the maximal n such that f(n) = m. Then the count is max_n - min_n + 1, if such numbers exist.\n\nBut how to find min_n and max_n?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Or maybe other numbers?\n\nWait, the count can be 0, 1, or 5? Let's think. For example, when m is such that there's a jump of 2, like from 4 to 6. Then m=5 would have no solutions. But for m=6, the numbers would be 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. So 5 numbers again. So in general, for m that can be achieved, there are 5 numbers except for some cases?\n\nWait, but what if the jump is more than 2? Like, for example, if there's a number that adds 3 to the count. For example, n=125. The count for 125 is 31 (125/5=25, 25/5=5, 5/5=1, total 25+5+1=31). For 124, the count is 24 + 4 + 0 = 28? Wait:\n\nWait, 124/5 is 24.8 → floor 24. 124/25 is 4.96 → 4. 124/125 is 0. So total is 24+4=28. Then 125! has 25 + 5 + 1 = 31. So between 124 and 125, the count increases by 3. So for m=29, 30, 30, 31?\n\nWait, m=29 would have no solution. Because for n=124, the count is 28. For n=125, it's 31. So between 124 and 125, there's a jump of 3. So m=28, 29, 30 would not have any solution. But m=31 would have numbers from 125 to 129 (assuming that for 125 to 129, the count is 31). Let me check:\n\nFor n=125, count is 31.\n\nn=126: same as 125, since adding 126 doesn't add any 5s. So count is 31.\n\nSame for 127, 128, 129. So for m=31, there are 5 numbers (125-129). So even with a jump of 3, the numbers for m=31 would be 5 numbers.\n\nSo the pattern seems that for any m that is achievable, there are exactly 5 numbers. Except when the jump is 1. Wait, no. Wait, for example, if the jump is 1, like between 4 and 5. For example, m=4. Let's see:\n\nn=20: count is 4 + 0 = 4. Then n=21, 22, 23, 24: their count is 4. Then n=25: count is 6. So for m=4, the numbers are 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. That's 5 numbers. So again 5 numbers.\n\nSo the conclusion is: for any m that is achievable, there are exactly 5 numbers n that satisfy f(n) = m. Except when the jump is more than 1. Wait, but in the case where the jump is more than 1, there are some m's that are not achievable. For example, when the jump is from 4 to 6, m=5 is not achievable. So for m=5, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem:\n\n1. Check if there exists any n such that f(n) = m. If not, output 0.\n\n2. If there are such n's, find the first n where f(n) = m, then the next four numbers (since there are 5 numbers in a row).\n\nBut how to find if such n exists?\n\nLet me think. The approach could be:\n\n- Find the smallest n such that f(n) = m.\n\n- Then check if the next four numbers (n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4) also have f(n) = m.\n\nBut how to find that smallest n?\n\nAlternatively, find the lower and upper bounds for n where f(n) = m.\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this low. Then check if f(low) is m. If not, then there is no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call this high. Then the numbers between low and high-1 are the ones where f(n) = m. So the count is high - low.\n\nWait, for example, in the first case where m=1:\n\nlow is the minimal n where f(n) >= 1. Which is 5. Then high is the minimal n where f(n) >= 2. Which is 10. So high - low is 5. Which is the count of numbers (from 5 to 9 inclusive). So that works.\n\nSimilarly, for m=5, let's find low and high.\n\nFind low as the minimal n where f(n) >=5. Let's see:\n\nn=20: f(20) is 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nn=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So the minimal n where f(n) >=5 is 25. But f(25) is 6, which is larger than 5. Therefore, there is no n with f(n) =5. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo this approach seems valid.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor a given m:\n\n- Find the minimal n_low where f(n_low) >= m.\n\n- Check if f(n_low) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n- Find the minimal n_high where f(n_high) >= m+1.\n\n- The count is n_high - n_low.\n\n- Then the numbers are n_low, n_low+1, ..., n_high-1.\n\nSo the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to compute n_low and n_high?\n\nTo find the minimal n where f(n) >= m, we can use binary search.\n\nBecause f(n) is a non-decreasing function. For example, as n increases, f(n) can stay the same or increase.\n\nSo for binary search, we can find the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\nSimilarly for m+1.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement a helper function count_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, for a given m, perform binary search to find the lower and upper bounds.\n\nOnce we have n_low and n_high, check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, then there are no solutions. Else, the answer is the numbers from n_low to n_high -1, inclusive.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n_with_count_ge(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m: output 0\n\nelse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n_with_count_ge(m+1)\n\nthen the numbers are from n_low to n_high -1. The count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to find find_min_n_with_count_ge(target)?\n\nWe can perform binary search between low=0 and high=5*target (since for target m, the minimal n is at most 5*m. Because each multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5. So for example, m=1, 5*1=5. For m=5, 5*5=25, which is the minimal n where count is 6, but that's for target=5. Hmm, but maybe the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. Let me think. For example, for target m, the minimal n is such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Since count_zeros(5*m) is at least m (since 5*m /5 = m, plus higher terms). So 5*m is a safe upper bound.\n\nSo the binary search for find_min_n_with_count_ge(target) can be done between 0 and 5*target.\n\nBut for large m (like 1e5), 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nSo the code for binary search:\n\ndef find_min_n_with_count_ge(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nOnce this is found, check if count_zeros(low) == target.\n\nBut for the case when target is m, and the minimal n_low is such that count_zeros(n_low) is m. Then proceed.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, the code for count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, let's take the sample input m=1:\n\nfind_min_n_with_count_ge(1) would be 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\nThen find_min_n_with_count_ge(2) is 10.\n\nso the numbers are 5 to 9 (inclusive), which is 5 numbers.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input m=5:\n\nfind_min_n_with_count_ge(5) is 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So output 0.\n\nWhich matches the second sample.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute n_low = find_min_n_with_count_ge(m).\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute n_high = find_min_n_with_count_ge(m+1).\n\nthen the numbers are from n_low to n_high-1.\n\nthe count is n_high - n_low.\n\nthen output the count and the numbers.\n\nBut what about the case when m is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So the input m is at least 1.\n\nBut in code, we need to handle m=0? No, because the input constraints say 1<=m<=1e5.\n\nSo now, the code.\n\nBut let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: m=0. But input is m >=1.\n\nCase 2: m=6. For example, when n=25, count is 6. Then n_high is find_min_n_with_count_ge(7). Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) = 6. For m=6, the n_high is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7. Let's compute:\n\nfor 25: 6.\n\nfor 29: count_zeros(29) is 29//5=5, 29//25=1, total 6. Still 6. For 30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7. So n_high is 30. So the numbers are 25-29, which is 5 numbers. So the code would output 5 numbers.\n\nAnother case: m=6, the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nAnother edge case: when m is such that there's only one n. Wait, is that possible? Let's think. Suppose that for some m, the minimal n_low is such that count_zeros(n_low) = m, and n_high is n_low +1. Then the count is 1. How can that happen?\n\nFor example, suppose that m is the count_zeros(n) for some n, and the next number (n+1) has count_zeros(n+1) = m+1. So the range is from n_low to n_high-1, which is n_low to (n_low +1 -1) = n_low. So the count is 1. How can that happen?\n\nLet me think. For example, when n is 24. count_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 = 4. Then n=25: count_zeros is 6. So for m=4, the n_high is 25. So the numbers are from 20 to 24. Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, for m=4, find_min_n_with_count_ge(4) is 20. Because count_zeros(20) is 4. Then find_min_n_with_count_ge(5) is 25. So the numbers are 20-24, which is 5 numbers. So that's 5 numbers. So in this case, even though the jump from 24 to 25 is +2, the code still gives 5 numbers.\n\nSo when can the count be 1?\n\nIt seems that it's not possible. Because for any m, the numbers that have f(n) = m must be consecutive. Because when you increase n by 1, the count can increase by 0 or 1 or more. So if there's a jump of more than 1, then between the previous count and the next, there's a gap. But the code would capture that by checking if the minimal n_low has count m, and then the next numbers would be up to n_high-1.\n\nWait, but for example, let's imagine that m is 5. Let's say that the minimal n_low for m=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6. So the code returns 0. So no solution.\n\nAnother example, let's take m=31. For n=125, count is 31. Then the next numbers up to 129 will have the same count. So n_high for m=31 is find_min_n_with_count_ge(32). Let's compute that. For n=130, count_zeros(130) is 130//5 = 26, 130//25=5, 130//125=1. Total 26+5+1=32. So n_high is 130. So the numbers are 125 to 129 (5 numbers). So the code works.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement the binary search function to find the minimal n with count >= target.\n\nThen, for the given m, find n_low and check if count_zeros(n_low) == m. If not, output 0. Else, find n_high and output the numbers from n_low to n_high-1.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nBut for the binary search function, how to implement it?\n\nLet me write a helper function called find_min_n(target) which returns the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut the input is a single integer m. So in Python, read m as int(input()).\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is given as a list, but perhaps the actual input is a single line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes.\n\nSo the code should read m as input().strip().\n\nBut in the sample input, it's given as ['1', '5'], which perhaps is two test cases. But the problem says that the code should read input from stdin, which for each run is a single m. So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the code needs to process a single m per run. So for example, the first sample input is m=1, output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. The second sample input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code should read m from input, and process it.\n\nSo code outline:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nThen:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    k = n_high - n_low\n\n    print(k)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nWait, but the code for the output is to print k followed by the numbers. For example, in the first sample, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nBut when you do range(n_low, n_high), since n_high is the first number where count_zeros is >= m+1. So the numbers from n_low to n_high-1. So the range is from n_low to n_high-1 inclusive. So the code should generate list(range(n_low, n_high)).\n\nYes. Because in Python, range(a, b) includes a, a+1,..., b-1.\n\nSo the code for the output part is:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nBut for the case when k is zero, we print 0. But that's handled by the first condition.\n\nTesting the sample input m=1:\n\nn_low = 5, count_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\nn_high = find_min_n(2). Let's compute that.\n\nfind_min_n(2) would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=2. Which is 10. So the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers. So the code outputs 5 followed by the list.\n\nAnother sample input m=5:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(5) → which is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So output 0.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nBut what about when m is 6?\n\nn_low = find_min_n(6) → which is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So proceed. n_high is find_min_n(7) → which is 30. So the numbers are 25-29 (5 numbers). Correct.\n\nAnother case: m=31. n_low is 125, n_high is 130. So the numbers are 125-129.\n\nNow, what about when m is very large, like 1e5. How efficient is this code?\n\nThe binary search for each find_min_n is O(log(5*target)), and for each step, count_zeros is O(log n). For m up to 1e5, 5*m is 5e5. The count_zeros for 5e5 is O(log 5e5) steps. So the code is efficient enough for Python.\n\nBut what about the case when m is 1e5. Let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(1e5) would be in the range up to 5e5. The binary search would take about 20 steps. Each step requires count_zeros, which for 5e5 is about 6 steps (since 5e5 /5 = 1e5, then divided by 5 again, etc. So 1e5 is 5^5 is 3125, 5^6 is 15625, 5^7 is 78125, 5^8 is 390625, 5^9 is 1953125. So for 5e5, the count_zeros would be 5e5//5 + 5e5//25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 128, 000 something. So for m=1e5, the code would find n_low and n_high.\n\nBut the code would handle that.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin and write to stdout. Also, note that for the output, when k is zero, we print 0. Else, print k followed by the numbers.\n\nSo the code:\n\nBut in Python, for the case when k is zero, we print 0. Else, print k and the numbers.\n\nBut in code:\n\nm = int(input())\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = n_high - n_low\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first case outputs '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So for k=5, the code prints 5 followed by the numbers. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the numbers are more than 5? Well, according to our analysis, it's impossible. Because the code would return n_high -n_low, which is the count of numbers. But according to the previous analysis, for any valid m, the count is 5. But is that always true?\n\nWait, for example, if m is such that there's a jump of 1. Let's take m=4. The numbers are 20-24 (5 numbers). For m=28, the numbers are 115-119 (since 115//5=23, 115//25=4, 115//125=0. Total 23+4=27. Wait, no. Let me compute count_zeros(115):\n\n115//5 = 23, 23//5=4, 4//5=0. So total 23+4=27. So for m=27, the numbers would be 115-119. For m=28, the code would find n_low as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=28. Let's see:\n\nWhat is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) is 28?\n\nLet's compute for n=116, 117, 118, 119, 120.\n\ncount_zeros(119) is same as 115, which is 27. For n=120: 120//5=24, 24//5=4, 4//5=0. Total 24+4=28. So the minimal n_low for m=28 is 120. Then n_high is find_min_n(29). Let's compute that.\n\ncount_zeros(120) is 28. For m=29, find_min_n(29) would be 125. Because count_zeros(125) is 31. So the code would return 125 as n_high. So the count is 125-120=5 numbers: 120, 121, 122, 123, 124. Which is 5 numbers. So yes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother case: m=28. The code would return 5 numbers. So the code seems to work.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, testing for m=5, the code returns 0.\n\nBut what about when m is 6, which is possible?\n\nYes, as discussed earlier.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut in Python, for the case when m is 0, but the problem says m starts from 1. So no problem.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut when m is 1, the code returns 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input m=5 would output 0.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input m=5:\n\nn_low = find_min_n(5) → which is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So 6 !=5 → output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for the case where m is 0, but according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code may have a problem with the upper bound of 5*target. For example, when target is very large, like 1e5. 5*target is 5e5, but the actual n_low could be higher than that? No, because for target m, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m is at most 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m (since 5*m//5 = m, and higher terms add more). So the upper bound is safe.\n\nBut for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. But for example, count_zeros(5e5) is 5e5//5 + 5e5//25 + ... = 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 128, 000+ something. Which is way larger than m=1e5. So the code would find the minimal n_low in the binary search between 0 and 5*m. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of values for $ n $ that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n2. **Counting Trailing Zeros**: A helper function `count_zeros(n)` calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5, 25, 125, etc., until the quotient is zero.\n3. **Binary Search for Bounds**: Using binary search, we find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least $ m $. This helps us determine the lower bound of $ n $ values that could potentially satisfy the condition.\n4. **Check Validity**: After determining the lower bound, we check if it indeed results in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If not, there are no valid $ n $ values. If valid, we then determine the upper bound by repeating the process for $ m+1 $ and compute the range of valid $ n $ values.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nn_low = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(n_low) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    n_high = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = n_high - n_low\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(n_low, n_high))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by summing the integer divisions of $ n $ by increasing powers of 5.\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to efficiently find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the given target value.\n3. **Main Logic**: The main part of the code reads the input $ m $, determines the lower bound $ n_{\\text{low}} $ using `find_min_n(m)`, checks if this bound indeed results in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If valid, it finds the upper bound $ n_{\\text{high}} $ for $ m+1 $ and prints the range of valid $ n $ values.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the valid range of $ n $ values using binary search, making the solution both optimal and easy to understand.",
