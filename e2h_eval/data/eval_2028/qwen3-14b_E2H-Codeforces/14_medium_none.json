    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the trailing zero count is exactly m. Let's think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros. This function is non-decreasing as n increases. So for example, when n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases by 1 or more.\n\nWait, but when you go from n to n+1, the count can increase by 0 or 1. Wait, no. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, adding 1 to n would add another 5. But if n is a multiple of higher powers like 25, then adding 1 would add more. Wait, no. Wait, for example, when n=24, f(24) is 4 (since 24/5=4.8 → 4, 24/25=0.96 → 0). Then n=25, f(25) is 6 (25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). So between 24 and 25, the count jumps by 2. So that means that for m=5, there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros? Wait, but wait, for n=25, it's 6. So for m=5, maybe there are some numbers between 24 and 25? But that's impossible. So that suggests that for certain values of m, there are no n's. For example, m=5 would have no solution. But how?\n\nWait, let's check. Let's compute the trailing zeros for numbers around 25:\n\nn=24: 24//5 = 4, 24//25=0. Total 4. So 4 zeros.\n\nn=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1. Total 6. So 6 zeros. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 trailing zeros. Therefore, for m=5, the answer is zero. Which matches the sample input's second example where m=5 outputs 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find all n where f(n) = m. But since f(n) can have jumps, there might be cases where there are no solutions. So how do I find the possible n's?\n\nThe approach I need to take is:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Then check if there are consecutive numbers that also have the same count. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the range of n's where f(n) equals m. But how?\n\nLet me think. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, the numbers n that satisfy f(n)=m must form a contiguous range. Because once f(n) increases beyond m, it can't come back. So for example, if there exists some n where f(n) = m, then there's a lower bound and upper bound for n where this holds.\n\nBut how to find this range?\n\nFirst, we can find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the smallest n where f(n) = m, and then find the largest n where f(n) = m. The numbers between them (inclusive) would be the possible n's.\n\nBut how to find the smallest and largest n for which f(n) = m?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible n's are in a range where the count is exactly m. Let's think about how to find the first occurrence of m.\n\nLet me think about binary search. For example, to find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this low_n. Then check if f(low_n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal n where f(n) = m, and then find the maximum n where f(n) = m. The difference between these two plus one would be the count of numbers.\n\nBut how to find the maximum n where f(n) = m. Well, the maximum n would be the minimal n where f(n) = m+1 minus 1. Because once f(n) reaches m+1, all numbers after that will have at least m+1 zeros. So the maximum n with exactly m zeros is the minimal n where f(n) = m+1 minus 1.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n_low where f(n_low) = m. Then find the minimal n_high where f(n_high) = m+1. Then the numbers from n_low to n_high - 1 are the numbers that have exactly m zeros. So the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nBut how to find n_low and n_high?\n\nBut how to find the minimal n where f(n) equals m. Well, perhaps using binary search.\n\nBut first, the function f(n) can be calculated as follows:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's the standard way to compute the number of trailing zeros.\n\nSo, for example, if I want to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m, I can use binary search. Let me think about that.\n\nThe minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m is the lower bound. Let's call this lower_n. Then, if count_zeros(lower_n) is exactly m, then the numbers from lower_n up to (upper_n - 1) where upper_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1 will be the numbers that have exactly m zeros.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input m=1:\n\nFind the lower_n for m=1. Let's see. For n=5, count_zeros(5) is 1. So lower_n is 5. Then upper_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 2. That would be 10, since count_zeros(10) is 2. So the numbers are from 5 to 9 inclusive. That's 5 numbers, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the number of n's is upper_n - lower_n. But wait, upper_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So the numbers from lower_n to upper_n - 1 are the ones with exactly m zeros. So the count is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nBut how to compute lower_n and upper_n?\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. For the given m, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. If there's no such n (i.e., if count_zeros(n) jumps over m), then the answer is 0.\n\nBut how to check that? Well, if the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m is such that count_zeros(n) is greater than m, then there's no solution. So, for example, if m=5, then the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25, which has 6 zeros. So no solution.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- Compute the lower_n as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n- Check if count_zeros(lower_n) == m. If not, then output 0.\n\n- Else, compute upper_n as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\n- The numbers from lower_n to upper_n - 1 are the valid n's. The count is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nThus, the number of valid n's is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nBut how to compute lower_n and upper_n?\n\nWe can use binary search for both. Let's think about the binary search for finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe binary search for lower_n:\n\nThe possible range of n is from 1 to 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m (since 5*m /5 = m, and higher divisions contribute more). But perhaps even a higher upper bound is needed. However, for binary search purposes, we can set the upper limit as 5*m. Or maybe 5*m is sufficient. For example, m=1, 5*1=5, which is the correct n. For m=6, 5*6=30. count_zeros(30) is 7 (30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7). So maybe 5*m is not enough. Wait, but for m=6, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) is 6 is 25. Because count_zeros(25) is 6. So 25 < 5*6=30. So the upper bound can be 5*m. But perhaps for larger m, the upper bound needs to be higher. Wait, for example, m=100000, then 5*m is 500000. But the actual n could be higher? Let me think. For example, for m=100000, the minimal n is such that count_zeros(n) = m. How big can that n be?\n\nWell, the count_zeros(n) is roughly n/5 + n/25 + n/125 + ... which is approximately n/4. So for m=100000, n is about 4*m. So setting the upper bound as 5*m is safe. So for binary search, the upper bound can be set to 5*m.\n\nSo the binary search for lower_n would be between low=0 and high=5*m. Wait, but for the case where m is 0, but in our problem m is at least 1. So for our problem, the code can proceed.\n\nSo, the binary search for finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m:\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = 5*m.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n      high = mid\n\n   else:\n\n      low = mid + 1\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce we have that, we check if count_zeros(low) == m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, we proceed.\n\nThen, for upper_n, we do the same for m+1. So find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the numbers from lower_n to upper_n - 1 are the valid numbers.\n\nSo the count is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nBut then, what if upper_n is not found? Well, for m+1, the same logic applies. But since m can be up to 1e5, and 5*m is manageable, the binary search should work.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor the input m:\n\nCompute lower_n = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m: output 0\n\nelse:\n\n   compute upper_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n   the valid numbers are from lower_n to upper_n - 1 inclusive.\n\n   the count is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nBut wait, what if m is such that there are multiple numbers in that range? Like in the sample input m=1, lower_n is 5, upper_n is 10. So 10-5=5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9).\n\nYes. So the code would generate that list.\n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute lower_n for m.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(lower_n) is m.\n\nIf not, output 0.\n\nElse, compute upper_n for m+1.\n\nThen, the numbers are from lower_n to upper_n -1.\n\nSo the number of such numbers is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nBut how to handle the case where m is such that there is no upper_n? Well, for m+1, the upper_n will be found, because for any m, there exists some n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Because count_zeros(n) increases as n increases.\n\nSo the code can proceed.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, write the count_zeros function.\n\nNow, the problem is to read m from input, then process as per above.\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows that for m=1, the output is 5 numbers. Let's test the code:\n\nFor m=1:\n\nlower_n is 5 (count_zeros(5)=1).\n\nupper_n is find_min_n(2). Let's see what that is.\n\nFor m=2, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=2.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1, count_zeros(10) is 2. So the minimal n is 10. So upper_n is 10. So the valid numbers are from 5 to 9 inclusive. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=5.\n\nCompute lower_n for m=5. Let's find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet's compute count_zeros(24) is 4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0). count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So the answer is 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=6. The lower_n is 25 (count_zeros(25) is 6). upper_n is find_min_n(7). Let's compute for m=7.\n\nWhat is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7?\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6, count_zeros(29) is 6 (29//5=5, 29//25=1, total 6). count_zeros(30) is 7 (30//5=6, 30//25=1, total 7). So upper_n is 30. So the valid numbers are 25 to 29, which is 5 numbers. So the answer would be 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, implement this.\n\nBut first, the code needs to handle m=0? No, according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement a function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nThen, for the given m:\n\nCompute lower_n = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   upper_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n   the numbers are from lower_n to upper_n -1.\n\n   the count is upper_n - lower_n.\n\n   output the count followed by the numbers in order.\n\nBut for large m, say 1e5, the upper_n could be up to 5*(m+1), which is 5*1e5+5, which is manageable.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nBut first, the code must read m from input. The input is a single integer m.\n\nBut looking at the sample input, the first example input is ['1', '5']? Wait, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nBut the sample input shows something different. Wait, the sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, maybe the sample input is for multiple test cases? But the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is a list of inputs, each being a separate case. But the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. Maybe the sample input is presented as two test cases, but in reality, the code should read a single m from input.\n\nBut looking back, the original problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input, m is 1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. For the second sample input, m is 5, output is 0.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the user wrote ['1', '5'], which may be a way to represent two test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin, so perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem description says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut that seems to suggest that there are two test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps this is a formatting error. Maybe the sample input is for two different test cases, but the actual code is supposed to handle one test case.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code should read a single integer m from input. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the first case is m=1 and the second is m=5. But in reality, the code is supposed to read one m per run.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So the code should process a single m.\n\nTherefore, the code should read m from input, process it, and output the required answer.\n\nSo, the code will be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nThen compute the answer as discussed.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for m=1, the output is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\" (the first case), and for m=5, output is 0. So the code must handle that.\n\nNow, coding:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement the binary search function to find the minimal n for a target.\n\nBut in Python, how to implement that?\n\nLet me write the code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nThen, for the given m:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    upper_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = upper_n - lower_n\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower_n, upper_n))))\n\nWait, but the output requires that after printing k, the numbers are printed in increasing order. So for example, in the first sample, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is exactly range(lower_n, upper_n). Because upper_n is 10, so range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, the range in Python is exclusive of the upper bound. So range(lower_n, upper_n) gives numbers from lower_n to upper_n -1 inclusive. Which is exactly what we need.\n\nBut the code for the else part is:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint(' '.join(...))\n\nBut for the sample input, the first case would print 5 followed by the numbers. However, in the sample output, the first line is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' — meaning that the first line is the k, and the second line is the numbers. But according to the problem statement, the output should first print k, then print the numbers in increasing order.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nFirst print k — the number of values of n ... Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\nSo the output should be two lines. For example, for the first sample, the output is:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nBut in the sample given, the output is written as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'], which perhaps represents two test cases. But for the code, when given m=1, the code should output two lines: first the k, then the numbers.\n\nBut in the code above, the code would print k, then print the numbers. However, the code as written would print k followed by the numbers on the same line? No, because the code does:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint('...')\n\nWhich would print two lines. For example, for the first sample, the first print is 5, then the next line is the numbers.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9', which is two lines. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what about when k is zero? Then, the code prints 0, and then nothing else. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the code, when k is zero, the code prints 0. But in the else clause, when the code is not zero, it prints k and the numbers.\n\nBut for the case where the count_zeros(lower_n) != m, the code prints 0, and that's it. Which is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code for m=5:\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(5). Let's compute that.\n\nfind_min_n(5) is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\ncount_zeros(24) is 4, count_zeros(25) is 6. So the binary search would find 25 as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Then, count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So the code would print 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. lower_n is 25, count_zeros(25)=6. Then upper_n is find_min_n(7). Let's compute that. For target=7.\n\nThe minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7 is 25? No. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6, count_zeros(29) is 6. count_zeros(30) is 7. So find_min_n(7) returns 30. So upper_n is 30. So the numbers are 25 to 29 inclusive. Which is 5 numbers. So the code would output 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nAnother test case: m=2. lower_n is 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. upper_n is find_min_n(3). What's the minimal n for target=3?\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). So the minimal n is 15. So the numbers are 10 to 14 inclusive. Which is 5 numbers. So 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. So the code outputs 5 followed by these numbers.\n\nBut wait, what about n=15? count_zeros(15) is 3. So for m=2, the upper_n is 15. So the range is 10-14, which is 5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when m is very large, say 1e5? The code should handle it. Let's think about the binary search. For m=1e5, the upper bound is 5*1e5 = 500000. The binary search would take log2(5e5) steps, which is about 20 steps. Each step involves count_zeros, which is O(log n) steps. So overall, the code is efficient enough for m up to 1e5.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut need to read m from input, and output the correct answer.\n\nBut the code as written:\n\nBut in the code, the function find_min_n uses 5*target as the upper bound. For target= m, which can be up to 1e5, 5*target is 5e5. Which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\nlower_n = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    upper_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = upper_n - lower_n\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower_n, upper_n))))\n\nWait, but for the case where k is zero? No, because in the else clause, we have already checked that count_zeros(lower_n) == m. So upper_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So upper_n is at least lower_n +1. Because for example, if lower_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m, then upper_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So upper_n - lower_n is the count of numbers between lower_n and upper_n -1, inclusive. Which is upper_n - lower_n numbers.\n\nBut what if upper_n is lower_n? That can't happen, because count_zeros(lower_n) is m, and upper_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So for upper_n to be equal to lower_n, count_zeros(lower_n) must be >= m+1. But since count_zeros(lower_n) is m, that's not possible. Hence, upper_n is strictly larger than lower_n. So k is at least 1.\n\nBut in code, for example, if m is 6, upper_n is 30, lower_n is 25. So k is 5.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test the case where m=0. But according to the problem statement, m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nBut for m=0, the code would return 0, but since m is not allowed, it's not a problem.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1. The code returns 5, and the numbers 5-9.\n\nSample input 2: m=5, returns 0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. The code returns 5 numbers.\n\nNow, what about m=2?\n\nThe code returns 5 numbers (10-14).\n\nBut what if m=3? Let's compute:\n\nlower_n for m=3 is 15 (count_zeros(15)=3). upper_n is find_min_n(4). Let's compute that. The minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=4 is 20? Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(15)=3, count_zeros(20) is 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0). So upper_n is 20. So the numbers are 15-19, which is 5 numbers. So yes.\n\nSo the code returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python. But note that for large m, the 5*target may be too big. For example, m=1e5, 5*1e5=5e5. But for count_zeros(5e5) is 5e5//5 + 5e5//25 + ... which is 1e5 + 2e4 + 4e3 + ... which is way larger than m=1e5. So the binary search will find the correct n.\n\nBut what if the target is so large that 5*target is not enough? For example, for m=1e5, perhaps the minimal n is larger than 5*m?\n\nWait, let's think. For example, the count_zeros(n) is roughly n/5 + n/25 + ... which is less than n/4. So to get count_zeros(n) = m, n must be at least 4*m. So for m=1e5, 4*m is 400,000. So 5*m is 500,000. Which is sufficient. So the upper bound of 5*m is safe.\n\nBut perhaps for some cases, even 5*m is not enough. Let's think: suppose m is 1e5, and the actual n is 5*m. Let's compute count_zeros(5*m) = count_zeros(5*1e5) = count_zeros(500000). Let's compute that:\n\n500000//5 = 100000\n\n500000//25 = 20000\n\n500000//125 = 4000\n\n500000//625 = 800\n\n500000//3125 = 160\n\n500000//15625 = 32\n\n500000//78125 = 6\n\n500000//390625 = 1\n\nTotal is 100000 + 20000 + 4000 + 800 + 160 + 32 + 6 + 1 = 124, 999? Let me compute:\n\nAdding up:\n\n100000 + 20000 = 120000\n\n+4000 = 124000\n\n+800 = 124800\n\n+160 = 124960\n\n+32 = 124992\n\n+6 = 124998\n\n+1 = 124999.\n\nSo count_zeros(500000) is 124999. Which is larger than m=1e5 (100000). So for m=1e5, the minimal n is less than 5*m. So the upper bound of 5*m is sufficient.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut when m=0, but the problem says m is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin and write to stdout.\n\nBut in the sample input, for m=1, the code outputs 5 followed by the numbers. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. The code would generate range(5, 10) which is [5,6,7,8,9], which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, the code as written may have a problem when the upper_n is not found. But for m+1, the upper_n is found correctly.\n\nNow, the code is ready. But what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says m is between 1 and 1e5.\n\nNow, let's code it.\n\nBut in Python, the code is:\n\nBut the code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nImplement the functions.\n\nBut the code may need to handle multiple test cases? But according to the problem statement, it's only one test case. The sample input may have been a mistake.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the code should read one integer m from input.\n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nBut in the sample input given, perhaps the first input is m=1, and the second is m=5. But the code is supposed to handle one m per run.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut in the code, when the code is run, for example, with m=1, it outputs 5 followed by the numbers. Which is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code for the else part, when the numbers are printed, uses range(lower_n, upper_n). However, in Python, range is exclusive of the upper bound. So for example, upper_n is 10, range(5, 10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\nlower_n = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    upper_n = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = upper_n - lower_n\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower_n, upper_n))))\n\nBut wait, when the code prints the numbers, for example, when k is 5, the code prints '5' followed by the numbers. But the output requires that the numbers are printed in increasing order, which they are.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample input m=1:\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(1) = 5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\nupper_n = find_min_n(2) = 10.\n\nk=5.\n\nprint 5, then 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nSample input m=5:\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(5) = 25.\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So print 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in a factorial are formed and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n2. **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the smallest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least $ m $, we use binary search. This helps us quickly narrow down the range of possible values for $ n $.\n3. **Range Determination**: Once we find the smallest $ n $ (let's call it `lower_n`) where the trailing zeros count equals $ m $, we then find the smallest $ n $ where the trailing zeros count is $ m+1 $ (let's call it `upper_n`). The valid values of $ n $ will be between `lower_n` and `upper_n - 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\nlower_n = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    upper_n = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = upper_n - lower_n\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower_n, upper_n))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least `target`.\n3. **Main Logic**:\n   - Read the input value $ m $.\n   - Use `find_min_n` to determine the smallest $ n $ (lower_n) where the trailing zeros count is at least $ m $.\n   - Check if the count of trailing zeros at `lower_n` is exactly $ m $. If not, print 0.\n   - Otherwise, find the smallest $ n $ (upper_n) where the trailing zeros count is $ m+1 $.\n   - The valid values of $ n $ are from `lower_n` to `upper_n - 1`, inclusive. Print the count of these values followed by the values themselves.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the range of possible values using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $.",
