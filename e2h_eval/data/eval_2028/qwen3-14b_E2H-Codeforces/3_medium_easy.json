Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum radius d for the lanterns so that the entire street is covered. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that each lantern can light up points within a distance d. So the goal is to find the smallest d such that every point on the street from 0 to l is within d of at least one lantern.\n\nHmm. So the key idea here is to check the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, then the middle of that gap would require a larger d to cover.\n\nBut wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo the steps I think are:\n\n1. Sort the positions of the lanterns. Because if they are not sorted, the gaps between consecutive ones can't be properly checked.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. That's a candidate for d.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to the end (l). Another candidate.\n4. Then for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum of these divided by 2 would be the required d for that gap. Because if two lanterns are s apart, the middle point between them would need a radius of s/2 to be covered by either lantern.\n5. The overall answer is the maximum among all these candidates.\n\nWait, right. For example, if two lanterns are 6 units apart, then the middle is 3 units away from each. So d needs to be at least 3 to cover that point. So for each consecutive pair, the distance between them divided by two is a candidate.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial gap between 0 and the first lantern. Then the gap between last lantern and l. Then all the gaps between consecutive lanterns. Take the maximum of all these, but for the consecutive ones, divide by two.\n\nWait, but for the initial and final gaps, we don't divide by two. Because, for example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. So the radius needs to be at least a1 to cover the start. Similarly, the last lantern is at a_n, so the distance from a_n to l is l - a_n. So the radius must be at least that.\n\nBut for the gaps between two lanterns, the maximum distance between them is the distance between them divided by two. Because the worst case is the middle of the gap.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Initialize max_d as 0.\n\n- Check the first lantern: if the first lantern is at position a[0], then the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. So current max_d is max(max_d, a[0]).\n\n- Then check the last lantern: the distance from a[-1] to l is l - a[-1]. So current max_d is max(max_d, l - a[-1]).\n\n- Then for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\n   compute the difference between a[i] and a[i-1]. Divide by 2.0. Then compare with current max_d.\n\n- The maximum of all these is the required d.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All lanterns are at the same position. For example, n=3, l=10, and all ai are 5. Then the first gap is 5 (from 0 to 5), the last gap is 5 (from 5 to 10). The consecutive gaps are zero. So the maximum is 5. So d is 5.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=10. The lantern is at 0. Then the first gap is 0, the last gap is 10-0 = 10. So d is 10.\n\nAnother case: n=1, lantern at 5. Then the first gap is 5, the last gap is 5. So d is 5.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0 and 15. l=15. So the first gap is 0, last gap is 0. The consecutive gap is 15-0 =15. Divided by two is 7.5. So d is 7.5. But wait, the street is from 0 to 15. The lanterns are at 0 and 15. So the middle is 7.5. So yes, the radius needs to be 7.5.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the algorithm should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the input. The input is given as two integers n and l, then a list of n integers.\n\nSo in code, the steps are:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as the first element (a[0]).\n\nThen compute the last part (l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for each consecutive pair, compute (a[i] - a[i-1])/2.0.\n\nTake the maximum of all these values.\n\nBut wait, the initial max_d is the maximum between the first part and the last part. Then compare with the consecutive gaps.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif sorted_a[0] > 0:\n\n   max_d = sorted_a[0]\n\nelse:\n\n   max_d = 0.0 ?\n\nWait, no. For example, if the first lantern is at 0, then the first part is 0, so the max_d is 0. Then the next part is the last lantern.\n\nBut the code should take the maximum between the first part (distance from 0 to first lantern), the last part (distance from last lantern to l), and the consecutive gaps divided by two.\n\nSo:\n\nmax_d = max( sorted_a[0], l - sorted_a[-1] )\n\nthen for each consecutive pair, compute (current - previous)/2.0, and compare with max_d.\n\nWait, but what if the first lantern is at 0? Then the first part is 0, which is the distance from 0 to first lantern. So that's okay.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nif n == 0: # but according to input constraints, n >= 1.\n\nSo no need.\n\nmax_d = max( sorted_a[0], l - sorted_a[-1] )\n\nthen for i in 1 to n-1:\n\n   gap = sorted_a[i] - sorted_a[i-1]\n\n   current_candidate = gap / 2.0\n\n   if current_candidate > max_d:\n\n       max_d = current_candidate\n\nSo the answer is max_d.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the sample input:\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\nsorted_a is [2,5].\n\nmax_d is initially max(2, 5 -5 = 0) => 2.\n\nThen check the consecutive gap: 5-2 = 3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. Which is less than 2. So the max remains 2. Which is the correct answer.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n7 15\n\npositions are 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nmax_d starts with max(0, 15-15=0) → 0.\n\nThen check consecutive gaps:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 1.5 → current max is 1.5.\n\n5-3 = 2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0.\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5 → now max is 2.5.\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5.\n\nSo the maximum is 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: when the lanterns are at 0 and 15, l=15. Then sorted_a is [0,15]. max_d starts as max(0, 15-15=0) → 0. Then the consecutive gap is 15-0=15 → divided by 2 → 7.5. So the max is 7.5.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: lanterns at 0 and 5, l=10. Then the first part is 0, last part is 10-5=5. Then the consecutive gap is 5-0=5 → divided by 2 is 2.5. So the maximum is 5. So the answer is 5. Which makes sense because the second lantern is at 5, so the end of the street is 10, which is 5 units away from the lantern. So d must be 5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nIn Python, the input is read from stdin. The first line has n and l. The next line has n integers.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as a list, but in actual code, it's read from stdin. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nSo in code:\n\nWe can read the first line as n, l = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen the next line is list(map(int, input().split())).\n\nBut need to make sure that the list has exactly n elements. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nOnce we have the list, sort it.\n\nThen compute the initial max_d as max( sorted_a[0], l - sorted_a[-1] )\n\nThen loop through the sorted array, checking consecutive elements.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first case gives 2.5, which is 2.5000000000.\n\nBut what about when the maximum is from the first or last part?\n\nFor example, if the first lantern is at 3, l is 15. Then the first part is 3. The last part is 15 - a[-1]. Suppose a[-1] is 12, then last part is 3. So max_d is 3. Then the consecutive gaps may be smaller.\n\nBut what if the first lantern is at 0, and the last at 15. Then the first and last parts are 0. The consecutive gaps between lanterns may have a maximum of 7.5, which is the correct answer.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the first lantern is at 0, but there's a gap between lanterns that is larger than the first and last parts?\n\nLike, for example, n=3, l=10, lanterns at 0, 3, 10. Then the first part is 0, last part is 0. The consecutive gaps are 3-0=3 → 1.5, and 10-3=7 → 3.5. So the max_d is 3.5. Which is correct. Because the middle between 3 and 10 is 6.5, which is 3.5 away from 3 and 6.5 away from 10. So the radius needs to be 3.5 to cover that point.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, considering the case where n=1. For example, n=1, l=5, a=[0]. Then the first part is 0, last part is 5-0=5. So max_d is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case, n=1, a=[5], l=10. Then first part is 5, last part is 5. So max_d is 5. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[2, 3]. Then the first part is 2, last part is 5-3=2. The consecutive gap is 1 → 0.5. So max is 2. So the answer is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the output must be printed with 10 decimal digits. So using the format string with .10f.\n\nBut in Python, when you print, for example, 2.5, it would be 2.5000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n, l.\n\nRead a list, sort it.\n\nCompute max_d as max of first and last parts.\n\nThen check all consecutive pairs.\n\nThen print with 10 decimals.\n\nSo the code seems straightforward.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting: [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d starts as max(0, 15-15=0) → 0.\n\nThen check consecutive gaps:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5 → max is 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0.\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0.\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5 → new max.\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5.\n\nSo the max is 2.5. Output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\nmax_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2.\n\nConsecutive gap is 5-2=3 → 1.5. So max remains 2. Output is 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then the max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. Output is 5.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. Then the initial max is max(0, 10-10=0). Then the consecutive gap is 10-0=10, divided by 2 is 5. So answer is 5.0.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then the initial max is 0 and 0. Then consecutive gaps are 5 and 5. Divided by 2 is 2.5. So answer is 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead input, process, etc.\n\nBut need to be careful with the case when n=0? But according to input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input lines. For example, in Python:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen sort a.\n\nThen compute max_d.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you do division, it returns a float. So even if all the numbers are integers, the division will be a float.\n\nBut for the cases where the maximum is from the first or last part, like 5, it will be printed as 5.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nThis should handle all cases.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns such that the entire street is illuminated. The key insight is to consider the maximum distance between consecutive lanterns and the distances from the ends of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius.\n3. **Check Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum gap divided by 2 will be the candidate radius since the middle of the gap would be the farthest point from either lantern.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required minimum radius is the maximum value among the distances calculated in the previous steps.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in efficiently calculating the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Initial Distances**: The initial maximum radius is determined by checking the distances from the start and end of the street to the nearest lanterns.\n3. **Consecutive Gaps**: By iterating through the sorted list of lantern positions, we calculate the gap between each consecutive pair. The midpoint of the largest gap determines the required radius for that segment.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The final result is the maximum value from the initial distances and the midpoints of the gaps between consecutive lanterns, ensuring the entire street is covered with the minimum radius.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required radius with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, followed by a linear scan of the sorted list. This ensures the solution is optimal and handles all edge cases effectively.",
