Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position.\n\nFirst, I think the approach is to sort the lantern positions. Because if they're sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. The maximum gap divided by two would be the required d for that gap. But wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, the first lantern might not be at 0, so the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position minus d needs to be covered. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nWait, let me think again. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the area from 0 to a1 - d must be covered. Wait no, the lantern's coverage is from a_i -d to a_i +d. So for the entire street [0, l] to be covered, all points must be within at least one of these intervals.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum distance between two consecutive coverage intervals, and then taking half of that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, after sorting the lantern positions, the maximum distance between two adjacent lanterns is important. Because between two adjacent lanterns, the worst case is the midpoint between them. So the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns divided by two would be the required d. However, we also need to check the edges. Like, the first lantern's left side (distance from 0 to a1) and the last lantern's right side (distance from an to l). Those could be larger than the gaps between lanterns.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from 0 to the first lantern. That's a candidate for d (since the first lantern's coverage must reach 0, so d must be at least a1 - 0, but wait no. Wait, the first lantern is at a1. The coverage of the lantern is from a1 -d to a1 +d. To cover 0, we need 0 >= a1 -d → d >= a1 - 0. Wait, no. Let me think: the lantern's coverage starts at a_i -d. So for 0 to be covered, it must be that 0 is within [a_i -d, a_i +d]. So for the first lantern, the leftmost point is 0. So the distance between 0 and the first lantern's position is a1 - 0. So the d must be at least that. But wait, if the first lantern is at 0, then that distance is zero. But if the first lantern is at some position a1 > 0, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. So the d must be at least a1, because otherwise the coverage of the first lantern starts at a1 -d. If d is less than a1, then a1 -d is positive, which leaves the area from 0 to a1 -d uncovered. Therefore, the initial d must be at least a1. Similarly, for the last lantern, the distance from the last lantern's position to l is l - a_n. So d must be at least that.\n\nBut then between two consecutive lanterns, say a[i] and a[i+1], the maximum distance between them is a[i+1] - a[i]. The worst case is that the middle point between them is not covered. So the required d for this gap is (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. Because if you have two lanterns separated by distance s, then the maximum distance from either lantern to the midpoint is s/2. So that's the minimal d needed for that gap.\n\nSo the overall minimal d is the maximum among:\n\n- the first lantern's position (if it's not 0)\n- the last lantern's position (if it's not l)\n- the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nWait, but what if the first lantern is not at 0? Then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0], so d has to be at least that. Similarly for the last lantern. But if the lanterns are already covering the ends, then those values would be zero. So, for example, if the first lantern is at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern is 0, so no problem.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as the maximum between (a[0] - 0) and (l - a[-1]).\n\nThen iterate through the sorted array, compute the differences between consecutive elements, and for each difference, compute (difference)/2. Take the maximum of these values.\n\nThe final answer is the maximum between the initial max_d and the maximum of the (consecutive differences)/2.\n\nWait, but for example, if there's only one lantern. Then the max_d is max(a[0], l - a[0]). Because the lantern's coverage must reach 0 and l. So for example, if the lantern is at position 5, and l is 10, then d must be at least 5 (so that 5 -d = 0, and 5 +d = 10). So yes, in that case, the max between a[0] and l -a[0] would be 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input is 7 15 with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, the positions are [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Then the first lantern is 0, so the initial max_d is 0. The last lantern is 15, so l - a[-1] is 0. Then the gaps between consecutive lanterns are 3-0=3, 5-3=2, 7-5=2, 9-7=2, 14-9=5, 15-14=1. The maximum of these is 5. Divided by 2 is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample: input is 2 5 with lanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted, they are [2,5]. The first lantern is at 2, so the distance from 0 is 2. The last lantern is at 5, so l - a[-1] is 0. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. The maximum between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo that seems to work.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen compute the maximum gap between consecutive elements, divide by 2. Then take the maximum between that and the initial max_d.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial_max = max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\ncurrent_max = max( initial_max, max_gap / 2 )\n\noutput current_max.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 1. Because input constraints say 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. So no problem.\n\nBut what if n is 1? Then the code will compute initial_max as max(a[0], l -a[0]). Then max_gap is zero (since there are no consecutive elements). So the code would take the initial_max as the answer. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Sort them. Then compute initial_max as max(a[0], l - a[-1]). Then compute the max_gap between consecutive elements. Then take the maximum between initial_max and (max_gap / 2).\n\nBut wait, in the case where the initial_max is zero. Like when the first lantern is at 0, and the last at l. Then the initial_max is zero. But the max_gap may be something. So the code would take the maximum between 0 and (max_gap / 2). Which is correct.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead input. Let's see, the input is given as two lines. First line is n and l. Second line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut in the example input, the first input is given as '7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0' — so the first line is n and l, then the next line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead the first line as n and l. Then read the next line as list of integers.\n\nIn Python, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen sort a.\n\nThen compute initial_max = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nmax_gap = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    if gap > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = gap\n\nresult = max( initial_max, max_gap / 2 )\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the initial_max is 0 (a[0] is 0, l - a[-1] is 15-15=0). The max_gap is 5 (between 9 and 14). So 5/2=2.5. So the result is 2.5, correct.\n\nIn the second sample, the input is 2 5, and the list is [2,5]. initial_max is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. The max_gap is 5-2=3. 3/2 is 1.5. The max between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. initial_max is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. max_gap is 0. So result is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. initial_max is max(0, 10-10=0) → 0. max_gap is 10. 10/2=5. So result is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 5]. initial_max is max(0, 10-5=5). So initial_max is 5. The max_gap is 5-0=5. 5/2=2.5. So the result is 5. Which is correct, since the first lantern covers from 0 -d to 0 +d. So for d=5, the first lantern covers up to 5. The second lantern covers from 5-d to 5+d. So for d=5, it covers 0 to 10. So the whole street is covered. But the max_gap is 5, which divided by 2 is 2.5. But the initial_max is 5. So the correct answer is 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nBut what about when the lanterns are not sorted? For example, if the input is [5, 0, 15], then after sorting it becomes [0,5,15]. The initial_max is max(0, 15-15=0). The max_gap is 5-0=5 and 15-5=10. So max_gap is 10. So 10/2=5. So the answer is 5. Which is correct. Because the first lantern covers 0 to 5 +d. The second lantern is at 5, so if d is 5, it covers 0 to 10. The third lantern is at 15, which covers 10 to 20. So the street is 0 to 15. So the middle part between 5 and 15 is covered by the second lantern (up to 10) and the third lantern (from 10). So the maximum gap between 5 and 15 is 10. Divided by 2 is 5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, with the proper formatting. Also, note that the output must have 10 decimal digits, like in the examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute initial_max.\n\nCompute max_gap.\n\nresult is max(initial_max, max_gap / 2).\n\nPrint with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, when printing, how to format it?\n\nFor example, in the first sample, the output is 2.5000000000. So using the format string with .10f.\n\nBut in Python, if the number is an integer, like 2.0, it would print as 2.0000000000.\n\nSo the code:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nBut in Python, when dealing with floating points, division is done with /, which returns a float.\n\nBut what about when the max_gap is zero? For example, when all lanterns are at the same position. But that's handled.\n\nNow, let's code.\n\nBut wait, what if the list is empty? Well, n is at least 1, so the list has at least one element.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    initial_max = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    max_gap = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n    result = max(initial_max, max_gap / 2)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the case where n is 1, the for loop doesn't run. So max_gap remains 0. Then the result is max(initial_max, 0/2) → which is initial_max. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 7 15, and the list is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. initial_max is max(0, 15-15=0) → 0. The max_gap is 14-9=5. So result is max(0, 5/2) → 2.5. Output is 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput is 2 5, list [2,5]. After sorting [2,5]. initial_max is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. max_gap is 3. 3/2 is 1.5. max(2, 1.5) is 2.0 → output 2.0000000000.\n\nWhich matches the samples.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. initial_max is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. max_gap is 0. result is 5.0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. initial_max is 0, max_gap is 10. result is 5.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should work.\n\nNow, code that.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l` given their positions. The approach involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and considering the edges of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Edge Coverage Check**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are potential candidates for the minimum radius.\n3. **Gap Analysis**: Compute the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. The minimum radius required to cover this gap is half of the maximum gap since the worst-case scenario is the midpoint between two consecutive lanterns.\n4. **Determine Result**: The result is the maximum value between the edge coverage distances and half of the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    initial_max = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    max_gap = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n    result = max(initial_max, max_gap / 2)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting Positions**: Sorting the lantern positions helps in sequentially checking the gaps between each pair of consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Edge Coverage Calculation**: The initial maximum radius candidate is determined by the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n4. **Gap Between Lanterns**: By iterating through the sorted positions, we determine the maximum gap between any two consecutive lanterns. The radius required to cover this gap is half of this maximum gap.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The final result is the maximum value between the edge coverage distances and half the maximum gap, ensuring that all parts of the street are illuminated.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures precision up to 10 decimal places as required.",
