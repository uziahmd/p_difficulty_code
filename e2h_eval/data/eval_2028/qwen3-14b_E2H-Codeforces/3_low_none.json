Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum radius d for the lanterns so that the entire street is covered. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The street is from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up a segment from (ai - d) to (ai + d). We need to find the minimal d such that all points from 0 to l are covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nSo the key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. But how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the lanterns are sorted in order. Then, between two consecutive lanterns, there's a certain distance. The worst case for coverage would be in the middle of that gap. For example, if two lanterns are at positions a and b (a < b), then the maximum distance from any point in between to the nearest lantern would be (b - a)/2. But wait, that's only if the lanterns are equally spaced. However, we also have to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position minus d must be covered. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. The required d here would be (first_lantern_pos - 0), but since the lantern's coverage extends to ai - d, so the first lantern's leftmost coverage is ai - d. To cover 0, we need ai - d <= 0. So d needs to be at least ai. Wait, no. Let's think again. The lantern's coverage is from ai - d to ai + d. So for the very beginning of the street (position 0) to be covered, there must be some lantern whose ai - d <= 0 <= ai + d. Which implies that d >= ai - 0 (if the lantern is to the right of 0). Or if there's a lantern at 0, then d can be zero. But for the first lantern, say it's at position a1. Then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. The maximum possible distance from 0 to the lantern is a1. So the required d must be at least a1 / 2? No, wait. Because if the lantern is at a1, then the left end of its coverage is a1 - d. To cover 0, we need a1 - d <= 0 => d >= a1. Wait, no. Because if the lantern's coverage extends to the left by d, then 0 has to be within [a1 -d, a1 +d]. So 0 must be >= a1 -d. So d >= a1 - 0. So d >= a1. Wait, but that's not correct. For example, if the lantern is at position 5, then to cover 0, the radius must be at least 5. Because 5 - d <= 0 => d >=5. But that seems like a big radius. But maybe that's correct. However, if there are multiple lanterns, maybe the first lantern is not at 0, but another lantern is closer to 0. But in the sorted list, the first lantern is the leftmost one.\n\nWait, after sorting, the first lantern is the leftmost. So the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0]. So the required d for covering 0 is a[0], because the lantern's coverage must reach 0. So the first part is a[0], but maybe the lantern's coverage can cover 0 if d is a[0]. Similarly, the last lantern is at a[-1], and the distance from that lantern to l is l - a[-1]. So d must be at least that value.\n\nBut then between two consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap is (a[i+1] - a[i]). For that gap, the maximum distance from the middle point would be (gap)/2. So the required d for that gap is (gap)/2. So the overall d is the maximum between the first part, the last part, and all the gaps between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial distance from 0 to the first lantern (a[0]).\n- Compute the final distance from the last lantern to l (l - a[-1]).\n- Compute the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, then divide by 2.\n- The answer is the maximum among these three values.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the minimum light radius required for lanterns to illuminate the entire street, we can break the solution into a few logical steps. The key idea is to identify the largest uncovered segment in the street and compute the necessary radius based on that.\n\n---\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**:\n   - Since the lanterns are placed at various points along the street, sorting their positions helps us systematically evaluate the gaps between them.\n\n2. **Evaluate Edge Coverage**:\n   - Check the distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern.\n   - Check the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (position `l`).\n\n3. **Evaluate Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**:\n   - For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the distance between them. The worst-case scenario for coverage is the midpoint of this gap, so the required radius for that segment would be half of the distance.\n\n4. **Determine the Maximum Required Radius**:\n   - The minimum required radius `d` will be the maximum among the edge distances and the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split('\\n')\n    \n    for line in data:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        parts = line.strip().split()\n        if len(parts) < 2:\n            continue\n        n, l = map(int, parts[:2])\n        a = list(map(int, parts[2:]))\n        \n        a.sort()\n        \n        max_d = 0.0\n        \n        # First segment: from 0 to a[0]\n        max_d = max(max_d, a[0])\n        \n        # Last segment: from a[-1] to l\n        max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n        \n        # Middle segments: between consecutive lanterns\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            current_d = gap / 2.0\n            max_d = max(max_d, current_d)\n        \n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions ensures we can sequentially check the gaps between them.\n- **Edge Cases**: The first and last lanterns may be away from the ends of the street, which requires checking their respective distances.\n- **Gap Analysis**: For any two adjacent lanterns, the worst-case point is the midpoint of the segment between them. This determines the minimum radius needed to cover that segment.\n- **Precision**: The output is printed with 10 decimal places to meet the problem's precision requirement.\n\nThis approach ensures an efficient and accurate solution with time complexity dominated by the sorting step, making it suitable even for large values of `l` up to $10^9$.",
