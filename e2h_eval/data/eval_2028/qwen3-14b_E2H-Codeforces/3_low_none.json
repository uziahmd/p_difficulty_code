Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to model this problem. The key idea is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would require the largest d to cover.\n\nBut wait, also need to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position would be a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street, l. So the steps might be:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. The required d here is that distance.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to the end (l). That's another candidate.\n4. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum gap between consecutive lanterns would contribute to the required d. But since each lantern covers up to d on both sides, the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns would have a midpoint that needs to be covered. So for a gap of length g, the required d would be g/2. Because if two lanterns are separated by g, then the middle point is at g/2 distance from each. So the minimal d needed for that gap is g/2.\n\nSo the overall minimal d is the maximum among:\n\n- the first lantern's position (if it's not at 0)\n- the last lantern's position (if it's not at l)\n- the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nWait, but what if the first lantern is at 0? Then the initial distance is zero. Same for the last lantern.\n\nSo the algorithm steps would be:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial distance from 0 to the first lantern. Let's call this initial_gap.\n- Compute the final distance from the last lantern to l. Call this final_gap.\n- Compute the max gap between consecutive lanterns. Let's call this max_consecutive_gap.\n- Then, the required d is the maximum of (initial_gap, final_gap, max_consecutive_gap / 2).\n\nBut wait, why is the max_consecutive_gap divided by 2?\n\nBecause if two lanterns are at positions a and b (a < b), then the distance between them is b - a. The worst case is the middle point between them. The distance from a to that point is (b - a)/2, same as from that point to b. So the required d for that gap is (b - a)/2.\n\nSo yes, the maximum of these three values will be the minimal required d.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lantern positions are [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, they are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15].\n\nInitial gap is 0 - 0 = 0. Final gap is 15 -15 =0. The consecutive gaps are:\n\n3-0=3 → 3/2=1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n\n9-7=2 →1.0\n\n14-9=5 →2.5\n\n15-14=1 →0.5.\n\nSo the max consecutive gap is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So the maximum of 0, 0, 2.5 is 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input: 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. Sorted as [2,5]. Initial gap is 2-0=2. Final gap is 5-5=0. Consecutive gap is 5-2=3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum is 2. Which matches the sample output. So that works.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=1, l=10. The lantern is at 5. Then initial gap is 5, final gap is 5. The max consecutive gap is 0 (since only one lantern). So the maximum is 5. Which makes sense, because the d must be 5 to cover from 0 to 10.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, lanterns at 0 and 10. The initial gap is 0, final gap is 0. The consecutive gap is ",
    "response": "To solve the problem of determining the minimum light radius required for all points on a street to be illuminated by lanterns, we need to focus on the largest gaps between consecutive lanterns and also consider the ends of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: Begin by sorting the positions of the lanterns. This helps in systematically evaluating the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Initial and Final Gaps**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These are potential candidates for the minimum radius.\n3. **Evaluate Consecutive Gaps**: Iterate through the sorted list of lantern positions to find the maximum gap between any two consecutive lanterns. The required radius for such a gap is half of this distance since the middle point of the gap will be the furthest point from either lantern.\n4. **Determine the Maximum Radius**: The minimum radius needed is the maximum value among the initial gap, final gap, and half of the maximum consecutive gap.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_gap = 0.0\n    # Check initial gap\n    initial_gap = a[0] - 0\n    # Check final gap\n    final_gap = l - a[-1]\n    \n    # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        if gap > max_gap:\n            max_gap = gap\n    \n    # Compute required d\n    d = max(initial_gap, final_gap, max_gap / 2)\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions ensures that we can easily check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Initial and Final Gaps**: These are critical because if the first lantern is not at the start or the last lantern is not at the end of the street, those areas need to be covered.\n- **Consecutive Gaps**: The largest gap between two consecutive lanterns determines the maximum distance from the midpoint of this gap to either lantern, which is half the gap length.\n- **Result Calculation**: The result is the maximum of the initial gap, final gap, and half of the largest consecutive gap, ensuring that all parts of the street are illuminated with the minimal radius.",
