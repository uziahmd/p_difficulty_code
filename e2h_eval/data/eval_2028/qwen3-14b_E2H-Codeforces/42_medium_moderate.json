    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about copying files and tracking two progress bars. The first shows the percentage of the current file copied, and the second shows the overall percentage across all files. Both are floored to integers. After each byte copied, these values update. We need to find all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that appear simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment.\n\nHmm. The task is to find all such numbers. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, let's understand when the progress bars update. For each byte copied in each file, after that byte is copied, the two percentages are calculated. Also, initially, before any bytes are copied, both are 0. So the initial state (0%) is included.\n\nThe key is to simulate all possible moments when a byte is copied and check for each moment what the two percentages are, then collect those values where they are equal.\n\nBut since n can be up to 100, and each a_i up to 1000, the total number of bytes is up to 100*1000 = 10^5. So for each byte, we can compute the current percentage for the current file and the overall percentage. Then check if they are equal, and collect those values.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"all such integers that exist at some moment\". So for each possible byte copied, compute both percentages and record the value if they are equal. Then collect all unique values from these.\n\nBut how do we model the process?\n\nLet me think. For each file i, and for each byte x in 1..a_i (since after copying x bytes, the progress for the current file is floor(100 * x / a_i). But also, the overall progress is floor(100 * (sum of previous files + x) / total_sum).\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n- Compute the total_sum of all a_i.\n\n- For each file i from 0 to n-1:\n\n   - For each byte x from 1 to a_i:\n\n      - current_file_percent = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\n      - total_bytes_so_far = sum of a_1 to a_{i-1} + x\n\n      - total_percent = floor(100 * total_bytes_so_far / total_sum)\n\n      - if current_file_percent == total_percent, add this value to a set.\n\nAlso, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is 0% for both. So we need to include 0 in the result if it's possible. But according to the note in the first example, when there's one file, the initial 0 is included. So how does that fit into the simulation?\n\nWait, the initial state is before any bytes are copied. But according to the problem statement, after copying each byte, the progress bars update. So the initial 0 is before any bytes are copied. However, the first byte copied will trigger the first update. But the initial state (0%) is considered as a moment where both bars show 0. So we need to include 0 in the answer if there's at least one moment where both are 0. Which is always true because at the very start, both are 0. But wait, the problem says that the values are updated after each byte is copied. So the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So the initial state (before any bytes) is considered as a moment where both are 0. However, according to the problem statement, the first update occurs after the first byte is copied. But the problem says that the initial state is 0% for both. So we need to check if 0 is present in the output.\n\nBut how? Because when the first byte is copied, the first progress bar is floor(100 * 1 / a_i), which may not be zero. But the initial moment (before any bytes) is when both are zero. So that's a valid moment. Therefore, 0 should be included in the output unless there's no such moment. But in all cases, there is at least one moment (the initial one) where both are 0. Wait, but the problem says that the initial state is considered. So the output must include 0. But looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the first sample input, the output includes 0. In the second sample input, the output includes 0. So yes, 0 is part of the answer. However, what if during the entire process, after the initial moment, the two bars never again show 0. But the initial moment counts. So 0 is always in the answer. Wait, but maybe not. Because the problem says that the initial state is considered. But according to the problem statement, the output should include all numbers that exist at some moment. So 0 is always present, except maybe if the initial moment is not considered? Or is it considered?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают 0 процентов.\"\n\nSo the initial moment is considered. Therefore, 0 is always in the answer. However, looking at the sample outputs, for example, the second sample input's output includes 0. But let's see the second example's input: n=2, files 100 and 500. The total is 600. So the initial moment is 0 for both. Then, after the first byte is copied, the current file is 100, so 1/100 * 100 = 1% (floor is 1). The total is (0 + 1)/600 * 100 = 0.166... floored to 0. So the two percentages are 1 and 0, not equal. So the initial 0 is the only time when 0 is present. So the output includes 0. So in the output, 0 is always present. But what about the case when the total_sum is zero? No, since a_i is at least 1. So total_sum is at least n, which is >=1.\n\nBut then, why in the sample outputs, for example, the third input's output includes 0, 50, 99, 100. So 0 is included.\n\nTherefore, our code must include 0 as a possible value. However, perhaps the initial moment is not considered? Wait, the problem says that the values are updated after each byte. So the initial moment is before any bytes are copied. So the initial state is considered as a moment where both are 0. Therefore, the answer must include 0. However, when the code simulates all the bytes, the initial moment is not captured in the simulation. Because the simulation starts with the first byte. Therefore, we have to manually add 0 to the set of possible values. Or check if during the simulation, 0 can be achieved again. But the initial moment is a valid case. So we need to include 0 in the answer.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, the output includes 0. But during the simulation of the bytes, after the first byte is copied, the current file percent is 100 * 1 /6 = 16.666..., floored to 16. The total is (1/6)*100 = 16.666... floored to 16. So both are 16. So in that case, 16 is added. But the initial 0 is also present. So the answer includes 0 and 16, etc.\n\nSo how do we capture the initial moment?\n\nWe need to check whether 0 is present. Since the initial moment is when both are 0, we can add 0 to the set of answers. However, perhaps there are cases where during the simulation, the two percentages are both 0 again. But the initial moment is always present. So 0 is always in the answer. However, according to the sample input 2, the output includes 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. So 0 is present. So how can we make sure that 0 is included in the answer?\n\nBut wait, perhaps the initial moment is not considered. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"В самом начале копирования оба прогресс-бара показывают 0 процентов.\" So the initial state is considered. So the answer must include 0. However, in the simulation, when we process each byte, the initial 0 is not part of the processing. So in our code, we need to add 0 to the set of possible values.\n\nBut wait, maybe during the simulation, when the first byte is processed, the current progress is 1/100 * 100 = 1% for the first file. The total progress is 1/total * 100. But in the initial moment, the two bars are 0. So the code needs to check if 0 is a valid value. So perhaps the answer is that 0 is always included. But then, what if the total sum is 1? For example, if n=1 and a_1=1. Then during the initial moment, both are 0. Then after the first byte is copied, the current file is 100 * 1 / 1 = 100, and the total is 100 * 1 / 1 = 100. So 0 is present as the initial moment. So the answer includes 0 and 100.\n\nSo in the code, we need to include 0 in the result. However, perhaps there are cases where even though the initial moment is 0, but during the simulation, the two bars are not 0 again. But 0 is still in the answer.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Initialize a set with 0.\n\n- Then simulate all the bytes being copied, and for each, compute the current file percent and total percent, and if they are equal, add to the set.\n\n- Finally, collect all the elements in the set, sort them, and output.\n\nBut wait, what about the moment when the last byte is copied? For example, after the last byte is copied, the total percent is 100% (since total_bytes_so_far is equal to the total_sum). So floor(100 * total_bytes_so_far / total_sum) is 100. Similarly, the current file's percent is 100. So that's another moment when both are 100. So 100 is added. But in the initial code, the simulation would process all bytes. So for the last byte, the code would check if the current percent equals the total percent, which would be 100. So 100 is added. But in the initial code, the initial 0 is added. So the code should include 0 and 100 if they are present.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the output includes 0 and 100. So the code needs to make sure that 0 is included. But how?\n\nWait, the initial moment is when both are 0. So regardless of anything else, 0 is present. So the code must include 0 in the answer. However, in some cases, during the simulation, the two percentages could be 0 again. For example, if the first file is 1000 bytes, and the total sum is 2000. Then, after copying 1 byte, the current percent is 0 (100 * 1 / 1000 = 0.1 floored to 0). The total percent is (1 / 2000) * 100 = 0.05 floored to 0. So both are 0. So in that case, 0 is added again. So in the code, the initial 0 is added, and then during simulation, 0 is added again. But that's okay, because the set will take care of duplicates.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute total_sum = sum(a).\n\n2. Initialize a set called result, and add 0 to it.\n\n3. For each file i (from 0 to n-1):\n\n   a. For each byte x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n      i. Compute current_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n      ii. Compute total_bytes_so_far = sum_prev + x, where sum_prev is the sum of the first i files (before the current one). Wait, sum_prev is sum of a[0] to a[i-1]. So for the current file i (assuming 0-based index), sum_prev is sum of a[0] ... a[i-1]. So for example, for the first file (i=0), sum_prev is 0. Then, for each x in 1..a[0], total_bytes_so_far is 0 + x.\n\n      iii. Compute total_percent = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total_sum.\n\n      iv. If current_percent == total_percent, add this value to the result set.\n\n4. After processing all bytes, collect the elements in the result set, sort them, and output.\n\nBut how to compute sum_prev for each file?\n\nWe can precompute the prefix sums. For example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc. So for the i-th file (assuming 0-based), the sum_prev is prefix_sums[i].\n\nSo for example, for the first file (i=0), sum_prev is prefix_sums[0] = 0. For the second file (i=1), sum_prev is prefix_sums[1] = a[0].\n\nThus, the steps would be:\n\nCompute prefix_sums array. Let's say prefix_sums is an array where prefix_sums[i] is the sum of the first i files. So for example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc.\n\nThen, for each file i (from 0 to n-1), and for each x in 1 to a[i], the total_bytes_so_far is prefix_sums[i] + x.\n\nSo that's manageable.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n, then the list a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums. For example, prefix_sums can be computed as follows:\n\nprefix_sums = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n    for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n        total_bytes_so_far = prefix_sums[i] + x\n\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total_sum\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            add to the set.\n\nThen, after processing all, add 0 to the set (but wait, the initial state is already considered. Wait, in the code above, the initial state is not considered. Because the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So the code adds 0 to the set. Then, during the simulation, if any other moment has 0, it will be added again. So the code needs to start with 0 in the set.\n\nBut what about when the total_sum is 0? Well, the problem says that a_i is at least 1, so total_sum is at least n, which is >=1.\n\nSo the code would proceed as follows.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input, when there's one file of size 6. The initial 0 is added. Then, for x=1, current_percent is 100 * 1//6 = 16, total_bytes_so_far is 0 + 1 =1, total_percent is 100 * 1 // 6 = 16. So they are equal. So 16 is added. Then for x=2, current is 33, total is 33 (since 2/6*100 is 33.333 floored to 33). So 33 is added. And so on. So the code would collect 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100 (for x=6, current is 100, total is 100). So the output is as in the first sample.\n\nBut in the code, the initial 0 is added. Then during the simulation, for each x, the code checks if current and total are equal. So in that case, the code would collect 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100.\n\nBut wait, when x=6, the current percent is (100 * 6)/6 = 100. The total bytes is 6, total_percent is (100 * 6)/6 = 100. So yes, 100 is added. So the code would collect 100.\n\nBut what about the final moment when all bytes are copied. The code captures that. So the code adds 0, and during simulation, all the other values.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to handle the prefix_sums?\n\nLet me think about the code.\n\nRead n from input. Then read the list a. Then compute total_sum = sum(a). Compute prefix_sums as a list of length n+1, starting with 0, then adding each a[i].\n\nThen, create a set called result, initialized with 0.\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n       total_bytes_so_far = prefix_sums[i] + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes_so_far) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to result.\n\nOnce all are processed, collect the sorted list of the result.\n\nBut wait, the code may miss the case where during the simulation, after the last byte of the last file is copied, the total_percent is 100. But in that case, during the simulation, the code would process x = a[-1], and compute the total_bytes_so_far as prefix_sums[-1] (which is sum of all files except last) + x (which is a[-1], so sum of all files). So total_bytes_so_far is total_sum. Thus, (100 * total_sum) // total_sum = 100. And current_percent is (100 * x) // a[i], which for x = a[i], is 100 * a[i] // a[i] = 100. So yes, 100 is added to the set. So the code will include 100 if it's present.\n\nBut what about the case when the total_sum is such that the total_percent is 100 even before all bytes are copied? For example, if the total_sum is 100, and the first file is 100 bytes. Then after the first byte is copied, the total_bytes_so_far is 1, which gives 1% total. But if the total_sum is 100, then after 100 bytes, it's 100%. But if the total_sum is 100, and a file is 50 bytes, then after copying 50 bytes, the total_bytes_so_far is 50. The total percent is 50% (50 * 100 / 100 = 50). The current percent is 100 * 50 / 50 = 100. So they are not equal. So 50% is not added. But in that case, during the simulation, the code would check for each x.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's test against the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nSample Output: 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100.\n\nWhich matches the code's processing.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nInput:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nTotal sum is 600.\n\nThe initial 0 is added.\n\nNow, for the first file (i=0, a[i] = 100). For x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_percent = 100 * x // 100 = x.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 0 + x.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * x) // 600.\n\nWe need to find x where x == (100x)/600.\n\nWhich simplifies to x = (x/6) → 6x = x → x=0. Which is not in the range. So during the first file, no matches except when x=0 (but that's initial). So during the first file, the code would not add any values except possibly when x is such that 100x//600 equals x//1 (since current_percent is x). Wait, no, current_percent is x, and total_percent is (100 * x) // 600. So for example, when x=1: current is 1, total is 0. So not equal. When x=6, total is (600) // 600 = 1. So current is 6, total is 1. Not equal. So no matches here.\n\nThen, for the second file (i=1, a[i] = 500). The prefix_sums[i] is 100 (sum of first 1 files). So for x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // 500 = (x * 100) // 500 = x//5.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 100 + x.\n\ntotal_percent = (100*(100 + x)) // 600.\n\nWe need to find x where (x//5) == (100*(100 + x))//600.\n\nLet me see for x=500:\n\ncurrent_percent is 500//5 = 100. total_bytes_so_far is 600, so total_percent is 100. So 100 is added.\n\nBut during the simulation, when x is 500, which is the last byte of the second file. So yes, 100 is added.\n\nBut what about other values? For example, when x= 500, yes. What about when x is 500 - 1 = 499?\n\ncurrent_percent is 499//5 = 99. total_bytes_so_far is 100 + 499 = 599. 599 * 100 / 600 = 99.833..., floored to 99. So 99 equals 99. So this would be added. So 99 is added.\n\nBut according to the sample output for the second input, the output includes 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 0. So 99 is present. So during the simulation of the second file, there are multiple x's that meet the condition.\n\nSo the code would correctly capture these.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, read n, then a list of integers.\n\nCompute prefix_sums:\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n+1)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    prefix_sums[i+1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n\nThen, total_sum = prefix_sums[-1]\n\nInitialize a set called result = {0}\n\nThen loop over each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n       total_bytes = prefix_sums[i] + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           result.add(current_percent)\n\nOnce done, collect the sorted list of the result.\n\nBut wait, for the case when the total_sum is 0? Well, according to the input constraints, a_i is at least 1, so total_sum is at least n >= 1.\n\nNow, testing for the second sample input:\n\nn=2, a=[100,500], total_sum=600.\n\nProcessing first file (i=0, a[i]=100). x ranges from 1 to 100.\n\ncurrent_percent is x, total_percent is (100 * x) // 600.\n\nSo for x=6, total_percent is 1, current is 6. Not equal.\n\nBut for x=600, but that's not in the first file.\n\nBut for the second file, when x is 500, total_bytes is 100+500=600. total_percent is 100. current_percent is 500 * 100 / 500 = 100. So added.\n\nBut during the simulation of the second file, when x is 500, yes.\n\nBut how about when x is 500- something?\n\nBut the code would process all x.\n\nOnce all is done, the result set is collected, sorted.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, a=[1]. Then total_sum=1.\n\nInitial 0 is added.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = 100 * 1 // 1 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes is 1, so total_percent is 100 * 1 //1 = 100. So added. So the result is {0, 100}.\n\nEdge case 2: n=1, a=[2]. So total_sum=2.\n\nInitial 0.\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent is 50, total is (1*100)/2 = 50. So added. So 50 is added.\n\nx=2: current is 100, total is 100. So added.\n\nSo the result is {0,50,100}.\n\nAnother edge case: when during the simulation, the same value is added multiple times, but the set takes care of uniqueness.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut for reading the input, the user provided examples have inputs like:\n\nFor example, the first input line is ['1\\n6', ...], but in reality, the input is read from stdin. So the code should read from stdin. But in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nFirst line: n.\n\nSecond line: a_1 ... a_n.\n\nSo the code would read n, then read a list of integers.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nThen compute prefix_sums.\n\nBut for the code, the code must read from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, then a list.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nCompute total_sum.\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nThen loop through each i and x.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for loops:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\nYes.\n\nOnce all that is done, collect the sorted list.\n\nSo the code:\n\nThen, after processing, the result set is sorted and printed, each element on separate lines, or as per the sample outputs.\n\nWait, the sample outputs are given as strings, but in the problem statement, the output is to print the numbers in increasing order, each on a separate line.\n\nWait, looking at the sample outputs:\n\nFor example, the first sample output is:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich is each number on its own line.\n\nSo the code should print the numbers in sorted order, each on a separate line.\n\nSo, after collecting the sorted list, print each element.\n\nSo in code:\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nBut in the sample outputs, the first sample output is written as '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100' which is the same as printing each number on a line.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing for the sample input 2:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nSample Output:\n\n0\n\n95\n\n96\n\n97\n\n98\n\n99\n\n100\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. How does 95 appear?\n\nFor example, during the second file's processing. Let's see:\n\nsum_prev is 100.\n\ntotal_sum is 600.\n\nFor x in 1..500.\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // 500 = x//5.\n\ntotal_percent = (100*(100 + x)) // 600.\n\nWe need x//5 == (100*(100 +x )) // 600.\n\nLet me take x = 475:\n\ncurrent_percent = 475//5 = 95.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 100 + 475 = 575.\n\ntotal_percent = (575 * 100) / 600 = 57500 / 600 = 95.833..., floored to 95. So yes, 95 equals 95. So 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 476:\n\ncurrent_percent is 476//5 = 95.2 → 95.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 100 + 476 = 576 → 576 * 100 / 600 = 96 → 96. So 95 != 96. So not added.\n\nBut for x= 475, added.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 480: current is 96. total_bytes is 580 → 580 * 100 / 600 = 96.666 → 96. So current is 96, total is 96. So added.\n\nSo 96 is added.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 485: current is 97. total_bytes is 585 → 585 * 100 / 600 = 97.5 → 97. So added.\n\nSame for x= 490: current is 98. total is 590 → 98.333 → 98. So added.\n\nx= 495: current is 99. total is 595 → 595 * 100 / 600 = 99.166 → 99. So added.\n\nx= 500: current is 100, total is 600 → 100.\n\nSo all 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 are added. Plus 0.\n\nSo the sample output is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, a.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\ntotal_sum = prefix_sums[-1]\n\nresult = {0}\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nBut let's check for the third sample input:\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n4\n\n1000 2 2 998\n\nSample Output:\n\n0\n\n50\n\n99\n\n100\n\nLet me think.\n\nTotal sum is 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002.\n\nLet me see when 50 is achieved.\n\nFor example, during the first file (1000 bytes), sum_prev is 0.\n\nAt x= 1000 * 50 / 100 = 500 bytes. So current_percent is 50. total_bytes is 500. total_percent is (500 * 100) / 2002 = 25 * 100 / 100.1 → 25 * 100 = 2500 / 2002 is approx 1.248... → 1. So not 50. So that's not the case.\n\nBut perhaps during the fourth file?\n\nAlternatively, during the second and third files.\n\nBut perhaps during the fourth file.\n\nBut let's think about when the total_bytes is 1001 (half of 2002 is 1001). So total_percent is 50.\n\nSo when total_bytes_so_far is 1001, then the total_percent is 50.\n\nAt that moment, what is the current_percent?\n\nWhich file is being copied?\n\nThe first file is 1000 bytes. The second is 2, third 2, fourth 998.\n\nSo sum_prev for the fourth file is 1000 + 2 + 2 = 1004. So during the fourth file, x is from 1 to 998.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 1004 + x.\n\nWe want 1004 + x = 1001 → x = -3. Not possible. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, during the third file.\n\nsum_prev for third file is 1000 + 2 = 1002. So during third file, x is from 1 to 2.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 1002 + x.\n\nWe want 1002 + x = 1001 → x = -1. No.\n\nDuring the second file: sum_prev is 1000. For x in 1..2.\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far is 1000 + x.\n\nWe want 1000 + x = 1001 → x=1. So during the second file, x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 * 1) // 2 = 50.\n\ntotal_percent is (100 * (1000 + 1)) // 2002 = 1001 * 100 / 2002 = 100100 / 2002 = 50. So yes! 50. So added.\n\nThus, 50 is in the set.\n\nSo during the second file, x=1, current_percent is 50, total_percent is 50. So added. Hence, 50 is in the output.\n\nSo the code would capture that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the third one, which outputs 0,50,99,100.\n\nSo the code would generate that.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n from input, then a list.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nBut for the code, let's write it.\n\nTesting the code with the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nThe code would generate:\n\nresult starts with 0.\n\nThen for i=0, current_file_size=6.\n\nsum_prev is 0.\n\nx from 1 to 6:\n\nfor x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = 100*1//6 = 16\n\ntotal_bytes_so_far = 0 +1 =1.\n\ntotal_percent = 100 * 1 //6 = 16 → equal. So add 16.\n\nSimilarly for x=2: 200//6=33.333 → 33. total is 2*100//6=33.333 → 33. So added.\n\nx=3: 300//6=50, total is 3*100//6=50. So added.\n\nSimilarly, x=4: 400//6=66.666 → 66. total is 4*100//6=6",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer values between 0 and 100 (inclusive) that appear simultaneously on two progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer and updated after each byte is copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: Compute prefix sums to efficiently determine the cumulative bytes copied up to each file.\n3. **Simulating Copy Process**: For each byte copied in each file, compute both the current file's progress and the overall progress.\n4. **Tracking Common Percentages**: Use a set to track all values where both progress bars show the same percentage at any moment.\n5. **Output Results**: Print the sorted list of these common percentages.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    total_sum = sum(a)\n    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + a[i]\n    \n    result = {0}\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        current_file_size = a[i]\n        sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n        for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n            current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n            total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n            total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n            if current_percent == total_percent:\n                result.add(current_percent)\n    \n    sorted_result = sorted(result)\n    for num in sorted_result:\n        print(num)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of files and their sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: This helps in quickly determining the cumulative bytes copied up to each file, which is essential for calculating the overall progress.\n3. **Simulating Copy Process**: For each byte copied in each file, we compute the current progress percentage of the file and the overall progress percentage across all files. These values are compared, and if they match, the value is added to a set to ensure uniqueness.\n4. **Tracking Common Percentages**: Using a set ensures that each valid percentage is only recorded once, even if it appears multiple times during the copy process.\n5. **Output Results**: The results are sorted and printed in ascending order, as required by the problem statement.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the copy process and checks for common progress percentages using straightforward arithmetic operations and set operations, ensuring correctness and optimal performance given the constraints.",
