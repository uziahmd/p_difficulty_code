His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the first and second tour scores for all participants, but they are not linked to names. So, we need to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j (but each participant has exactly one a and one b, right? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that each participant participated in both tours. So for each participant, there is an a_i (first tour) and a b_i (second tour). But the input gives the a's and b's in arbitrary order. So the teacher has two lists: the first list is all the a's (first tour scores), and the second list is all the b's (second tour scores). But the problem is that the teacher doesn't know which a_i corresponds to which b_i. So for each participant, their total is a_i + b_j, but the teacher doesn't know which combination is correct. However, it's guaranteed that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >= x. Our task is to find the best and worst possible rank Vasya can have, considering all possible pairings of a's and b's (each a must be paired with exactly one b, and vice versa).\n\nWait, no. Wait, the participants are n in number. Each participant has one a_i and one b_i. But the input gives the a's and b's in arbitrary order. So the actual pairing between a_i and b_i is unknown. So for example, the first list is the first tour's scores for all participants, but the second list is the second tour's scores, but not necessarily in the same order. So when considering possible pairings, we need to assign each a_i to a unique b_j, such that each participant has a_i + b_j as their total.\n\nBut Vasya's total is at least x. However, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. But the teacher needs to find the best and worst possible positions he could have, given that there exists some pairing where at least one participant (Vasya) has a_i + b_j >=x. Wait, but the problem says that it is guaranteed that there exists two integers i and j such that a_i + b_j >=x. So, the teacher needs to find, among all possible valid pairings (where each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa), the best possible rank and worst possible rank that Vasya can have.\n\nWait, but how does Vasya's pairing work? Because in any valid pairing, there is exactly one participant whose a and b are paired. But since the teacher doesn't know which one is Vasya, but knows that in reality, there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So for the purposes of calculating best and worst possible ranks, we can assume that Vasya is represented by some pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x, and then find the best and worst possible ranks that this pair could have in the overall ranking.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nWe need to find, for all possible pairings of a's and b's (each a paired with exactly one b), the maximum possible rank (worst case) and minimum possible rank (best case) that a particular pair (a_i, b_j) can have, given that a_i + b_j >=x. However, since the actual pairing is unknown, but we can choose any pairing that includes at least one such pair (since the problem says that such a pair exists), we need to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have.\n\nBut how do we model this? For the best possible rank, we want to maximize Vasya's total (so that he is as high as possible), and arrange other participants' totals to be as low as possible. For the worst possible rank, we want to minimize Vasya's total (so that he is as low as possible), and arrange others to be as high as possible.\n\nWait, but since the pairing is arbitrary, for the best possible rank, we can choose the pairing where Vasya's a_i and b_j are paired such that their sum is as high as possible, and arrange other pairings so that as many other participants have lower totals. Similarly, for the worst possible rank, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange others' sums to be as high as possible.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think.\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\nWe want Vasya's total to be as high as possible. So, we can choose the maximum possible a_i + b_j that is >=x. Then, for the rest of the participants, we pair them in a way that their total is as small as possible. But how?\n\nWait, but the pairing must be a bijection between a's and b's. So for the best possible rank, we can choose the best possible pair (a_i + b_j) for Vasya (maximizing it), and then pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that their totals are as small as possible. However, the other participants' totals would affect Vasya's rank. For example, if there are other participants with higher totals than Vasya's, then Vasya's rank would be worse. But if we can arrange that other participants have as low totals as possible, then Vasya's rank would be as good as possible.\n\nWait, but how can we arrange the other pairs to minimize the number of people who have higher totals than Vasya?\n\nAh, for the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and then arrange the rest of the pairs such that as few as possible participants have a higher total than him. So, the best possible rank is 1 if there's a way to pair the a's and b's such that Vasya's total is the maximum.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible value of (a_i + b_j) that is >=x. Then, the number of participants that have a total higher than this value is zero, so Vasya's rank is 1. But that's only possible if there exists a pairing where Vasya's total is the maximum.\n\nBut maybe not. Because even if Vasya's total is the maximum, but there are other participants with the same total. Then the jury can assign ranks arbitrarily. So in that case, Vasya can be placed first, which is the best possible.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1 if there exists a pairing where Vasya's total is the maximum possible. But how to find that?\n\nBut perhaps the approach for best possible rank is to find the maximum possible total that Vasya can have (given that it's >=x), and then count how many participants can have a total greater than this value. But since the pairing is arbitrary, perhaps we can arrange that no one else has a higher total than Vasya.\n\nWait, but how can we ensure that? For example, suppose that Vasya's total is S. Then, for the rest of the participants, we can pair their a's and b's in a way that their total is as small as possible. So, for the best rank scenario, we can select the maximum possible S (for Vasya) and then arrange the rest of the pairs to have as low as possible totals. Thus, the number of people with higher total than S would be zero, so the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut how do we know that such a pairing exists?\n\nWell, the maximum possible S is the maximum a_i + b_j. But since the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x, then if the maximum possible sum is >=x, then yes, we can take that as Vasya's sum. Then, for the rest, we can pair the a's and b's in a way that their sum is as small as possible. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is 1. Because we can choose the pairing where Vasya's total is the maximum possible. But if there are other participants with the same maximum total, then the jury can assign him first place. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, the first sample input shows that all participants have 1+1=2. So the best possible rank is 1, and worst is 5. Which matches the sample output. So in that case, the best possible is 1.\n\nIn the second sample input, the best possible is 1. So perhaps the best possible rank is always 1 if there exists a possible pairing where Vasya's total is the maximum. But how can we confirm that?\n\nBut how do we know that there's a way to pair the rest of the a's and b's so that none of them have a higher sum than Vasya's maximum?\n\nWell, for example, if we take the maximum a_i + b_j as Vasya's sum, then for the remaining a's and b's, we can pair them in a way that their sum is as low as possible. But how to do that? Well, perhaps by pairing the smallest a's with the largest b's, or something like that. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut for the purpose of the best possible rank, perhaps we can assume that the best possible rank is 1. Because the problem allows the jury to assign ranks in case of ties. So even if there are multiple people with the same maximum sum as Vasya, the jury can assign him first place.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is always 1. But wait, what if there are no possible pairings where Vasya's sum is the maximum? For example, suppose that the maximum possible sum is S, and there's a participant whose a_i + b_j is S, but that's not Vasya. But no, because Vasya's sum is chosen to be the maximum possible. So in the best case scenario, we can choose to pair Vasya's a and b to be the maximum possible sum. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, but how do we know that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum possible sum? Because the maximum sum is achieved by some a_i and b_j. So in that case, we can pair that a_i with that b_j (for Vasya), and then pair the rest of the a's and b's in any way. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo perhaps the best possible rank is always 1. But why in the first sample input, the output is 1 5. So that seems to fit. So the first part of the output is 1. But why?\n\nWait, in the first sample input, all participants have a_i =1 and b_i=1. So in any pairing, all participants will have sum 2. So the best possible rank is 1 (if the jury assigns it to Vasya), and worst is 5 (if the jury assigns it to the last). So the best possible rank is indeed 1.\n\nSo perhaps the best possible rank is always 1. Unless there's a scenario where even when choosing the maximum possible sum for Vasya, there are other participants with higher sums. But that can't happen. Because the maximum sum is the maximum possible. So if Vasya's sum is that maximum, then no other participant can have a higher sum than that. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo that seems to be the case. Therefore, the first part of the answer is always 1. But wait, what if x is such that the maximum possible sum is less than x? No, the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists a pair (i,j) such that a_i +b_j >=x. So the maximum possible sum is at least x. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo that's the best possible rank. So the first number in the output is always 1. Wait, but why in the second sample input, the output is 1 5. So that's consistent.\n\nBut then why the first sample's output is 1 5. So the best is 1, which is correct.\n\nSo then, the first part is easy. Now, the second part is the worst possible rank. That's more complex.\n\nThe worst possible rank is determined by choosing a pairing where Vasya's total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arranging the other participants' totals to be as high as possible, thus pushing Vasya's rank as low as possible.\n\nSo how can we compute this?\n\nLet me think. For the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible value of S (Vasya's total) such that S >=x, and then count the maximum number of participants that can have a total >= S. Then, the worst possible rank would be that count plus 1 (if there are k participants with higher total, then Vasya's rank is k+1, but if there are some with equal, then it depends on the jury's choice. But to get the worst possible rank, we need to maximize the number of participants that have total >= S. So the worst possible rank is the maximum number of participants that can have total >= S (for S being the minimal possible value that is >=x) plus 1, or just that number, depending on whether Vasya's S is included.\n\nWait, let's think again. Suppose that Vasya's total is S (the minimal possible that is >=x). We want to arrange the other pairings such that as many participants as possible have a total >= S. Then, the worst possible rank for Vasya is the number of participants with total >=S (including himself) plus 1? Or not. Because if there are m participants with total >=S, then Vasya could be placed in the m-th position, but if the jury wants to give him the worst possible, they can put him last among those m. So the worst possible rank is m.\n\nBut how to compute m.\n\nSo the steps for the worst possible rank are:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible S (Vasya's total) that is >=x. How?\n\nTo find this minimal S, we need to find the minimal possible value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. But since the pairing is arbitrary, we can choose the minimal possible S. However, how to find that minimal S?\n\nWait, but the minimal S is the minimal value that is >=x and can be achieved by some a_i + b_j. For example, if there is a pair (a_i, b_j) that sums to exactly x, then that's the minimal possible S. If not, then the next higher value.\n\nBut how to find this minimal S?\n\nBut perhaps, the minimal S is the minimal value such that there exists a_i and b_j where a_i + b_j >=x. But how to find that.\n\nBut for the worst case scenario, we need to choose S as small as possible (but still >=x), and then arrange the other pairings to have as many as possible participants with a total >= S. Then, the worst possible rank is the number of participants that can have a total >= S, including Vasya.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nSo, here's the approach for the worst case:\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible S (>=x) that can be achieved by some a_i + b_j, and then find the maximum number of participants that can have a total >= S in some pairing. Then, the worst possible rank is that number.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think. For the worst case, we need to choose S as small as possible (but >=x), and then arrange the pairings such that as many as possible participants have a total >= S. Because this will maximize the number of people that are above or equal to Vasya's S, hence making his rank as bad as possible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Find the minimal S such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >=x. Let's call this S_min. But how to find S_min?\n\nWait, S_min is the minimal value that is >=x and can be achieved by some a_i + b_j. For example, if x is 2, and there are pairs with sums 2,3, then S_min is 2. So for the worst case, we need to take S as small as possible, so that more people can have higher sums.\n\nBut how to find S_min?\n\nWell, S_min is the minimal value between all possible a_i + b_j that are >=x. But since the pairing is arbitrary, we can choose any a_i and b_j for Vasya. So S_min is the minimal value in the set {a_i + b_j | a_i and b_j are from the two lists} that is >=x. However, the problem says that there exists at least one such pair. So S_min is the minimum of all possible a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nBut how to compute that? Well, perhaps we can find all possible pairs and find the minimal one that is >=x. But since n can be up to 1e5, that would be O(n^2) which is impossible.\n\nSo we need a better approach. How can we find the minimal S such that S >=x and there exists a_i and b_j with a_i + b_j = S?\n\nWait, but for the worst case, we need to find the minimal possible S that is >=x. So that's the minimal possible sum that is >=x. So to find that, we can sort the a array and the b array, and for each a_i, find the minimal b_j that when added to a_i is >=x. Then take the minimum over all such a_i + b_j.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nYes. Let's sort the a array in ascending order, and the b array in ascending order. Then for each a_i, we can find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Since the b array is sorted, for each a_i, we can perform a binary search to find the minimal b_j that satisfies this condition. Then, the minimal S is the minimal among all these a_i + b_j values.\n\nBut also, there might be cases where even the maximum b_j is not enough. But the problem says that there exists at least one pair, so that's not a problem.\n\nOnce we have S_min, the minimal possible sum for Vasya, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have a total >= S_min in some pairing of the a and b arrays.\n\nSo the question becomes: given the two arrays a and b, what is the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= S_min, where each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of maximum matching where we want as many pairs as possible with sum >= S_min.\n\nHow to compute this maximum number?\n\nThis is a classic problem. The approach is to sort a in ascending order and b in descending order, then pair the smallest a with the largest possible b that can form a sum >= S_min. Or perhaps sort a in ascending and b in ascending, then for each a_i, find the minimal b_j that can be paired with it, and proceed greedily.\n\nWait, here's a standard approach for maximum matching:\n\nSort a in ascending order, and sort b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, find the smallest b_j that hasn't been used yet and such that a_i + b_j >= S_min. If found, pair them. This way, we can maximize the number of pairs.\n\nAlternatively, sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, pair with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet and a_i + b_j >= S_min. But I think the first approach is better.\n\nLet me think again. To maximize the number of pairs with sum >= S_min, we can sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order. Then, use two pointers approach:\n\nInitialize i = 0 (start of a), j = n-1 (end of b). For each a_i, check if a_i + b_j >= S_min. If yes, then pair them, increment i and decrement j. Else, increment i (since this a_i can't be paired with any b_j, as even the largest available b_j is too small).\n\nThis is similar to the approach used in the \"two sum\" problem for maximum pairs.\n\nYes, this approach would give the maximum number of pairs possible with sum >= S_min.\n\nSo, once we have S_min, we can compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min. Let's call this count 'k'.\n\nThen, the worst possible rank for Vasya is k. Because in this scenario, there are k participants with sum >= S_min (including Vasya), and the jury can assign him the last position among them, so his rank is k.\n\nWait, but how does that work? Because in this case, the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S_min is k. So Vasya is one of them, and the worst possible rank is k.\n\nBut in the first sample input, S_min is 2. Then, the maximum number of pairs with sum >=2 is 5 (all of them). So the worst possible rank is 5, which matches the sample.\n\nIn the second sample input, let's see. The input is:\n\nn=6, x=7\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nSo S_min is the minimal sum >=7. Let's find it.\n\nFor each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=7.\n\nLet's sort a and b.\n\nOriginal a: [4,3,5,6,4,4] → sorted a: [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n\nOriginal b: [8,6,0,4,3,4] → sorted b: [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\nNow, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j that makes sum >=7.\n\nFor a_i =3: need b_j >=4. The minimal is 4. So 3+4=7.\n\nFor a_i=4: need b_j >=3. The minimal is 3. 4+3=7.\n\nSimilarly for the other a_i's. So the minimal S_min is 7.\n\nThen, the maximum number of pairs with sum >=7.\n\nUsing the two pointers approach:\n\nsorted a: [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n\nsorted b: [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\ni starts at 0 (a[0]=3), j starts at 5 (b[5]=8). 3+8=11 >=7 → count +=1. i=1, j=4.\n\na[1]=4, b[4]=6 → 4+6=10 >=7 → count=2. i=2, j=3.\n\na[2]=4, b[3]=4 → 4+4=8 >=7 → count=3. i=3, j=2.\n\na[3]=4, b[2]=4 → 4+4=8 >=7 → count=4. i=4, j=1.\n\na[4]=5, b[1]=3 → 5+3=8 >=7 → count=5. i=5, j=0.\n\na[5]=6, b[0]=0 → 6+0=6 <7 → no. So i increases to 6, loop ends. Total count is 5.\n\nSo the maximum number of pairs is 5. So the worst possible rank is 5, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSteps to solve the problem:\n\n1. For the best possible rank, it is always 1. Because we can choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya (which is >=x), and arrange others to have lower sums, so Vasya is first.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple people with the same maximum sum? Then the jury can assign him first place, so best is 1. So yes.\n\nSo the best possible rank is 1.\n\n2. For the worst possible rank:\n\n   a. Find the minimal S_min such that there exists a_i + b_j >=x. How?\n\n      - Sort a and b.\n\n      - For each a_i, find the minimal b_j (using binary search) such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then collect all such possible sums and take the minimum of them.\n\n   b. Once we have S_min, compute the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed with sum >= S_min. Let this be 'k'.\n\n   c. The worst possible rank is 'k'.\n\nBut how to find S_min?\n\nLet me think again. To find the minimal possible S that is >=x and can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j). How?\n\nWe can sort a and b. For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, take the minimum of all these possible a_i + b_j.\n\nBut how to find that efficiently.\n\nLet me think. Sort the a array in ascending order. Sort the b array in ascending order.\n\nFor each a_i, we can find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Since the b array is sorted, for each a_i, we can perform a binary search on b to find the smallest b_j that is >= (x - a_i). If such a b_j exists, then the sum is a_i + b_j. We can track the minimum of all such sums.\n\nYes. So for example, for a_i in sorted a, and for each a_i, find the minimal b_j >= (x - a_i). The minimal possible sum for this a_i is a_i + b_j. Then, the overall minimal S_min is the minimum of all these a_i + b_j values.\n\nOnce we have S_min, proceed to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min.\n\nSo now, the code steps:\n\nFirst, read n and x.\n\nThen read the a list and the b list.\n\nSort a and sort b.\n\nCompute S_min.\n\nTo compute S_min:\n\nInitialize min_sum to some large value.\n\nFor each a_i in a:\n\n   target = x - a_i\n\n   find the smallest index j in b where b[j] >= target.\n\n   if such j exists:\n\n       current_sum = a_i + b[j]\n\n       if current_sum < min_sum:\n\n           min_sum = current_sum\n\nSo after processing all a_i, min_sum is the minimal possible S that is >=x.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple a_i's and for some a_i, there's no b_j >= target? Well, the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. So in this process, at least one of the a_i's will have a corresponding b_j.\n\nOnce S_min is found, then compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min.\n\nTo compute that, use the two pointers approach:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i = 0 (start of a), j = n-1 (end of b). count = 0.\n\nWhile i < n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] >= S_min:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1\n\nSo this gives the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min.\n\nThen, the worst possible rank is count.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input, the S_min is 2. Then the maximum count is 5. So the worst possible rank is 5, which matches.\n\nIn the second sample input, S_min is 7. The count is 5. So the worst possible rank is 5.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: All participants have the same sum. Then, S_min is that sum. The maximum count is n. So the worst possible rank is n.\n\nWhich matches the first sample.\n\nAnother case: x is 0. Then, S_min is 0. But since all a and b are non-negative, the sum can be 0. Then, maximum count is n, so worst possible rank is n.\n\nAnother case: n=1. Then, the best is 1, worst is 1.\n\nAnother case: x is larger than all possible sums. But the problem says it's guaranteed that there exists a pair with sum >=x. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, coding this.\n\nBut for the S_min calculation, how to perform the binary search?\n\nIn Python, we can use the bisect module.\n\nFor each a_i in the sorted a array, compute target = x - a_i. Then, find the first index in the sorted b array where the value is >= target. If such index exists, then take the value at that index and add to a_i.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\nimport bisect\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nsorted_b = sorted(b)\n\nmin_sum = infinity\n\nfor ai in sorted_a:\n\n    target = x - ai\n\n    # find the first index in sorted_b where value >= target\n\n    idx = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_b, target)\n\n    if idx < len(sorted_b):\n\n        current_sum = ai + sorted_b[idx]\n\n        if current_sum < min_sum:\n\n            min_sum = current_sum\n\nSo this would find the minimal possible S_min.\n\nOnce we have min_sum, then compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= min_sum.\n\nBut what if there are multiple possible S_min? For example, multiple pairs that sum to the same value. But the code above finds the minimal possible S_min.\n\nOnce that is done, the two pointers approach.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead n, x.\n\nRead a list.\n\nRead b list.\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\n\nsorted_b = sorted(b)\n\nCompute S_min as described.\n\nThen, compute max_count using two pointers.\n\nThen, output 1 and max_count.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the max_count is 5. Which is correct. So yes.\n\nSo, the code for the worst case is as described.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with the second sample input.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=6, x=7\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4] → sorted_a = [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4] → sorted_b = [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\nFor each ai in sorted_a:\n\nai=3 → target =7-3=4. Find first index in sorted_b >=4. sorted_b is [0,3,4,4,6,8]. The first index is 2 (value 4). So sum is 3+4=7.\n\nai=4 → target=7-4=3. Find first index in sorted_b >=3 → index 1 (value 3). sum 4+3=7.\n\nai=4 → same as before, sum 7.\n\nai=4 → same, sum 7.\n\nai=5 → target=2. Find first index >=2 → index 0 (value 0 is 0 <2? Wait, sorted_b is [0,3,4,4,6,8]. So target is 7-5=2. Find first index where b[j] >=2. The first element >=2 is 3 at index 1. So sum 5+3=8.\n\nai=6 → target is 7-6=1. Find first index where b[j] >=1 → index 0 (value 0 is <1?), no. Wait, sorted_b[0] is 0. So target is 1. The first element >=1 is 3 (index 1). sum 6+3=9.\n\nSo the min_sum is 7.\n\nThen, compute max_count with S_min=7.\n\nsorted_a is [3,4,4,4,5,6], sorted_b is [0,3,4,4,6,8].\n\ni=0, j=5. a[i]=3, b[j]=8 → 3+8=11 >=7 → count=1. i=1, j=4.\n\na[1]=4, b[4]=6 → 4+6=10 >=7 → count=2. i=2, j=3.\n\na[2]=4, b[3]=4 → 8 >=7 → count=3. i=3, j=2.\n\na[3]=4, b[2]=4 → 8 >=7 → count=4. i=4, j=1.\n\na[4]=5, b[1]=3 → 5+3=8 >=7 → count=5. i=5, j=0.\n\na[5]=6, b[0]=0 → 6+0=6 <7 → i increments to 6, loop ends. So count=5. So the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple possibilities for S_min? For example, if there are multiple pairs that sum to the same minimal value. It doesn't matter, since we take the minimal S_min.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nBut for the S_min calculation, we need to loop through all elements in sorted_a, and for each, perform a binary search on sorted_b.\n\nBut for n=1e5, this would be O(n log n), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport bisect\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsorted_a = sorted(a)\nsorted_b = sorted(b)\n\n# Compute S_min\nmin_sum = float('inf')\n\nfor ai in sorted_a:\n    target = x - ai\n    # find first index in sorted_b >= target\n    idx = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_b, target)\n    if idx < len(sorted_b):\n        current_sum = ai + sorted_b[idx]\n        if current_sum < min_sum:\n            min_sum = current_sum\n\n# Now compute max_count with sum >= min_sum\n\ni = 0\nj = n - 1\ncount = 0\n\nwhile i < n and j >= 0:\n    if sorted_a[i] + sorted_b[j] >= min_sum:\n        count +=1\n        i +=1\n        j -=1\n    else:\n        i +=1\n\nprint(1, count)\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple possible S_min? For example, suppose that there are multiple pairs that can achieve the same minimal sum. But the code correctly finds the minimal sum.\n\nBut what if there is no pair that achieves min_sum? Well, no, because the code finds the minimal sum that is >=x, and the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x.\n\nBut let's check for the case where x is zero. For example, n=1, x=0. Then, a and b are [0], [0]. min_sum is 0. Then, count is 1. So output is 1 1.\n\nAnother test case: first sample input.\n\nInput is:\n\n5 2\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nsorted_a is [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nsorted_b is same.\n\nFor each ai=1, target is 2-1=1. bisect_left finds index 0. sum is 1+1=2. So min_sum is 2.\n\nThen, compute count:\n\ni=0, j=4. 1+1=2 >=2 → count=1. i=1, j=3. same. count=2. etc. until count=5.\n\nSo output is 1 5. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nAnother test case: when there are multiple possible S_min.\n\nBut I think the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about when x is larger than all possible sums? Well, the problem says that it's guaranteed that there exists a pair with sum >=x, so that case is not possible.\n\nBut what if x is zero and some a_i + b_j is zero? Well, the code would handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1. Then, the code returns 1 and 1.\n\nAnother case: when S_min is not achievable by any pair. But no, the code ensures that.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when computing S_min, for each ai in sorted_a, we find the minimal b_j that can be paired with ai to get sum >=x. But what if there are multiple ai's that can be paired with different b_j's to get different sums, and the minimal sum is the minimum among all those possibilities.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the final code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the possible pairings of scores from the two tours to find these ranks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: The best possible rank Vasya can achieve is always 1. This is because we can always pair Vasya's scores with the highest possible sum that meets or exceeds the minimum required points, ensuring he is at the top of the rankings.\n\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To determine the worst possible rank, we need to:\n   - **Find the Minimum Valid Sum (S_min)**: This is the smallest sum of scores from the two tours that meets or exceeds the minimum required points (x). This is done by sorting the scores and using binary search to efficiently find the minimum valid sum.\n   - **Maximize the Number of Participants with Scores ≥ S_min**: Using a two-pointer technique on sorted arrays, we determine the maximum number of participants that can have scores greater than or equal to S_min. This count gives the worst possible rank for Vasya.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr + n]))\n    ptr += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[ptr:ptr + n]))\n    ptr += n\n    \n    sorted_a = sorted(a)\n    sorted_b = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Compute S_min\n    min_sum = float('inf')\n    for ai in sorted_a:\n        target = x - ai\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_b, target)\n        if idx < len(sorted_b):\n            current_sum = ai + sorted_b[idx]\n            if current_sum < min_sum:\n                min_sum = current_sum\n    \n    # Compute max_count with sum >= min_sum\n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    count = 0\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        if sorted_a[i] + sorted_b[j] >= min_sum:\n            count += 1\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    print(1, count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants, minimum required points, and the scores from the two tours.\n- **Sorting**: Both score lists are sorted to facilitate efficient calculations.\n- **Finding Minimum Valid Sum (S_min)**: By iterating through each score in the first tour and using binary search on the second tour's scores, we determine the smallest valid sum that meets or exceeds the minimum required points.\n- **Two-Pointer Technique**: This technique is used to count the maximum number of participants that can have scores greater than or equal to S_min, which determines the worst possible rank for Vasya.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute both the best and worst possible ranks using sorting and binary search, leading to an optimal solution.",
