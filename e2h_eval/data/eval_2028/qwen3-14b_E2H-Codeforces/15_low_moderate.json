They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find all the winning integers x for a playoff tournament based on the given string s. The problem says that each phase of the tournament has certain rules: in phase i (starting from 1?), if s_i is 0, the lower skill level team wins; if it's 1, the higher one wins. And I have to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the tournament works. Let's take the example given. For n=3 and s=101. The output is 4 5 6 7. Let me think why.\n\nSo, the tournament has 2^3 = 8 teams. The phases are 3 in total. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. The first phase (phase 1) has 4 games (since 2^(3-1) = 4). Then phase 2 has 2 games, phase 3 has 1 game.\n\nThe string s is '101', which is length 3. So for phase 1 (i=1?), s[0] is '1' meaning higher skill wins. Phase 2 (i=2?), s[1] is '0' meaning lower skill wins. Phase 3 (i=3?), s[2] is '1' meaning higher skill wins.\n\nSo the question is, for each possible x (from 1 to 8), can we arrange the permutation p such that x ends up as the champion?\n\nThe key here is to model the tournament structure and determine for each x what conditions must be met in each phase so that x can win.\n\nBut how do I model this? Since the permutation p can be chosen arbitrarily, except that it must be a permutation of 1 to 2^n, the problem is to find for which x there exists a way to arrange the initial positions of the teams such that x can win through each round according to the rules of the phases.\n\nBut how to model the tournament structure. Let's think recursively. For each round, the teams are grouped into pairs. The winner of each pair proceeds to the next round.\n\nBut the order of the teams in the initial bracket matters. For example, in the first round, team 1 vs 2, then 3 vs 4, etc. So the initial arrangement is fixed in terms of pairing. However, the permutation p determines which team is where. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that p is a permutation of the numbers 1 to 2^n. But the actual positions of the teams in the bracket are determined by their initial positions. So, for example, in the first round, the first pair is team 1 and team 2 (but which team is which depends on p? Or is the initial arrangement fixed, and the permutation p is the skill levels of the teams in their initial positions?)\n\nWait, the problem says that the teams are split into pairs as follows: team 1 plays against team 2, team 3 vs 4, etc. So the initial bracket is fixed. However, the permutation p gives the skill levels of the teams. So team 1's skill is p_1, team 2's is p_2, etc. So the initial positions of the teams are fixed (positions 1 to 2^n), and their skill levels are given by p. So when you arrange p, you can assign any skill level to any position. But the tournament bracket is fixed in terms of which positions are paired in each round.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the skill level of some team, and that team can win the tournament according to the rules of the phases.\n\nSo for each x, we need to check whether there's a way to arrange the skills in the bracket so that x can win.\n\nNow, how can we model the tournament structure for x to be able to win? Let's think about the process of the tournament.\n\nIn each phase (round), the teams are paired. The winner of each pair proceeds to the next round. The rules for each phase are given by the string s. For example, in phase 1 (the first round), for each match, the higher or lower skill level team wins, depending on s[0].\n\nBut since the permutation can be arranged, the idea is to find for x, a path through the tournament where in each round, x can win the match according to the phase's rule, and also have the necessary opponents in each round.\n\nBut how to model this? It seems like a problem where for each x, we need to determine what constraints it must satisfy in each round.\n\nLet me think recursively. For x to be the champion, it must win all rounds. Let's consider the tournament as a binary tree. Each round corresponds to a level of the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which skill levels can win a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase of the tournament. The tournament structure is such that teams are paired in each phase, and the winner proceeds to the next phase based on the rules provided in the string `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured in a binary tree format with `2^n` teams. Each phase halves the number of teams until only one champion remains.\n2. **Phase Rules**: Each phase has a rule (either higher or lower skill level wins) determined by the string `s`.\n3. **Recursive Validation**: For each possible skill level `x`, we need to check if there exists a permutation of teams such that `x` can win all phases according to the rules given in `s`.\n4. **Range Constraints**: For each phase, determine the minimum and maximum possible values that `x` must satisfy to win that phase. This involves recursively checking the constraints from the subsequent phases.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    def get_winning_numbers(n, s):\n        def dfs(phase, depth, min_val, max_val):\n            if depth == n:\n                return [min_val, max_val]\n            current_rule = s[depth]\n            next_phase = phase + 1\n            if current_rule == '1':\n                # Higher skill wins in this phase\n                # So, x must be higher than all opponents in this phase\n                # The next phase's min and max will be determined by the next round\n                # For this phase, the min and max are determined by the next round's range\n                new_min, new_max = dfs(next_phase, depth + 1, min_val, max_val)\n                # In this phase, x must be >= new_min and <= new_max\n                # But since it's higher skill, x must be larger than the other team in this round\n                # So the minimal x is new_min, but since it needs to be higher than the other team, which can be as low as 1\n                # Wait, perhaps I need to think about the ranges that x must fall into in each phase\n                # Let me think again.\n                # For each phase, the current x must be able to beat its opponent in that phase.\n                # The opponent in that phase must be such that x is higher than them (if rule is 1).\n                # But how do we model this?\n                # Let's think recursively.
