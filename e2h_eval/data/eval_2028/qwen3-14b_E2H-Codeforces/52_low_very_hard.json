Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the ones that have gone out. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is 'a'. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The conversion rate is 'b' used candles to make one new one. And this new candle can be used again, so it's a loop.\n\nThe goal is to find the total number of hours he can keep the room lit. Let's think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let me walk through that example again.\n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. He uses all 4, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 used candles are converted into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 used ones are converted into 2/2 = 1 new candle. He uses that, adding 1 hour. Now, he has 1 used candle. Since 1 is less than 2, he can't make more. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Start with 6. Burn them all (6 hours). Now 6 used candles. 6 /3 = 2 new. Burn those (2 hours). Now 2 used. 2 <3, so no more. But wait, the output is 8. Wait 6 + 2 = 8? Oh right. But wait, what about when you have 2 used candles. But maybe there's a way to get more?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. Let's take the second example input 6 and 3. The output is 8. Let me walk through:\n\nFirst, 6 candles. Burn them, 6 hours. Now 6 used. Make 6 /3 = 2 new. Burn them, 2 hours. Now 2 used. Can't make any more. So total is 6+2=8. Which matches the output. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the number of used candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how do we model this?\n\nThe key is to track the total hours, and the number of used candles. Let's think of the process as:\n\n- Initially, we have 'a' candles. We burn them all, adding 'a' hours. Then, we have 'a' used candles.\n\nThen, while the number of used candles is >= b:\n\n- Take as many as possible (divided by b) to make new candles. \n\nBut each time, the number of new candles is floor(used_candles / b). Then, the new candles are burned, adding that number of hours. And then, those new candles become used again. \n\nWait, but the process is:\n\nEach time, you can take the used candles, make new ones, burn them, and then collect their used versions again. So this seems like a loop.\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_used = 0\n\nInitially, we have a candles. So:\n\ntotal_hours += a\n\ncurrent_used = a\n\nThen, while current_used >= b:\n\n    new_candles = current_used // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    current_used = (current_used % b) + new_candles \n\nBecause after making new_candles, the remaining used candles are (current_used % b) plus the new ones that have been burned. Wait, no. Wait, when you make new_candles from current_used, you use up (new_candles * b) candles. So the remaining used candles after that would be current_used - (new_candles * b). But since new_candles = current_used // b, then current_used % b is the remainder. Then, after making new_candles, those new_candles are burned, which adds new_candles to the total hours, and then they become used again. So the new current_used is (current_used % b) + new_candles.\n\nYes. Because the new_candles are burned, which adds to the hours, and then they become used. So the process continues.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\ncurrent_used = a\n\nwhile current_used >= b:\n\n    new_candles = current_used // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    current_used = (current_used % b) + new_candles \n\nRepeat until current_used < b.\n\nSo for example, the first case:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours =4, current_used=4.\n\nLoop: 4 >=2. new_c",
