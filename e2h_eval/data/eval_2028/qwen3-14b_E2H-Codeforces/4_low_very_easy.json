The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to calculate the number of times each loses over n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round directly isn't feasible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Nikephoros uses sequence A, which repeats cyclically. Similarly for Polycarpus with sequence B. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find out what move each makes, then determine who wins.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, iterating through each round is impossible. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that can be computed once and then multiplied.\n\nLet me think: the moves for each player repeat every len(A) and len(B) rounds respectively. So the combined pattern of their moves would repeat every LCM(len(A), len(B)) rounds. Let's call this period T. So if we can compute the number of wins for each player in one period, then multiply by the number of full periods in n rounds, and then add the remaining rounds.\n\nYes! That's the way to go. Because for large n, we can compute how many full cycles there are and the remainder.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute T = LCM(m, k), where m is the length of A and k the length of B.\n\n2. For each round in 0 to T-1, determine the moves of A and B, then compute who wins. Keep track of the number of wins for each player in this period.\n\n3. The total number of full periods is q = n // T, and the remainder is r = n % T.\n\n4. So the total wins for each player would be q * (number of wins in a period) plus the number of wins in the first r rounds of the next partial period.\n\nBut how to compute the moves for each round?\n\nFor a given round i (starting from 0?), the move for Nikephoros is A[i % m], and for Polycarpus it's B[i % k]. So for each i in 0..T-1, we can compute the moves.\n\nBut since T can be up to m*k, and m and k are up to 1000, T could be up to 1e6. Which is manageable, because even 1e6 operations are acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute for each possible i in 0..T-1, the moves of A and B, then compute the outcome.\n\nOnce we have the counts per period, then multiply by q and add the counts for the first r rounds.\n\nNow, let's think about how to compute the LCM. LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So we need to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, that's fine.\n\nBut wait, for the LCM calculation, if m or k is zero? No, the constraints say m and k are at least 1. So no problem.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B. Then m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute T = LCM(m, k).\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to T-1:\n\n- a_move = A[i % m]\n\n- b_move = B[i % k]\n\nDetermine who wins this round. For each such round, increment the count for Nikephoros or Polycarpus.\n\nOnce we have the counts for a full period (call them per_period_nik, per_period_poly), then:\n\ntotal_periods = n // T\n\nremaining_rounds = n % T\n\nThen, the total for Nik is total_periods * per_period_nik + count_in_remaining_rounds_nik\n\nSame for Poly.\n\nNow, for the remaining_rounds, we need to simulate the first 'remaining_rounds' rounds (from 0 to remaining_rounds - 1) and count how many times each loses.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nWell, for the remaining rounds, we can loop from 0 to remaining_rounds-1, compute the moves, check outcome, and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut since T can be up to 1e6, and remaining_rounds can be up to T-1, which is 1e6, then for each test case, the total time would be O(T) which is acceptable for 1e6.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 2e9, but the code is O(T) which is 1e6, it's manageable.\n\nNow, the question is: How to compute the outcome between two moves.\n\nLet's make a helper function. For two moves a and",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over a large number of rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic strategy. The challenge is to efficiently compute the result without simulating each round individually due to the potentially enormous number of rounds.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every `k` rounds.\n2. **Finding the Period**: The combined sequence of moves for both players will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k`, denoted as `T`. This period `T` allows us to compute results for a full cycle and then use this to determine results for the entire number of rounds.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within one period `T`, determine the moves of both players and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Scaling Up**: Use the results from one period to compute the total losses over the entire number of rounds by considering how many full periods fit into the total number of rounds and the remaining rounds after these full periods.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef calculate_rounds(n, A, B):\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def gcd(a, b):\n        return math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n    \n    T = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the number of wins in one period\n    nik_period = 0\n    poly_period = 0\n    \n    for i in range(T):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        # Determine the outcome\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Check who wins\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n           (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n           (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n            poly_period += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n            nik_period += 1\n    \n    # Calculate total periods and remaining rounds\n    total_periods = n // T\n    remaining = n % T\n    \n    # Compute total from full periods\n    total_nik = total_periods * nik_period\n    total_poly = total_periods * poly_period\n    \n    # Compute remaining rounds\n    for i in range(remaining):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n           (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n           (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            poly_period += 1\n        else:\n            nik_period += 1\n    total_nik += nik_period\n    total_poly += poly_period\n    \n    return total_nik, total_poly\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    nik, poly = calculate_rounds(n, A, B)\n    print(f\"{nik} {poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of sequences `A` and `B` is computed to determine the period `T` after which the move sequences repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within the period `T`, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome is checked to count losses for each player.\n4. **Scaling Results**: The total number of full periods and remaining rounds are calculated. The results from the full periods are scaled up, and the remaining rounds are simulated to get the final counts of losses for each player.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the players' strategies, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
