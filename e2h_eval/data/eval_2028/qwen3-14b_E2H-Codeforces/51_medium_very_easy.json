Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, so I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters from both names, the pile should have exactly those letters, no more, no less.\n\nSo the steps I need to do are:\n\n1. Take the three input lines: guest, host, and pile.\n2. Combine the guest and host names into one string.\n3. Check if the combined string has the same count of each character as the pile.\n4. If yes, output YES; else, NO.\n\nHmm. How to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to concatenate the guest and host names, then create a frequency dictionary for that combined string. Then create a frequency dictionary for the pile. Then compare the two dictionaries. If they are the same, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python?\n\nLet me think. For example, for the first sample input:\n\nGuest is SANTACLAUS, host is DEDMOROZ. Combined, their letters should be SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Then the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Wait, but when you combine the guest and host, the total letters should be exactly the same as the pile.\n\nWait, but how to check that? Because the pile is supposed to be exactly the letters from the guest and host combined. So the sum of the counts of each character in guest + host should equal the counts in the pile.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Combine guest and host into a single string, say combined = guest + host.\n- Then check if the sorted combined string is equal to the sorted pile string.\n\nWait, that's a clever way. Because if you sort both the combined string and the pile, then if they are the same, then the pile has exactly the same letters as the combined string.\n\nYes. For example, if combined is \"ABC\" and pile is \"CBA\", sorted both would be \"ABC\" and \"ABC\", so equal.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nTake the three inputs. Combine the first two, then check if the sorted combination equals the sorted pile.\n\nBut wait, what about the lengths? For example, if the combined length is different from the pile's length, then it's automatically NO. But checking the sorted strings would take care of that, because if the lengths are different, the sorted strings can't be equal.\n\nSo the code could be:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\nif sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but the input is three lines. Oh right, the input is three lines. So in the code, we need to read three lines. But in the sample input given, the first example's input is three lines. So for example, the first input is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo the code would read three lines. So in Python, we can read them via input() three times. But sometimes, when there are multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is three lines. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line the host's name, third line the pile.\n\nSo the code needs to read three lines. So for each test case, we process three lines.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows three examples. Like the first input is three lines, then the second input is three lines, etc. But in the problem statement, the input is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case, not multiple. Because the sample input shows three examples, but each example is three lines.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input is given as a list of three examples. But in reality, the program should read three lines from standard input. So for example, in the first example, the input is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWhich would produce output YES.\n\nSo the code should read three lines, process them, and output YES or NO.\n\nSo the code structure is straightforward.\n\nBut in Python, when reading from stdin, if you use input(), each call reads a line. So for the three lines, we can read them as:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen combine guest and host into combined = guest + host.\n\nThen check if sorted(combined) equals sorted(pile). If yes, output YES else NO.\n\nThat's the plan.\n\nBut let's think about edge cases.\n\nWhat if the combined string is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, all lines are not empty. So guest and host are non-empty, so combined is non-empty. The pile is also non-empty. So no problem.\n\nAnother case: when the combined length is different from pile's length. For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → sorted combined is AB, sorted pile is AB → YES. If pile is \"A\", then sorted combined is AB, pile is A → lengths differ, so NO.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother case: same letters but different counts. Like guest is \"AA\", host is \"BB\", pile is \"AABB\" → sorted combined is AABB, sorted pile is AABB → YES. If pile is \"AAB\", then sorted combined is AABB, pile is AAB → lengths differ. So code returns NO.\n\nSo this approach should handle all cases.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead three lines, combine first two, check if sorted combined equals sorted pile.\n\nSo the code is simple.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count letters. Let me see:\n\nBut perhaps the code will sort them. Let's see:\n\nThe pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me check the combined and pile.\n\nBut perhaps the code will handle it correctly.\n\nAnother sample input is the second example:\n\nPAPAINOEL\nJOULUPUKKI\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Let's see the length. Let me count:\n\nPAPAINOEL is 9 letters. JOULUPUKKI is 10 letters. Combined is 19 letters.\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the letters. Let me see:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's count letters. Let me think:\n\nBut perhaps the code would compare the sorted versions. For example, the combined string would have letters from PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Let's see:\n\nThe guest is PAPAINOEL → letters: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L. Host is JOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I. So combined letters:\n\nLetters in guest: 2 P, 2 A, 1 I, 1 N, 1 O, 1 E, 1 L.\n\nHost: 1 J, 2 O, 1 U, 3 L, 1 P, 2 K, 2 I.\n\nCombined letters:\n\nP: 2+1=3?\n\nWait guest has PAPAINOEL: P appears twice (positions 0 and 2?), yes. Host is JOULUPUKKI: has one P (position 5?), yes. So combined P is 3.\n\nNow the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's count letters. Let me see:\n\nBut the sample output says that the answer is NO. Because the pile is missing a P and has an extra L.\n\nSo the code would sort the combined and the pile and compare.\n\nIn the sample input, the code would return NO for the second case.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead three lines, then check.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\nif sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nThat's the code. Let me check the sample input.\n\nFor the third example:\n\nBABBONATALE\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nCombined is BABBONATALE + FATHERCHRISTMAS → let's see:\n\nThe combined length is len(BABBONATALE) is 10 letters (B, A, B, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, E? Wait let me count:\n\nWait BABBONATALE: B A B B O N A T A L E → that's 11 letters? Let me check:\n\nB (1), A (2), B (3), B (4), O (5), N (6), A (7), T (8), A (9), L (10), E (11). Yes. So 11 letters. Host is FATHERCHRISTMAS: F A T H E R C H R I S T M A S → let me count letters. Let's see, F (1), A (2), T (3), H (4), E (5), R (6), C (7), H (8), R (9), I (10), S (11), T (12), M (13), A (14), S (15). So 15 letters. Combined length is 11 + 15 = 26 letters.\n\nThe pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nBut the sample output says that the answer is NO because there's an extra L. So the code would compare the sorted combined and sorted pile. The combined has some letters, and the pile has an extra L. So the sorted lists would differ.\n\nSo the code would output NO.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n",
