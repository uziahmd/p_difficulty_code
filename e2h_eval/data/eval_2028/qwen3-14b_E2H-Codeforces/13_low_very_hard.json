For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes forms a major chord, minor chord, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor definitions.\n\nFirst, let me understand the definitions again. \n\nA major triad has X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3. So total from X to Z is 7. But since the notes are cyclic, I need to calculate the distances properly.\n\nSimilarly, a minor triad requires X to Y is 3 semitones, Y to Z is 4. So total X to Z is 7 as well. Wait, but the order of the notes matters here. The problem says that the triad is unordered, but we can arrange them in some order to check the conditions.\n\nSo for the three notes, I need to check all permutations of them and see if any permutation satisfies either the major or minor condition.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between two notes?\n\nFirst, I need to map each note to its position in the 12-note scale. Let's list them in order:\n\nThe notes are: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, in the problem statement, the list is given as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Oh right, and after H comes C again. So the order is important for calculating the distance between two notes.\n\nSo for example, the distance from C to E is 4 semitones. Let's check: C is position 0, C# is 1, D is 2, D# is 3, E is 4. So from C (0) to E (4) is 4 semitones. That's correct. And from E to C would be 8 semitones? Because if you go forward, E to F is 1, F to F# is 2, etc., up to C. Wait, but the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper note. So if you have two notes, the distance is calculated as the number of semitones when moving upwards. So if X is lower than Y, then distance is Y - X. If Y is lower than X, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think. For example, between E and C: if you consider the distance from E to C, since E is higher than C, but the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to upper. So if you have two notes, say X and Y, the distance between X and Y is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12, but considering that if Y is higher than X, then it's Y - X, else (Y + 12 - X). Wait, but the problem says that the distance is measured along the musical scale from the lower to upper. So for example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones (as in the example). The distance between E and C would be 8 semitones because you have to go E to F (1), F to F# (2), F# to G (3), G to G# (4), G# to A (5), A to B (6), B to H (7), H to C (8). So that's 8 semitones.\n\nSo for any two notes, the distance from X to Y is (Y_pos - X_pos) mod 12, but if that's negative, add 12? Wait no. Wait, the distance is always the minimal number of semitones when moving upward. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Because you wrap around.\n\nBut how do I compute that? For example, if X is at position 0 (C), Y is at position 4 (E): distance is 4. If X is E (4), Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 + 12 - 4) = 8. So the formula for the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y + 12 - X). Which can also be written as (Y - X) % 12, but wait, no. Because (Y - X) mod 12 gives the same as",
