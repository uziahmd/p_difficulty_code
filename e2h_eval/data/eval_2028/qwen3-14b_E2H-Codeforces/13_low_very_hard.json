For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem where I have to determine if a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. Hmm. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that the three notes can be ordered in some way. For a major triad, there must be an ordering where X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3. For minor, it's 3 and then 4. So I need to check all possible permutations of the three notes and see if any of them fit either the major or minor condition.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Convert each note into a numerical value representing its position in the 12-note scale. Like C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H (which is B in some notations, but according to the problem statement, the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, the note list says: \"C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\" Wait, that's 12 notes. Wait, but in standard music theory, B and H are the same? Oh right, the problem says that H is considered the same as B. So perhaps the note list is written with H instead of B. So the order is:\n\nLet me list them in order:\n\n0: C\n\n1: C#\n\n2: D\n\n3: D#\n\n4: E\n\n5: F\n\n6: F#\n\n7: G\n\n8: G#\n\n9: A\n\n10: B\n\n11: H ?\n\nWait, but the problem says that after H comes C again. So the order is as given. So the list is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So H is the 12th note, but since there are 12 notes, the indexes are 0-11. So H is index 11, and then C is 0 again.\n\nSo first, I need to create a mapping from note names to their numerical positions. Let's make a dictionary for that. Like:\n\nnote_order = {\n    'C': 0,\n    'C#': 1,\n    'D': 2,\n    'D#': 3,\n    'E':4,\n    'F':5,\n    'F#':6,\n    'G':7,\n    'G#':8,\n    'A':9,\n    'B':10,\n    'H':11\n}\n\nWait, but the problem says that the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So yes, B is 10 and H is 11. But in the example given, one of the inputs is 'C# B F' which is considered a minor chord. Let's check that example. The example says that when ordered as B, C#, F, the distances are 3 and 4. Let's see:\n\nB is 10, C# is 1. So the distance from B to C# is (1 - 10 + 12) mod 12? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance between two notes is measured along the musical scale, from the lower to the upper. So for example, between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's see: C is 0, E is 4. The distance is 4-0 = 4. But if you have E and C, the distance is 8, because you go from E (4) to C (0) by moving up 8 semitones (since the total circle is 12). Wait, but how is the distance calculated?\n\nThe problem says: the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So the distance between X and Y is calculated as (Y - X) mod 12? Or is it (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y - X + 12)? Because the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to the upper. So for example, between X and Y, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So for example, between E (4) and C (0), the distance is (0 + 12 -4) = 8 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) if Y >= X, else (Y - X + 1",
