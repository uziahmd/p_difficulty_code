    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. So when I remove one element, I need to find which removal leads to the smallest max-min difference.\n\nFirst, let's think about the brute force approach. For each element in the array, remove it, then compute the max and min of the remaining elements, and track the minimum instability. But with n up to 1e5, this approach would be O(n^2), which is way too slow. So we need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but maybe we can precompute some things. Let's think: the original array's max and min are known. But when we remove an element, how does that affect the max and min?\n\nFor example, if the element removed is the current max, then the new max is the second maximum. Similarly for min. But how do I find those efficiently?\n\nHmm. So perhaps the idea is that when we remove an element, the new max and min can be determined based on whether the removed element was the original max or min. But this might not be straightforward because there could be multiple instances of the max or min.\n\nLet me think of the example given. For the first input: [1,3,3,7]. The original max is 7, min is 1. If we remove 7, the new max is 3, min is 1, instability is 2. If we remove 1, the new max is 7, min is 3, instability is 4. If we remove a 3, then the array becomes [1,3,7], so instability is 6. So the best is to remove 7.\n\nSo, the key here is that when you remove the max or the min, you can get a better instability. But how to find which element to remove?\n\nBut for the general case, perhaps the optimal choice is to remove either the first occurrence of the max, or the first occurrence of the min, or maybe something else. Wait, but maybe the optimal choice is to remove either the max or the min, but not sure. Let me think of another example.\n\nSuppose the array is [1, 2, 5, 5, 5]. The original instability is 5-1=4. If I remove one of the 5s, the instability becomes 5-1=4. If I remove the 1, the instability is 5-2=3. If I remove the 2, the instability is 5-1=4. So the best is to remove the 1, giving instability 3. So in this case, removing the min gives a better result.\n\nAnother example: [1, 5, 5, 5]. Removing 1 gives instability 5-5=0. So that's better than removing any other element. So the idea is that if we can remove the min or max, then the instability can be reduced.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal approach is to consider two scenarios:\n\n1. Remove the first occurrence of the max element. Then the new max is the second max, and the min remains the same (if the original min wasn't the element being removed).\n\nWait, but how do I find the second max? Or maybe, for each element, when we remove it, the new max is the max of the array without that element. Similarly for min.\n\nBut calculating this for every element is expensive. However, perhaps the optimal choice is to remove either the first element, the last element, or some other element that's either the max or min. Wait, but how can we find this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think about the sorted array. Suppose we sort the array. Then, the instability is the difference between the last and first element. Now, when we remove one element, the new instability would be the difference between the new max and new min. For example, if the array is sorted as a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]. If we remove a[0], then the new min is a[1], and max is a[n-1]. The instability is a[n-1] - a[1]. If we remove a[n-1], the instability is a[n-2] - a[0]. If we remove any element in between, say a[i], then the instability is a[n-1] - a[0], since the max and min remain the same. Wait, that's an important point. Because if the array is sorted, then the max is the last element and the min is the first. If we remove any element that's not the first or last, then the max and min remain the same. So the instability is the same as the original. Therefore, the only way to reduce the instability is to",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sorted Array Insight**: By sorting the array, we can easily identify the potential candidates for removal that might reduce instability. When the array is sorted, removing the first or last element (which are the min or max) can potentially reduce the instability.\n2. **Key Observations**:\n   - If we remove the first element (minimum), the new instability is calculated from the second element to the last.\n   - If we remove the last element (maximum), the new instability is calculated from the first element to the second last.\n   - Removing any other element in the middle does not change the max or min, so the instability remains the same as the original array.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By considering only the cases where we remove the first or last element of the sorted array, we can compute the minimum instability in O(n log n) time due to sorting.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    \n    # Check removing the first element\n    instability = a_sorted[-1] - a_sorted[1]\n    min_instability = min(min_instability, instability)\n    \n    # Check removing the last element\n    instability = a_sorted[-2] - a_sorted[0]\n    min_instability = min(min_instability, instability)\n    \n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: The array is sorted to easily access the minimum and maximum values.\n- **Instability Calculation**: By removing the first element (minimum) or the last element (maximum) of the sorted array, we compute the instability for these two scenarios.\n- **Result**: The minimum instability from these two scenarios is the answer, as removing any other element would not reduce the instability further.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the optimal element to remove with minimal computational overhead, leveraging sorting and simple arithmetic operations.",
