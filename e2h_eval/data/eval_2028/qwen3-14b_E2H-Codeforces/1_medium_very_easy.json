The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then the next is two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle. For example, the first ring is the outermost border. The second ring would be the border of a rectangle that's 2 cells in from each edge. So for a rectangle of size w x h, the first ring's perimeter is calculated, then the next one would be based on a smaller rectangle.\n\nWait, the formula given says that the i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so for each ring, the width and height decrease by 4*(i-1) over time. Wait, no. Wait, for the first ring, i=1, so it's (w - 0) x (h - 0) = original size. Then the second ring is (w - 4*(2-1)) = w-4, h-4. So each subsequent ring is 4 less in both dimensions. Because each ring takes 2 cells from each side. So for the second ring, the inner rectangle is 2 cells in from each edge. So the width is original width minus 2*2 (left and right), same for height.\n\nSo for each ring, the perimeter is calculated as 2*(width + height - 2). Because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(w + h) but since it's the border, each side contributes. Wait, for example, a rectangle of m rows and n columns. The number of cells in the border is 2*m + 2*(n-2) — because the top and bottom rows have n cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the corners already counted) have (m-2) each. So total is 2n + 2(m-2) = 2(n + m - 2). Which simplifies to 2*(m + n) -4. Or 2*(m + n - 2). So that's the formula for the perimeter.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w_i x h_i), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, we have to make sure that these dimensions are valid. For example, if the original w and h are small, after some steps, the dimensions might become invalid. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's possible. The problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense because for a 3x3 plate, you can only have one ring.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   add this perimeter to total.\n\nBut wait, wait. Wait, for each ring, the perimeter is calculated as 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). Let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So current_w is 3, current_h is 3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the first sample output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1. So current_w is 7, current_h is 9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14 = 28. Which matches the second sample output. Third example: 7 9 2. So for i=1, perimeter is 28. For i=2, current_w = 7 -4*(1) = 3, current_h = 9 -4*(1) =5. So perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*(6) = 12. So total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the third sample. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop for each i in 1..k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   add to total.\n\nReturn total.\n\nBut wait, what if current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that this doesn't happen. Because the maximum k is floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let's see. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then k can be 1. For i=1, 4*(i-1) is 0. So current_w and h are 3 and ... So for min(w, h) =3, the minimum of current_w and current_h is 3 - 0 =3. So the rectangle is valid.\n\nFor i=2, the current_w would be 3 -4*(1) = -1? But k is limited so that it's not possible. Because for min(w, h) =3, the maximum k is floor( (3 +1)/4 )=1. So the loop will run for i=1 only. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code can proceed as described.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python.\n\nThe input is three integers on one line. So read them as w, h, k.\n\nThen compute the sum.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead input line, split into w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me test the third example again. Input 7 9 2. So:\n\ni=1: current_w =7, current_h=9. perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28.\n\ni=2: current_w =7 -4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: if w=5, h=5, k=2. Let's see:\n\ni=1: 5x5. perimeter 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Then i=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 2*0=0? That can't be. Wait, but for a 1x1 rectangle, the perimeter is zero? Because the formula gives 2*(1 +1 -2) = 0. Which makes sense. But in that case, the code would add 0. But according to the problem statement, the rings are added as per the description. However, the input constraints ensure that k is such that the rings are possible. So for example, when min(w, h) is 5, then floor( (5 +1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. So for k=2, it's not allowed. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead the input line, split into w, h, k. Then loop from 1 to k, compute each perimeter and sum.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead input as:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input: 3 3 1 → 8. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: 7 9 1 → 28. Correct.\n\nThird sample: 7 9 2 → 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. The perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is 16. So output is 16.\n\nAnother test case: w=5, h=5, k=1. Output 16.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should handle all cases. The code is straightforward.\n",
