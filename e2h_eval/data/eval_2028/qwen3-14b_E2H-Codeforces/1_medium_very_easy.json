The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, for the i-th ring, right?\n\nSo for each ring from 1 to k, I need to calculate the perimeter of that rectangle and sum them all. But wait, how does the perimeter calculation work here? Because for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter in terms of cells would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes (length) cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a rectangle that's 3x3: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (the four corners counted twice) → 8, which matches the first example where input is 3 3 1, output is 8.\n\nYes, so the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle with width W and height H is 2*(W + H - 2). Because for each of the two directions, you have (W) cells on top and bottom, and (H-2) cells on the sides (since the corners are already counted). Or maybe another way: the total number of cells in the border is (W * 2) + (H-2)*2. Which simplifies to 2*(W + H - 2). Right.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). But wait, for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1))? Let me check the example.\n\nTake the third example input: 7 9 2. The output is 40.\n\nLet's compute for each ring:\n\nFirst ring (i=1): the rectangle is 7x9. The perimeter is 2*(7 + 9 - 2) = 2*(14) = 28. Then the second ring (i=2): the rectangle is 7-4*(1) = 3, 9-4*(1) = 5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample. So yes, that seems right.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter for the current dimensions, and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, what's the condition for when the rings can be formed? The problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions after subtracting 4*(i-1) from both w and h must be at least 1. Because otherwise, you can't form a rectangle. But since the input k is constrained properly, we don't have to worry about that. So we can safely compute for each i up to k.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Initialize total = 0\n\n- For each i in 1..k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   add this to total\n\n- Return total\n\nWait, but why is the formula for the perimeter 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)? Let me think again. For example, for a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in the border is:\n\nThe top and bottom rows contribute W cells each. The left and right columns contribute (H-2) cells each (since the top and bottom cells are already counted). So total is W*2 + (H-2)*2 = 2(W + H - 2). Yes. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward. Let's test the first sample input:\n\nSample 1: 3 3 1. So i=1: current_w=3, current_h=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSample 2: 7 9 1. So perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the second output.\n\nThird sample: 7 9 2. As discussed earlier, 28 + 12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: Let's say w=5, h=5, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1: 5x5 → 2*(5+5-2)= 16.\n\ni=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. So 1x1. Perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 2*0=0? Wait, but that's a single cell. So the perimeter is zero? Because the border of a 1x1 rectangle is zero cells. So yes. So adding 16 + 0 = 16. But according to the problem statement, the rings are added as per the description. For the second ring, the rectangle is 1x1. But the border of that is zero cells. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code would handle that.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k. Then loop from 1 to k, compute for each i, current_w and current_h, compute perimeter, sum all.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then compute the sum.\n\nFor example:\n\nIn Python:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check for the case when current_w or current_h becomes zero or negative? But according to the problem statement, the input k is such that it's allowed. For example, the constraints on k are that it's <= floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let's see:\n\nSuppose min(w, h) is m. Then for the k-th ring, the dimensions are:\n\nw - 4*(k-1), h - 4*(k-1). Since k is at most floor( (m +1)/4 ), then for example, when m is 3, floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k=1. Then for i=1, 4*(i-1) is 0, so the dimensions are w and h, which are >=3. So for the k-th ring, the dimensions are at least 3 - 4*(k-1) ?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's constraints on k ensure that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 1. Because for example, for the maximum possible k, which is floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ), then for the k-th ring, the min(w, h) -4*(k-1) >= 1 ?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose min(w, h) is 5. Then (5 +1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can be 1. Then for i=1, 5 - 4*(0) =5, which is okay.\n\nIf min(w, h) is 7. Then (7+1)/4 = 2. So floor is 2. So k can be 2. For i=2, 7 -4*(1) =3, which is okay. So for the k-th ring, the dimensions are 3, which is okay.\n\nAnother example: if min(w, h) is 9. Then (9+1)/4 is 2.5 → floor is 2. So k can be 2. For i=2, 9-4*(1) =5, which is okay. If k was 3, then 9-4*(2) =1. But the problem says that k is constrained such that it's up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ), which for min(w, h)=9 would be floor( (9+1)/4 )=2. So k=2 is allowed. So for the k-th ring, the dimensions are 9-4*(k-1) = 9-4*(1) =5. So yes, valid.\n\nSo the code can proceed safely.\n\nThus, the code should be as written above.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 2*6 = 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if w=5, h=5, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1: 5x5 → perimeter 2*(5+5-2)= 16.\n\ni=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1 → perimeter 2*(1+1-2) = 0. Total is 16. So output is 16.\n\nAnother case: w=5, h=5, k=1 → output 16.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
