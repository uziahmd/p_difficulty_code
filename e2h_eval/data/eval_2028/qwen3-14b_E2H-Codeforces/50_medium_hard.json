    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the sum of d(1,n) for all good trees. Let me first understand what a good tree is.\n\nSo, a good tree has edges with weights 1 or -1. And for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i must be -1. Oh right, because each edge is connected to two vertices, so for each vertex, the product of all edges connected to it is -1.\n\nWait, how does that constraint affect the structure of the tree? Let me think. For example, take a simple case where n=2. The tree has only one edge between 1 and 2. For vertex 1, the product of its edges (only one edge) must be -1. Similarly for vertex 2. So the edge's weight must be -1. Hence, for n=2, there's exactly one good tree, and d(1,2) is -1. Which matches the first example.\n\nNow, for n=1? Well, the input says n is positive. But for n=1, there are no edges, but the condition for each vertex (only one vertex) is that the product of all edges incident to it (which is none) is -1. Wait, but the product of zero numbers is 1, not -1. So for n=1, there are no good trees. Hence, the answer would be zero. But according to the note, the second test case is n=1, output is 0. So that's correct.\n\nSo the first thing is to figure out for which n there exists any good trees, and then compute the sum.\n\nBut how to model the constraints for the tree?\n\nLet me think about the product conditions. For each vertex, the product of the edges adjacent to it is -1. Let's consider the product for all vertices. Let me think about the product of all these products. Each edge is connected to two vertices, so when we take the product of all the vertex products, each edge's weight is multiplied twice. Therefore, the total product is (-1)^n, since each vertex contributes a -1. But the product of all the vertex products is equal to the product of (product of edges adjacent to each vertex). However, each edge is counted twice (once for each endpoint). So the total product is (product of edge weights)^(2). Because each edge's weight is multiplied twice. Therefore:\n\nproduct_{v} (product of edges incident to v) = (product of edge weights)^2.\n\nBut the left side is (-1)^n. Therefore:\n\n(product of edge weights)^2 = (-1)^n → product of edge weights squared equals (-1)^n. However, since the square of any real number is non-negative, but here the product is either 1 or -1. Wait, but the square of any real number is positive. So (-1)^n must be 1. Therefore, (-1)^n = 1 → n must be even. Otherwise, this equation can't hold. Therefore, if n is odd, there are no good trees. Because for n odd, (-1)^n is -1, which can't equal (product of edge weights)^2 which is 1. Therefore, for odd n ≥ 1, the answer is zero. Except for n=1, which also gives zero. Wait, but n=1 is odd, and indeed, there are no good trees.\n\nSo this suggests that for all odd n, the answer is zero. For even n, maybe there are some good trees. Let me check the example given for n=4. The third test case input is n=4, output is 998244343, which is -10 mod MOD. So for n=4, which is even, there are good trees.\n\nSo the first conclusion is: if n is odd, the answer is zero. So in code, for n odd, return 0. For even n, compute something else.\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to even n. Let's focus on even n.\n\nNow, for even n, how to count the number of good trees, and compute the sum of d(1,n) over all such trees.\n\nBut perhaps there's a clever way to model this problem.\n\nLet me think again about the constraints. Each vertex must have the product of its incident edges equal to -1. Let me consider the degrees of the vertices. Wait, no, the degrees are not directly related to the product. Because the product depends on the number of edges and their weights. For example, if a vertex has degree k, then the product of the edge weights is -1. So for each vertex, the product of the edge weights is -1. So the product of the edge weights adjacent to the vertex is -1. So for each vertex, the number of edges with weight -1 adjacent to it must be odd. Because the product is -1. Since multiplying an even number of -1s would give 1, and odd would give -1.\n\nSo for each vertex, the number of edges with weight -1 connected to it must be odd.\n\nBut how can this be possible? Let me think about the entire tree.\n\nLet me think of the tree as a graph. Each edge is either +1 or -1. For each vertex, the number of -1 edges adjacent to it is odd.\n\nLet me think about the sum of degrees (number of edges) for all vertices. Each edge connects two vertices. So the sum of the degrees (counted as the number of edges adjacent to each vertex) is 2*(n-1). Now, for each vertex, the number of -1 edges adjacent to it is odd. Let me denote for each vertex v, let c_v be the count of -1 edges adjacent to it. Then c_v is odd for all v. So the sum over all c_v is sum_{v} c_v = sum_{edges} (number of times the edge is counted in c_v). Each edge contributes 1 to the count of each endpoint if it's a -1 edge. So sum c_v is equal to twice the number of -1 edges. Because each -1 edge contributes 1 to two vertices. So sum c_v = 2 * (number of -1 edges).\n\nBut sum c_v is the sum of odd numbers for each vertex. Since each c_v is odd, the sum over all vertices is equal to n * (some odd number). Wait, for example, if n is even, sum of n odd numbers. Let me think: sum of even number of odd numbers is even. Because each odd is 2k+1. Summing even number of them: sum is even * 2k + even * 1. So even + even = even. So sum c_v is even. Which matches the previous statement that sum c_v is 2 * (number of -1 edges), which is even. So that works. So for even n, this is possible.\n\nBut for odd n, the sum of c_v would be sum of odd numbers for n vertices. Which would be odd * odd = odd. But sum c_v is even. Contradiction. So that's why for odd n, there are no good trees. Which confirms our previous conclusion.\n\nSo for even n, there are possible good trees.\n\nNow, how to model the constraints. Let me think of the problem as follows: each edge can be assigned +1 or -1, and the tree must be such that for each vertex, the product of the edges adjacent to it is -1. So the product of edges adjacent to each vertex is -1. Let me think of this as a system of equations. For each vertex, the product of the edges adjacent to it is -1. Let me take logs? Not sure. Alternatively, since the product is -1, which is equivalent to the product being -1. Let me think of each edge's weight as a variable, either +1 or -1. Let me consider that for each vertex, the product of its edges is -1. So, for each vertex v, the product of the edges adjacent to v is -1.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let me consider the tree as a graph. Let me pick a root, say vertex 1. Then, for each node, the product of the edges along the path from the root to that node? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the constraints. Let me consider that the product of the edges adjacent to each vertex is -1. Let me think of the edges as variables. Let me take the tree as a graph. Let me pick an arbitrary tree structure (the actual tree structure is part of the problem, since the problem counts all possible trees with edges assigned ±1 that satisfy the constraints).\n\nBut perhaps the key is to find for each possible tree structure, how many valid assignments of edge weights exist, and then compute the sum of d(1,n) over all such valid assignments for all possible trees.\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 5e5, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) approach.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this problem combinatorially, without enumerating all trees.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For any tree, the assignment of edge weights must satisfy that for each vertex, the product of the edges adjacent to it is -1. Let me think about the system of equations. For example, suppose we have a tree with edges e_1, e_2, ..., e_{n-1}, and for each vertex v, the product of the edges adjacent to v is -1.\n\nLet me consider that each edge is part of two vertices. Let me think of the equations for the vertices. For example, if I have a tree with vertices 1, 2, ..., n, and edges e_1, e_2, etc. Then, for each vertex v, the product of edges adjacent to it is -1.\n\nNow, let me think about the system of equations. Suppose I have a tree. How many solutions are there for the edge weights?\n\nLet me think of the tree as a connected graph. Let me consider that the equations are for the vertices. However, the equations are not independent. For example, if I take the product of all equations for all vertices, I get (-1)^n. But earlier analysis shows that the product of all equations equals (product of all edge weights)^2, which must equal (-1)^n. So for even n, this is possible. But how does that affect the system of equations?\n\nLet me think of the system of equations. Let me suppose that the tree is fixed. How many valid assignments of edge weights are there?\n\nEach edge can be considered as a variable x_e ∈ {+1, -1}. For each vertex v, the product of x_e for all edges adjacent to v is -1. Let me think of the system of equations.\n\nBut the system has n equations (for each vertex), but they are not all independent. Because the product of all equations gives (-1)^n = (product of x_e)^2, which holds for even n. So for even n, there is a solution. But how many solutions?\n\nLet me think of the system. Suppose the tree is fixed. Let me consider the variables as the edges. Let me think of the equations. For example, for a tree with n vertices, there are n-1 edges. So there are n equations, but they are not all independent. Let me see: if I take the product of equations for all vertices except one, say vertex v, then the product of those equations would be (-1)^{n-1} = product of (product of edges adjacent to each vertex except v) = product of (product of edges adjacent to each vertex except v). But each edge is adjacent to two vertices. So when you take the product of all equations except for vertex v, each edge is included in the product once for each of its endpoints, except for edges adjacent to v. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for a tree, the system of equations has rank (n-1). Because the product of all equations gives (-1)^n = product of (product of edges adjacent to each vertex) = product of (x_e)^{degree of v}? No, no. Wait, each x_e is part of two vertices. So the product of all equations is product_{v} (product_{e adjacent to v} x_e) ) = product_{v} (-1) = (-1)^n. On the other hand, this product is equal to product_{e} x_e^{2} (because each x_e is in two vertices' products). So product_{e} x_e^2 = (product x_e)^2. So (-1)^n = (product x_e)^2. Which for even n implies that product x_e can be ±1. So the system is consistent. However, when considering the equations, there are n equations but they are not independent. So the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (rank)} }, but I need to find the rank.\n\nBut perhaps for a tree, the system has exactly one dependency. So the number of independent equations is n-1. Therefore, the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } = 1? Wait, no. Because each equation is multiplicative, and the variables are in {±1}.\n\nAlternatively, think of the system as linear equations over GF(2). But since the equations are multiplicative, perhaps taking logarithms would help. However, since the variables are ±1, we can map them to GF(2) by considering x_e = (-1)^{b_e}, where b_e is 0 or 1. Then, the product of edges adjacent to v is -1. Let's take the logarithm (in multiplicative terms) to additive terms. For example, the product of edges adjacent to v is -1, which is equivalent to the sum (mod 2) of the exponents being 1. Because:\n\nproduct_{e adjacent to v} x_e = (-1)^{sum b_e} = -1 → sum b_e ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nSo for each vertex v, sum_{e adjacent to v} b_e ≡ 1 mod 2.\n\nThis is a system of linear equations over GF(2). The variables are the b_e for each edge e. The system has n equations, each equation being sum of variables (b_e) adjacent to v equals 1 mod 2.\n\nWhat is the rank of this system?\n\nWell, the sum of all equations is sum_{v} (sum_{e adjacent to v} b_e) ) ≡ sum_{v} 1 mod 2.\n\nThe left-hand side is sum_{v} sum_{e adjacent to v} b_e = sum_{e} (number of vertices adjacent to e) * b_e. But each edge is adjacent to two vertices, so this becomes sum_{e} 2*b_e ≡ 0 mod 2. Therefore, the sum of all equations is 0 mod 2. On the right-hand side, sum_{v} 1 mod 2 is n mod 2. Therefore, for the system to be consistent, n mod 2 must be 0. Which is true since we are considering even n. So the system is consistent.\n\nNow, the system of equations has rank (n - 1). Because adding all equations gives 0 ≡ 0 mod 2. So the rank is at most n-1. Also, since the system is connected (the tree is connected), the rank is exactly n-1. Therefore, the number of solutions is 2^{(number of variables - rank)} } = 2^{( (n-1) - (n-1) )} } = 2^0 = 1. So for any tree structure, there is exactly one valid assignment of the edge weights (b_e) that satisfies the equations. Which implies that for each tree structure, there is exactly one way to assign the edge weights (each edge is ±1) such that the product conditions are satisfied.\n\nWait, that's a huge insight! So for each tree structure, there is exactly one assignment of edge weights (up to the choice of variables) that satisfies the product conditions. Therefore, the number of good trees is equal to the number of possible tree structures multiplied by 1 (since each tree structure contributes exactly one valid edge assignment). But wait, no. Wait, the tree structure is part of the problem. The total number of good trees is the number of trees multiplied by the number of valid assignments per tree. Since for each tree, there is exactly one valid assignment, the total number of good trees is equal to the number of trees (n^{n-2}) multiplied by 1. But wait, no. Because the assignment is unique per tree. So for each tree structure, there's exactly one way to assign the edge weights. So the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} × 1. But the problem says that the total number of edge-weighted trees is n^{n-2} × 2^{n-1}. So the good trees are exactly those where the edge weights are uniquely determined by the tree structure. So the number of good trees is n^{n-2} × 1. But how?\n\nBut according to the previous analysis, for each tree structure, there is exactly one valid assignment of edge weights. Therefore, the total number of good trees is equal to the number of tree structures (n^{n-2}) multiplied by 1. Therefore, for even n, the number of good trees is n^{n-2}.\n\nBut wait, the example for n=2: the number of trees is 1 (since Cayley's formula is n^{n-2} = 1). And the number of good trees is 1, which matches. For n=4, the number of good trees is 4^{2} = 16, which matches the third example (the note says there are 16 good trees for n=4). So that seems correct.\n\nSo the problem now is: for even n, compute the sum over all good trees of d(1, n), where each good tree is a tree structure with exactly one valid edge assignment (so each tree contributes exactly one value of d(1,n)).\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for even n, compute the sum of d(1,n) over all possible trees (each tree contributes once, with its unique edge assignment).\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think about what d(1,n) represents. It's the sum of the weights of the edges on the path from 1 to n. Since each tree has a unique assignment of edge weights, which is determined by the constraints.\n\nSo for each tree, we need to find the sum of the edge weights along the unique path from 1 to n, and sum that across all trees.\n\nBut how to compute this sum?\n\nLet me think about the edge weights. For each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined by the constraints. So perhaps there's a way to express the edge weights in terms of the tree structure, and then find the sum of the path from 1 to n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each edge, the contribution to the sum across all trees. That is, for each edge e, determine how many times it is present in the path from 1 to n in some tree, multiplied by its weight (which depends on the tree structure). Then sum all these contributions.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think.\n\nBut the edge weights depend on the tree structure. For each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined by the constraints. So perhaps we can find a formula for the edge weights in terms of the tree structure.\n\nLet me think again about the system of equations. For each vertex, the sum of the b_e (where x_e = (-1)^{b_e}) for edges adjacent to v is 1 mod 2. So, for each vertex v, the sum of b_e for edges adjacent to v is 1 mod 2.\n\nLet me think of this as a system of linear equations over GF(2). The system has rank n-1, so there is a unique solution once we fix one variable. But how to find the solution?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the value of each edge's b_e in terms of the tree structure. Let me think of the tree as rooted at node 1. Let me perform a traversal of the tree and assign values to the edges.\n\nSuppose we root the tree at node 1. For each node, we can assign a value to the edge between it and its parent. Let me think recursively. For the root node (node 1), the sum of the b_e for edges adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. Let's say node 1 has degree d. Then, the sum of the b_e for its d edges must be 1 mod 2. However, each of these edges leads to a subtree. Let me think of the edges as connecting parent to child.\n\nLet me think of the root node. Suppose I have a tree rooted at 1. For each child u of the root, there is an edge between 1 and u. Let me denote the b value of this edge as b_{1u}. The root's equation is sum of all its adjacent edges' b_e equals 1 mod 2. So for the root, sum_{children u} b_{1u} = 1 mod 2.\n\nBut how to determine the values of these b's? Well, for each subtree, perhaps we can set the values recursively. Let me think of the following approach: for each node, the sum of the b_e's of its edges must be 1 mod 2. However, the edge to the parent is already determined, so the sum of the edges to children can be determined accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the tree as a graph. The system of equations is that for each node v, the sum of the b_e's of edges adjacent to v is 1 mod 2. Let me imagine that we choose the values of the edges in such a way that this holds.\n\nLet me consider that the system can be solved by choosing arbitrary values for all edges except those in a spanning tree, but since the tree is already a spanning tree, perhaps there's another way. Wait, no. The system is for the edges of the tree. The tree is connected, and the equations are for each node.\n\nBut perhaps we can choose a root, and for each node, assign the b value of the edge from the node to its parent. Let me think recursively. Let's assume that for a node u, the edge from u to its parent p has a value b_{pu}. Then, for node u, the sum of all edges adjacent to u (including the edge to p) must be 1 mod 2. Let me denote that the sum of the b values for edges adjacent to u is 1 mod 2. So, for node u, the sum of the b values of all edges adjacent to u (including the edge to its parent) is 1. But the edge to the parent is already part of this sum. So, for the children of u, their edges to u will contribute to their own equations.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For the root node (say, node 1), there is no parent. So for the root, the sum of all its adjacent edges (each of which is an edge to a child) must be 1 mod 2. Let me assign values to the edges in such a way that for each node, after setting the edges to its children, the equation holds.\n\nBut how? For example, let's take the root. Suppose the root has k children. For each child, there's an edge. Let me assign the values of these edges as follows: for each child, the edge to the root can be set arbitrarily, except for the last one, which is chosen to satisfy the root's equation.\n\nWait, but for the root, the sum of all edges adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. So if there are k edges, then the sum of their b values is 1 mod 2. So if we assign values to k-1 of them arbitrarily, then the last one is determined. For example, suppose the root has two children. Assign the first edge's b value to 0, then the second must be 1 mod 2. So the sum is 0+1=1 mod 2.\n\nThen, for each child u of the root, we can proceed similarly. For node u, the sum of the edges adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. The edges adjacent to u are the edge to its parent (which is already set) and the edges to its children. So for node u, the sum of the b values of the edges to its children plus the b value of the edge to the parent must be 1 mod 2. Therefore, the sum of the edges to its children must be (1 - b_parent) mod 2. So, if we have m children of u, we can assign the first m-1 edges arbitrarily, and the last one is determined based on this equation.\n\nThis suggests that for any tree structure, there is exactly one way to assign the b values (which determine the edge weights) that satisfies the constraints. Therefore, the assignment is uniquely determined once we choose arbitrary values for all edges except for those determined by the equations. But since the system has exactly one solution, this process will result in a unique assignment.\n\nBut how does this help us compute the sum of d(1, n) over all trees?\n\nThe key observation is that for each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined, and d(1, n) is the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to n. Let me denote that for each tree, the path from 1 to n has a certain sum. The question is to compute the sum of these sums over all possible trees.\n\nBut how can we compute this sum?\n\nLet me think about the contribution of each edge to the total sum. For each edge e, how many trees have e on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by the weight of e in those trees. Then, the total sum is the sum over all edges of (number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n) × (weight of e in those trees).\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nBut the weight of e in a tree depends on the tree structure. Because for each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined by the constraints. Therefore, for each edge e, its weight is determined by the tree structure and the constraints. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find the expected value of d(1, n) multiplied by the number of trees. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that for each tree, the value of d(1, n) is equal to the number of edges on the path from 1 to n with weight -1 minus the number of edges with weight +1. Which is equivalent to the sum of the weights of the edges on the path.\n\nBut how can we find this sum for all trees?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each tree, the value of d(1, n) is determined by the edge weights, which are determined by the constraints. So, for each tree, we can think of the path from 1 to n as a sequence of edges, and the sum of their weights is determined by the constraints.\n\nBut perhaps there's a clever way to find the sum over all trees of this value.\n\nLet me think of the following idea: for each tree, the value of d(1, n) is equal to the number of edges on the path from 1 to n with weight -1 minus the number with weight +1. Which is equal to the sum of the weights. Let me denote this sum as S.\n\nBut since each edge's weight is ±1, and the sum is S.\n\nBut how to find the sum of S over all trees?\n\nLet me think about the following: for each tree, the value of S is determined by the constraints. Perhaps there's a relation between S and the structure of the tree.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each tree, the value of S is equal to the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to n. Let me think about the constraints again. For the root (node 1), the sum of the edges adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. For node n, the sum of the edges adjacent to it is 1 mod 2. But how does this relate to the path?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express the sum S as the difference between the number of -1 edges and +1 edges along the path. Let me denote that for the path from 1 to n, there are k edges. Then, the sum S is (number of -1 edges) - (number of +1 edges) = (k - 2 * (number of +1 edges)) ), since number of -1 edges = k - number of +1 edges. So S = (k - 2 * c), where c is the count of +1 edges on the path.\n\nBut I don't know if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the value of S for a tree. Let me think of the tree as rooted at 1. The path from 1 to n is unique. Let me denote that the path has length L (number of edges). The sum S is the sum of the weights of these edges.\n\nBut how to relate this to the constraints?\n\nLet me think of the tree and the system of equations. For each node v, the sum of the b_e's (where x_e = (-1)^{b_e}) for edges adjacent to v is 1 mod 2. Let me consider the root node 1. Its sum is 1 mod 2. For node n, the sum of its adjacent edges is 1 mod 2. The path from 1 to n includes one edge from node n to its parent. Let me think about the sum of the b_e's along the path.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a direct connection yet.\n\nLet me think of the following. For the root node, the sum of its adjacent edges is 1 mod 2. Let me denote that the path from 1 to n is a sequence of edges e_1, e_2, ..., e_k, where e_1 is the edge from 1 to its child, and e_k is the edge from n's parent to n.\n\nFor each edge e_i on this path, let me think about the contribution to the sum of the b_e's for the nodes along the path.\n\nFor example, for node 1, the sum of its adjacent edges is 1 mod 2. This includes e_1. For the next node on the path (say, node v_1), the sum of its adjacent edges is 1 mod 2. This includes e_1 (from node 1 to v_1) and the edges to its children (e_2, and possibly others). But since the tree is arbitrary, it's hard to find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find that the sum S is always equal to -1. Or some other constant. But in the example for n=4, the sum was -10 over 16 trees. So average per tree is -10/16 = -5/8. Which is not a constant. So that idea is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: think about the contribution of each edge to the sum S. For each edge e, determine in how many trees it lies on the path from 1 to n, multiplied by its weight in those trees.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nLet me think about the following: For each edge e, what is the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n? And what is the expected value of the weight of e in those trees?\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nFirst, for the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n: this is equal to the number of trees that contain e and where e is on the path from 1 to n. But since the tree is arbitrary, the number of trees that include e and have it on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of ways to choose the rest of the tree such that e is on the path.\n\nBut how to calculate this?\n\nIn general, the number of trees that include edge e and have e on the path between 1 and n is equal to the number of trees where e is part of the unique path between 1 and n. To count this, we can think of splitting the tree into two parts by removing e. Let me say that removing e splits the tree into two components: one containing node 1 and the other containing node n. Let me denote the sizes of these components as a and b, where a + b = n. Then, the number of trees that include edge e and have e on the path between 1 and n is equal to a^{a-2} * b^{b-2} * ...? Wait, Cayley's formula says that the number of trees on a labeled graph with k nodes is k^{k-2}. So if we have two components, one with a nodes (including 1) and the other with b nodes (including n), then the number of trees that have edge e and have the path between 1 and n passing through e is equal to the number of ways to connect the two components with edge e. So, the total number of such trees is a^{a-2} * b^{b-2} * 1 (for the edge e). But how to compute this for all possible edges e?\n\nBut for this problem, we are considering all possible trees, and for each edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of trees that have e in the tree and e is on the path between 1 and n. This can be calculated as follows: for each edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path between 1 and n is equal to (number of trees where e is present) multiplied by the probability that e is on the path between 1 and n. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of trees that include edge e and have e on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of ways to form a tree that includes e and connects the two subtrees formed by removing e. But when e is on the path between 1 and n, removing e would split the tree into two components, one containing 1 and the other containing n. So, the number of such trees is equal to the number of ways to form a tree on the component containing 1 (with size a) and a tree on the component containing n (with size b), and then connect them via edge e. But since the original tree is connected, the number of trees that include e and have e on the path between 1 and n is equal to the number of ways to choose the trees on the two components, multiplied by 1 (for the edge e). The number of such trees is a^{a-2} * b^{b-2}.\n\nBut for each edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is a^{a-2} * b^{b-2}, where a and b are the sizes of the two components formed when e is removed. However, this depends on the position of e in the tree. But since we are considering all possible trees, we need to find, for all possible edges e, the sum over all possible a and b of the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n.\n\nBut this seems difficult to compute directly. However, there's a known formula for the number of trees where a particular edge is present and lies on the path between two nodes. For example, the total number of trees that contain a particular edge e is (n-2) * n^{n-4} }, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, there's a well-known result that for any two distinct nodes u and v, the number of trees where the path between u and v contains a specific edge e is equal to (number of trees where e is present) multiplied by the probability that e is on the path between u and v. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of trees where e is on the path between 1 and n is equal to the number of trees that contain e multiplied by the probability that e is on the path between 1 and n. \n\nThe total number of trees that contain edge e is (n-2) * n^{n-4} }, but I need to verify this. \n\nCayley's formula says that the total number of trees is n^{n-2}. The number of trees that contain a particular edge e can be computed as follows: when you contract the edge e, you get a tree with n-1 nodes. The number of such trees is (n-1)^{n-3} }, and each corresponds to a tree on the original n nodes with the edge e present. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the number of trees containing a specific edge e is n^{n-4} * 2. Or perhaps another approach.\n\nLet me think: the number of trees containing edge e is equal to the number of ways to build a tree on n nodes that includes e. Let me fix the edge between nodes u and v. To count the number of trees containing this edge, we can consider that the tree is formed by connecting the two subtrees rooted at u and v. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the number of trees that include edge e is equal to the number of ways to choose a tree on the n nodes with that edge. This is equal to (n-2) * n^{n-4} }, but I'm not sure.\n\nActually, there's a formula for the number of trees containing a particular edge. For any edge e between u and v, the number of trees on n labeled nodes that contain e is 2 * n^{n-4} }. Wait, but I need to think carefully.\n\nWhen you have a tree, the number of trees that contain a particular edge e can be found by considering that the edge e is part of the tree. If we contract the edge e, we get a tree on n-1 nodes. The number of such trees is (n-1)^{n-3} }, and each corresponds to a tree on n nodes with e included. However, when we contract e, the number of trees on n-1 nodes is (n-1)^{n",
