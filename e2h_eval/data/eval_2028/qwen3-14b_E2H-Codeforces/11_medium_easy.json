A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, each toast requires nl ml of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and np grams of salt per friend.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs these things. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl ml. Because each friend has one toast. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (since each friend uses one slice per toast). And the salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the total resources available:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nSalt: p grams.\n\nThen, for each toast, the total required is:\n\ndrink: n * nl ml per toast.\n\nlime slices: n per toast.\n\nsalt: n * np grams per toast.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute. For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made with that resource, then take the minimum of those numbers.\n\nSo for drink: total_drink = k*l. Each toast takes n * nl. So possible toasts from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, if it's not divisible, we take the floor.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: total_slices = c*d. Each toast requires n slices. So possible toasts is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np grams. So possible toasts is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, nl is 3 here. Oh yes. So per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total is n * nl. So for the first sample:\n\ndrink: 20 / (3 * 3) = 20 /9 = 2.222... so floor is 2.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8. Total slices 80. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80 /3 is 26.666, floor 26. But wait, the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, no. Wait in the note they say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nWait the note says that the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Oh, but according to the calculation, each toast requires n slices. So for 3 friends, each toast requires 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80 / 3 = 26.666, which is 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that contradicts. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices are needed. So for the first example, 3 friends per toast, so 3 slices per toast. So total slices available is 10 * 8 = 80. So 80 / 3 is 26.666, so 26 toasts. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps I have made a mistake here.\n\nWait looking at the note:\n\nIn the first sample, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. Wait, where do these numbers come from?\n\nOriginal note says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 ml of drink. It is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, but why is that? Because each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml? Or per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. So for the first sample, n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, 3*3=9 ml. 20 /9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Wait, this is conflicting. So clearly, I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 = 6 toasts. So why is that? Because maybe per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total is nl * n? Or per toast, each friend uses nl ml, so for one toast, total is n * nl. But in the note, 20 /3 is 6. Which implies that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be if per toast, each friend uses 1 ml. But in the first sample, nl is 3. So perhaps the note is wrong? Or maybe I have misread the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh! So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, the total drink required is n * nl. But in the note, the sample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So n is 3, nl is 3. So per toast, total drink is 3 *3 =9. The total drink is 4*5=20. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But according to the note, the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. That suggests that the per toast total drink is nl, not n * nl. Which would be possible if per toast, each friend needs nl ml, but the total is nl. But that's impossible.\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". So 20 is total drink, divided by 3 (which is nl?), giving 6. So that suggests that per toast, the total drink is nl. But that would mean that per toast, each friend gets nl /n ml. Which doesn't make sense. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait perhaps the problem is that the note is considering per toast per friend. Let me think again.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem:\n\nEach friend makes t toasts. For each toast, they need nl ml of drink. So for each friend, total drink is t * nl. For all friends, total drink is n * t * nl.\n\nSimilarly, for lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. For t toasts, n * t slices.\n\nSalt: per toast, per friend, np grams. So total for t toasts is n * t * np grams.\n\nSo the total required resources are:\n\nDrink: n * t * nl <= k * l\n\nLime slices: n * t <= c * d\n\nSalt: n * t * np <= p\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of ( (k*l) // (n * nl), (c*d) // (n), p // (n * np) )\n\nBut in the first sample, let's compute that.\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo:\n\nk*l = 4 *5=20.\n\nn * nl = 3 *3=9. So 20//9 is 2.\n\nc*d is 10*8=80. n is 3. 80//3 is 26.\n\np is 100. n * np is 3*1=3. 100//3 is 33.\n\nSo the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the sample output. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which suggests that the calculation is different. So why is the note saying that?\n\nAh, the note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, this seems to indicate that the drink can make 6 toasts, but then divided by 3 friends. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-examine the note's explanation.\n\nThe note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. But according to the earlier reasoning, the drink is 20 ml. Each toast requires per friend 3 ml. For 3 friends, that's 3 *3 =9 ml per toast. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which is 2 toasts. But the note says 20 /3 is 6. So why is that?\n\nAh! Maybe the note is considering that each toast requires nl ml per friend, but the total per toast is nl ml. Which would be wrong. But according to the note, the drink is 20ml, and each toast requires 3 ml. So 20/3=6. But that would be possible only if each toast requires 3 ml in total, not per friend. Which would imply that the problem statement is different than what I thought.\n\nThis is a critical point. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\n\nSo, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl ml. So for the first sample, n=3, nl=3. Per toast, 3*3=9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so 2 toasts.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. So according to the note, the drink is being divided by nl, not by n * nl. Which suggests that the problem is that the note is considering that per toast, each friend needs nl ml, but the total per toast is nl ml. Which would be impossible unless n=1.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. How to resolve this?\n\nLet me check the sample input and output again.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nInput: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nOutput: 2.\n\nAccording to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but then divides by 3 friends. Which would imply that the 6 is the total number of toasts across all friends. But that would mean that each friend can make 6/3=2 toasts. Which would be the case if the total number of toasts is 6, and each friend makes the same number.\n\nBut how is the 6 calculated? According to the note, it's 20 /3 =6. Which would be total drink divided by nl. So 20 is total drink, divided by nl (3) gives 6. Which would be the total number of toasts across all friends. Because for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl ml. For all friends, total drink is n * t * nl. Which equals 3 * t *3 = 9t. Which must be <= 20. So 9t <=20 → t ≤2.222, so t=2. Which gives 9*2=18 ≤20.\n\nBut according to the note's calculation, 20 /3 =6. Which is the total toasts across all friends? That would be t *n =6. So t=2. Which would be the same as the correct answer. So the note is saying that the drink allows for 6 total toasts across all friends, which is t*n=6. So t=2.\n\nSo the note is considering that the total number of toasts across all friends is (total drink) / nl. But that would be:\n\ntotal_drink / nl = (k*l) / nl = total toasts across all friends. Then, since each friend makes t toasts, total toasts across all friends is n * t. So:\n\nn * t = (k*l) / nl → t = (k*l) / (nl *n) → which is the same as before.\n\nBut the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which is the total number of toasts across all friends. Then, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by n (3) to get t=2.\n\nAh! So the note is calculating the maximum number of total toasts (across all friends) that can be made with each resource. Then, since each friend must make the same number of toasts, the total toasts is t *n. So the maximum t is the minimum of (total toasts possible for each resource) divided by n.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each resource, calculate how many total toasts can be made (across all friends), then divide by n to get the per-friend number of toasts.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think again:\n\nFor the drink:\n\nTotal drink is k*l. Each toast (per friend) requires nl ml. So for one toast per friend, total drink is n * nl. So for t toasts per friend, total drink is n * t * nl. So:\n\nn * t * nl ≤ k*l → t ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nSimilarly for the limes: total slices is c*d. Each toast requires n slices (one per friend). So for t toasts per friend, total slices is n * t. So:\n\nn * t ≤ c*d → t ≤ (c*d)/n.\n\nFor salt: n * t * np ≤ p → t ≤ p/(n * np).\n\nThus, the maximum t is the minimum of the three values (k*l)//(n * nl), (c*d)//n, p//(n * np).\n\nBut according to the note, the drink is allowing 20 /3 =6 total toasts. Which is (k*l)/nl = 20/3 =6.666, floor to 6. Then, divided by n (3) gives 2. Which is the same as (k*l)/(n * nl) = 20/(3*3) = 2.222 → floor 2. So both approaches give the same result.\n\nSo the note is calculating the total toasts possible for each resource as (total_resource) / (per_toast_per_friend_resource), and then dividing by n to get the per-friend toasts. But that's equivalent to the approach I had earlier.\n\nSo for drink, the total toasts possible (across all friends) is (k*l) // nl. Then, per friend toasts is (total_toasts) // n. But that's not exactly the same as (k*l) // (n * nl). Because (k*l) // nl divided by n may not be the same as (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nWait let's take the first sample:\n\nk*l = 20, nl=3. So (k*l) // nl is 6. Then 6 // n (3) is 2. Which is the same as (20) // (3*3) = 20//9=2.\n\nSo in this case, both methods give the same result.\n\nAnother example: suppose k*l = 10, nl=3, n=2. Then:\n\nMethod 1: (10//3) =3 → 3//2=1.5 → floor 1.\n\nMethod 2: (10) // (2*3) = 10//6=1. Same result.\n\nAnother example: k*l= 7, nl=3, n=2. Method 1: 7//3=2, 2//2=1. Method 2: 7//6=1. Same.\n\nSo in general, (a // b) // c = a // (b*c) ?\n\nNot sure. Let's see:\n\nSuppose a= 10, b=3, c=2. Then (10//3)=3, 3//2=1. 10//(3*2)=10//6=1. Same.\n\nAnother example: a= 11, b=3, c=2. 11//3=3, 3//2=1. 11//6=1. Same.\n\nAnother example: a= 5, b=2, c=2. 5//2=2, 2//2=1. 5//4=1. Same.\n\nSo seems like (a//b) //c = a// (b*c) ?\n\nIf that holds, then the two approaches are equivalent. Which would mean that the note's approach is equivalent to the original approach.\n\nSo in this case, the code can be written by calculating for each resource the maximum possible total toasts (across all friends) and then divide by n, taking the floor. But since the two approaches are equivalent, the code can proceed either way.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nCompute for each resource:\n\ndrink_total = k * l\n\nmax_drink_toasts = drink_total // nl\n\nlime_total = c * d\n\nmax_lime_toasts = lime_total // n\n\nsalt_total = p\n\nmax_salt_toasts = salt_total // np\n\nthen, the total toasts across all friends is the minimum of these three values. Then, the per-friend toasts is (min_total) // n.\n\nWait no, wait. Let me re-express:\n\nThe max_drink_toasts is the maximum total number of toasts across all friends. Because each toast per friend requires nl ml. So for each toast (per friend), it's nl ml. So total toasts across all friends is t_total = (k*l) // nl. But since each friend must make the same number of toasts, t_total must be divisible by n? Or not. Because if t_total is 6, and n is 3, then each friend can make 2 toasts. If t_total is 7, and n is 3, then each friend can make 2 toasts (total 6). So the per-friend toasts is t_total // n.\n\nBut then, for the drink, the maximum possible t_total is (k*l) // nl. Then, the per-friend toasts is t_total //n.\n\nBut for the other resources, like limes:\n\nmax_lime_toasts is (c*d) // n. Because each toast (per friend) requires 1 slice, so per toast across all friends, n slices are needed. So the total number of toasts across all friends is (c*d) // n. Similarly for salt: max_salt_toasts = p // (np) → because per toast across all friends, n * np grams are needed. So for total toasts across all friends, it's p // (np) ?\n\nWait no. Let me re-express:\n\nFor the salt:\n\nEach toast per friend requires np grams. So for t toasts per friend, total salt needed is n * t * np. So the maximum t is p // (n * np). Which is the same as (p // np) // n ?\n\nLet me see:\n\np // (n * np) vs (p // np) // n.\n\nTake p=100, n=3, np=1. Then p//(n*np) is 100//3 = 33. (p//np) is 100//1=100, divided by 3 → 33. So same.\n\nAnother example: p= 10, n=3, np=3. Then p//(n*np) is 10//9=1. (p//np) is 10//3=3, divided by 3 is 1. Same.\n\nAnother example: p= 10, n=3, np=2. Then p//(n*np) is 10//6=1. (p//np) is 5, divided by 3 is 1. Same.\n\nSo again, same result. So for each resource, the maximum total toasts across all friends is:\n\ndrink: (k*l) // nl\n\nlimes: (c*d) // n\n\nsalt: p // np \n\nThen, the total toasts across all friends is the minimum of these three values. Then, the per-friend toasts is (min_total) // n.\n\nWait no. Because for the limes, the maximum total toasts across all friends is (c*d) // n. Because each toast requires n slices. For example, if you have 80 slices, and n=3, then you can have 80//3=26 toasts. Which is 26 *3 =78 slices used. So the total toasts across all friends is 26. So per friend toasts is 26//3= 8.666 → 8. But according to the previous approach, the maximum per friend toasts is (c*d) //n //n ?\n\nNo. Wait, no. Because the total toasts across all friends is t_total. Each friend makes t toasts. So t_total = t * n. So t = t_total //n. Because t_total can be anything, but t must be integer. So the maximum t is floor(t_total /n).\n\nBut t_total is the minimum of the three values: drink_total_toasts, lime_total_toasts, salt_total_toasts.\n\nSo the steps for the code would be:\n\nCalculate:\n\ndrink_total = (k * l) // nl\n\nlime_total = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt_total = p // np\n\nt_total = min(drink_total, lime_total, salt_total)\n\nresult = t_total // n\n\nBut wait in the first sample:\n\ndrink_total = 20//3 =6\n\nlime_total = 10*8//3 = 80//3=26\n\nsalt_total = 100//1=100.\n\nt_total = 6.\n\nresult =6//3=2 → correct.\n\nWhich matches the sample. So this approach works.\n\nAnother example: let's take the second sample input.\n\nSample input 2 is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nSo n=5, k=100, l=10 → drink_total = 100*10=1000. nl=4 → drink_total = 1000//4 = 250.\n\nc=1, d=19 → lime_total = 1*19//5 = 19//5=3.\n\nsalt_total: p=90, np=3 → 90//3=30.\n\nt_total is min(250,3,30) → 3. result is 3//5=0.6 → 0. Which is the sample output of 3? Wait no, the sample output is '3' for the second input. Wait what's the sample input and output again?\n\nThe sample input includes:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nSample output is ['2', '3', '0'].\n\nSo for the second input, the output is 3.\n\nWait according to the calculation above, the code would compute:\n\ndrink_total = (k*l) // nl → 100 *10 = 1000, divided by nl=4 → 250.\n\nlime_total: (c*d) //n → 1*19//5=3.8 → 3.\n\nsalt_total: p//np → 90//3=30.\n\nt_total is min(250,3,30) → 3. Then result is 3//5=0. But the sample output is 3. So this approach is wrong.\n\nWait this is a problem. So according to this approach, the second sample input would return 0, but the sample output is 3. So clearly, my approach is incorrect.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nLet me re-examine the sample input 2:\n\nInput line is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'.\n\nBreaking down the parameters:\n\nn=5 (friends)\n\nk=100 (bottles)\n\nl=10 (ml per bottle)\n\nc=1 (limes)\n\nd=19 (slices per lime)\n\np=90 (grams of salt)\n\nnl=4 (ml per toast per friend)\n\nnp=3 (grams per toast per friend)\n\nSo the total drink is 100 *10 =1000 ml.\n\nEach toast requires per friend 4 ml. So per toast, total for all friends is 5 *4 =20 ml. So maximum number of toasts is 1000//20 =50.\n\nLimes: 1 *19 =19 slices. Each toast requires 5 slices. So maximum toasts is 19//5 =3.\n\nSalt: 90 grams. Each toast requires 5 *3 =15 grams. So maximum toasts is 90//15=6.\n\nSo the minimum is 3. So the answer is 3. Which matches the sample output. But according to the previous approach, the code would compute:\n\ndrink_total = (k*l) // nl → 1000//4=250. lime_total = (c*d) //n →19//5=3. salt_total =90//3=30. t_total is 3. Then result is 3//5=0. Which is wrong.\n\nSo the previous approach is wrong. So what's the mistake here?\n\nAh! Oh right! The previous approach was wrong. Because the drink_total is calculated as (k*l) // nl. But that's not correct. Because for the drink, the per toast across all friends is n * nl. So the maximum number of toasts across all friends is (k*l) // (n * nl). Which for sample 2 is 1000/(5*4)= 50. Which is correct. But in the previous approach, I was using (k*l) // nl, which is 1000//4=250. Which is wrong.\n\nSo the mistake was in the way I calculated the drink_total. The previous approach was wrong. So the correct approach is to calculate for each resource the maximum number of toasts across all friends, which is:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = (c*d) // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nthen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nAh! So the mistake was in the way I computed the drink_total and salt_total. Earlier, I thought that the drink_total was (k*l) // nl, but it's actually (k*l) // (n * nl). Because each toast across all friends requires n * nl ml of drink.\n\nSo the correct approach is to compute for each resource the maximum number of toasts that can be made across all friends, which is:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = (c*d) // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nthen the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nLet me recheck the first sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\ndrink_toasts = (4*5) // (3 *3) = 20//9=2\n\nlime_toasts = (10*8)//3 =80//3=26\n\nsalt_toasts = 100// (3 *1) = 33.333 → 33.\n\nminimum is 2 → answer is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\ndrink_toasts = (100*10) // (5 *4) → 1000//20=50.\n\nlime_toasts = 1*19 //5 = 3.\n\nsalt_toasts=90 // (5*3) =90//15=6.\n\nminimum is 3 → answer is 3. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → drink is 1000*1000=1,000,000.\n\nnl=50. So drink_toasts = 1e6 / (10 *50) = 1e6 / 500 = 2000.\n\nlime_toasts: c=25, d=23 → 25*23=575. divided by n=10 →575//10=57.\n\nsalt_toasts: p=1, divided by (10 *1) =10 → 1//10=0. So minimum is 0 → answer is 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo now the approach is correct. Therefore, the code should calculate these three values and take the minimum.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead the input numbers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\nlime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\nsalt_toasts = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes. So this will work.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nThe input is a single line with 8 integers. Wait, the input is given as a list of lines, but the problem says that the first and only line contains the numbers. So in the sample input, the first example is given as a list of three inputs, but the actual input is one line per test case. But the user's code is supposed to read from stdin.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line with the numbers. So the code should read a line, split into the eight integers.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input, the input line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute the variables.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink = k * l\n\ndrink_toasts = drink // (n * nl)\n\nlime_slices = c * d\n\nlime_toasts = lime_slices // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input 2:\n\ninput line is '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\ndrink_toasts = 100*10 = 1000, divided by 5*4=20 → 50.\n\nlime_toasts: 1*19=19 //5 →3.\n\nsalt_toasts: 90 // (5*3) →90//15=6. min(50,3,6) →3. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\ndrink_toasts: 1000*1000 = 1,000,000 divided by 10*50=500 → 2000.\n\nlime_toasts: 25*23=575 divided by 10 →57.5 →57.\n\nsalt_toasts: 1 divided by 10*1=10 →0. min is 0. Correct.\n\nSo this code works.\n\nNow, edge cases: for example, when any of the denominators is zero? No, since the problem says that all input numbers are positive integers. So no division by zero.\n\nAnother edge case: when the division results in zero. Like if the salt is not enough for even one toast.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nThus, the Python code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The goal is to ensure all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Requirements**: Each toast requires `nl` milliliters of drink, one slice of lime, and `np` grams of salt per friend. For `n` friends, each toast will require `n * nl` milliliters of drink, `n` slices of lime, and `n * np` grams of salt.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total available drink, lime slices, and salt.\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with each resource based on their respective requirements.\n4. **Find Minimum Constraint**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. Therefore, take the minimum value from the calculated possible toasts for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\ndrink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\nlime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into individual variables representing the number of friends, bottles of drink, milliliters per bottle, number of limes, slices per lime, grams of salt, milliliters needed per toast per friend, and grams of salt needed per toast per friend.\n2. **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle. The maximum number of toasts possible with the drink is determined by dividing this total by the drink required per toast for all friends.\n3. **Total Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is calculated by multiplying the number of limes by the slices per lime. The maximum number of toasts possible with the lime slices is determined by dividing this total by the number of friends.\n4. **Salt Calculation**: The maximum number of toasts possible with the salt is determined by dividing the total grams of salt by the salt required per toast for all friends.\n5. **Determine Result**: The result is the minimum of the three calculated values, ensuring that all resources are considered and the limiting factor is respected.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by focusing on the constraints of each resource and determining the limiting factor, ensuring an optimal and correct result.",
