Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum radius d for the lanterns so that the entire street is covered. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The street is from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up a segment from (ai - d) to (ai + d). We need to find the minimal d such that all points from 0 to l are covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nSo the key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. But how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the lanterns are sorted in order. Then, between two consecutive lanterns, there's a certain distance. The worst case for coverage would be in the middle of that gap. For example, if two lanterns are at positions a and b (a < b), then the maximum distance from any point in between to the nearest lantern would be (b - a)/2. But wait, that's only if the lanterns are equally spaced. However, we also have to consider the ends. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position minus d must be covered. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from the start (0) to the first lantern. The required d here would be (first_lantern_pos - 0), but since the lantern's coverage extends to ai - d, so the first lantern's leftmost coverage is ai - d. To cover 0, we need ai - d <= 0. So d needs to be at least ai. But wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the first lantern is at position a. The leftmost point it can cover is a - d. To cover 0, a - d must be <= 0. So d >= a. Because if d is a, then a -d = 0. So the left end is covered. Similarly for the right end: the last lantern is at position b. The rightmost coverage is b + d. This must be >= l. So d must be >= l - b.\n\nThen, between two consecutive lanterns, say at positions a and b (a < b), the maximum distance between them is (b - a). The worst case is the midpoint between them. The distance from the midpoint to either lantern is (b -a)/2. So the required d must be at least (b -a)/2. Because if d is that value, then the two lanterns' coverage areas will just touch each other. If there's a gap, then that midpoint would not be covered.\n\nSo the minimal d is the maximum among:\n\n- the first lantern's position (since 0 needs to be covered)\n- (l - last lantern's position)\n- the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nWait, but what if the first lantern is at 0? Then the first part is 0, so no problem. Similarly for the last lantern being at l.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial maximum d as the maximum between the first lantern's position and (l - last lantern's position).\n- Then, iterate through consecutive pairs and compute the gaps. For each gap, compute (gap)/2. Take the maximum of these values and compare with the initial maximum. The overall maximum is the required d.\n\nBut wait, let me test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter sorting, the positions are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nFirst lantern is at 0. So the first part is 0. The last lantern is at 15, so l - last is 15 -15=0. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 3/2 = 1.5\n5-3 = 2 → 1.0\n7-5=2 → 1.0\n9-7=2 → 1.0\n14-9=5 → 2.5\n15-14=1 → 0.5\n\nThe maximum of these is 2.5. So the overall maximum is max(0, 0, 2.5) → 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample Input 2:\n2 5\n2 5\n\nAfter sorting, [2,5]. \n\nFirst lantern is at 2. So the first part is 2. The last lantern is at 5. l - last is",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length $ l $. The lanterns are positioned at various points along the street, and each lantern can illuminate a segment of the street within a distance $ d $ from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the process of checking gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are critical because they determine the minimum radius needed to cover the ends of the street.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Lanterns**: Iterate through the sorted positions of the lanterns to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. The minimum radius required to cover this gap is half of the gap's length since the worst-case scenario is the midpoint of the gap.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        l = int(input[idx + 1])\n        idx += 2\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n        idx += n\n        \n        a.sort()\n        \n        max_d = 0.0\n        \n        # Check the first lantern\n        if a[0] > 0:\n            max_d = a[0]\n        # Check the last lantern\n        if l - a[-1] > max_d:\n            max_d = l - a[-1]\n        \n        # Check gaps between consecutive lanterns\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            current = gap / 2.0\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        \n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go and split into a list of strings for easier processing.\n2. **Sorting Lanterns**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate checking gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial Checks**: The initial checks for the start and end of the street ensure that the edges of the street are covered by the lanterns' illumination radius.\n4. **Gap Calculation**: By iterating through the sorted lantern positions, we determine the largest gap between consecutive lanterns. The required radius to cover this gap is half the gap's length, as the midpoint of the gap would be the farthest point from either lantern.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum radius required by considering both the edges of the street and the gaps between lanterns, leading to an optimal solution with a time complexity of $ O(n \\log n) $ due to sorting.",
