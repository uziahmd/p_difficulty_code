При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an error. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, and the overlapping part has at least one character but less than the length of s. Also, the full overlap (where the entire message is overlapped) is not considered an error. Similarly, if there's no overlap (just concatenation), it's not considered an error either.\n\nSo, the task is: given t, check if there exists some string s such that t can be formed by merging two s's with an overlap as described. If yes, output YES and any possible s, else NO.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key idea is that the merged string t must be equal to s + s[overlap:], where overlap is some positive integer less than len(s). Because when two s's are merged with an overlap of k characters, the resulting string would be s concatenated with s[k:]. So the total length of t would be len(s) + (len(s) - k) = 2*len(s) -k. But since k is between 1 and len(s)-1, the total length of t would be between len(s) + 1 (when k is len(s)-1) and 2*len(s) -1 (when k is 1).\n\nBut how do we find s?\n\nLet me think about the possible lengths of s. Let's denote len(t) as n. Then, for the merged string t, the length n must be equal to 2 * len(s) - k, where 1 <= k < len(s). Let's rearrange this equation. Let m be len(s). Then:\n\nn = 2m -k → k = 2m -n.\n\nBut since k must be between 1 and m-1 (inclusive), substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2m -n ≤ m-1.\n\nLet me solve these inequalities for m.\n\nFirst inequality: 2m -n ≥ 1 → 2m ≥ n+1 → m ≥ (n+1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2m -n ≤ m-1 → 2m -n ≤ m-1 → m ≤ n-1.\n\nSo combining these two, m must satisfy:\n\n(n+1)/2 ≤ m ≤ n-1.\n\nBut m is the length of s. Also, since the original two s's are merged with an overlap, the total length of t must be 2m -k, which is also equal to n. So for each possible m in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1], we can check if there exists a k (which is 2m -n) that satisfies 1 ≤ k ≤ m-1. Let's see:\n\nFor example, for a given m, k = 2m -n. Since m ranges from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1, let's check for possible values.\n\nWait, for example, let's take m = (n+1)/2. Then k = 2*(n+1)/2 -n = n+1 -n = 1. Which is valid (since m must be at least (n+1)/2, which for even and odd n would be okay). For m = n-1, k = 2(n-1) -n = 2n-2 -n = n-2. Since m is n-1, then m-1 is n-2. So k = n-2, which is exactly m-1. So that's valid.\n\nSo for each possible m in the range from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1, inclusive, we can compute k = 2m -n. Then, check if this k is between 1 and m-1. Which it will be, because of the way we selected m.\n\nSo for each m in that range, we can check whether the first m -k characters of t (the first part) plus the last k characters of t (the overlapping part) equals s. Wait, no. Wait, the merged string is s concatenated with s[k:]. So the total length is m + (m -k) = 2m -k = n. So the entire t must be equal to s + s[k:]. Therefore, the first m characters of t must be s, and the next (m -k) characters must be s[k:].\n\nBut how can we check that? Let's think. For a candidate m, the s would be the first m characters of t. Then, we need to check if the rest of the string (from position m onwards) is equal to s[k:]. But k is 2m -n. Let's compute k for that m.\n\nAlternatively, since the entire t must be equal to s + s[k:], then the entire t must be equal to s concatenated with s[k:]. So, the first m characters of t is s, and the next (m -k) characters must be s[k:]. Also, since the total length of t is n = 2m -k, then m -k = n -m. So the length of the suffix is n -m.\n\nSo for each possible m in the allowed range, we can check if the first m characters (s_candidate) and the last (n -m) characters of t match s_candidate[k:] where k is 2m -n.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nFor each m in [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1], compute k = 2m -n.\n\nCheck if k is between 1 and m-1. Well, since m is chosen such that (n+1)/2 ≤ m ≤ n-1, then k is between 1 and m-1. So for example, when m is (n+1)/2, k is 1. When m is n-1, k is n-2, which is m-1 (since m is n-1, m-1 is n-2). So yes.\n\nOnce we have k, then check if the first m characters (s_candidate) and the rest of the string (from index m onwards) equals s_candidate[k:].\n\nIf this is true for any m, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute n = len(t)\n\n2. Iterate m from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1, inclusive.\n\n   For each m:\n\n   a. Compute k = 2m -n.\n\n   b. Check that k is between 1 and m-1. (Which it should be, given the m range.)\n\n   c. Check if the first m characters (s_candidate) has a suffix of length k (i.e., s_candidate[k:]) that matches the remaining part of t (t[m:]).\n\n   d. If yes, return YES and s_candidate.\n\n3. If none of the m's work, return NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the entire string is formed by overlapping two s's with some k. For example, if the original two s's are merged with k=1, then the merged string is s + s[1:]. So the entire t is s + s[1:]. So the length of t is m + (m-1) = 2m -1. Which for n = 2m -1, so m = (n+1)/2. So for that m, k is 2m -n = 2*( (n+1)/2 ) -n = n+1 -n = 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the examples.\n\nTake the first example input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (the first sample input). Its length is 19. Let's compute n=19.\n\nPossible m ranges from (19+1)/2 = 10 to 18.\n\nSo m ranges from 10 to 18. For each m, compute k = 2m -19.\n\nFor example, when m=11, k=22-19=3. So check if the first 11 characters (abrakadabra) and the rest of the string (from index 11) is equal to s_candidate[3:].\n\nThe original string is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (length 19). Let's see, when m=11, the first 11 characters are 'abrakadabra' (s_candidate). Then, the rest is 'brakadabra' (length 19-11=8). s_candidate[3:] is 'akadabra' (length 11-3=8). So compare 'brakadabra' vs 'akadabra'? No. So that's not a match. But in the sample, the correct answer is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). Let's see when m=11, what k is. For m=11, k=2*11 -19=22-19=3. So the rest of the string is t[m:] which is t[11:] which is 'brakadabra' (assuming the original string is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — wait, the first sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 19 characters? Let me count: 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters. Then the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 11 + 11 - overlap? Wait, perhaps the actual input is 19 letters. Let me check:\n\nOriginal sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let's count letters:\n\nabrakadabra is 11 letters. Then adding 'abrakadabra' again would be 22 letters. But the sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — which is 19 letters. So the first part is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters), then 'abrakadabra' (11 letters) but overlapping by 3 letters? Wait, maybe the example says that when two 'abrakadabra's are merged with an overlap of 1, the result is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (length 11 + 11 -1 = 21?), but perhaps the sample input is different. Anyway, perhaps the code will handle it.\n\nBut let's take the first example input. The output is YES and s is abrakadabra (length 11). Let's check for m=11.\n\nk = 2*11 -n. Let's compute n for that input. The input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let me count letters. Let's see:\n\n\"abrakadabrabrakadabra\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n\"abrakadabra\" (11) + \"abrakadabra\" (11) — but overlapping by 1 character. So the merged string would be 11 + 11 -1 = 21 characters. But the sample input is given as 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which is 19 letters. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example. Let me check the sample input and output again.\n\nSample input for the first example is ['abrakadabrabrakadabra', ...]. The output is 'YES\\nabrakadabra'.\n\nSo the input string is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' — let's count the letters:\n\nLet me write it out:\n\na b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a\n\nWait, that's 21 letters. But maybe I'm making a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the input is 'abrakadabraabrakadabra' (without overlapping), but that's 22 letters. However, the sample output says that the correct s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). So for that case, the length of t is 2*11 -k. So for example, if k=1, then n=2*11 -1 =21. So the input is 21 letters. So perhaps the input in the first example is 21 letters long. So for m=11, k=2*11 -21 = 1. So the code would check if the first m characters (11) is s_candidate, and the rest of the string (t[11:]) is s_candidate[k:] = s_candidate[1:].\n\nSo, for example, if the input is s + s[1:], then t would be s + s[1:], which is 11 + 10 = 21 letters. So the code would check if t[11:] equals s_candidate[1:].\n\nIn that case, the code would find that it is true, and return YES.\n\nSo the code's approach is correct.\n\nAnother example is the second input: 'acacacaca' (output is 'YES\\nacaca'). Let's see. The length of t is 9. So n=9. Possible m ranges from (9+1)/2 =5 to 8. So m can be 5,6,7,8.\n\nFor each m, compute k=2m-9.\n\nFor m=5: k=10-9=1. Check if first 5 characters (acaca) and the rest (t[5:] is 'caca') equals s_candidate[k:] = acaca[1:] = 'caca'. So yes. So the code would return YES and s_candidate as 'acaca'.\n\nWhich matches the sample. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example is 'abcabc' (output is NO). Let's see. n=6. The possible m ranges from (6+1)/2=3.5 → ceil(3.5)=4 to 5. So m can be 4 or 5.\n\nFor m=4: k=2*4 -6 = 8-6=2. Check if first 4 characters (abca) and the rest (t[4:] is 'bc'). Check if s_candidate[2:] is 'ca' (since s_candidate is 'abca', [2:] is 'ca'). But the rest is 'bc' which is not equal to 'ca'. So no.\n\nFor m=5: k=2*5-6=4. Check if first 5 characters (abcab) and the rest is t[5:] is 'c'. Check if s_candidate[4:] is 'b'. But the rest is 'c' which is not equal. So no. Hence, output is NO, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abababab' (output is YES with 'ababab'). Let's see. The input length is 8. So n=8. m ranges from (8+1)/2=4.5 → 5 to 7.\n\nFor m=5: k=2*5 -8 = 2. Check if first 5 characters (ababa) and the rest is t[5:] = 'bab'. Check if s_candidate[k:] is ababa[2:] = 'aba'. The rest is 'bab' which is not equal. So no.\n\nFor m=6: k= 12-8=4. Check if first 6 characters (ababab) and the rest is t[6:] = 'ab'. Check if s_candidate[4:] is 'ab' (since s_candidate is ababab, indexes 4: are 'ab'). So yes. So the code would return YES and s_candidate as ababab. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach seems valid.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string t.\n\nCompute n = len(t). If n is less than 2, then it's impossible (since two messages must be merged, but for example, if n is 1, then the merged string would be 2m -k. But m has to be >= (n+1)/2 = 1. So m can be 1, but then k = 2*1 -1=1. But k must be less than m (which is 1), so k must be <1. But k=1 is invalid. Hence, for n=1, output is NO. So in general, for n < 2, output is NO.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is non-empty, but for n=1, the answer is definitely NO.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nLoop m in range from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1 inclusive.\n\nBut how to compute the starting m?\n\nIn Python, (n+1)//2 would give us the floor of (n+1)/2. Wait, for example, if n is even: say n=6. (n+1)/2 = 3.5. ceil(3.5) is 4. So for n even, the starting m is (n+1)//2 ?\n\nWait, (n+1)/2 for even n:\n\nn=6 → (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4. (n+1)//2 in integer division would be (7)//2 = 3. So no. So perhaps the starting m is (n+1 +1)//2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way to compute the lower bound for m is m_min = (n +1) // 2 if (n+1) is even? Or perhaps m_min is math.ceil( (n+1)/2 ). But since in Python, for integers, we can compute m_min as (n + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, let me think. For example, for n=5: (n+1)/2 = 3. So m starts at 3.\n\nFor n=6: (n+1)/2 = 3.5, so m starts at 4.\n\nIn Python, math.ceil( (n+1)/2 ) can be calculated as (n + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for (n+1) even, say n=5: (5+1)/2=3. So (n+1 +1)//2 = (6 +1)/2 = 7//2=3.5 → 3 in integer division? No, in Python, (n + 1 + 1) // 2 would be (5+1+1)//2 = 7//2=3. Which is correct for m_min=3.\n\nWait, for n=6, (n+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil is 4. (n+1 +1) is 6+1+1=8? No. Wait n is 6. (n+1) is 7. So (n+1 +1) is 8. Divided by 2 is 4. Which is correct. So yes, m_min is (n + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait no, (n+1 +1) // 2 is (n+2)//2. For example, for n=5, (n+2)//2 = (5+2)//2 = 7//2=3.5 → 3 in integer division. Which is correct.\n\nWait, (n + 1) / 2 is the value we need to ceil. So math.ceil( (n+1)/2 ) equals (n+1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nYes. Because for any real number x, ceil(x) = (x + 1) // 1. But here, for integers, let's think:\n\nLet me take x = (n+1)/2.\n\nIf x is integer, then ceil(x) is x. Else, it's x + 0.5, which when floored would be x+0.5?\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as:\n\nceil(a / b) can be written as (a + b -1) // b.\n\nSo here, for x = (n+1)/2, we want ceil(x). So using the formula, it's ((n+1) + 2 -1 ) // 2 → (n+1 +1) // 2 → (n+2)//2.\n\nYes. So m_min is (n+2)//2.\n\nSo for m in the range from m_min to n-1, inclusive.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor m in range(m_min, n):\n\nWait, but in Python, range is exclusive on the upper end. So for example, to loop from m_min to n-1 inclusive, it's range(m_min, n).\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead t.\n\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    for m in range( (n+2)//2, n ):\n\n        k = 2*m -n\n\n        # check if k is between 1 and m-1. But since m is in the range (n+2)//2 to n-1, this should be true.\n\n        # Now, check if the first m characters and the rest of the string matches.\n\n        s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n        # the rest of the string is t[m:]\n\n        # check if t[m:] == s_candidate[k:]\n\n        if t[m:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n            print(s_candidate)\n\n            exit()\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about for m in the range (n+2)//2 to n-1 inclusive?\n\nWait, for example, when n=9, (n+2)//2 is (9+2)//2=11//2=5. So m starts at 5, and goes up to n-1=8. So m=5,6,7,8.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut let's test for m=5 in the second sample input, which is 'acacacaca' (n=9). Then, m=5, k=2*5-9=1. s_candidate is 'acaca', and t[m:] is 'caca'. s_candidate[k:] is 'caca' (since k=1, s_candidate[1:] is 'caca'). So yes. So the code returns YES.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: for the sample input 'abababab' (n=8). m ranges from (8+2)//2 = 5 to 7.\n\nm=5: k=2*5 -8=2. s_candidate is 'ababa'. t[m:] is 'bab'. s_candidate[k:] is 'aba' (since 2: is 'aba'), which is not equal to 'bab'.\n\nm=6: k=12-8=4. s_candidate is 'ababab' (t[:6] is 'ababab'). t[m:] is 'ab'. s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[4:] → 'ab' (since s_candidate is 'ababab', indexes 4: are 'ab'). So yes. So code returns YES and s_candidate.\n\nSo the code would work.\n\nBut what about cases where multiple m's are possible? For example, in the second sample input, there's another possible answer. But the code returns the first possible m, which is correct.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase 1: t is 'aa' (n=2). Then m_min is (2+2)//2 = 2. The loop is for m in range(2, 2) → no iterations. So code returns NO. But let's see: the possible m is 2? Because m must be between (n+1)/2= (2+1)/2=1.5 → ceil is 2. So m_min is 2. But the upper bound is n-1=1. So the loop is from 2 to 1, which is invalid. So no iterations. So code returns NO. But what is the correct answer?\n\nThe original problem says that the full overlap (two messages completely overlapping) is not considered an error. For example, if t is 'aa', then it could be that two 'a's were sent, and they overlapped completely. But according to the note, this is not considered an error. Also, if the two messages are sent with no overlap (so 'aa' is the concatenation of two 'a's), that's not considered an error either. So for t='aa', the code returns NO. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: t='aaa' (n=3). m_min is (3+2)//2 = 5//2=2. So m ranges from 2 to 2 (since n-1=2). So m=2. k=2*2 -3 =1. Check if t[m:] (t[2:] is 'a') equals s_candidate[k:] where s_candidate is t[:2] = 'aa'. s_candidate[k:] is 'a' (k=1). So yes. So the code would return YES and 'aa'. Which is correct. Because two 'aa's merged with overlap of 1 character. So the merged string is 'aa' + 'a' → 'aaa'. So the code returns YES.\n\nAnother case: t is 'aaaaa' (n=5). m_min is (5+2)//2 = 3.5 → 3.5 floored? Wait, in Python (5+2)//2 is 3 (since 7//2 is 3). So m ranges from 3 to 4.\n\nFor m=3: k=6-5=1. Check if t[3:] is 'aa' equals s_candidate[1:] where s_candidate is 'aaa'. s_candidate[1:] is 'aa' → yes. So code returns YES and 'aaa'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother case: t is 'ababa' (n=5). m_min is 3. Let's see m=3: k=1. s_candidate is 'aba', t[m:] is 'ba'. s_candidate[k:] is 'ba' (since k=1, s_candidate[1:] is 'ba') → yes. So code returns YES and 'aba'.\n\nBut what if the original s was 'ababa'? No, because m is 3. So the code would return 'aba' as the possible s. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, handle the case when n is 1 → output NO.\n\nBut for n=2, the code returns NO. Which is correct.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead t from input. For example, in the sample input, the first input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\nt = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    found = False\n\n    for m in range( (n + 2) // 2, n ):\n\n        k = 2 * m - n\n\n        # check if k is between 1 and m-1\n\n        # since m ranges from (n+2)//2 to n-1, which ensures that k is in the required range.\n\n        # So proceed.\n\n        s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n        if t[m:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n            print(s_candidate)\n\n            found = True\n\n            break\n\n    if not found:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper limit. So for example, range(a, b) includes a, a+1,..., b-1. So when the code uses for m in range( (n+2)//2, n ), then m takes values from (n+2)//2 up to n-1 inclusive. Which is correct.\n\nTesting the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (n=19?)\n\nWait let's count the letters of the first sample input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'.\n\nLet me count:\n\na b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a → that's 21 letters. So n=21.\n\nThen m_min = (21 + 2) // 2 = 23//2=11. So m ranges from 11 to 20 (since n is 21, n-1=20).\n\nSo m=11: k=2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. Check if t[11:] equals s_candidate[1:].\n\ns_candidate is t[:11] which is 'abrakadabra' (assuming the first 11 letters are that). Then t[11:] is 'abrakadabra' (the rest of the string). s_candidate[1:] is 'brakadabra'. So the code would compare 'abrakadabra' (t[11:]) with 'brakadabra' (s_candidate[1:]). Which is not equal. So no.\n\nWait but in the sample, the correct answer is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). How does that fit?\n\nAh, perhaps in the first sample input, the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters. Let me think: the correct s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). So the merged string is s + s[1:], which is 11 + 10 = 21 letters. So the code should find for m=11, k=1. Then, t[m:] should be s_candidate[k:] → s_candidate is 'abrakadabra', and s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[1:] which is 'brakadabra'. So t[m:] must be 'brakadabra'.\n\nBut in the input string, after the first 11 letters (abrakadabra), the next letters are 'abrakadabra' (but overlapping by 1 character). So the merged string would be 'abrakadabra' + 'brakadabra'? Or perhaps the input is 'abrakadabraabrakadabra' (no overlap) which would be 22 letters. But the sample input is given as 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 21 letters. So the first 11 letters are 'abrakadabra', then the next letters are 'brakadabra' (10 letters). So t[m:] is 'brakadabra', which equals s_candidate[1:] (which is 'brakadabra'). So the code would find this and return YES.\n\nSo why in my previous calculation for the first sample input, the code would return YES. So the code would find for m=11, and the condition holds. Hence, the code would output YES and the s_candidate.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother sample input is 'acacacaca' (n=9). The code would process m=5, which gives k=1, and t[m:] is 'caca' which equals s_candidate[1:] = 'caca' (s_candidate is 'acaca').\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abcabc' (n=6). The code checks m=4 and m=5. For m=4, k=2*4-6=2. s_candidate is 'abca'. t[m:] is 'bc'. s_candidate[k:] is 'ca' → not equal. For m=5, k=2*5-6=4. s_candidate is 'abcab', t[m:] is 'c'. s_candidate[k:] is 'b' (since k=4, s_candidate is 5 letters, indexes 4: is 'b'). So 'c' != 'b' → no. So output is NO.\n\nAnother sample input is 'abababab' (n=8). For m=6, k=12-8=4. s_candidate is 'ababab' (t[:6] is 'ababab'). t[m:] is 'ab'. s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[4:] → 'ab'. So yes. So code returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input is 'tatbt' (output NO). Let's see: n=5. m_min is (5+2)//2=3. So m ranges from 3 to 4.\n\nFor m=3: k=6-5=1. s_candidate is 'tat'. t[m:] is 'bt'. s_candidate[1:] is 'at' → compare 'bt' vs 'at' → no.\n\nFor m=4: k=8-5=3. s_candidate is 'tatb'. t[m:] is 't'. s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[3:] → 'b'. Compare 't' vs 'b' → no. So output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you do range( (n+2)//2, n ), for example, when (n+2)//2 is greater than or equal to n, the loop doesn't run. For example, if n=2, then (2+2)//2 = 2, and range(2, 2) is empty. So code returns NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3. (n+2)//2 = (5)//2=2. So m runs from 2 to 2 (since n-1 is 2). So m=2. k=2*2 -3=1. Check if t[2:] is equal to s_candidate[1:]. For example, if t is 'aaa', then s_candidate is 'aa', t[2:] is 'a', and s_candidate[1:] is 'a' → yes. So code returns YES.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, implement this code.\n\nBut also, note that in Python, the input is read as a single line. So the code reads the input as t = input().strip().\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead t from stdin.\n\nHandle the cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t:\n\nt = input().strip()\n\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    found = False\n\n    for m in range( (n + 2) // 2, n ):\n\n        k = 2 * m - n\n\n        s_candidate = t[:m]\n\n        if t[m:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n            print(s_candidate)\n\n            found = True\n\n            break\n\n    if not found:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nThis should work.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 2: 'acacacaca' → output YES and 'acaca'.\n\nn=9.\n\nm ranges from (9+2)//2 = 5.5 → 5.5 floored? Wait (9+2) is 11, divided by 2 is 5.5, but in Python (n + 2) // 2 is (9 + 2) // 2 = 11//2 = 5. So the loop runs for m from 5 to 8 (since n is 9, n-1 is 8).\n\nSo m=5: k=2*5 -9=1. s_candidate is t[:5] → 'acaca'. t[m:] is t[5:] → 'caca'. s_candidate[k:] is 'acaca'[1:] → 'caca' → match. So code returns YES.\n\nSample Input 3: 'abcabc' → output NO. As discussed.\n\nSample Input 4: 'abababab' → output YES. For m=6, which is in the range (8+2)//2 = 5 → m ranges from 5 to 7. m=6: k=12-8=4. s_candidate is t[:6] = 'ababab'. t[6:] is 'ab'. s_candidate[4:] is 'ab' → match. So code returns YES.\n\nSample Input 5: 'tatbt' → output NO. As discussed.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nAnother test case: t = 'aaa' → output YES. Because m=2, k=1. t[:2] is 'aa', t[2:] is 'a' which equals 'aa'[1:] → 'a'.\n\nAnother test case: t = 'aaaaa' → n=5. m ranges from (5+2)//2 = 3.5 → 3. So m=3 and 4.\n\nFor m=3: k=6-5=1. t[:3] is 'aaa', t[3:] is 'aa'. s_candidate[k:] is 'aa' → match. So returns YES.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: t = 'aa' → returns NO. Because m ranges from (2+2)//2=2, to n-1=1. So the loop doesn't run. So returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: t = 'aabbaa' → n=6. m ranges from (6+2)//2=4 to 5.\n\nFor m=4: k=8-6=2. s_candidate is 'aabb'. t[m:] is 'aa'. Check if s_candidate[2:] is 'bb' → compare with 'aa' → no.\n\nFor m=5: k=10-6=4. s_candidate is 'aabba'. t[m:] is 'a'. s_candidate[4:] is 'a' → match. So returns YES. So the code would return YES and 'aabba'.\n\nWhich is correct. Because two 'aabba's merged with overlap of 4 characters. The first message is 'aabba', the second is 'aabba'. Overlap of 4 characters: the last 4 characters of first message is 'abba', and the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an overlap. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second message, but not completely or not at all.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Overlap**: The merged string `t` is formed by two identical strings `s` overlapping by some positive number of characters `k`, where `1 ≤ k < len(s)`. The length of `t` will be `2 * len(s) - k`.\n2. **Range for Length of `s`**: Given the length `n` of `t`, the possible lengths of `s` (denoted as `m`) must satisfy `(n + 1) / 2 ≤ m ≤ n - 1`. This ensures that the overlap `k` is valid (i.e., between 1 and `m - 1`).\n3. **Check Validity**: For each valid length `m`, compute the overlap `k = 2 * m - n`. Check if the substring `t[:m]` (candidate `s`) can form `t` when overlapped by `k` characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    # Calculate the starting m value\n    m_min = (n + 2) // 2\n    for m in range(m_min, n):\n        k = 2 * m - n\n        s_candidate = t[:m]\n        if t[m:] == s_candidate[k:]:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            found = True\n            break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input string `t` and determine its length `n`.\n2. **Edge Case Check**: If the length of `t` is less than 2, immediately output \"NO\" since it's impossible to form `t` from two messages.\n3. **Range Calculation**: Calculate the minimum possible length `m` of the candidate string `s` using integer division.\n4. **Overlap Check**: For each valid length `m`, compute the overlap `k` and check if the substring `t[:m]` can form `t` when overlapped by `k` characters. If a valid overlap is found, print \"YES\" followed by the candidate string `s`.\n5. **Result Determination**: If no valid overlap is found after checking all possible lengths, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid overlaps and ensures correctness by leveraging the constraints on the overlap length.",
