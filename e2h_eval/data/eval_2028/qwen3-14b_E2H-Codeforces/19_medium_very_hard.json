The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are:\n\n1. The districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair. So the initial structure is a tree.\n2. After removing k districts, the remaining districts must form a connected subtree.\n3. We want to maximize the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute more. So ideally, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure connectivity? Because if we just take the top (n -k) districts, they might not be connected. So we need to find a connected subtree that includes as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nSo the approach here is similar to finding a subtree with (n -k) nodes, which has maximum sum of 2^i. But how?\n\nLet me think. Since 2^i is strictly increasing with i, the optimal strategy would be to include as many high-numbered districts as possible. However, the tree structure might require that certain lower-numbered districts are kept to connect the higher ones.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe we can think of it as a problem where we need to select a subtree of size (n -k), and we want to maximize the sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes included, and higher nodes contribute more, perhaps we can prioritize keeping higher-numbered nodes.\n\nBut how to do that? One idea is to perform a greedy approach where we start from the highest-numbered node and try to include as many high nodes as possible, making sure that the subtree remains connected.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of selecting which nodes to remove. Since we have to remove exactly k nodes, and the remaining must form a connected component. So the problem is equivalent to choosing a connected subtree of size (n -k) with maximum sum of 2^i.\n\nBut how do we find that subtree efficiently?\n\nAnother thought: the sum is maximized when the subtree contains the largest possible nodes. So maybe we can model this as a problem where we want to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, but they must form a connected subtree. If they are connected, then that's our answer. Otherwise, we have to remove some lower nodes and include some higher ones.\n\nBut how to check if the largest (n -k) nodes form a connected subtree?\n\nWait, perhaps not. For example, if the largest nodes are spread out in the tree, then their subtree may not be connected. So we need to find a way to select the nodes with the highest possible values while ensuring connectivity.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding a maximum spanning tree, but in this case, we need a subtree of a certain size.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem of pruning the tree. Since higher-numbered nodes have higher value, we want to keep them. But to keep them connected, perhaps we can perform a traversal starting from the highest node and decide which branches to keep.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider that each node's value is 2^i, so the priority is to keep the nodes with higher i. So the optimal solution is to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible. So perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to remove k nodes, but in such a way that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. To maximize the sum, we need to remove the nodes with the smallest i possible, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as selecting a subtree of size (n -k) that has the maximum sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes included, and since higher i gives higher value, we need to include as many high i nodes as possible.\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to perform a priority-based selection. Let's think recursively. The root of the tree could be the highest-numbered node. Then, for each subtree, we decide whether to include or exclude certain nodes based on their value.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to use a priority queue (max heap) approach. However, given the constraints of n up to 1e6, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) algorithm.\n\nAnother angle: Since the sum is determined by the nodes kept, and the sum is maximized when the nodes kept are the ones with the highest possible i values. So the problem reduces to selecting the subset of (n -k) nodes with the highest possible i values, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nIf the highest (n -k) nodes are connected, then that's the answer. If not, we need to remove some lower nodes and keep some higher ones to make the subset connected.\n\nBut how to determine which nodes to remove?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. Here's an idea inspired by Krusky's algorithm:\n\nWe can think of the nodes as having weights (their 2^i values). We need to select a connected subtree with exactly (n -k) nodes. Since the weight is highest for higher i, we can try to select the nodes with the highest i, but ensuring that the subtree is connected.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the problem as starting with all nodes. We need to remove k nodes, but in such a way that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. Since we want to maximize the sum, we should remove the nodes with the smallest possible values (since they contribute less). However, the problem is that removing a node may split the tree into disconnected parts. Therefore, we need to find a way to remove nodes in a way that the remaining tree is connected.\n\nBut how to choose which nodes to remove?\n\nPerhaps we can model this as a problem where we want to keep the nodes with the highest possible values. Let's imagine that we first keep all nodes, and then iteratively remove the nodes with the smallest values, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nWait, but how to do that? Because if you remove a node that is a leaf (in the current tree), then the tree remains connected. So maybe we can perform a process where we remove the nodes with the smallest values, but only if they are leaves in the current tree.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let me think:\n\nThe optimal solution is to keep the nodes with the largest possible i values. So we need to select the nodes with the highest i's, but in such a way that they form a connected subtree. To do that, perhaps we can perform a process where we start with all nodes and remove the nodes with the smallest i values, but only if they are leaves. Because removing a leaf doesn't disconnect the tree. So this way, we can remove k nodes, and the remaining tree will be connected.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n- We need to remove k nodes. So we can think of the problem as building a tree with (n -k) nodes, which is connected. To maximize the sum, we want to keep the largest nodes. So the plan is to remove the smallest nodes, but in such a way that each removal is a leaf in the current tree.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to remove?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding a tree with (n -k) nodes by removing leaves. So the process would be:\n\n- Start with the original tree.\n\n- While the number of nodes is larger than (n -k):\n\n   - Find all the leaves (nodes with degree 1) in the current tree.\n\n   - Among these leaves, select the one with the smallest i (since we want to remove the least valuable nodes first).\n\n   - Remove that node from the tree (i.e., mark it for removal), and decrease the degree of its neighbor.\n\nThis way, after k steps, the remaining nodes form a connected tree, and we have removed the k nodes with the smallest possible values.\n\nWait, but why would this work? Because each time we remove a leaf, which is the smallest possible, allowing us to keep the higher ones. This way, the remaining nodes are connected and have the maximum sum.\n\nBut does this approach guarantee that the remaining nodes are the ones with the highest possible i's?\n\nFor example, suppose that there is a node with a small i that is not a leaf. If we can't remove it now, but later when it becomes a leaf, we can remove it. But the process would ensure that we remove the smallest possible nodes first.\n\nLet me take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n6 3\nEdges:\n2-1\n2-6\n4-2\n5-6\n2-3\n\nSo the tree structure is:\n\nDistrict 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. District 6 is connected to 5.\n\nThe initial tree has all nodes. We need to remove 3 nodes.\n\nThe process would be:\n\nInitially, the leaves are 1, 3, 4, 5, 6? Wait, let's think:\n\nWait, the tree structure:\n\nLet me draw it:\n\nNode 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. Node 6 is connected to 2 and 5. Node 5 is connected to 6. So the leaves are 1, 3, 4, 5.\n\nInitially, the leaves are 1,3,4,5. Among these, the smallest i is 1 (i=1), 3 (i=3), 4 (i=4), 5 (i=5). So the smallest is 1. Remove it. Now the tree is:\n\nNodes 2,3,4,5,6. The degrees of node 2 is now 3 (connected to 3,4,6). The leaves are 3,4,5. The next smallest is 3 (i=3). Remove it. Now nodes are 2,4,5,6. Leaves are 4 and 5. The smallest is 4 (i=4). Remove it. Now the tree has nodes 2,5,6. Which is connected. So the removed nodes are 1,3,4. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes! So this approach works for the first sample.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input is:\n\nInput:\n8 4\nEdges:\n2 6\n2 7\n7 8\n1 2\n3 1\n2 4\n7 5\n\nSo the tree structure is:\n\nLet me think. Let's build the tree:\n\nNodes connected as follows:\n\n- 2 is connected to 6,7,1,4.\n\n- 7 is connected to 2, 8,5.\n\n- 1 is connected to 2,3.\n\n- 3 is connected to 1.\n\n- 4 is connected to 2.\n\n- 5 is connected to 7.\n\n- 6 is connected to 2.\n\n- 8 is connected to 7.\n\nSo the initial leaves are 3,4,5,6,8. The smallest i among them is 3 (i=3), 4 (i=4), 5 (i=5), 6 (i=6), 8 (i=8). So first remove 3. Then the leaves are 4,5,6,8, and 1 (since 1 is connected to 2 and 3, but 3 is removed, so now 1's degree is 1). Wait, after removing 3, node 1 is connected to 2. So node 1 is now a leaf. So leaves are 1,4,5,6,8. The next smallest is 1 (i=1). Remove it. Now the leaves are 4,5,6,8. Next, the smallest is 4 (i=4). Remove it. Now leaves are 5,6,8. Next, the smallest is 5 (i=5). Remove it. Now the remaining nodes are 2,6,7,8, and others? Let me check:\n\nOriginal n is 8. We need to remove 4 nodes. After removing 3,1,4,5, that's 4 nodes. The remaining nodes are 2,6,7,8, and 2 is connected to 6,7, etc. So the remaining tree is connected. The districts removed are 1,3,4,5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach seems to work.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is:\n\n- We need to remove k nodes. The way to do this is to iteratively remove the leaves with the smallest i until we have removed k nodes.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nThe challenge is to find the leaves and select the one with the smallest i each time. However, for large n (up to 1e6), we need an efficient way to do this.\n\nAn efficient way would be to use a priority queue (min-heap) that holds all the current leaves. Each time, we extract the minimum, remove it, and add the new leaves created by that removal.\n\nBut how to track the leaves?\n\nLet's think about the steps:\n\n1. Build the tree as an adjacency list. Each node has a list of neighbors.\n\n2. Compute the initial degrees of each node. For a tree, the initial degree is the number of adjacent nodes.\n\n3. Initialize a priority queue (min-heap) with all the nodes that have degree 1 (initial leaves).\n\n4. While the number of nodes to remove (count) is less than k:\n\n   a. Extract the node with the smallest number from the priority queue.\n\n   b. Add this node to the list of removed nodes.\n\n   c. For each neighbor of this node, if the neighbor hasn't been removed yet, decrease its degree by 1. If the degree of the neighbor becomes 1, add it to the priority queue.\n\nBut wait, how to track which nodes have been removed? Because once a node is removed, we cannot consider it again.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Maintain a boolean array to mark whether a node is removed.\n\n- When processing a node from the priority queue, if it's already removed, skip it. But since the priority queue is built with leaves, and once a node is removed, it's not part of the tree anymore. So during the process, the priority queue may contain nodes that are already removed. Wait, no. Because once a node is removed, it's not part of the tree anymore. So when we add a node to the priority queue, it's only when it becomes a leaf in the current tree.\n\nBut during the process, when we extract a node from the priority queue, we need to check if it's already removed. Because if it was added to the queue before but was already processed, then it's already removed.\n\nWait, but the way the algorithm works is that each time a node is added to the priority queue, it's because it's a leaf in the current tree. So once we process it (i.e., remove it), then it's no longer part of the tree. So the priority queue should not have duplicates, but perhaps during the process, a node may be added multiple times. However, once it's processed, it's marked as removed, so any subsequent entries in the priority queue for that node can be ignored.\n\nBut how to handle that? Because when we process a node, we need to check if it's already removed.\n\nSo here's the detailed algorithm:\n\nInitialize:\n\n- adj = adjacency list.\n\n- degree = array of degrees for each node.\n\n- removed = array of booleans, initially False.\n\n- priority queue (min-heap) containing all nodes with degree 1.\n\nThen, for each step until we have removed k nodes:\n\n   while the priority queue is not empty:\n\n      get the node with the smallest number (u)\n\n      if u is already removed, continue\n\n      else:\n\n          mark u as removed\n\n          add u to the list of removed nodes\n\n          for each neighbor v of u:\n\n              if not removed[v]:\n\n                  degree[v] -= 1\n\n                  if degree[v] == 1:\n\n                      add v to the priority queue\n\n          break\n\n   else:\n\n      // if the priority queue is empty, but we haven't removed enough nodes. But this shouldn't happen since the tree is connected and we need to remove k nodes.\n\nBut wait, in a tree, when you remove leaves, you can eventually remove all nodes except one. So for k < n-1, this process should work.\n\nBut how to handle the priority queue correctly?\n\nIn Python, the heapq module can be used. However, since the same node can be added multiple times to the heap, but once it's removed, we need to skip those entries.\n\nBut for example, a node may be added to the heap multiple times, but once it's removed, the other entries in the heap for that node can be ignored.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nWe use a priority queue (min-heap) that may contain multiple entries of the same node. However, when we pop a node from the heap, we check if it's already removed. If it is, we ignore it. If not, we proceed to remove it.\n\nThis is acceptable, but in the worst case, the heap can have O(n) entries. However, given that each node can be added to the heap at most O(1) times (since once a node is processed, it's removed, and its neighbors are updated), the total number of operations is O(n log n), which is acceptable for n up to 1e6.\n\nBut in practice, for Python, using a heap with possible duplicate entries can be manageable.\n\nNow, let's think about the data structures.\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\n- Read n and k.\n\n- Read the n-1 edges, build the adjacency list.\n\n- Compute the degree of each node.\n\n- Initialize the heap with all nodes that have degree 1.\n\n- Create a removed array (or set) to track which nodes have been removed.\n\n- Then, process the heap until we have removed k nodes.\n\nBut for the heap, since we need to process the smallest node first, we can push all initial leaves into the heap.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the heapq module is a min-heap. So each time, we pop the smallest element.\n\nNow, for the sample input 1:\n\nInitial leaves are 1,3,4,5. The heap will have [1,3,4,5]. Then, pop 1, add to removed. Then, check its neighbor (node 2). The degree of node 2 was 4 (connected to 1, 3, 4, 6). After removing 1, the degree of 2 becomes 3. Since it's not 1, nothing is added to the heap.\n\nNext, the heap has 3,4,5. Pop 3. Add to removed. Check neighbor 2. Its degree decreases to 2. Not 1, so nothing added.\n\nHeap now has 4,5. Pop 4. Add to removed. Check neighbor 2. Degree decreases to 1. So add 2 to the heap. Now, heap has 2,5. Now, the next step: we need to remove 3 nodes. So after 3 removals, we stop.\n\nThus, the removed nodes are 1,3,4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nFirst, read n and k.\n\nThen, read n-1 edges. Build adjacency list. For each node, track its neighbors.\n\nCompute the degree of each node.\n\nInitialize the heap with nodes where degree is 1.\n\nBut for Python, the heap is a priority queue. So we can push all such nodes into the heap.\n\nThen, we need to process until we have removed k nodes.\n\nWe also need to track which nodes are removed. So, a list called 'removed' of size n+1 (since nodes are numbered from 1 to n).\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport heapq\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor _ in range(n-1):\n\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    adj[a].append(b)\n\n    adj[b].append(a)\n\ndegree = [0]*(n+1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    degree[i] = len(adj[i])\n\nheap = []\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    if degree[i] == 1:\n\n        heapq.heappush(heap, i)\n\nremoved = [False]*(n+1)\n\nresult = []\n\nwhile len(result) < k:\n\n    u = heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n    if removed[u]:\n\n        continue\n\n    removed[u] = True\n\n    result.append(u)\n\n    for v in adj[u]:\n\n        if not removed[v]:\n\n            degree[v] -= 1\n\n            if degree[v] == 1:\n\n                heapq.heappush(heap, v)\n\nOnce this is done, the result list contains the k nodes to remove, but we need to output them in sorted order.\n\nWait, but the problem says to output the numbers in increasing order. So after collecting the result, we sort it.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first sample's result is [1,3,4], which is already sorted. However, in other cases, the order may not be sorted. For example, if the heap pops 5, then 4, then 3, etc. So the result list may be in arbitrary order, so after collecting the k elements, we need to sort them before outputting.\n\nSo, after collecting the result, we sort it and print.\n\nSo in code:\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, sorted(result))))\n\nBut wait, let's test for the second sample. The sample output is '1 3 4 5'. The code would collect them in the order 3,1,4,5 (if that's how the heap pops them). But after sorting, they are 1,3,4,5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the time complexity?\n\nEach node is pushed into the heap once for each time it becomes a leaf. But in a tree, each node can become a leaf only once. Because once it's removed, it's not part of the tree anymore. So the total number of operations on the heap is O(n). Each heappush and heappop is O(log n). So overall, O(n log n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 1e6.\n\nBut in Python, with n=1e6, O(n log n) is acceptable? Well, Python can handle it, but the code needs to be optimized.\n\nBut for the given constraints (n up to 1e6), and with the code being O(n log n), it's manageable.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=2, k=1. The tree is two nodes connected. The initial leaves are both nodes. The heap has 1 and 2. The code removes the smaller one (1), and the output is [1], which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, k=1. The tree is a chain 1-2-3. Initial leaves are 1 and 3. The heap has 1 and 3. The code removes 1. The remaining nodes are 2 and 3, which are connected. So the output is [1], which is correct. The sum is 2^2 + 2^3 = 12. If we had removed 3, the sum is 2^1 + 2^2 = 6, which is worse. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=4, k=1. Tree is 1-2-3-4. Initial leaves are 1 and 4. The code removes 1. The remaining tree is 2-3-4. Which is connected. So the output is [1].\n\nAnother case: n=4, k=2. The code will remove 1 and 4. Then the remaining tree is 2-3, connected.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case where a node is not a leaf but needs to be removed. But according to the algorithm, it's not possible, since the algorithm only removes leaves. So for example, in a star-shaped tree: node 2 connected to 1,3,4,5. So the initial leaves are 1,3,4,5. Suppose k=2. The code removes 1 and 3. The remaining nodes are 2,4,5. Which is connected.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nBut what if the required k is such that we need to remove nodes that are not leaves? For example, in a tree with 3 nodes connected as 1-2-3. Suppose k=1. The algorithm removes 1 (the smallest leaf). But if we remove 2, the tree becomes disconnected. So the algorithm is correct in not removing 2, since it's not a leaf. So the code correctly removes 1, which is a leaf, and the remaining tree is connected.\n\nThus, the algorithm works.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut for Python, the problem is that for n=1e6, the adjacency list may take O(n) memory, which is acceptable. Also, the heap operations.\n\nBut in Python, for n=1e6, the code may be slow. However, given that the problem allows for it, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input. But note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as a single test case. Wait, looking at the sample input, the first line shows the input as:\n\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the problem description. Wait, the user says that the input is given as per the problem's input format. The first line of input contains n and k, then n-1 lines of edges.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are two examples. However, the problem says that the code should read from standard input. So the code should process a single test case.\n\nWait, the sample input shows two examples, but perhaps that's a mistake. The actual input for the code is one test case.\n\nSo the code should read n and k from stdin, then n-1 edges.\n\nBut in the sample input provided, the first example's input is:\n\n6 3\n\nthen the edges.\n\nBut in the code, the user provided the input as a list of two examples, but that's perhaps a formatting error. So the code should read the input as per the problem's description.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, and process a single test case.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport heapq\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n\n    ptr += 1\n\n    k = int(input[ptr])\n\n    ptr += 1\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n\n    for _ in range(n-1):\n\n        a = int(input[ptr])\n\n        ptr += 1\n\n        b = int(input[ptr])\n\n        ptr += 1\n\n        adj[a].append(b)\n\n        adj[b].append(a)\n\n    degree = [0]*(n+1)\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n\n        degree[i] = len(adj[i])\n\n    heap = []\n\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n\n        if degree[i] == 1:\n\n            heapq.heappush(heap, i)\n\n    removed = [False]*(n+1)\n\n    result = []\n\n    while len(result) < k:\n\n        u = heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n        if removed[u]:\n\n            continue\n\n        removed[u] = True\n\n        result.append(u)\n\n        for v in adj[u]:\n\n            if not removed[v]:\n\n                degree[v] -= 1\n\n                if degree[v] == 1:\n\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, v)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(result))))\n\nBut wait, for the case where the same node is pushed multiple times into the heap. For example, when a node is pushed once, and then again later. But the code checks if it's already removed, so even if the same node is in the heap multiple times, once it's removed, the other instances are skipped.\n\nThis should be correct.\n\nTesting with the first sample:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n6 3\n\nEdges:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nThe code would generate the correct output.\n\nNow, for the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n8 4\n\nEdges:\n\n2 6\n\n2 7\n\n7 8\n\n1 2\n\n3 1\n\n2 4\n\n7 5\n\nWhich would be parsed as:\n\nn=8, k=4.\n\nThe edges are:\n\n2-6, 2-7, 7-8, 1-2, 3-1, 2-4, 7-5.\n\nThe code would generate the output [1,3,4,5], sorted.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThus, this code should work.\n\nNow, considering possible edge cases.\n\nCase when k=1 and n=2: output is 1.\n\nAnother case: when n=1, but according to the problem statement, k < n, so n can't be 1. Because for n=1, k must be <1, but k is >=1? Wait, the input constraints are 1 ≤ k < n ≤ 1e6. So n starts from 2.\n\nSo the code can handle n=2.\n\nAnother case: when the tree is a straight line, e.g., 1-2-3-...-n. The code will remove the first k leaves, which are the ends. For example, if n=5, k=2. The initial leaves are 1 and 5. Remove 1, then 5. The remaining nodes are 2,3,4. Which is connected.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and maximize the total number of fans. The districts are structured as a tree, and each district's fan count is exponentially increasing with its number. Therefore, our goal is to retain the highest-numbered districts while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Greedy Removal**: To maximize the sum of fans, we should prioritize removing districts with the smallest numbers. However, we must ensure that the remaining districts remain connected.\n3. **Leaf Nodes**: Start by identifying leaf nodes (nodes with degree 1) since removing them does not disconnect the tree. Use a min-heap to always remove the smallest numbered leaf node first, ensuring that we remove the least valuable nodes while maintaining connectivity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport heapq\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    k = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        b = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        adj[a].append(b)\n        adj[b].append(a)\n\n    degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        degree[i] = len(adj[i])\n\n    heap = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if degree[i] == 1:\n            heapq.heappush(heap, i)\n\n    removed = [False] * (n + 1)\n    result = []\n\n    while len(result) < k:\n        u = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if removed[u]:\n            continue\n        removed[u] = True\n        result.append(u)\n        for v in adj[u]:\n            if not removed[v]:\n                degree[v] -= 1\n                if degree[v] == 1:\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, v)\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(result))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into an adjacency list representing the tree structure.\n2. **Degree Calculation**: Calculate the degree of each node to identify initial leaf nodes.\n3. **Min-Heap for Leaves**: Use a min-heap to efficiently retrieve the smallest numbered leaf node. This ensures we remove the least valuable nodes first.\n4. **Iterative Removal**: Continuously remove the smallest leaf node, update the degrees of its neighbors, and add new leaves to the heap if their degree becomes 1 after removal.\n5. **Result Formatting**: After removing `k` nodes, sort the result and print them in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that the remaining districts form a connected subtree while maximizing the total number of fans by prioritizing the removal of the least valuable nodes. The use of a min-heap ensures efficient retrieval of the smallest leaf nodes, maintaining an overall time complexity of O(n log n).",
