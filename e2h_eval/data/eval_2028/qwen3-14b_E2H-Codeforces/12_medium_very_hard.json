The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks have to be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The explanation is that she moves 1→2→3 (time 2), then from 3 to 4→1→2 (time 3) to get to 2 for the second task, then from 2→3 (time 1). Total is 2+3+1 = 6? Wait, but how does that add up?\n\nWait, the initial position is house 1. Let's break down the steps:\n\nTask 1 is at 3. So she needs to go from 1 to 3. Since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise. The distance between 1 and 3 is 2 steps (1→2→3). Then task 2 is at 2. But she's currently at 3. To get to 2, since it's clockwise, she has to go all the way around. From 3 to 4 (1 step), then 4→1 (another), then 1→2 (another). That's 3 steps. Then task 3 is at 3 again. She's at 2, so moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the problem is to compute the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks, where each distance is calculated as the minimal steps needed to move clockwise from the current position to the next task's house.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nLet me think: for each task in order, we need to calculate the distance from the previous position to the current task's house, moving clockwise. Then accumulate all these distances.\n\nThe initial position is 1. Then for each task a_i, we compute the distance from the previous position (prev_pos) to a_i. Then update prev_pos to a_i.\n\nSo the main thing is to compute the distance between two points on a ringroad. Let's think about how to calculate that.\n\nSuppose current position is x, and target is y. Since movement is clockwise, the distance is (y - x) mod n if y >=x? No, wait. For example, if x is 3 and y is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - x + y) steps. Because from 3 to 4 to ... to n, then 1, 2. So the number of steps is (n - x) + y. Which is (y - x + n) % n? Wait, for example, when x=3, y=2, n=4: (2-3 +4) = 3. Which is correct. If x is 1 and y is 3, then (3-1) = 2 steps. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula for the distance between x and y (clockwise) is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x + n). Or more concisely, (y - x + n) % n. But since in Python, modulo can handle negative numbers, but perhaps we can compute it as (y - x) % n. Wait, let's see: if x=3, y=2, n=4. (2-3) = -1. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the distance between x and y is (y - x) % n. But wait, in the case where x=3 and y=3, the distance is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo for each consecutive pair of tasks, we compute the distance between previous position and current a_i, and add that to the total.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given in the order that they must be done. So for the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m, we need to process them in order, and for each step from a_{i-1} to a_i, compute the distance.\n\nBut what about the initial position? The initial position is 1. So for the first task a_1, the distance is (a_1 - 1) mod n? Or (a_1 - 1) if a_1 >=1, else (a_1 -1 +n). But since a_1 is between 1 and n, inclusive, then (a_1 -1) is correct. Wait, no. For example, if a_1 is 1, then distance is 0. Which is correct. If a_1 is 2, then 1 step. So yes, the initial step is (a_1 - 1) mod n. But since a_1 is between 1 and n, (a_1 -1) is between 0 and n-1, so mod n is same as (a_1 -1).\n\nBut for subsequent steps, the previous position is a_{i-1}, and the current is a_i. So the distance is (a_i - prev_pos) mod n. But wait, for example, if prev_pos is 3, a_i is 2, n=4. Then (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize total_time = 0\n\nprev_pos = 1\n\nfor each ai in the list a:\n\n    distance = (ai - prev_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += distance\n\n    prev_pos = ai\n\nreturn total_time\n\nWait, but let's test this against the first example.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3, 2, 3]\n\nprev_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) mod 4 = 2 → total_time is 2. prev_pos is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod 4 = -1 mod4 = 3 → total_time is 2+3=5. prev_pos is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1 → total_time 5+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example given is input 4 3\\n2 3 3. Output is 2.\n\nLet's compute that.\n\nprev_pos is 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: (2-1) mod4 = 1 → total 1. prev is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1 → total 2. prev is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-3) mod4=0 → total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward: read n and m, then read the list of a's. Then iterate through the list, keeping track of previous position, and adding the (current - previous) mod n to the total.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operator can return negative results? Wait, no. Wait, in Python, (-1) % 4 is 3, which is correct. So (ai - prev_pos) can be negative, but mod n will give the correct distance.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list of a's (as integers).\n\nInitialize total_time = 0\n\nprev = 1\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    diff = (num - prev) % n\n\n    total_time += diff\n\n    prev = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nBut wait, let me check some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then the distance is (1-1) mod 2 = 0 → total is 0. Correct.\n\nEdge case 2: n=2, m=1, a=[2]. (2-1) mod 2 = 1 → total is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: when the tasks are in the same house. Like a = [3,3,3]. Then the total time is (3-1) mod n + 0 + 0. So for n=4, it's 2 + 0 + 0 = 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: when the tasks are in reverse order. For example, n=5, m=2, a = [5, 1]. So first step: 5-1=4 mod5 is 4. Then next step: 1-5 mod5 is (1-5) = -4 mod5 is 1. So total is 4+1=5. Which makes sense: moving from 1 to 5 (4 steps), then from 5 to 1 (1 step). Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. The first line has n and m, the second line has m integers.\n\nBut in the sample input given, there are two examples. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user provided:\n\nInput:\n\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\nOutput:\n\n['6', '2']\n\nBut that's probably for two test cases. However, in the problem statement, the input is a single test case. So perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases for testing, but the actual code needs to read one input.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line containing n and m, and the second line containing m integers. So the code needs to read from stdin, which for the problem's purposes is a single test case.\n\nSo the code needs to read two lines. The first line is n and m. The second line is m integers.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the first line as n and m. Then read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading from stdin, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but splitting by whitespace is okay.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead the first line, split into two integers n and m.\n\nRead the second line, split into m integers, which is the list a.\n\nThen process as per the algorithm above.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal = 0\n\nprev = 1\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    total += (num - prev) % n\n\n    prev = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what about when m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is at least 1? Let me check the input constraints.\n\nThe input says m is between 1 and 1e5. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 1e5, 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5). So m can be 1. So the code handles m=0? Well, no, but the problem says m is at least 1. So the code is okay.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3 → code gives 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3 → code gives (2-1) =1, (3-2)=1, (3-3)=0 → total 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. Then:\n\nFirst step: (2-1) mod 2 = 1. total is 1. prev is 2.\n\nSecond step: (1-2) mod 2 = -1 mod 2 = 1. total is 2. So output is 2. Which is correct: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). Total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut wait, why is the problem considered very hard? Maybe because of some edge cases?\n\nWait, what if the same house is repeated multiple times? Like a = [1,1,1]. Then the code adds (1-1) mod n, then 0, then 0. So total is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: when the previous position is same as current. So no time added.\n\nAnother possible edge case is when n is 1e5 and m is 1e5. But the code is O(m), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes one unit of time.\n2. **Circular Distance Calculation**: The distance between two houses on a circular road can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. For houses `x` and `y`, the clockwise distance is `(y - x) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task in sequence, calculate the distance from the current position to the target house of the task and accumulate the total time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ntotal_time = 0\nprev_pos = 1\n\nfor num in a:\n    diff = (num - prev_pos) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    prev_pos = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line contains the list of houses where each task needs to be completed.\n2. **Initialization**: Start from house 1, which is Xenia's initial position.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each task, compute the clockwise distance from the current position to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Sum up the distances for all tasks to get the total time required.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required time in linear time, O(m), making it suitable even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
