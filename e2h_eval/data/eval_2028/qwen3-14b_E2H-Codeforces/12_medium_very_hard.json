The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem is about calculating the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. Let me think through the details.\n\nSo, the setup is that there are n houses arranged in a circle. Xenia starts at house 1. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The movement between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. The goal is to find the total minimum time required to complete all tasks.\n\nHmm. The key here is to model the movement between the tasks. Since the tasks must be done in order, each task depends on the previous ones. So for each task, we need to calculate the time taken to get from the previous task's location to the current one, considering the circular arrangement.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the movement between two points on a ringroad? Let's think. Suppose Xenia is currently at position prev, and needs to move to position curr. Since the movement is clockwise, the time taken is (curr - prev) mod n if curr >= prev? Or wait, no. Because if prev is 3 and curr is 2, then moving clockwise would require going all the way around. For example, if n=4, moving from 3 to 2 would take 3 steps: 3→4→1→2. So the formula for the time between prev and curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr + n - prev). But that's equivalent to (curr - prev + n) % n. Wait, no. Because if curr is less than prev, then (curr - prev) is negative. Adding n and taking mod n would give the correct number of steps. For example, when prev is 3 and curr is 2, (2-3 +4) = 3, which is correct. So yes, the time between prev and curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Which can be written as (curr - prev + n) % n. Wait, but if curr is equal to prev, then the time is zero. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time. So moving from 1 to 2 is 1 step, 1 to 3 is 2 steps, etc. So for any two positions, the time to move from prev to curr is (curr - prev) mod n if moving clockwise. But since the movement is only allowed clockwise, that's the correct way.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nWe need to process the tasks in order, keeping track of Xenia's current position. For each task, we calculate the time needed to move from the current position to the new position (a_i), add that to the total time, and update the current position.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given as a list a_1 to a_m. But the note says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then moving time between them is zero. So the order of processing is important.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nInitialize current position as 1 (since she starts there). Total time is 0.\n\nFor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   calculate the time needed to move from current position to a_i, add that to total time.\n\n   update current position to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that she must complete all tasks with numbers less than i before doing task i. So the order of the tasks is fixed. So the list a_1 to a_m is the order in which the tasks must be done. So even if a_i is same as a_{i-1}, we still have to process it, but movement time is zero.\n\nSo for example, in the second example input:\n\nInput is 4 3 and the list is 2 3 3.\n\nSo initial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2. Moving from 1 to 2 takes 1 step. Total time is 1. Current position is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3. Moving from 2 to 3 takes 1 step. Total is 2. Current position is 3.\n\nThird task is 3. No movement needed. Total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes. So the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to process each task in order, and for each, compute the movement from the previous position to the current task's position, adding that to the total.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's (m elements).\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list:\n\n   compute delta = (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos else (a_i - current_pos + n)\n\n   but wait, that's equivalent to (a_i - current_pos) % n ?\n\nWait, no. Because (a_i - current_pos) can be negative. Let's take an example where current_pos is 3, a_i is 2, n=4.\n\n(2 - 3) = -1. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, (a_i - current_pos) % n gives the correct number of steps. But wait, in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values if the numerator is negative. Wait, no. Wait in Python, (-1) % 4 is 3, which is correct. So yes, (a_i - current_pos) % n gives the correct steps.\n\nBut wait, let me check:\n\ncurrent_pos is 3, a_i is 2. So (2 - 3) is -1. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: current_pos is 4, a_i is 1. (1-4) is -3 mod 4 is 1. Which is correct (moving from 4 to 1 is 1 step).\n\nYes. So the formula for steps between current_pos and a_i is (a_i - current_pos) % n.\n\nBut wait, what if a_i is equal to current_pos? Then the difference is zero, mod n is zero. So steps is zero. Correct.\n\nSo, in code, for each a_i in the list:\n\nsteps = (a_i - current_pos) % n\n\ntotal_time += steps\n\ncurrent_pos = a_i\n\nBut wait, why not? Because the movement is done in the clockwise direction. So that's correct.\n\nSo for the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 4 3, and the list is 3 2 3.\n\nLet's walk through:\n\nInitial current_pos = 1.\n\nFirst task is 3.\n\nsteps = (3 - 1) mod 4 = 2 mod4 = 2. So total_time is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. steps = (2 - 3) mod4 = (-1) mod4 = 3. So total_time becomes 2+3=5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. steps = (3-2) mod4 = 1. total_time becomes 5+1=6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward. Now, considering that n and m can be up to 1e5, which is manageable in Python with O(m) time.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the list of m integers.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as two lines. First line is n and m. Second line is m integers.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nSo in code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen, current_pos = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nfor each num in a:\n\n    steps = (num - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current_pos = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nWait, but wait. Let me test the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2: 4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_pos = 1.\n\nFirst num is 2: steps = (2-1) mod4 = 1. total_time is 1. current_pos is 2.\n\nSecond num is 3: (3-2) mod4=1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-3) mod4=0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Correct.\n\nYes. So the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about when the list is empty? Well, m is at least 1? No, the constraints say m is 1<=m<=1e5. So m can be 1. So the code handles that.\n\nWhat about when the a_i is 1, and current_pos is 1? Then steps is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[1, 2]. Steps:\n\ncurrent_pos is 1. first task is 1: steps (1-1) mod2=0. total is 0. current is 1. Second task is 2: (2-1) mod2=1. total is 1. So output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. Steps:\n\ncurrent is 1. first task is 2: steps (2-1) mod2=1. total is 1. current is 2. Second task is 1: (1-2) mod2= ( -1 ) mod2= 1. total is 2. Which is correct. Because moving from 2 to 1 is 1 step (clockwise).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1, total_time as 0.\n\nLoop over each element in the list:\n\n   compute steps as (num - current_pos) % n\n\n   add to total_time\n\n   update current_pos.\n\nFinally, print total_time.\n\nYes. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, let me check the sample input again.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\nProcessing steps:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst step: 3-1=2 mod4 is 2. total is 2.\n\ncurrent_pos is 3.\n\nSecond step: 2-3 = -1 mod4 is 3. total is 5.\n\ncurrent_pos is 2.\n\nThird step: 3-2=1 mod4 is 1. total is 6. Correct.\n\nSample output is 6. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nSample 2: n=4, m=3, a = [2,3,3]. Output is 2. As discussed.\n\nSo the code works for these.\n\nNow, what about when a_i is 1, but current_pos is n?\n\nLike n=4, current_pos is 4, a_i is 1. steps is (1-4) mod4 = (-3) mod4 = 1. Which is correct: moving from 4 to 1 is 1 step.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operation for negative numbers returns a positive result, so that's correct.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntime = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    time += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(time)\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, let me test the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nThe code would process as follows:\n\ncurrent = 1.\n\nFirst num is 3: (3-1) = 2 mod4 is 2. time is 2.\n\ncurrent is 3.\n\nSecond num is 2: (2-3) = -1 mod4 is 3. time is 5.\n\ncurrent is 2.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-2) = 1 mod4 is 1. time is 6. Output is 6. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3.\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst num is 2: (2-1)=1 mod4=1. time is 1.\n\ncurrent is 2.\n\nSecond num is 3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. time is 2.\n\ncurrent is 3.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-3)=0. time remains 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nYes. So the code works.\n\nNow, what about when the list is empty? Well, according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nAnother edge case: m=1, a=[1]. Then time is (1-1) modn = 0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: m=1, a=[n]. Then steps is (n -1) modn = n-1. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is efficiently calculating the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes one unit of time. Since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise from a house to another might involve wrapping around the end of the list.\n2. **Modulo Operation for Circular Movement**: The time to move from one house to another can be calculated using modulo arithmetic. For two positions `current` and `target`, the time taken to move from `current` to `target` clockwise is `(target - current) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: We iterate through each task, updating the total time based on the movement from the current position to the target position of the current task, then update the current position to the target position for the next iteration.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n    total_time += delta\n    current = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line reads the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line reads the list of house numbers where each task must be completed.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current house to the target house using modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad. Accumulate this time into the total and update the current position to the target house.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the accumulated total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modulo operations to handle circular movements, resulting in an optimal O(m) time complexity.",
