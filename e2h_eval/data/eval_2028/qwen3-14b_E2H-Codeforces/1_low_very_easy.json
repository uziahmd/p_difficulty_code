    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the number of cells that are gilded on a plate. The plate is divided into w rows and h columns. We need to add k rings of gilding. Each ring is placed such that the first is along the edge, the second two cells away, etc. Each ring is one cell thick. The i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, right. Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so for each ring, the next one is 2 steps in each direction. So for the first ring, the rectangle is the original size. Then for the second ring, it's (w-4) by (h-4), since each ring adds 2 on each side. Wait, no. Let me think again. The first ring is the outermost layer, which is the perimeter of the original rectangle. Then the second ring is two cells in from the edge. So for that, the rectangle would be (w - 4) by (h - 4), because you subtract 2 from each side (left and right, top and bottom). So for each ring i, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1))? Or wait, maybe the formula is (w - 2*(i-1)*2) ? No, because each ring is 2 steps in from the previous. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (original width minus 2*(i-1)*2) ?\n\nWait, the problem statement says that the i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side. For example, the first ring (i=1) is the original rectangle. The second ring (i=2) is the rectangle that's 2 cells in from the edges, which would have width w - 2*2 = w -4, and similarly for height. So the formula is correct.\n\nNow, the number of cells in each ring is the perimeter of that rectangle. But wait, how to calculate the perimeter? For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter in terms of cells is 2*(W + H - 2). Because the perimeter is (W * 2) + (H * 2) - 4 (since the corners are counted twice). Alternatively, for a rectangle, the number of cells in the border is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because each side contributes (width or height) but subtracting the corners which are counted twice.\n\nSo for each ring i, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that for each i, the rectangle is valid. For example, when i increases, the dimensions must be at least 1. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's possible. Because the problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense, since for a 3x3 plate, you can have only one ring. For a 7x7 plate, min is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2, so k can be up to 2. Because 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4=3, which is okay. For the third ring, 7-4*(3-1) = 7-8= -1, which is invalid. So the input constraints ensure that for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions are valid.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum them all.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nAdd perimeter to total.\n\nReturn total.\n\nWait, let's check the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1.\n\ncurrent_w = 3, current_h =3.\n\nperimeter is 2*(3 +3 -2) = 2*4=8.
