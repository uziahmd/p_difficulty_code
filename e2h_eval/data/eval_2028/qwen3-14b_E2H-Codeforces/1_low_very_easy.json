The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, for the i-th ring, right?\n\nSo for each ring from 1 to k, I need to calculate the perimeter of that rectangle and sum them all. But wait, how does the perimeter calculation work here? Because for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter in terms of cells would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes (length) cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a rectangle that's 3x3: the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (the four corners counted twice) → 8, which matches the first example where input is 3 3 1, output is 8.\n\nYes, so the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle with width W and height H is 2*(W + H - 2). Because for each of the two directions, you have (W) cells on top and bottom, and (H-2) cells on the sides (since the corners are already counted). Or maybe another way: the total number of cells in the border is (W * 2) + (H-2)*2. Which simplifies to 2*(W + H - 2). Right.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). But wait, for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1))? Let me check the example.\n\nTake the third example input: 7 9 2. The output is 40.\n\nLet's compute for each ring:\n\nFirst ring (i=1): the rectangle is 7x9. The perimeter is 2*(7 + 9 - 2) = 2*(14) = 28. Then the second ring (i=2): the rectangle is 7-4*(1) = 3, 9-4*(1) = 5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3 +5 -2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter for the current dimensions, and sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, what's the condition for when the rings can be formed? The problem says that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). So for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions after subtracting 4*(i-1) from both w and h must be at least 1. Because otherwise, the rectangle would not exist. But since the input k is constrained properly, we don't have to worry about that. So the code can safely process each ring.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nFor each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nadd this to total.\n\nReturn total.\n\nYes.\n\nSo for example, the first sample input is 3 3 1. current_w =3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input is 7 9 1. The perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*14=28. Which matches the second sample.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input, which is three integers. The input is given as a single line with three integers. So in Python, we can read them via input().split(), convert to integers.\n\nThen compute the sum as described.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nLoop i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\ntotal += perimeter\n\nPrint total.\n\nYes.\n\nWait, but what if the current_w or",
