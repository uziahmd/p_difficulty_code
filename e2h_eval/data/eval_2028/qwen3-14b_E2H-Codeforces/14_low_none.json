He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the trailing zero count is exactly m. But how?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros in n!. This function is non-decreasing as n increases. For example, when n increases by 1, f(n) either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. Wait, no. Because when n is a multiple of 5, adding 1 to n would add at least one 5. But if n is a multiple of higher powers of 5, like 25, then adding 1 would add more. Wait, no. Let me think again. For example, when n increases from 24 to 25, the count increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So f(24) = 4 (24/5=4.8 → 4, 24/25=0.96 → 0. Total 4). f(25) = 6 (25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6). So when you go from 24 to 25, the count increases by 2. So the function f(n) is non-decreasing but can have jumps of more than 1. \n\nThis means that for some m, there may be no n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. For example, if m is between f(n) and f(n+1) where the jump is more than 1. For example, between 4 and 6, m=5 would have no solution. So for such m, the answer is zero.\n\nBut the problem says that for the given m, we have to find the number of n's that have exactly m trailing zeros. So how do I find those n's?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that f(n) = m. Then check if there are other n's that also have f(n) = m. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find all n where f(n) = m. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, the set of n's with f(n)=m would form a contiguous range. But wait, because when you have a jump of more than 1, there could be gaps. For example, if m is 5, and suppose there's no n with f(n) =5. So the answer would be zero.\n\nSo first, I need to find the possible n's where f(n) equals m. How?\n\nLet me think of binary search. For example, to find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. Similarly, find the largest n such that f(n) <= m. But perhaps that's not directly helpful.\n\nWait, here's a plan:\n\nFor a given m, find the lower and upper bounds of n where f(n) = m. For example, if there exists n such that f(n) = m, then there must be a range of consecutive numbers where f(n) equals m. However, since f(n) can jump by more than 1, there may be cases where no such n exists. For example, when m is between f(n) and f(n+1) where f(n+1) - f(n) > 1.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- Find the minimal n where f(n) = m. If there's no such n, return 0.\n\n- Then, find the maximal n where f(n) = m. Then all numbers between min and max would be valid. The count is max - min + 1.\n\nBut how to find these min and max?\n\nAlternatively, let's think: For each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Wait, no. Wait, the example given for m=1",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the problem of finding the number of positive integers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros, we can use a combination of binary search and mathematical analysis of the trailing zero count function.\n\n---\n\n### **Understanding Trailing Zeros in Factorials**\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because every multiple of 5 contributes at least one 5, and multiples of 25 contribute two, and so on.\n\nThe formula for counting trailing zeros in `n!` is:\n$$\nf(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n$$\n\nThis function is non-decreasing. So for a given `m`, we are looking for all `n` such that:\n$$\nf(n) = m\n$$\n\nHowever, due to the nature of this function, there may be no such `n` (e.g., if `m` lies between jumps in the function), or there could be multiple values of `n` that satisfy the condition.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach to Solve the Problem**\n\n1. **Binary Search for Lower Bound:**\n   - Find the smallest `n` such that `f(n) = m`.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Upper Bound:**\n   - Find the largest `n` such that `f(n) = m`.\n\n3. **Check Validity:**\n   - If no such `n` exists (i.e., `f(n)` never equals `m`), output `0`.\n   - Otherwise, the range `[low, high]` contains all such `n` values, and the count is `high - low + 1`.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Implementation**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_values(m):\n    # Binary search to find the lower bound\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    left = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        tz = trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if tz == m:\n            left = mid\n            high = mid - 1\n        elif tz < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    if left == -1:\n        return [0]\n\n    # Binary search to find the upper bound\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * m\n    right = -1\n    while low <= high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        tz = trailing_zeros(mid)\n        if tz == m:\n            right = mid\n            low = mid + 1\n        elif tz < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid - 1\n\n    if left == -1 or right == -1:\n        return [0]\n\n    result = list(range(left, right + 1))\n    return [len(result)] + result\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    m = int(input)\n    res = find_values(m)\n    print(res[0])\n    if res[0] > 0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, res[1:])))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Explanation of Key Parts**\n\n- **`trailing_zeros(n)`**: Computes the number of trailing zeros in `n!`.\n- **Binary Search**:\n  - Used twice: once to find the first `n` where `f(n) = m`, and again to find the last such `n`.\n- **Edge Cases**:\n  - If no such `n` is found (`left == -1`), the result is `[0]`.\n  - The result is printed in the required format: first the count, then the sorted list of valid `n`s.\n\n---\n\n### **Example Output for Input `1`**\n\n- The function returns `[5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` which corresponds to the five values of `n` whose factorial has exactly 1 trailing zero.\n\nThis solution is efficient and works within the constraints of `m ≤ 100,000`.",
