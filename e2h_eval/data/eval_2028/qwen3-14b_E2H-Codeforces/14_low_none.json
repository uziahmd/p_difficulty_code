He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find such n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's. Let's think about the function f(n) which gives the number of trailing zeros. This function is non-decreasing as n increases. Because adding a higher number can't decrease the count of 5s.\n\nSo for example, when n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases. So for a given m, there could be a range of n's where f(n) equals m. But how many?\n\nWait, but sometimes there's no n that gives exactly m zeros. Like for m=5, maybe there's a gap. Wait, no. Wait, for example, let's see. Let's take m=5. Let's compute for n=24: 24/5=4, 24/25=0. Total is 4. For n=25, it's 25/5=5, 25/25=1, 25/125=0. Total is 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where the count is 5. So for m=5, the answer would be zero.\n\nBut in the sample input, when m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check. For 5! it's 120 (1 zero). For 6! it's 720 (1 zero). Similarly up to 9! which is 362880 (still one zero). Then 10! adds another 5, so 2 zeros. So for m=1, there are 5 numbers. So the idea is that for some m, there's a range of n's that give exactly m zeros. But for others, there's none.\n\nSo the approach is: find all n where f(n) = m. How to find them?\n\nThe key is to find the lower and upper bounds of n where f(n) equals m. But how?\n\nFirst, we can find the minimum n such that f(n) = m. Then check if there exists such n. If not, output zero. Otherwise, find the maximum n where f(n) = m. Then all numbers between min and max (inclusive) would be the answers.\n\nBut how to find these min and max?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the smallest n where f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the smallest n where f(n) = m, and then find the largest n where f(n) = m. The numbers between them would be the possible answers.\n\nWait, but how do we find those numbers?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Check if f(low) is equal to m. If not, then there's no solution.\n\n3. Else, find the minimal n such that f(n) >= m+1. Let's call this high. Then the numbers from low to high-1 would be the ones where f(n) equals m.\n\nBut wait, because for example, if m is 1, then the minimal n where f(n) >=1 is 5. Then the minimal n where f(n) >=2 is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are the ones with exactly 1 zero. Which is 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the number of solutions is high - low. But only if f(low) == m. Otherwise, zero.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor a given m, find the lower bound (the first n where f(n) >=m) and upper bound (the first n where f(n) >=m+1). Then check if the lower bound's f(n) is m. If yes,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. Additionally, we must return these integers in increasing order.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is given by the formula:\n$$\nf(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\ldots\n$$\nThis function is **non-decreasing** as $ n $ increases.\n\nFor a given $ m $, we are interested in finding all $ n $ such that $ f(n) = m $. These values of $ n $ will form a contiguous range if they exist at all.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Binary Search for Bounds**:\n   - Use binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that $ f(n) \\geq m $ (call it `low`).\n   - Then find the smallest $ n $ such that $ f(n) \\geq m+1 $ (call it `high`).\n   - If $ f(low) \\neq m $, then there is no $ n $ such that $ f(n) = m $, and the answer is zero.\n   - Otherwise, all integers from `low` to `high - 1` have exactly $ m $ trailing zeros.\n\n2. **Edge Case Handling**:\n   - For $ m = 0 $, the only valid $ n $ is 1, since $ 1! = 1 $ has 0 trailing zeros.\n   - For values of $ m $ where no $ n $ exists with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, return an empty list.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_first_n_with_at_least(m):\n    low, high = 0, 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n\ndef solve():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    m = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if m == 0:\n        print(1)\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    low = find_first_n_with_at_least(m)\n    if count_trailing_zeros(low) != m:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    high = find_first_n_with_at_least(m + 1)\n    result = list(range(low, high))\n    print(len(result))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    solve()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Execution\n\n**Input:**\n```\n1\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n5\n5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- $ 5! = 120 $, $ 6! = 720 $, ..., $ 9! = 362880 $ all end with exactly one trailing zero.\n\n**Input:**\n```\n5\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n0\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- There is no $ n $ such that $ n! $ ends with exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity\n\n- The function `count_trailing_zeros` runs in $ O(\\log n) $ time.\n- Binary search is used twice, each time in $ O(\\log n) $, making the overall complexity efficient enough for $ m \\leq 100000 $.\n\nThis solution handles all edge cases efficiently and correctly.",
