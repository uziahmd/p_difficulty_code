The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each gets pinched, which is the number of times they lose a round.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. Each character is R, S, or P. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what move each player makes. Then check who wins, and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key here is to find patterns or cycles that repeat, so that we can compute the number of losses in each cycle and multiply by the number of cycles, plus the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think: For each round, the move of Nikephoros (A) is determined by the index modulo m, where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus (B), it's index modulo k. So the combination of their moves depends on (i mod m, i mod k). Since m and k are up to 1000, the total possible combinations of (i mod m, i mod k) is m*k. Which for 1000 each is 1e6. That's manageable.\n\nSo the idea is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let's call that LCM. Because after LCM rounds, the pattern of moves for both players will repeat. So the entire sequence of moves for both players repeats every LCM rounds. Therefore, the number of losses in each LCM-length block can be calculated once, then multiplied by the number of full blocks in n rounds, and then add the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period_length.\n\n2. For each round from 0 to period_length - 1, compute the moves of A and B, determine who wins, and count the number of losses for each player in this period.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full periods in n rounds is total_periods = n // period_length.\n\n4. The remaining rounds are remainder = n % period_length.\n\n5. The total losses for each player would be total_periods * (losses_in_period) + losses_in_remainder_rounds.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing for each possible round in the period, how many times each player loses, then multiply by the number of periods and add the remainder.\n\nBut how to compute the losses in the period and in the remainder?\n\nLet me think about how to compute the losses for each round in the period. For each i in 0 to period_length - 1:\n\n- For Nikephoros's move: A[i % m]\n\n- For Polycarpus's move: B[i % k]\n\nThen, compare these two moves and determine who wins. For each such round, increment the counts for the loser.\n\nSo for the entire period, we can precompute the number of times Nikephoros loses (count_a) and Polycarpus loses (count_b).\n\nOnce we have count_a and count_b per period, then total for all full periods is total_periods * count_a and total_periods * count_b.\n\nThen, for the remaining remainder rounds, we can loop from 0 to remainder - 1, compute the moves for each round, and add the losses accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute the period_length? Well, LCM(m, k) can be computed using the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So first compute GCD of m and k.\n\nBut for that, I need to compute GCD. Let's think about how to compute GCD in Python. Well, there's math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, that's fine.\n\nWait, but the LCM could be very large. For example, if m and k are 1000 each, then LCM is 1e6. Which is manageable. Because even if m and k are 1000, the maximum period_length is 1e6. So for each period_length, we can process all the rounds in O(period_length) time. Which is acceptable for 1e6 steps.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period_length = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each of the period_length rounds, the number of losses for each player in that period.\n\nThen, compute total_periods = n // period_length.\n\nremainder = n % period",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over a large number of rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to handle up to 2 billion rounds efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Cyclic Nature**: Both players use cyclic sequences for their moves. This means their move sequences repeat after a certain number of rounds. The key insight is that the combined sequence of moves for both players will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their individual sequences.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences. This gives us the period after which the combined move sequences repeat.\n3. **Simulate One Period**: For each round within one period, determine the moves of both players and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Scale Up**: Use the counts from one period to compute the total losses over all full periods and then handle any remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    gcd = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = m * k // gcd\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one period\n    count_a = 0  # Nikephoros's losses\n    count_b = 0  # Polycarpus's losses\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        # Determine the winner\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n             (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n             (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            count_b += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            count_a += 1\n    \n    total_periods = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    total_a = total_periods * count_a\n    total_b = total_periods * count_b\n    \n    # Process the remaining rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        elif (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n             (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n             (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            total_b += 1\n        else:\n            total_a += 1\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is calculated to determine the period after which the move sequences repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within one period, we determine the moves of both players and count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Scaling Up**: Using the counts from one period, we calculate the total losses for all full periods. Any remaining rounds after the full periods are processed separately to ensure accuracy.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the repeating nature of the sequences, ensuring that we do not simulate each round individually but instead use mathematical properties to scale the results.",
