The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to calculate the number of times each loses over n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round directly isn't feasible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Nikephoros uses sequence A, which repeats cyclically. Similarly for Polycarpus with sequence B. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find out what move each makes, then determine who wins, and count the losses.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, iterating through each round is impossible. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that can be calculated once and then multiplied.\n\nLet me think: The moves for each player are periodic. For Nikephoros, the sequence repeats every m moves, and for Polycarpus every k moves. So the combined pattern of their moves would repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so their moves will repeat.\n\nSo the idea is to find the number of rounds in one full cycle (let's call it cycle_length = LCM(m, k)), and compute how many full cycles there are in n rounds, and then the remaining rounds.\n\nFor each full cycle, we can precompute how many times Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses. Then multiply by the number of full cycles. Then handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length.\n\n2. For each round in the cycle (total of cycle_length rounds), compute the moves for both players, determine the outcome, and accumulate the number of losses for each.\n\n3. The total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n\n4. The remaining rounds are rem = n % cycle_length.\n\n5. Multiply the per-cycle losses by total_cycles, then add the losses from the first rem rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut how to compute the per-cycle losses?\n\nYes, but for each round in the cycle, we need to find the move of A and B. For the i-th round (starting from 0?), the move of A is A[i % m], and B is B[i % k]. So for each i from 0 to cycle_length-1, we can compute the moves.\n\nBut since cycle_length could be up to LCM(1000, 1000) = 1,000,000 (since m and k are up to 1000). So for each cycle_length, which is up to 1e6, we can process all rounds in O(cycle_length) time. Which is acceptable, since 1e6 is manageable even for Python.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute the per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly (number of losses for each in one cycle).\n\nThen total_nik = per_cycle_nik * total_cycles + ... (the remaining part)\n\nSame for total_poly.\n\nNow, how to compute the per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly?\n\nFor each i in 0 to cycle_length -1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\ndetermine who wins. For each such pair, if a beats b, then Nikephoros wins, so Poly loses. If b beats a, then Nikephoros loses. If same, nothing.\n\nSo for each pair, we can check the outcome.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nFirst, read n, A, B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM(m, k). To compute LCM, we can use the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but it returns positive integers, and for Python 3.5+ it's available. However, since m and k are positive, no problem.\n\nBut wait, in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, no problem.\n\nOnce we have the LCM, then:\n\nCompute the number of full cycles and remainder.\n\nBut for the full cycles, we can calculate the per_cycle counts once.\n\nNow, for the per_cycle counts, we can loop through 0 to cycle_length-1, and for each step, get the moves and count.\n\nBut how to compute the outcome between a and b?\n\nWe can have a helper function, which takes a and b, and returns which player wins. For example:\n\nif a == b: return 0 (draw)\n\nelse:\n\nif (a is 'R' and b is 'S') or (a is 'S' and b is 'P') or (",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over a large number of rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic strategy. The challenge is to efficiently compute the result without simulating each round individually due to the potentially very large number of rounds.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every `k` rounds.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The combined pattern of moves from both players will repeat every `LCM(m, k)` rounds, where LCM is the least common multiple of `m` and `k`. This is because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles.\n3. **Precompute Outcomes**: Calculate the number of losses for each player over one full cycle of `LCM(m, k)` rounds. This allows us to handle large numbers of rounds efficiently by leveraging the periodicity.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Compute the number of full cycles within the given number of rounds and the remaining rounds after these full cycles. Use the precomputed outcomes for full cycles and handle the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef get_outcome(a, b):\n    if a == b:\n        return (0, 0)\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        return (0, 1)  # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n    else:\n        return (1, 0)  # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    cycle_length = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one cycle\n    nik_cycle = 0\n    poly_cycle = 0\n    \n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        res = get_outcome(a, b)\n        nik_cycle += res[0]\n        poly_cycle += res[1]\n    \n    total_cycles = n // cycle_length\n    remainder = n % cycle_length\n    \n    # Compute total from full cycles\n    total_nik = nik_cycle * total_cycles\n    total_poly = poly_cycle * total_cycles\n    \n    # Compute from remainder rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        res = get_outcome(a, b)\n        total_nik += res[0]\n        total_poly += res[1]\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the move sequences is calculated to determine the length of one full combined cycle.\n3. **Outcome Precomputation**: For each round within one full cycle, the outcome of the game is determined and the number of losses for each player is counted.\n4. **Handling Full Cycles**: The number of full cycles within the given number of rounds is computed, and the precomputed losses are multiplied by the number of full cycles.\n5. **Handling Remaining Rounds**: Any remaining rounds after the full cycles are processed individually using the same method as for the full cycle.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle up to 2 billion rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the players' strategies, avoiding the need to simulate each round individually.",
