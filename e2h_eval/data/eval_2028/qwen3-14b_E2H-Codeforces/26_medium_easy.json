Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Oh right, and the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the key condition is x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in order, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest.\n\nWait, the problem says that x is between A and B, y is between B and C (but y is at least B?), and z is between C and D. Wait the condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Oh right, so x can be from A to B, y is from B to C (since B ≤ y ≤ C), and z is from C to D. Also, since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, then x ≤ y. And since y ≤ C and z ≥ C, then y ≤ z. So the order is x ≤ y ≤ z. So the triangle inequality is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], z is in [C, D], and x + y > z.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently? Because if I naively loop through all possible x, y, z, it would be O(B * (C-B+1) * (D - C + 1)) which could be way too big given that D can be up to 5e5. So for example, if all ranges are 5e5, then the product is (5e5)^3 which is 1.25e17 operations. That's way too slow. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about how to compute this efficiently. Let's break down the problem.\n\nFor each possible x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, D] that are less than x + y. But since z must also be ≥ C, the valid z's are in the interval [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. However, if x + y - 1 < C, then there are no valid z's for this x and y. Otherwise, the count is (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1). So for each x and y, we can compute the number of z's that satisfy the triangle condition.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], of (number of z's for that x and y).\n\nBut even this approach would be O(B * (C - B + 1)), which for B and C up to 5e5 could be O( (5e5)^2 ) = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow for Python. So I need to find a way to compute this sum more efficiently.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how to compute for each x and y, the count of z's. Let me first note that for a fixed x and y, the lower bound for z is C, and upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1). So the count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(...) >= C.\n\nBut how can I compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me consider that for each x, I can iterate over y in [B, C], and compute for each y the contribution. But again, that's O(B*(C-B+1)) time. Let's think about the constraints. For example, if B is 5e5 and C is 5e5, then C-B+1 is 1, so it's O(B) time. But if B is 1 and C is 5e5, then it's O(B*(C-B+1)) = O(5e5 * 5e5) = 2.5e11 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo I need to find a mathematical formula or a way to compute the sum for all possible x and y.\n\nLet me think about the variables:\n\nx ranges from A to B.\n\ny ranges from B to C.\n\nFor each x and y, the value s = x + y. The number of valid z's is max(0, min(D, s - 1) - C + 1) if s -1 >= C. Else zero.\n\nSo the count is:\n\nif s - 1 >= C: then the number is (min(D, s-1) - C + 1) = (s - 1 - C + 1) if D >= s -1, else D - C + 1.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nif s - 1 >= C:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D - C + 1, s - 1 - C + 1)) ?\n\nWait, min(D, s-1) - C + 1 = (s-1 - C +1) if D >= s-1, else D - C +1. So that's min(s - 1 - C + 1, D - C + 1) ?\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nLet me denote L = C, U = D. Then for a given s, the valid z's are between L and min(U, s - 1). The count is max(0, min(U, s - 1) - L + 1) if min(U, s-1) >= L.\n\nSo for each x and y, compute s = x + y.\n\nSo the count is:\n\nif s - 1 >= L → s >= L + 1 → x + y >= L + 1.\n\nThen the number is min(U, s-1) - L + 1 = min(U - L + 1, s - 1 - L + 1) = min(U - L + 1, s - L).\n\nSo the count is max(0, min(U - L + 1, s - L)) if s >= L + 1.\n\nBut U - L + 1 is (D - C + 1), which is the total number of z's available. So for s - L >= D - C + 1 → s >= D + C - (D - C + 1) + L? Wait maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me define the count as:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D, s - 1) - C + 1) if s - 1 >= C else 0.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\ncount_z = max(0, min(D - C + 1, (s - 1) - C + 1 )) if s >= C + 1.\n\nBecause min(D, s-1) - C + 1 = min(D - C + 1, (s-1 - C + 1)).\n\nSo (s - 1 - C + 1) = s - C.\n\nThus, count_z is max(0, min(D - C + 1, s - C)) if s >= C + 1.\n\nBut s is x + y. So for each x and y, the count_z is:\n\nif x + y >= C + 1:\n\nthen count_z = min(D - C + 1, x + y - C)\n\nelse:\n\ncount_z = 0\n\nSo the total number of triangles is sum_{x=A}^B sum_{y=B}^C [ min(D - C + 1, x + y - C) ] if x + y >= C + 1 else 0.\n\nNow, how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me denote K = D - C + 1. So the count_z is min(K, x + y - C) if x + y >= C + 1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to computing sum_{x, y} [ min(K, x + y - C) ] where x ranges from A to B, y ranges from B to C, and x + y >= C + 1.\n\nBut how to compute this sum.\n\nLet me think of the variables x and y. Since x can be from A to B, and y from B to C.\n\nBut perhaps I can split the sum into two parts: when x + y - C <= K, which is equivalent to x + y <= C + K. Since K = D - C + 1, C + K = C + D - C + 1 = D + 1. So x + y - C can be up to D + 1 - C. Which is exactly D - C + 1 = K. So min(K, x + y - C) is x + y - C when x + y - C <= K, i.e., x + y <= D + 1. But since z can be up to D, and x + y - 1 needs to be >= z. So for x + y - 1 >= C, but when x + y -1 >= D, then the count is K (since z can be from C to D, which is K numbers). So the min is K in that case.\n\nSo the sum can be written as:\n\nsum_{x, y} [ (x + y - C) if x + y >= C + 1 and x + y <= D + 1 else K if x + y >= C + 1 else 0 ]\n\nBut since x + y can be as high as B + C (since x is up to B, y up to C). But D can be larger than B + C. So for example, if D is very large, then for x + y >= C + 1, the count is K (D - C + 1).\n\nBut how to find the regions where x + y is between C + 1 and D + 1, and where it's above D + 1.\n\nAlternatively, for each x and y, the contribution is:\n\nif x + y <= C: 0\n\nelse if x + y <= D + 1: x + y - C\n\nelse: K\n\nSo the sum can be broken down into three parts, but perhaps two parts.\n\nSo the total sum is:\n\nsum_{x, y} [ max(0, min(x + y - C, K)) ] where x ranges from A to B, y ranges from B to C.\n\nBut how to compute this sum.\n\nLet me think of variables x and y. Let me note that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. Let me denote the lower and upper bounds for x and y.\n\nLet me think about the sum over x and y of max(0, min(x + y - C, K)).\n\nLet me make substitution: for each x, y, let s = x + y.\n\nSo for each x, y, the contribution depends on s.\n\nSo the problem becomes, for all x and y in their ranges, compute the sum of min(s - C, K) if s >= C + 1 else 0.\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the sum as:\n\nsum_{x, y} [ (s - C) if s >= C + 1 and s <= D + 1 else (K if s >= C + 1 else 0) ]\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{s} [ (number of (x, y) pairs with x + y = s) * (contribution for s) ]\n\nSo for each possible s, compute the number of (x, y) pairs that sum to s, multiply by the contribution for s, and sum all these.\n\nBut how to compute this for all s.\n\nBut what is the range of s? The minimum possible s is A + B (since x >= A and y >= B). The maximum possible s is B + C (since x <= B and y <= C).\n\nSo for each s in [A+B, B+C], compute the number of (x,y) pairs that sum to s, and then compute the contribution based on s.\n\nBut even this approach may be feasible, because the range of s is up to 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo for each s, compute:\n\ncount_pairs = number of (x, y) pairs where x ∈ [A, B], y ∈ [B, C], x + y = s.\n\nThen, the contribution for s is:\n\nif s < C + 1 → 0\n\nelse if s <= D + 1 → (s - C) * count_pairs\n\nelse → K * count_pairs\n\nSo the total sum is the sum over all s of these contributions.\n\nSo the problem now breaks down into:\n\n1. Compute for all s in [A+B, B+C], the count_pairs.\n\n2. For each s, compute the contribution based on s and K.\n\nSo how to compute count_pairs for each s.\n\nThis seems like a classic two-sum problem. Let me think about how to compute the number of pairs (x, y) with x in [a, b], y in [c, d], and x + y = s.\n\nIn our case, a = A, b = B, c = B, d = C.\n\nSo for x in [A, B], y in [B, C], x + y = s.\n\nThe number of solutions can be calculated as follows:\n\nFor each x in [A, B], y must be s - x, and y must be between B and C. So for each x, check if s - x is between B and C. So the count_pairs is the number of x in [A, B] such that B ≤ s - x ≤ C → which is equivalent to s - C ≤ x ≤ s - B.\n\nBut x must also be in [A, B].\n\nSo the valid x's are in the intersection of [A, B] and [s - C, s - B].\n\nSo the lower bound for x is max(A, s - C), and upper bound is min(B, s - B).\n\nIf lower bound > upper bound, then there are 0 solutions.\n\nOtherwise, the number of x's is upper - lower + 1.\n\nSo for each s, the count_pairs is max(0, min(B, s - B) - max(A, s - C) + 1).\n\nSo this gives a way to compute count_pairs for each s in O(1) time.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute K = D - C + 1.\n\n- Compute the minimum and maximum possible s values: s_min = A + B, s_max = B + C.\n\n- For each s in s_min to s_max:\n\n   - compute count_pairs as explained above.\n\n   - compute contribution based on s.\n\n- Sum all contributions.\n\nBut how efficient is this?\n\nThe s_min can be as low as 1 + 1 = 2 (if A=1, B=1), and s_max can be up to 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6. So the loop will run up to 1e6 times. Each iteration is O(1), which is acceptable for Python.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4 → A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\ns ranges from 1+2=3 to 2+3=5.\n\ns can be 3,4,5.\n\nFor each s:\n\nCompute count_pairs and contribution.\n\nK = D - C + 1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2.\n\nNow for each s:\n\ns=3:\n\ncount_pairs: x must be in [max(1, 3-3)=max(1,0)=1, min(2, 3-2)=min(2,1)=1]. So lower=1, upper=1. count is 1.\n\nNow, check contribution. s=3 >= C+1 (C is 3, C+1=4?) Wait C is 3, so C + 1 is 4. So s=3 is less than 4. So contribution is 0.\n\nSo contribution is 0.\n\ns=4:\n\ncount_pairs: x in [max(1, 4-3)=max(1,1)=1, min(2, 4-2)=min(2,2)=2]. So lower=1, upper=2. count is 2.\n\ns=4 is equal to C+1 (3+1=4). So contribution is (4 - 3) * 2 = 1*2=2.\n\ns=5:\n\ncount_pairs: x must be in [max(1, 5-3)=2, min(2, 5-2)=3 → min(2,3) is 2. So lower=2, upper=2. count is 1.\n\ns=5 >=4, and s=5 <= D+1 (D=4 → D+1=5). So contribution is (5 -3)*1 = 2*1=2.\n\nAlso, for s=5, since D+1 is 5, so yes.\n\nSo total contribution is 0 + 2 + 2 = 4. Which matches the first sample output of 4. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input '1 2 2 5' → A=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nSo K = 5 - 2 +1 =4.\n\ns ranges from 1+2=3 to 2+2=4.\n\ns=3 and 4.\n\nFor s=3:\n\ncount_pairs: x in [max(1, 3-2)=max(1,1)=1, min(2, 3-2)= min(2,1)=1. So count is 1. s=3 >= C+1? C is 2, C+1 is 3. So yes. contribution is (3 - 2) * 1 = 1*1=1.\n\ns=4:\n\nx must be in [max(1, 4-2)=2, min(2, 4-2)=2. So count is 1. s=4 >=3. Also, D+1 is 5+1=6. So s=4 is <=6. contribution is (4-2)*1=2*1=2. Total contribution 1+2=3. Which matches the second sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input: 500000 500000 500000 500000. So A=B=C=D=500000.\n\ns ranges from 500000 + 500000 = 1e6 to 500000 + 500000 = 1e6. So s is 1e6.\n\ncount_pairs: x ranges from max(A, s - C) = max(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) = max(5e5, 5e5) =5e5. Upper bound is min(B, s - B) = min(5e5, 1e6 -5e5) = min(5e5, 5e5) =5e5. So count is 1.\n\nContribution: s is 1e6. C is 5e5. C+1 is 5e5 +1. s is 1e6 which is >= C+1. Also D+1 is 5e5 +1. So s=1e6 is 1e6 <= D+1 (which is 5e5 +1)? No. Because 1e6 is 1,000,000, and 5e5 +1 is 500,001. So s=1e6 is larger than D+1. So contribution is K * count_pairs. K is D - C +1 = 5e5 -5e5 +1 =1. So contribution is 1 *1=1. Which matches the third sample.\n\nSo the approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nSo steps:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\nCompute s_min = A + B, s_max = B + C.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop s from s_min to s_max:\n\n   compute lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n\n   upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n   if lower_x > upper_x:\n\n       count_pairs = 0\n\n   else:\n\n       count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n\n   if s < (C + 1):\n\n       contribution = 0\n\n   else:\n\n       if s <= (D + 1):\n\n           contribution = (s - C) * count_pairs\n\n       else:\n\n           contribution = K * count_pairs\n\n   total += contribution\n\nreturn total.\n\nBut wait, what about when D is smaller than C? No, since the input says A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So C ≤ D. So D + 1 is ≥ C + 1.\n\nBut for example, if D is equal to C, then D + 1 is C + 1. So for s = C + 1, which is D + 1, then it's handled.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nBut let's think about when s exceeds D + 1. For example, when D is 4, C is 3. D +1 is 5. If s is 6, then it's larger than D+1. So contribution is K * count_pairs.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, we can loop s from s_min to s_max, which could be up to 1e6 steps. For each step, compute lower_x and upper_x.\n\nBut for large values of A, B, C, D, this is feasible.\n\nBut what about when s_min is larger than s_max? Well, since A ≤ B and B ≤ C, then s_min is A + B, and s_max is B + C. Since A ≤ B, and B ≤ C, then A + B ≤ B + C. So s_min is always ≤ s_max.\n\nSo the loop is safe.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in Python, looping from s_min to s_max may be slow if s_max is up to 1e6. But 1e6 is manageable.\n\nWait, for example, 1e6 iterations in Python is acceptable. Let's see.\n\nBut let's think about the constraints. The maximum possible s_max is B + C. Since B and C can be up to 5e5, s_max can be up to 1e6. So the loop is 1e6 steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead A, B, C, D from input.\n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\ntotal = 0\n\ns_min = A + B\n\ns_max = B + C\n\nfor s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n\n    lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n\n    upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n    if lower_x > upper_x:\n\n        count_pairs = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n\n    if s < (C + 1):\n\n        contrib = 0\n\n    else:\n\n        if s <= (D + 1):\n\n            contrib = (s - C) * count_pairs\n\n        else:\n\n            contrib = K * count_pairs\n\n    total += contrib\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input, when s is 3, which is C+1? C is 3. C+1 is 4. So s=3 is less than 4. So contribution is zero. Which is correct.\n\nBut let's check another scenario. Suppose s is exactly C+1. Then, (s - C) is 1, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 1 2 3 4 → code returns 4, correct.\n\nSample 2: 1 2 2 5 → K is 5-2+1=4. s ranges from 3 to 4.\n\ns=3:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 3 - 2) = max(1,1) =1.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 3 - 2) = min(2, 1) =1. count_pairs =1.\n\ns >= C+1 (C=2, C+1=3). So yes. s is 3, which is <= D+1 (5+1=6). So contrib is (3-2)*1 =1.\n\ns=4:\n\nlower_x is max(1, 4-2=2) → 2.\n\nupper_x is min(2, 4-2=2) → 2. count_pairs=1.\n\ncontrib is (4-2)*1 =2. total is 1+2=3. Correct.\n\nThird sample: A=B=C=D=500000. s_min = 1e6, s_max= 1e6. So loop runs once.\n\nlower_x = max(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) → max(5e5, 5e5) → 5e5.\n\nupper_x = min(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) → min(5e5, 5e5) → 5e5. count_pairs =1.\n\ns=1e6. C+1 =5e5 +1. s=1e6 is larger than that. D+1 is 5e5 +1. So s is 1e6 which is larger than D+1. So contrib is K * count_pairs. K is D - C +1 = 5e5 - 5e5 +1 =1. So contrib is 1*1=1. Correct.\n\nSo code works for samples.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nCase where no triangles are possible. For example, A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1. Then x=1, y=1, z=1. Check x + y > z → 1 +1>1 → 2>1 → yes. So count is 1. Which code would compute:\n\ns_min = 1+1=2, s_max=1+1=2. s=2.\n\nlower_x = max(1, 2 - 1) = max(1,1)=1.\n\nupper_x = min(1, 2 -1) =1. count_pairs=1.\n\nC is 1. C+1 is 2. s=2 is equal to C+1. So contrib is (2 -1)*1 =1. So total is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: when x + y is exactly C. For example, A=1, B=2, C=3, D=3. Then s can be 3 (1+2). For s=3, which is C=3. So s >= C+1? C+1 is 4. No. So contribution is 0. So no triangles. But what about z?\n\nWait, in this case, for x=1, y=2, z must be between C=3 and D=3. So z=3. Check if x + y > z: 1+2=3 >3? No. So it's a degenerate triangle. So not counted. So code correctly returns 0.\n\nAnother case: x=2, y=2, z=3. x+y=4>3. So yes. So for example, A=2, B=2, C=3, D=3. Then s_min=2+2=4, s_max=2+3=5.\n\ns=4:\n\nlower_x = max(2, 4 -3=1) → 2. upper_x = min(2, 4 - 2=2) → 2. count_pairs=1. s=4 >= C+1 (3+1=4). So contrib is (4-3)*1=1. s=4 is <= D+1 (3+1=4). So yes. So total is 1. Which is correct (triangle (2,2,3)).\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother edge case: when D is very large. For example, A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1e5. Then for any x=1, y=1, s=2. C+1 is 2. So s >= C+1. D+1 is 1e5 +1. So s=2 is <= D+1. So contrib is (s - C) * count_pairs. s - C = 2 -1=1. count_pairs is 1. So total is 1. Which is correct: z can be from 1 to 1e5. But since x + y = 2, z must be < 2. But since z >= C=1. So z can be 1. So only one z. Which is correct. But according to code, (s - C) is 1. Which is the number of z's. Because min(D, s-1) - C + 1 → min(1e5, 1) - 1 +1 → 1 -1 +1 =1. So code is correct.\n\nAnother case where s is larger than D +1. For example, A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1. Then s=2. D+1 is 2. So s is equal to D+1. So contrib is (s - C) * count_pairs = (2-1)*1=1. Which is correct, since z can be 1. Which is allowed. So code is correct.\n\nAnother case where s is larger than D +1. Let's say D=2, C=1. Then D+1 is 3. Suppose s=4. Then contrib is K * count_pairs. K is D-C+1 = 2-1+1=2. So for example, if x=2, y=2 (assuming B is 2, etc.), then s=4. So z must be between 1 and 2. But since x + y =4, which is larger than z. So for any z in [1, 2], 2 + 2 > z. So there are 2 options. Which is K. So code returns K * count_pairs.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, for large ranges, the for loop might be slow. However, given that the maximum s_max is 1e6, it's manageable.\n\nBut let's think about the possible maximum s_max. For example, when B and C are 5e5, s_max is 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6. So the loop runs 1e6 times. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nRead the input line, split into A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\nCompute s_min = A + B, s_max = B + C.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop s from s_min to s_max inclusive:\n\n   lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n\n   upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n   if lower_x > upper_x:\n\n       count_pairs = 0\n\n   else:\n\n       count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n\n   if s < (C + 1):\n\n       contrib = 0\n\n   else:\n\n       if s <= (D + 1):\n\n           contrib = (s - C) * count_pairs\n\n       else:\n\n           contrib = K * count_pairs\n\n   total += contrib\n\nPrint(total)\n\nSo code:\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input. For multiple test cases? Wait, the input is given as a list of inputs, but in the problem statement, the input is a single line. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three lines, but perhaps the sample input shows multiple test cases. But the actual problem says that the input is four integers. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nBut the problem says that the input is four integers. However, the sample input shows multiple lines, perhaps indicating that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nOutput\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nBut that's probably a representation of multiple test cases. However, the actual problem's input is one line per test case. But the original problem says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the user is supposed to read a single test case.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers...\n\nSo the code should read one line of input, split into four integers. However, the sample input shows three lines. Which suggests that perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But this is unclear.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is ['1 2 3 4', ...], which is probably a mistake in formatting. Because the actual input is given as a single line. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. But the problem's description says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the sample input is showing three separate test cases, each on their own line.\n\nBut the user's code should read from stdin. So the code must read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate test case, and output the corresponding answer for each.\n\nBut the problem statement says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers...\n\nSo perhaps the code is supposed to read a single line of input. But the sample input shows three lines. Which is confusing.\n\nLooking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nBut this is probably a formatting error. In programming competitions, the input would be three lines, each with four integers. So the code should read each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the original problem statement says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers...\n\nSo perhaps the code should read one line. However, the sample shows multiple lines. Which is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the problem's note, the first example's input is \"1 2 3 4\" and output is 4. So perhaps the code should read one line of input. However, the sample input in the problem shows three lines. Which may be an error. But given that the user provided the sample input as a list of strings, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each on their own line.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the code should read one line. However, the sample shows multiple lines. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's original statement:\n\nThe user is to write a Python script that reads input from stdin and prints to stdout. So the code should read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is four integers. However, the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, each given on a separate line.\n\nThus, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the answer for each.\n\nSo the code should read each line, split into four integers, and compute the answer.\n\nIn Python, that would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute and print the answer.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '1 2 3 4' and output is 4.\n\nSo the code must process each line as a separate test case.\n\nThus, the code should be written to handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem statement says that the input is four integers. Which suggests that there is only one test case. However, the sample input shows three lines. Which is likely a mistake in the problem statement. But given the sample input and output, we have to assume that the code should handle multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n        K = D - C + 1\n\n        total = 0\n\n        s_min = A + B\n\n        s_max = B + C\n\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n\n            lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n\n            upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n            if lower_x > upper_x:\n\n                count_pairs = 0\n\n            else:\n\n               ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The key condition for a non-degenerate triangle is that the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side. Given the constraints $A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D$, we can leverage this ordering to simplify our checks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Triangle Inequality**: For a triangle with sides $x \\leq y \\leq z$, the necessary and sufficient condition for a non-degenerate triangle is $x + y > z$.\n2. **Range Constraints**: Given the ranges for $x$, $y$, and $z$, we need to count valid combinations where $x$ is in $[A, B]$, $y$ is in $[B, C]$, and $z$ is in $[C, D]$.\n3. **Efficient Counting**: Instead of iterating over all possible values of $x$, $y$, and $z$, which would be computationally expensive, we use mathematical insights to count valid combinations efficiently:\n   - For each possible sum $s = x + y$, determine how many valid $z$ values exist such that $z < s$.\n   - Use range constraints to compute valid counts of $x$ and $y$ pairs for each possible sum $s$.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        K = D - C + 1\n        total = 0\n        s_min = A + B\n        s_max = B + C\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n            lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n            upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n            if lower_x > upper_x:\n                count_pairs = 0\n            else:\n                count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n            if s < (C + 1):\n                contrib = 0\n            else:\n                if s <= (D + 1):\n                    contrib = (s - C) * count_pairs\n                else:\n                    contrib = K * count_pairs\n            total += contrib\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines of input, each representing a test case with four integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n2. **Precompute Constants**: Calculate $K = D - C + 1$, which represents the number of valid $z$ values when $x + y$ is sufficiently large.\n3. **Range of Sums**: Determine the minimum and maximum possible sums $s = x + y$.\n4. **Count Valid Pairs**: For each possible sum $s$, compute the number of valid $(x, y)$ pairs such that $x + y = s$.\n5. **Contribution Calculation**: For each valid sum $s$, compute the contribution to the total count of valid triangles based on the number of valid $z$ values.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid triangles without explicitly iterating through all possible combinations, leveraging mathematical properties and constraints to reduce complexity.",
