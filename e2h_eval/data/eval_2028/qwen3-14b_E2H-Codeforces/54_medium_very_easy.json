Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Mister B wants to find three vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. The output should be three distinct vertices. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the angles in a regular polygon work. Let me think. For a regular n-gon, each interior angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. But wait, that's the angle between two adjacent sides. However, when you pick three vertices, the angle formed depends on how many steps apart they are.\n\nWait, the problem says that the angle is formed with v2 as the vertex, and v1 and v3 on its sides. So, for example, in a regular polygon, if we pick three vertices such that there are k steps between v1 and v2, and m steps between v2 and v3, but since it's a regular polygon, maybe the angle depends on the number of sides between the points?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for the angle formed by three vertices. Let me recall. For a regular polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. But for the angle at a vertex, perhaps when you select three vertices, the angle depends on how many edges are skipped between them.\n\nLet me think about a regular polygon. Suppose we have a regular n-gon. Let's fix v2 as a vertex. Then, the other two points v1 and v3 are such that they lie on the sides of the angle. Wait, but in the polygon, each vertex is connected to adjacent vertices. So, perhaps when selecting three vertices, the angle at v2 depends on how many vertices are between v1 and v2 and between v2 and v3.\n\nWait, maybe the angle is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. But since the polygon is regular, maybe the angle is determined by the number of steps between them. For example, if v1 and v2 are adjacent, and v2 and v3 are adjacent, then the angle at v2 would be the internal angle of the polygon. But if there are more steps between them, the angle might change.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the regular polygon can be inscribed in a circle. So, each vertex lies on a circle. Then, the angle at v2 would be an inscribed angle. Wait, but the angle formed by three points on a circle. For example, if you have three points A, B, C on a circle, then the angle ABC depends on the arcs AC and so on.\n\nWait, the central angle for each side is 2π/n radians. Let me think about the angle at vertex B. Suppose that between A and B there are k steps (so the arc AB is k * (2π/n) radians), and between B and C there are m steps. But since the polygon is regular, the positions are symmetric. However, when forming the angle at B, the points A and C must be such that they are on either side of B. Wait, but for the angle to be formed with B as the vertex, A and C must be such that they are not adjacent to B? Or maybe they can be adjacent?\n\nWait, the problem says that the angle is formed with v2 as the vertex, and v1 and v3 lying on its sides. So, perhaps the sides of the angle are the lines from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. But in the polygon, the sides are the edges between consecutive vertices. However, if v1 and v3 are not adjacent to v2, then those lines would be diagonals, not sides of the polygon. Wait, maybe the problem's wording is a bit confusing here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: the angle is where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides. So, perhaps the sides of the angle are the lines from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. But in the polygon, the sides of the polygon are the edges between consecutive vertices. However, the lines from v2 to v1 and v2 to v3 could be any diagonals or edges. But the problem says that v1 and v3 lie on the sides of the angle. Wait, maybe that's a translation issue. Maybe it's that the angle is formed by two sides of the polygon, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the angle is formed by two lines that are sides of the polygon, but that would only be possible if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2. But in that case, the angle would be the internal angle of the polygon.\n\nBut in the example given, for the square (n=4), when a is 67, the answer is 45 degrees. Which is half of the internal angle of the square (which is 90 degrees). So how is that possible?\n\nAh, perhaps the angle is formed by connecting v2 to two other vertices that are not adjacent. For example, in a square, choosing vertices 1, 2, 3 gives an internal angle of 90 degrees. But if you choose vertices 1, 3, 2, then the angle at 3 would be 45 degrees. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the square is labeled 1,2,3,4 clockwise. If we take points 1, 2, 3: the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But if we take points 1, 3, 2, then the angle at 3 would be formed between the lines from 3 to 1 and 3 to 2. But in the square, 3 is connected to 2 and 4. So the line from 3 to 2 is an edge, and the line from 3 to 1 is a diagonal. So the angle between those two lines would be... Well, in a square, the diagonal splits the 90-degree angle into two 45-degree angles. So if you take the angle between the edge (from 3 to 2) and the diagonal (from 3 to 1), that's 45 degrees. So that's how the example works. So the angle is formed by two lines that are edges and diagonals.\n\nSo, the key is to find for any three vertices, the angle at v2. How to compute that angle?\n\nLet me think about the general case. Suppose we have a regular n-gon inscribed in a unit circle. Let's say that the vertices are placed at angles θ_k = 2π(k-1)/n radians for k from 1 to n. Now, consider three vertices v1, v2, v3. Let me assume that v2 is fixed, and v1 and v3 are positioned such that they are m and k steps away from v2. Wait, but perhaps the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. However, since the polygon is regular, the actual positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2 will determine the angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. But since the polygon is regular, the angle is determined by the arc lengths between these points.\n\nLet me think of the regular polygon as being inscribed in a circle. Then, the angle at v2 between points v1 and v3 is equal to half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Wait, that's the inscribed angle theorem. For example, in a circle, the angle subtended at the center by an arc is twice the angle subtended at the circumference. So, if the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is x degrees, then the angle at v2 would be x/2 degrees.\n\nBut how to compute x? Well, the arc length depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3. Let me think. Let's suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k steps (along the arc that does not pass through v2). Since the polygon is regular, the arc length between v1 and v3 is k * (360/n) degrees. Therefore, the angle at v2 would be (k * (360/n )) / 2 = k * 180/n degrees.\n\nWait, but how do we find k? Let me think. For example, in the square case, if v1 is 1, v2 is 3, and v3 is 2. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) would be from 1 to 2, which is one step. So k=1. Then angle is 1*180/4 = 45 degrees. Which matches the example. That seems correct.\n\nAnother example: in a square, if v1 and v3 are opposite vertices (say, 1 and 3), then the arc between them is 2 steps. Then angle at v2 (say, 2) would be 2 * 180/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct because if you take points 1, 2, 3, the angle at 2 is 90 degrees.\n\nSo the formula seems to be that the angle at v2 is (k * 180)/n degrees, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2. But how to find k?\n\nWait, for a given v2, and any two other points v1 and v3, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 has length k steps. But since the polygon is regular, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is determined by their positions relative to v2.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's imagine that for any three points, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in the direction that does not pass through v2. But how to calculate this?\n\nAlternatively, for a regular n-gon, when choosing three vertices v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 depends on the number of edges between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. Wait, but perhaps the key is that the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3, skipping over v2. For example, if v1 is m steps away from v2 in one direction, and v3 is m steps away in the other direction, then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is (m + m) steps. But that's just an example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when you go around the polygon in the direction that doesn't pass through v2. For example, if v1 is one step clockwise from v2, and v3 is one step counter-clockwise from v2, then the arc between them not passing through v2 would be two steps (the path from v1 to v3 that goes the other way around the polygon). But that would be 2 steps. Then the angle is 2 * 180 / n degrees.\n\nBut how to find this k for any possible triple?\n\nAlternatively, for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in the arc that does not contain v2. Let's denote this number as k. Then the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees.\n\nBut how to find k for any given v1, v2, v3? Well, perhaps for any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not include v2. For example, if v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2, then the arc between them that doesn't include v2 is (n - 2) steps. Wait, no. Let me think of the square again. Suppose v2 is 2. Then, v1 is 1 and v3 is 3. The arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2 is going from 1 to 4 to 3, which is 2 steps (from 1 to 4 is one step, and 4 to 3 is another). So k is 2. Then angle is 2*180/4 = 90 degrees, which is correct. But if v1 is 1 and v3 is 3, and v2 is 2, then the angle is 90 degrees. But earlier, when v2 was 3, and v1 was 1 and v3 was 2, the angle was 45 degrees. So in that case, the arc between v1 and v3 (1 and 2) that does not pass through v2 (which is 3) is the arc from 1 to 2 directly, which is 1 step. So k is 1, and angle is 1 * 180/4 = 45 degrees. That matches.\n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees, where k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2.\n\nBut how to compute k for a given v2, v1, v3?\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed v2, the possible values of k are determined by the positions of v1 and v3. For example, if we fix v2, and choose v1 and v3 such that they are m and l steps away from v2 in either direction, then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 would be (m + l) steps. Because if you go from v1 to v2 in m steps, and from v2 to v3 in l steps, then the arc that doesn't contain v2 would be the other way around, which would be (n - (m + l + 1)) steps? Or perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, perhaps the key insight is that for any three vertices, the angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when you go around the polygon in the arc that does not contain v2. Let's call this number k. Then the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees. But how to find k for a given triple?\n\nAlternatively, for a given v2, if we pick v1 and v3 such that there are exactly m steps between v1 and v2, and exactly l steps between v2 and v3 (in the clockwise direction?), then the arc between v1 and v3 that does not pass through v2 would be (n - (m + l + 1))? Not sure. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nWait, in the regular polygon, the angle at v2 between v1 and v3 depends on the number of edges between v1 and v3 when you go around the polygon in the direction that doesn't pass through v2. Let's say that between v1 and v3, there are k steps. Then the angle is (k * 180)/n degrees. So for example, in the square, if k is 1, angle is 45 degrees. If k is 2, angle is 90 degrees.\n\nBut how to find all possible k values for a given n?\n\nFor a given n, the possible values of k can be from 1 to (n-2). Because if k is 1, that's the minimal possible (when v1 and v3 are adjacent), and if k is n-2, that's when v1 and v3 are adjacent on the other side of the polygon (so the arc that doesn't pass through v2 is almost the entire polygon except for v2).\n\nBut for each k, the angle is (k * 180)/n. So the problem reduces to finding the value of k that makes this angle as close as possible to a. Then, once we find the optimal k, we need to output three vertices that form such an angle.\n\nBut how to find the optimal k?\n\nLet me think. For each possible k, compute the angle theta = (k * 180)/n. We want theta to be as close as possible to a. So, the problem becomes finding the k that minimizes |theta - a|.\n\nBut what are the possible k values?\n\nWell, for any three distinct vertices, the value of k can be from 1 to n-2. Because if you have three distinct vertices, then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 must have at least one step (since otherwise, they would be adjacent to v2, and the arc would be zero steps, which is impossible). Wait, for example, in a triangle (n=3), the only possible k is 1. Because if you take three vertices, the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 1 step (since the polygon has 3 vertices). So the angle is 180*1/3 = 60 degrees, which matches the first example.\n\nSo for a general n, the possible k values are 1 <= k <= n-2. So for each possible k in this range, we can compute the angle and find which one is closest to a.\n\nOnce we find the optimal k, we need to choose three vertices that correspond to this k.\n\nNow, the question is: how to find the optimal k?\n\nLet me think about the formula for theta. theta = (k * 180)/n. We want this to be as close as possible to a.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation. Solving for k:\n\nk = (a * n) / 180.\n\nBut since k must be an integer between 1 and n-2, we can compute the ideal k as floor((a * n)/180) and ceil((a * n)/180), and check which one gives the minimal difference.\n\nBut since a is given in degrees, and n can be up to 1e5, this approach is feasible.\n\nWait, but what if (a * n) / 180 is not integer? Then we need to check the floor and ceiling values. Also, we need to ensure that the chosen k is within [1, n-2].\n\nSo, let's proceed with this approach.\n\nFor example, in the sample input:\n\nSample 2: n=4, a=67.\n\nCompute ideal k = (67 * 4)/180 = 268/180 ≈ 1.488. So possible k is 1 or 2.\n\nFor k=1, theta is 1*180/4 = 45 degrees. Difference is 67-45=22.\n\nFor k=2, theta is 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Difference is 90-67=23. So 45 is better. Hence, choose k=1.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSample 3: n=4, a=68. Then ideal k is (68 *4)/180 = 272/180 ≈ 1.511. So possible k is 1 or 2. For k=1: 45, difference 23. For k=2: 90, difference 22. So choose k=2. Hence, the angle is 90, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: n=3, a=15. The ideal k is (15*3)/180 = 0.25. So possible k is 1 (since k must be >=1). Then theta is 60 degrees. Which is the only option, hence the sample output.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the ideal k as (a * n)/180. Let's call this target_k.\n\n2. Check the integer values around target_k (floor and ceiling) to find which gives the minimal difference.\n\nBut also, we need to ensure that k is within 1 <= k <= n-2.\n\nOnce we find the best k, we need to construct three vertices that form this angle.\n\nNow, the next part is to find three vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle at v2 is for this k.\n\nHow to choose them? Well, for a given k, we can choose any v2, then choose v1 and v3 such that there are exactly k steps between them along the arc that does not include v2.\n\nFor example, let's choose v2 as 1. Then, v1 can be 2, and v3 can be (2 + k) steps away from v1? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, for a given k, the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2 must be such that the arc between them (not containing v2) has exactly k steps. Let me think of how to arrange that.\n\nSuppose v2 is vertex 1. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must have k steps. So, for example, if I choose v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex (2 + k) mod n? No, that depends on the arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, imagine that for a given v2, we can select v1 as the next vertex (v2 + 1), and v3 as v2 + k + 1. Wait, perhaps not. Let's think for the square example where k=1, n=4, v2=2. Then the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 should be 1 step. So, for example, v1 could be 1, v3 could be 3. Then, the arc between 1 and 3 not containing 2 is 1 step (from 1 to 4 to 3?), no. Wait, that's two steps. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, for a given k, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2 is k. So, for example, if we fix v2 as vertex 1, then v1 and v3 can be arranged such that there are k steps between them in the arc that doesn't include v2. For example, if k=1, then v1 could be vertex 2, and v3 could be vertex n (since the arc from v1 to v3 that doesn't include v2 would be one step (n to 2 is one step if n is 3, but that's for n=3). Hmm, perhaps it's easier to think of v2 as vertex 1, and then v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex (2 + k) mod n? Not sure.\n\nWait, here's an approach. For any k, the minimal configuration is to take v2 as vertex 1, v1 as vertex 2, and v3 as vertex (2 + k) steps away. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nIn the square example with k=1, the angle is 45 degrees. So for v2=2, the example output is 4 1 2. Wait, in the sample input for n=4 and a=67, the output is \"2 1 3\". Let's see: v2 is 1, v1 is 2, v3 is 3. The arc between v1 and v3 (2 and 3) that does not contain v2 (1) would be from 2 to 3 directly, which is one step. So k=1. Which gives 1*180/4=45 degrees. So that's correct.\n\nSo, in this case, for k=1, the choice is v1 = 2, v2=1, v3=3. So the arc between 2 and 3 not containing 1 is 1 step.\n\nSo, the way to construct the three vertices is: choose v2 as any vertex, then v1 as the next vertex in clockwise order, and v3 as the vertex that is k+1 steps away from v1 in the clockwise direction. Wait, no. Because for the example, v1 is 2, v3 is 3. So from v1, moving one step clockwise gets to v3. So for k=1, the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is 1 step.\n\nAlternatively, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that does not contain v2 is k. So, for a given v2, if we take v1 as v2 + 1 (mod n), and v3 as v2 + 1 + k (mod n), then the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is k steps. Because between v1 and v3, the arc that does not contain v2 would be the path that skips v2, which would be k steps. Let me think with the square example.\n\nn=4, v2=1. v1 is 2. v3 is 2 + 1 = 3. The arc between 2 and 3 not containing 1 is one step (directly from 2 to 3). So k=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4, k=2. Then, v1 is 2, v3 is 2 + 2 = 4. The arc between 2 and 4 not containing 1 is 2 steps (2→3→4). So k=2. The angle is 2*180/4 = 90 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems to be a valid approach. Therefore, for any k, we can choose v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + k. But wait, what if 2 + k exceeds n? For example, n=4, k=2. 2 +k = 4, which is okay. For n=5, k=3, 2+3=5, which is okay. For n=5, k=4, 2+4=6, which is 6 mod 5 = 1. But then the arc between 2 and 1 not containing v2 (which is 1) would be... Wait, if v2 is 1, and v1 is 2, and v3 is 1, but v3 must be distinct from v2. So this approach may not work for larger k.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the formula. Let me think again. For a given k, the arc between v1 and v3 not containing v2 is k steps. So, if I fix v2 as 1, then v1 can be 2, and v3 can be (v1 + k) steps away from v1 in the clockwise direction. But since the polygon is cyclic, adding k steps to v1's position. But how to compute that.\n\nWait, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that doesn't contain v2 is k. So, the total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is (n - k - 1) steps. Because the total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the whole circle is n-1 steps (since they are distinct). But the arc that contains v2 has (n - k - 1) steps, and the other arc has k steps.\n\nSo, for example, if v1 is 2, and v3 is 2 + k steps clockwise. But since the arc between them not containing v2 (which is 1) is k steps, then the distance between v1 and v3 along that arc is k steps. Therefore, the position of v3 is v1 + k steps clockwise. But since the polygon is numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order, the position of v3 is (v1 + k) mod n. But since v1 is 2, then v3 would be (2 + k) mod n. However, if mod n results in 0, then it's n.\n\nBut in that case, for example, n=4, v1=2, k=2. 2+2=4, which is correct. For k=3, 2+3=5 mod 4 is 1. Then, the arc between v1=2 and v3=1 not containing v2=1? Wait, but v3 is 1, which is v2. That's invalid. So this suggests that the approach is flawed for certain k.\n\nAh, right. Because when we choose v2 as 1, and v1 as 2, then v3 cannot be 1. So for k steps between v1 and v3 not containing v2, we need to ensure that v3 is not equal to v2.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct way is to set v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + k steps in the clockwise direction, but ensuring that this doesn't land on v2 (1). So for example, when k is such that 2 + k steps equals 1 mod n, then that would be a problem.\n\nBut how to avoid that? Well, since k ranges from 1 to n-2, then 2 + k can be up to 2 + (n-2) = n. So for example, when 2 + k = n, then v3 is n. Which is allowed. For example, in n=4, k=2, v3 is 4. Which is allowed.\n\nBut when k is n-2, then 2 + k = 2 + n-2 = n. Which is allowed. So for k up to n-2, 2 + k is between 3 and n. So v3 is between 3 and n, which is different from v2 (which is 1). So that's okay.\n\nSo this approach works. So for any k between 1 and n-2, setting v2 as 1, v1 as 2, and v3 as 2 + k steps clockwise (i.e., v3 = 2 + k if it's <=n, else wrap around). But since k is at most n-2, 2 +k is at most n, so no wrapping needed. Therefore, v3 is 2 +k.\n\nThus, for any k, the three vertices can be selected as v1=2, v2=1, v3=2 +k.\n\nBut wait, in the sample input where n=4, a=67, the output is \"2 1 3\", which corresponds to v1=2, v2=1, v3=3. Here, k is 1, since 2 +k =3 implies k=1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4, a=68. The optimal k is 2, which gives v3=2+2=4. So the three vertices would be 2, 1, 4. Which is a valid triplet. But the sample output for that case is \"4 1 2\". Which is another valid triplet. Because the angle is determined by the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2. So regardless of the order, as long as the k is correct.\n\nTherefore, the triplet can be (v1, v2, v3) as (2, 1, 2 +k), or any permutation that satisfies the angle condition. However, the problem requires that the output is any valid triplet.\n\nSo, the approach for constructing the triplet once k is determined is:\n\nPick v2 as 1, v1 as 2, v3 as 2 +k.\n\nBut what if n is 3? For example, n=3, k=1. Then v3 is 2 +1 =3. So the triplet is 2,1,3. Which is correct. And the sample output for the first case is \"1 2 3\" which is another valid triplet. Because the angle is the same regardless of which vertex is chosen as v2, as long as the k is correct.\n\nSo, the code can generate the triplet as 2, 1, 2 +k. However, the problem allows any valid triplet, so this approach is acceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe steps for solving the problem are:\n\n1. Compute the ideal k as (a * n) / 180. Since a and n are integers, this may not be an integer.\n\n2. Find the integer k that is closest to this ideal value, within the range [1, n-2].\n\n3. Once the optimal k is found, output the triplet (2, 1, 2 +k). Or any other valid triplet.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that multiple k's give the same minimal difference. For example, if the ideal k is exactly between two integers. In that case, we need to choose the one with the smallest difference. If both have the same difference, we can choose either.\n\nSo, how to compute the optimal k?\n\nLet me think. For example, compute target = (a * n) / 180. Then, possible candidates are floor(target), ceil(target). Also, need to check if they are within the valid range [1, n-2]. Also, possibly, if target is exactly integer, then that's the optimal.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nCompute k_floor = floor(target)\n\nk_ceil = ceil(target)\n\nBut need to check if these are in the valid range. Also, if target is integer, then k_floor = k_ceil = target. So, in that case, we can just take that value.\n\nOnce we have these candidates, we can compute for each of them the absolute difference between (k * 180)/n and a. Choose the one with minimal difference. If there's a tie, choose either.\n\nOnce we find the optimal k, then generate the triplet as (2, 1, 2 +k).\n\nBut what if the optimal k is not in the range [1, n-2]? For example, if target is less than 1, then the optimal k is 1. If target is larger than n-2, then the optimal k is n-2.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nCalculate target_k = a * n / 180.0\n\ncandidates = list of possible k values around target_k.\n\nBut how to generate them? For example, the candidates can be floor(target_k), ceil(target_k), and also check if they are within 1 <=k <=n-2. Also, if target_k is exactly integer, then only that k is considered.\n\nOnce the candidates are generated, compute the difference for each and select the best one.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to generate all possible k candidates as floor(target_k) -1, floor(target_k), floor(target_k)+1, etc., but that may not be necessary. Let's think: since the function is linear, the minimal difference is achieved either at floor(target_k) or ceil(target_k), unless target_k is exactly on an integer.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nCompute target_k = (a * n) / 180.0\n\nk_candidates = [math.floor(target_k), math.ceil(target_k)]\n\nBut also, need to check if they are within 1 <= k <= n-2. For example, if math.floor(target_k) is 0, then we need to use 1 instead. Similarly, if math.ceil(target_k) is larger than n-2, then we use n-2.\n\nBut also, after generating the candidates, we need to check for possible other candidates. For example, if target_k is 0.5, then floor is 0, which is out of range, so the candidate is 1. Similarly, if target_k is 1.5, then floor is 1, ceil is 2. Both are valid. So compare both.\n\nOnce the candidates are generated, we can collect all possible candidates (including clamped values) and compute which one gives the minimal difference.\n\nOnce we have the best k, then generate the triplet.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this?\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport math\n\nn, a = map(int, input().split())\n\ntarget_k = (a * n) / 180.0\n\n# Generate possible candidates\ncandidates = set()\nfor k in [math.floor(target_k), math.ceil(target_k)]:\n    if 1 <= k <= n-2:\n        candidates.add(k)\n    else:\n        # clamp to the nearest valid value\n        if k < 1:\n            candidates.add(1)\n        elif k > n-2:\n            candidates.add(n-2)\n# Also, need to check if target_k is exactly integer, but the above code handles that.\n\n# Also, what if the candidates are empty? No, since n >=3, n-2 >=1. So for example, when n=3, n-2=1. So candidates will have at least 1.\n\n# Also, need to check if the candidates are within the range.\n\n# Now, check for possible other candidates. For example, if target_k is exactly on the edge.\n\n# Also, perhaps the candidates could be [1, n-2], but we need to check all possibilities.\n\nWait, but the code above adds floor and ceil. However, if target_k is exactly integer, then floor and ceil are same, and added once.\n\nBut what if the optimal k is not among these two candidates? For example, if target_k is 1.9, then floor is 1, ceil is 2. But maybe 1.9 is closer to 2 than 1. So the code checks both. So that's covered.\n\nOnce the candidates are generated, we need to evaluate each of them and select the one with minimal difference.\n\nBut perhaps there are other candidates. For example, if the target_k is 0.9, then floor is 0, which is clamped to 1, and ceil is 1,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle formed at the middle vertex is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves calculating the optimal number of steps between vertices to form the closest possible angle and then determining the corresponding vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Geometry**: In a regular n-gon, the angle formed at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the number of steps between those vertices along the arc that does not contain the middle vertex. This angle can be calculated using the formula: $ \\text{angle} = \\frac{k \\times 180}{n} $, where `k` is the number of steps between the two vertices.\n\n2. **Determine Optimal Steps (k)**: Calculate the ideal value of `k` using the formula $ k = \\frac{a \\times n}{180} $. Since `k` must be an integer, we check the floor and ceiling values of this ideal value to find the closest valid integer within the range [1, n-2].\n\n3. **Select Vertices**: Once the optimal `k` is determined, the vertices can be selected as follows: fix the middle vertex as the first vertex (v2=1), the first vertex (v1=2), and the third vertex (v3) such that there are exactly `k` steps between v1 and v3.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    target_k = (a * n) / 180.0\n    \n    candidates = set()\n    # Check floor and ceil of target_k\n    for k in [math.floor(target_k), math.ceil(target_k)]:\n        if 1 <= k <= n - 2:\n            candidates.add(k)\n        else:\n            if k < 1:\n                candidates.add(1)\n            else:\n                candidates.add(n - 2)\n    \n    # Also check if the clamped values are already considered\n    # Now evaluate all candidates to find the best one\n    best_k = None\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    \n    for candidate in candidates:\n        angle = (candidate * 180.0) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = candidate\n        elif diff == min_diff:\n            # Choose the smaller k or any, since problem allows any\n            if candidate < best_k:\n                best_k = candidate\n    \n    # Now generate the triplet\n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = 2\n    v3 = 2 + best_k\n    \n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of vertices) and `a` (desired angle).\n2. **Calculating Target k**: The ideal value of `k` is derived from the formula $ k = \\frac{a \\times n}{180} $.\n3. **Candidate k Values**: We consider both the floor and ceiling values of the ideal `k`, ensuring they are within the valid range [1, n-2].\n4. **Finding the Best k**: Evaluate each candidate `k` to find the one that results in the angle closest to `a`.\n5. **Output the Vertices**: Using the optimal `k`, the vertices are chosen as v1=2, v2=1, and v3=2+k, forming the required angle.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the closest possible angle and ensures the vertices are chosen correctly based on geometric properties of regular polygons.",
