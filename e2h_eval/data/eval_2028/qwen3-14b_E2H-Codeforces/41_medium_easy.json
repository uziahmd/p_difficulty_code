There are $$$n$$$ spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between $$$0$$$ and $$$h$$$.In each spot, if a house has height $$$a$$$, you will gain $$$a^2$$$ dollars from it.The city has $$$m$$$ zoning restrictions. The $$$i$$$-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots $$$l_i$$$ to $$$r_i$$$ (inclusive) must be at most $$$x_i$$$.You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$h$$$, and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n,h,m \\leq 50$$$) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains three integers $$$l_i$$$, $$$r_i$$$, and $$$x_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq l_i \\leq r_i \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq x_i \\leq h$$$) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the $$$i$$$-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\n### Output\n['14', '262']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, there are $$$3$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$3$$$, and there are $$$3$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between $$$1$$$ and $$$1$$$ must be at most $$$1$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house between $$$2$$$ and $$$2$$$ must be at most $$$3$$$. The third restriction says the tallest house between $$$3$$$ and $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$2$$$.In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights $$$[1, 3, 2]$$$. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is $$$1^2 + 3^2 + 2^2 = 14$$$.In the second example, there are $$$4$$$ houses, the maximum height of a house is $$$10$$$, and there are $$$2$$$ restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from $$$2$$$ to $$$3$$$ must be at most $$$8$$$. The second restriction says the tallest house from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$ must be at most $$$7$$$.In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights $$$[10, 8, 7, 7]$$$. We get a profit of $$$10^2+8^2+7^2+7^2 = 262$$$. Note that there are two restrictions on house $$$3$$$ and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house $$$1$$$, we must still limit its height to be at most $$$10$$$ ($$$h=10$$$).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about building houses on n spots. Each house can have a height between 0 and h. For each house, the profit is a^2 where a is the height. But there are m restrictions. Each restriction says that the tallest house in the range l_i to r_i must be at most x_i. My goal is to maximize the total profit while satisfying all the restrictions.\n\nHmm. So how do I approach this? Since n, h, m are all up to 50, maybe a brute-force approach is possible. But even with n=50, trying all possibilities for each house's height would be h^50, which is way too big. That's not feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think about constraints. The restrictions require that for each interval [l_i, r_i], the maximum height in that interval is <= x_i. So for each such interval, the maximum of the heights in that range must not exceed x_i.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to choosing heights for each house such that all these constraints are satisfied, and the sum of squares is maximized.\n\nBut how to model this? One idea is that for each position, the maximum possible height it can have is determined by the restrictions that apply to it. However, since a restriction applies to a range, the maximum height of any house in that range can't exceed x_i. So for example, if there's a restriction on [1,3] with x=2, then all houses 1, 2, 3 must be <= 2. But if there are multiple overlapping restrictions, we need to find for each position the minimum x_i from all restrictions that cover it. Wait, no. Because a restriction says that the maximum in the interval is <= x_i. So for a particular house j, if there's a restriction that covers j (i.e., l_i <= j <= r_i), then the maximum height of that house can't be higher than x_i. But if there are multiple restrictions that include j, then the maximum allowed for j is the minimum of all x_i's from those restrictions. Because if one restriction says that in some interval containing j, the max is <= x1, and another says that in another interval containing j, the max is <= x2, then the maximum allowed for j is min(x1, x2). Because if j's height is higher than either x1 or x2, then that would violate the respective restriction.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose j is part of two intervals. For example, suppose there's a restriction that says the max in [1,2] is <= 3, and another that says the max in [2,3] is <= 2. Then for house 2, the maximum allowed height is 2, because if it's 3, then the second restriction (which includes house 2) would be violated. But the first restriction allows up to 3 in [1,2], but since house 2 can't be more than 2, then the max in [1,2] would be the max of house 1 and 2. If house 1 is 3, then the max would be 3, which is allowed by the first restriction. But the second restriction requires that the max in [2,3] is <= 2. So house 2 can't be higher than 2. Therefore, for each house, the maximum possible height is the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that include that house in their interval. Wait, but that's not entirely correct. Because a restriction may not directly apply to a house, but if there's a restriction on an interval that includes the house, then the maximum in that interval can't exceed x_i. However, that doesn't necessarily mean that the house itself can't be higher than x_i. Wait, no. Because if the house is in the interval, then the maximum in that interval is at least the height of the house. So if the restriction says that the maximum in that interval is <= x_i, then the house's height can't be higher than x_i. Because otherwise, the maximum would be higher than x_i, violating the restriction. Therefore, for each house, the maximum possible height is the minimum x_i across all restrictions that include that house in their interval. Because if there is a restriction that includes the house, then the house's height can't exceed that x_i. So for each house, its maximum allowed height is the minimum of all x_i's from restrictions that include that house in their interval. Also, there's the global maximum h. So the maximum allowed for each house is min(h, min of x_i's from restrictions covering it).\n\nWait, but what if there are no restrictions covering a house? Then the maximum allowed is h. So for each house, the maximum possible height is min(h, min of x_i's from restrictions that include that house in their interval). Because if there are no restrictions covering it, then min of x_i's is undefined, but in that case, the maximum is h.\n\nSo, if I can compute for each house j, the maximum possible height it can have, which is the minimum between h and the minimum x_i of all restrictions that include j in their [l_i, r_i] interval. Then, the optimal solution is to set each house to that maximum value. Because the sum of squares is maximized when each individual term is as large as possible. Because square is a monotonically increasing function for non-negative numbers. So if each house is set to the maximum possible allowed, then the sum will be maximum.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let's take an example. Suppose there are two houses. Suppose there is a restriction that says that the max in [1,2] is <= 3. Then, the maximum for each house is 3. So setting both to 3 gives sum 18. Which is better than any other combination. So yes, that seems right.\n\nAnother example: Suppose there are two restrictions. One says that in [1,1], the max is 1. Another says that in [2,2], the max is 2. Then, house 1 can be 1, house 2 can be 2. Sum is 5. Which is optimal.\n\nBut what if there are overlapping restrictions? For example, suppose there are two restrictions: one on [1,2] with x=3, and another on [1,1] with x=2. Then, for house 1, the restrictions that include it are both. So the minimum x_i is 2. So house 1 can be 2. House 2 is included in the first restriction, but not the second. So the max for house 2 is 3. So the sum is 2^2 + 3^2 = 13. Which is indeed the maximum possible.\n\nSo this approach seems correct. So the steps would be:\n\nFor each house j (from 1 to n):\n\n- Find all restrictions that include j in their [l_i, r_i] interval.\n\n- Take the minimum x_i among those restrictions. Let's call this min_x_j.\n\n- The maximum allowed height for j is min(h, min_x_j) if there are any such restrictions. If there are no restrictions that include j, then it's h.\n\nOnce we have the maximum allowed for each house, we set each house to that value, and compute the sum of squares.\n\nWait, but why is this correct? Because for each restriction, the maximum in the interval [l_i, r_i] is the maximum of the allowed heights of the houses in that interval. Since each house's allowed maximum is <= x_i (due to the restrictions that include it), then the maximum in that interval would be <= x_i. Because each house in the interval has a maximum allowed that is <= x_i (since for each house in the interval, there is at least the restriction i that includes it, so the min_x_j for that house is <= x_i). Therefore, the maximum of the allowed heights in the interval is <= x_i. Therefore, the restriction is satisfied.\n\nYes! So this approach works.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to for each house, compute the minimal x_i of all restrictions that include it. Then, the maximum allowed height for the house is min(h, that minimal x_i). Then, sum the squares.\n\nSo the steps to code this:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nThen for each of the m restrictions, read l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nFor each house j (1-based?), we need to check all restrictions and see if j is in [l_i, r_i]. For each such restriction, collect x_i, then take the minimum of them. Then, the maximum allowed for j is min(h, min_x).\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nInitialize for each house j, max_height[j] = h.\n\nThen for each restriction (l, r, x):\n\n   for each j in l to r:\n\n      if current max_height[j] is larger than x, then set it to x.\n\nWait, no. Because for each j in l to r, the restriction says that the maximum in the interval [l, r] must be <=x. Therefore, for each j in that interval, the maximum allowed height for j can't be higher than x. Because if j is in the interval, then the maximum in the interval is at least the height of j. So if j's height is higher than x, then the maximum in the interval would be higher than x, violating the restriction. Therefore, for each j in l..r, the maximum allowed height for j is the minimum between its current value and x.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize for each j, max_h[j] = h.\n\nFor each restriction (l, r, x):\n\n   for j from l to r:\n\n      if max_h[j] > x:\n\n          max_h[j] = x\n\nOnce all restrictions are processed, compute the sum of squares of max_h[j].\n\nYes! That seems correct.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n1 1 1 → for j=1, set to min(3, 1) → 1.\n\nThen 2 2 3 → j=2 is set to min(3, 3) → 3.\n\nThen 3 3 2 → j=3 is set to min(3, 2) → 2.\n\nSo the max_h array is [1,3,2], sum squares is 1+9+4=14. Which matches the example.\n\nSecond example input:\n\nn=4, h=10, m=2.\n\nRestrictions:\n\n2 3 8 → for j=2 and 3, set their max_h to min(10, 8) → 8.\n\nThen 3 4 7 → for j=3 and 4. For j=3, current max_h is 8. Now compare to 7. So set to 7. For j=4, set to 7.\n\nSo the max_h array is [10, 8, 7, 7]. Sum is 10² +8² +7² +7² = 100+64+49+49= 262. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother test case: suppose there are overlapping restrictions. For example, n=2, h=5, m=2. Restrictions are [1,2,3], [1,1,4]. Then for the first restriction, j=1 and 2 are set to 3. Then the second restriction applies to j=1, which is already 3. Since 3 is less than 4, nothing changes. So the max_h is [3,3]. Sum is 18.\n\nAnother case: if a house is covered by multiple restrictions. Like, for house 1, there are two restrictions: [1,1, 2], and [1,2,3]. Then during processing, the first restriction sets house 1 to 2. Then the second restriction processes house 1, and since 2 is less than 3, no change. So the max_h is 2. Which is correct because the first restriction requires that the max in [1,1] is <=2. So even though the second restriction allows up to 3 in [1,2], the first restriction requires that house 1 is <=2. So the code handles that.\n\nSo this approach works. Therefore, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize max_h as a list of h for each of the n positions.\n\nThen for each of the m restrictions:\n\n   read l, r, x.\n\n   for j in range l to r (inclusive):\n\n       if max_h[j-1] > x:\n\n           max_h[j-1] = x\n\nThen compute sum of squares.\n\nBut wait, in Python, lists are 0-based. So for the spots 1..n, we can have a list of size n, indexes 0..n-1.\n\nSo for each restriction l_i, r_i, x_i. For example, if l_i is 1, r_i is 3, then we loop j from 1 to 3 (inclusive), which in 0-based is 0 to 2.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor each restriction:\n\n    l, r, x = ... \n\n    for j in range(l-1, r):  # because in Python, range is exclusive on upper bound. So l-1 to r-1 inclusive. Wait, no. For example, l=1, r=3. So the original indices are 1,2,3. So in 0-based, 0,1,2. So the loop should be for j in range(l-1, r) ?\n\nYes. Because l-1 is 0, r is 3. So range(0,3) gives 0,1,2. So yes.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor each of the m restrictions:\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for j in range(l-1, r):\n\n        if max_h[j] > x:\n\n            max_h[j] = x\n\nOnce that is done, compute the sum of squares.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=1, h=5, m=0. Then the max_h is [5], sum is 25.\n\nCase 2: m=0. All houses can be set to h. Sum is n * h².\n\nAnother case: overlapping restrictions. For example, n=2, m=2. Restrictions [1,2, 3], [1,2, 2]. Then the first restriction sets both houses to 3, then the second restriction sets both to 2. So sum is 2² * 2 = 8.\n\nAnother case: a restriction that is redundant. For example, a restriction on [1,1] with x=5, but h is 5. Then nothing changes.\n\nAnother case: a restriction with x larger than h. For example, h=3, and a restriction on [1,1] with x=5. Then the code would set the house to min(3,5) → 3. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code handles all these cases.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nmax_h = [h] * n\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for j in range(l-1, r):\n\n        if max_h[j] > x:\n\n            max_h[j] = x\n\nsum_sq = sum( [a*a for a in max_h] )\n\nprint(sum_sq)\n\nWait, but wait, the code for the loop:\n\nWait, the range is l-1 to r, but in Python, range is up to but not including the end. So for example, if l=1, r=3, then range(l-1, r) is range(0,3) → 0,1,2 → which are the indices for 1,2,3. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the first example:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nProcessing:\n\nInitially, max_h = [3,3,3]\n\nFirst restriction: l=1, r=1, x=1. So j ranges from 0 to 0 (range(0,1)), so index 0. Set to 1. Now [1,3,3]\n\nSecond restriction: l=2, r=2. So j ranges from 1 to 1. Check if 3 > 3? No. So no change. [1,3,3]\n\nThird restriction: l=3, r=3. j ranges from 2 to 2. Check if 3>2 → yes. So set to 2. Now [1,3,2]. Sum is 1+9+4=14. Correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\nInput is 4 10 2\n\n2 3 8\n\n3 4 7\n\nInitial max_h is [10,10,10,10]\n\nFirst restriction l=2, r=3. So indices 1 and 2 (since range(2-1=1, 3) → 1, 2. So for j=1 and 2. Set to 8. Now [10,8,8,10]\n\nSecond restriction l=3, r=4. So indices 2 and 3. For j=2: current value is 8. x=7. 8>7 → set to 7. j=3: 10>7 → set to 7. So max_h becomes [10,8,7,7]. Sum is 100 + 64 + 49 + 49 = 262. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for these examples.\n\nWhat about when a restriction is on a range that includes multiple houses, and some of them have already been restricted by previous restrictions?\n\nLike, say n=2, h=5, m=2. First restriction is [1,2] with x=3. Then another restriction [1,2] with x=4. Then the first restriction sets both houses to 3. The second restriction would check for each house, but since 3 is less than 4, no change. So the max_h remains [3,3]. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: if a restriction is applied to a range that includes a house already set to a lower value. For example, n=2, h=5. First restriction [1,2] x=3. Then [1,1] x=2. The first restriction sets both to 3. Then the second restriction applies to j=0 (house 1). It's 3>2, so set to 2. Now the max_h is [2,3]. Then, the restriction [1,2] x=3 is already satisfied, since the max is 3. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is straightforward. Now, the code needs to read the input. However, the input format is given as a list of inputs. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m.\n\nEach of the next m lines contains three integers l_i, r_i, x_i.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example is given as:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nWait, but that's probably the way the input is presented in the problem. But in reality, the actual input is read from stdin. So the code should read from stdin. For example, the first line is n, h, m, then m lines follow.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided two test cases. But the code is supposed to process one input. So the code must read from standard input, which for programming competition problems is the usual case.\n\nSo the code must read from stdin. For example, in the first example, the input is:\n\n3 3 3\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 3\n\n3 3 2\n\nWhich would be read as:\n\nn=3, h=3, m=3. Then 3 lines of restrictions.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n, h, m from input.\n\nThen read m lines, each with l, r, x.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nn, h, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nmax_h = [h] * n\n\nfor _ in range(m):\n\n    l, r, x = map(int, input().split())\n\n    for j in range(l-1, r):\n\n        if max_h[j] > x:\n\n            max_h[j] = x\n\nprint(sum(a*a for a in max_h))\n\nWait, but in Python, the code for reading the input is straightforward. But what about when there are multiple test cases? Like the sample input shows two test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains three integers n, h, m.\n\nThen m lines follow.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are two examples. However, the code is supposed to process a single test case. The sample input shows two examples, but in practice, the code is supposed to read one test case. So perhaps the sample input is presented as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one.\n\nSo the code is correct as written.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the first input is:\n\n['3 3 3\\n1 1 1\\n2 2 3\\n3 3 2', '4 10 2\\n2 3 8\\n3 4 7']\n\nWhich is two test cases. But the code is supposed to handle one test case. So perhaps the problem is that the user provided two test cases as examples, but the actual code should process a single test case.\n\nTherefore, the code as written is correct.\n\nSo the code is as above. Let me write it in Python.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the sample outputs are ['14', '262'], which correspond to the two test cases. So the code should process each test case. But in the problem, the code is supposed to read from stdin, which for programming competition problems is one test case. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n, h, m.\n\nInitialize max_h as [h]*n.\n\nProcess each of the m restrictions, updating the max_h as needed.\n\nThen compute the sum of squares.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let me code this in Python.\n\nBut wait, the code may have to read multiple test cases. Wait, no. The problem says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem\", and the input is given as per the problem statement. So the code is supposed to read a single test case. For example, in the first sample input, the code would read the first line as 3 3 3, then three lines of restrictions, and output 14.\n\nBut the sample input shows two test cases. But in programming competition problems, each test case is handled separately. However, the code is supposed to read from stdin, which for the problem is one test case. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code is as written.\n\nNow, testing for possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, m=0. Output is 1^2 * h^2. For example, n=1, h=5, m=0 → output 25.\n\nEdge case 2: n=1, m=1, restriction [1,1, 0]. So the max_h is 0. Sum is 0.\n\nEdge case 3: multiple restrictions on the same range. For example, n=2, m=2, restrictions [1,2, 3], [1,2, 2]. The code would process the first restriction, setting both to 3, then the second restriction, setting both to 2. Sum is 2^2 + 2^2 = 8.\n\nAnother case: overlapping ranges. For example, n=3, m=2. Restriction [1,3, 5], then [2,2, 3]. The first restriction sets all to 5. The second restriction sets position 2 to 3. So the max_h is [5,3,5]. Sum is 25 +9 +25 = 59.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Python code is as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum profit possible from building houses on a street with given zoning restrictions.
