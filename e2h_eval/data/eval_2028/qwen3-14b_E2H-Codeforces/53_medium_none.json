    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and the output is the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' appears starting at index 0 and 2, so overlapping is allowed. The answer here is 3.\n\nSo the brute force approach would be to check all possible substrings and see if they appear more than once. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, the number of possible substrings is O(n^2), which for n=100 is 10,000. For each substring, checking if it appears again could take O(n) time, leading to O(n^3) time. But with n=100, that's 1e6 operations, which should be manageable.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Alternatively, we can generate all possible substrings, track their occurrences, and then find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Generate all possible substrings of the string, along with their starting and ending indices.\n2. For each substring, record all the starting positions where it occurs.\n3. For each substring, check if there are at least two starting positions. If so, note its length.\n4. Find the maximum such length.\n\nBut generating all substrings and storing them in a dictionary might be feasible here.\n\nWait, but how to generate all substrings? For each possible start index (i from 0 to len(s)-1), and for each possible end index (j from i+1 to len(s)), the substring s[i:j]. Then for each of these substrings, we can store the list of starting indices.\n\nBut for each substring, even if it's the same as another, we need to track all their starting positions. For example, in 'ababa', the substring 'ab' occurs at positions 0 and 2. So when we check for each substring, if there are at least two starting positions, then it's a candidate.\n\nBut how do I generate all possible substrings and track their occurrences?\n\nAn approach could be:\n\n- Create a dictionary where keys are substrings and values are lists of starting indices where they occur.\n\nThen, for each substring in the dictionary, if the length of the list is >= 2, we consider the length of the substring as a candidate for the maximum.\n\nBut generating all substrings and checking their occurrences may be computationally feasible for n=100.\n\nLet me think about how to generate all possible substrings. For example, for a string of length n, there are n*(n+1)/2 possible substrings. For n=100, that's 5050 substrings. For each substring, we can check all possible starting positions.\n\nBut for each substring, how do I collect all the starting positions?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible substring length l (from the maximum possible down to 1), check all possible substrings of that length. For each such substring, check if it appears again elsewhere in the string. If yes, then return l as the maximum. Because we're checking from largest to smallest, the first occurrence of such a substring would be the answer.\n\nThis approach might be more efficient because once we find the maximum possible length, we can stop early.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate over possible lengths l from min(len(s), max possible) down to 1.\n\n- For each l, check all possible substrings of length l. For each such substring, check if it appears at least two times in the string.\n\n- Once any such l is found, return l as the maximum.\n\nThe question is, how to check if a substring of length l appears at least twice.\n\nFor example, for each l, iterate through all possible starting positions i (from 0 to len(s) - l). For each i, take the substring s[i:i+l], and check if this substring exists again in the string at a different position. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nWell, for each l, we can collect all substrings of length l and track their counts. If any substring occurs at least twice, then return l as the answer.\n\nSo for example, for l=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So the count for 'aba' is 2. Hence, l=3 is valid.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor l in range (max_length, 0, -1):\n\n   create a set or a dictionary to track substrings of length l.\n\n   for each i in 0 to len(s) - l:\n\n      substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n      if substr has been seen before (i.e., already in the set), then return l as the answer.\n\n      else add substr to the set.\n\n   after checking all substrings of length l, if any of them appeared at least twice, return l.\n\nBut wait, the above approach would not work because for a substring that appears multiple times, we need to check if it appears at least two times. So for example, for each l, we can collect all substrings of length l, and check if any of them occurs more than once. So for that, for each l, we can create a frequency dictionary. Then, for each substring in that frequency dictionary, if the count is >=2, then return l.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps for each l, we can check all substrings of length l, and track their occurrences. If during this process, we find a substring that's already been seen once, then we can immediately return l as the answer (since we are checking l from largest to smallest, the first occurrence of such a l is the maximum possible).\n\nWait, but for example, if there are multiple substrings of length l that appear twice, but we can return l once any such substring is found.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nfor l in range (len(s), 0, -1):\n\n   seen = set()\n\n   for i in range(0, len(s) - l + 1):\n\n      substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n      if substr in seen:\n\n          return l\n\n      else:\n\n          seen.add(substr)\n\nreturn 0\n\nWait, but this would miss cases where a substring appears more than once but not overlapping. Wait, no, because even if the same substring appears in two different positions, even if overlapping, the code would catch it. For example, in 'ababa', for l=3, the first substr is 'aba' (i=0), then i=1: 'bab', i=2: 'aba' again. So when i=2, substr is 'aba', which is already in seen (added when i=0). So returns 3.\n\nYes. So this approach would work. However, this approach checks for any substring of length l that occurs at least twice. Because once a substring is found again, we return l.\n\nBut what about if the same substring occurs more than once, but the first occurrence is not the same as the second? For example, if a substring appears three times, then the first time it's added to the set, then when the second occurrence comes, it's found in the set and returns l.\n\nSo this approach is correct.\n\nBut then, for each l, the code checks all possible substrings of length l, and if any of them occurs more than once, returns l. So the first l (starting from the largest possible) for which this is true is the answer.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef longest_substring(s):\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(0, n - l + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                return l\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    return 0\n\nWait, but this code would return the first l where any substring of length l occurs twice. But what about if there are multiple l's? For example, the maximum possible l is the first one found.\n\nBut this approach would work because we check from the largest l down. So the first l that satisfies the condition is the maximum possible.\n\nBut let's test this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd'\n\nThe possible l's are 4,3,2,1.\n\nFor l=4: only one substring, 'abcd' → no duplicates. So proceed.\n\nl=3: substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. No duplicates. Proceed.\n\nl=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. All unique. Proceed.\n\nl=1: substrings are 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' → all unique. So returns 0. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → output is 3.\n\nFor l=5: substrings are 'ababa' → only once. No.\n\nl=4: substrings are 'abab', 'baba' → no duplicates.\n\nl=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. When i=0, substr is 'aba' added to seen. Then i=1, 'bab' added. Then i=2, substr is 'aba' which is in seen. So return 3. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' → output is 2.\n\nCheck for l=3: substrings are 'zzz' (only once). Then l=2. The substrings are 'zz' (i=0), 'zz' (i=1). So when i=1, substr is 'zz' which is already in seen (from i=0). So returns 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa'. What's the maximum? The maximum is 4. Because 'aaaa' occurs at positions 0-3 and 1-4. So for l=4, the code would find that.\n\nYes. So the code seems to handle that.\n\nWhat about overlapping occurrences? Like 'abab' → the substring 'ab' occurs at 0 and 2. So for l=2, the code would find that. So the code would return 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input, process each string, and output the correct value.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first input line containing the string. Wait, no, the sample input shows:\n\nInput is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] but perhaps that's just an example. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. But the sample input shows a list of strings. Wait, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, etc.\n\nBut the sample input shows:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nWhich is a list of three strings. But the output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nSo perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the problem description. Because the original problem says that the input is a single string. However, the sample input shows multiple strings. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the user intended to present multiple test cases. For example, perhaps the input is a list of strings, each on separate lines, but the problem's input description is wrong.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo perhaps the input is a single string. However, the sample input shows a list of strings. That's confusing.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's example:\n\nInput:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nOutput:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nWhich suggests that the input is a list of strings, and for each string, the output is the corresponding answer. But the problem says that the input is a single string. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that's not matching the actual input. Maybe the original problem is that the input is a single string, and the sample input is perhaps a mistake. Or perhaps the problem is that the user intended to have multiple test cases, but the problem description is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as a Python list, but the actual input is multiple lines, each being a string.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. So for example, if the input is 'ababa', then the output is 3.\n\nBut the sample input shows a list of three strings. So perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the sample input. For example, perhaps the actual input is multiple lines, each being a separate test case. So the code should read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate string, and output the answers for each.\n\nBut the original problem's input says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is a mistake.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, it's possible that the problem requires processing multiple test cases. For example, the input is a list of strings, and for each, output the answer.\n\nBut how to reconcile that with the problem's input description?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that's not standard. For example, perhaps the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read a single string. However, the sample input and output suggest that the code needs to process multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a critical point. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nOutput: Output one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\nExample:\n\nInput: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nOutput: ['0', '3', '2']\n\nSo the sample input shows three test cases. But according to the problem's input description, the input is a single string. This is a contradiction.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that's not matching the actual input format. For example, perhaps the actual input is multiple lines, each being a separate test case. For example, the first line is the number of test cases, followed by each test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is not correctly formatted, but the actual code should read a single string, and output a single number.\n\nIn that case, the sample input and output may be written as a list for clarity, but the actual input is a single string.\n\nBut the sample output shows three numbers. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user intended to have multiple test cases. For example, the input is a list of strings, each on separate lines, and the code should process each one and output the answer for each.\n\nBut given the problem's input description, this is unclear. However, given the sample input and output, it's likely that the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's sample input is not properly formatted. For example, perhaps the input is a single string, but the sample input is written as a list. For example, the input is \"abcd\", \"ababa\", \"zzz\" as separate test cases. But the problem's description says that the input is a single string.\n\nThis is a problem. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking back at the original problem statement, the user wrote:\n\n\"Input\n\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\"\n\nSo the input is a single string, and the output is a single integer.\n\nBut the sample input shows a list of three strings. The sample output shows a list of three integers. So this suggests that the problem expects multiple test cases, but the problem description is wrong.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and output as ['0', '3', '2'], perhaps the actual code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single string.\n\nThis is a contradiction. But perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that's not standard. For example, perhaps the input is a list of strings passed as a single line, but in reality, the code should read each line as a separate test case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. For example, the actual input is a list of strings, each on a separate line, and the code should process each and output the corresponding answer.\n\nBut how to know? Well, given that the sample input and output are lists, perhaps the actual code should read multiple strings from the input. For example, the input is a list of strings, each on a separate line. But the problem's description says the first line contains the string. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as a list, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. For example, the code should read all lines from stdin, split them into individual strings, and process each one.\n\nBut in that case, the code would be:\n\nRead all lines from input, for each line, process the string and output the answer.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. However, the sample input shows three strings. So perhaps the problem's sample input is incorrect, and the actual code should process a single string.\n\nBut the sample output is given as a list of three elements, which would correspond to three test cases. So this is confusing.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], and output as ['0', '3', '2'], perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single string. This is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement's sample input is not properly formatted, and the actual input is a single string, and the sample input is a list showing three separate test cases.

So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. But given the ambiguity, how to proceed?\n\nWell, looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. For example, the sample input is three strings, and the output is three numbers. Therefore, the code must read multiple strings from input, process each one, and output the corresponding answer.\n\nBut how are the test cases provided?

So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and the actual input is a list of strings, and the code should process all of them.\n\nGiven that the sample input and output are given as lists, I think that the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nFor example, in Python, the input can be read via sys.stdin.read().split() or similar. But the problem says that the input is a single string. But the sample input shows a list of strings. So perhaps the input is a list of strings, each on a separate line.\n\nAssuming that, the code would read all lines from input, process each line as a separate string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So this is very confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is not properly formatted and the actual input is a single string, and the sample input is a mistake. For example, the sample input is 'abcd', and the output is 0. Then, for 'ababa' the output is 3, and for 'zzz' it's 2. But the problem says that the input is a single string, and the output is a single number.\n\nIn this case, the code would be written to read one string from input, compute the answer, and output it.\n\nBut then the sample input and output would be for three separate cases. However, the problem's sample input shows a list of three strings, but perhaps that's just for illustration.\n\nBut the user says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So, for example, if the input is a single string, like 'ababa', then the code outputs 3.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. So how to resolve this?\n\nPerhaps the problem is that the original problem is from a programming competition, and the sample input is presented as a list for clarity, but the actual input is multiple lines. For example, the input is several lines, each being a test case.\n\nIn that case, the code should read all lines from input, process each one, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut given the problem's initial description, it's ambiguous.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, I think that the code must process multiple test cases. For example, in the sample input, there are three test cases. So the code must read all lines from input, and for each line, process the string and output the answer.\n\nThus, in Python, the code would read all lines from stdin, split them into individual strings, and process each.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, if the input is given as multiple lines, each with a string, then:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    # process s and print the result\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], which may imply that the input is passed as a single line, with the strings separated by commas. But that's unclear.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows a list, perhaps the code should read a single line, split it into individual strings, and process them. For example, the input is a single line containing the list of strings, like ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'].\n\nBut this is not standard input format. Usually, programming competition problems have each test case on a separate line.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written incorrectly, and the actual code should process a single string. In that case, the sample input and output would be for three separate test cases, but the code would read one string at a time.\n\nBut how to proceed?\n\nWell, looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code must produce the output for each of the sample inputs. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. Let's assume that the input is multiple lines, each being a separate string. Then, the code would read each line, process it, and print the answer for each.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nThen the output would be:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code should read all lines from input, process each line as a string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the problem's initial description says that the input is a single string. However, this seems to be a mistake in the problem description.\n\nIn that case, the code would be written as follows:\n\nRead all lines from stdin, for each line, process the string and output the answer.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nThe code would look like:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        # process s and print the result\n\nBut then, for each line in the input, process it.\n\nNow, the code for processing the string is as discussed earlier.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nImplement the function that, given a string, returns the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice.\n\nNow, the code for that function is:\n\ndef max_substring_length(s):\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                return l\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    return 0\n\nThen, in the main function, read each line and call this function.\n\nSo the full code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef max_substring_length(s):\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - l + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+l]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                return l\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    return 0\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        print(max_substring_length(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut let's test this code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: 'abcd' → output 0.\n\nSample input 2: 'ababa' → output 3.\n\nSample input 3: 'zzz' → output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the case where the same substring appears more than once but in overlapping positions?\n\nLike 'aaaaa' → the maximum is 4. For l=4, substrings are 'aaaa' (positions 0-3), then 'aaaa' (positions 1-4). So during the loop, when i=1, substr is 'aaaa' which is already in seen (from i=0), so returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aa' → the maximum is 1. Because the substring 'a' appears twice. For l=2, the substring is 'aa' once. For l=1, the substrings are 'a' and 'a'. So during the loop for l=1, the first 'a' is added to seen, then the second 'a' is found in seen, returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'aaa' → for l=2, substrings are 'aa' (i=0), 'aa' (i=1). So returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the case where the same substring appears multiple times but not overlapping? Like 'ababab' → the maximum is 3. For example, 'aba' appears at 0 and 2, but also 'bab' appears at 1 and 3. So the code will find for l=3, the first occurrence is 'aba', then 'bab', then 'aba' again. So returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, the code reads from stdin, each line is processed as a separate string. The output is printed for each line.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. But given the sample input and output, this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nTherefore, the code should be written as above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The solution must handle multiple test cases efficiently and correctly identify overlapping substrings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read multiple lines from standard input, each representing a separate string to be processed.\n2. **Substring Search**: For each string, check all possible substrings starting from the longest possible length down to 1. This ensures that we find the maximum length as soon as possible.\n3. **Set Usage**: Use a set to track substrings of a given length. If a substring is found again, it indicates that it appears at least twice, and we immediately return the length of that substring.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef max_substring_length(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n        seen = set()\n        for i in range(n - l + 1):\n            substr = s[i:i+l]\n            if substr in seen:\n                return l\n            seen.add(substr)\n    return 0\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        print(max_substring_length(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The `main` function reads each line from standard input, strips any extraneous whitespace, and processes each string individually.\n2. **Substring Length Check**: For each string, the function `max_substring_length` iterates from the longest possible substring length down to 1. This ensures that the first valid substring found (which appears at least twice) is the longest possible.\n3. **Tracking Substrings**: Using a set to track substrings of the current length allows efficient checking for duplicates. If a substring is found again, the length of that substring is returned immediately.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest repeating substring by leveraging the properties of sets for quick lookups and iterating from the largest possible length downwards. This method is both effective and efficient for the given constraints.",
