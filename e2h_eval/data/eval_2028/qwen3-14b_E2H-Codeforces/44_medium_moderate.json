He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, Polycarp has a list of n problems with difficulties a_1 to a_n. He wants to practice for exactly k days. Each day he solves at least one problem, and the order is fixed. So, the way to split the problems is into k contiguous segments, each starting from the previous end. For each day, the profit is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The total profit is the sum of these maxima. We need to find the maximum possible total profit and output the split.\n\nThe input gives n and k, then the array a. The output is the maximum profit and the split into k numbers.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Because for each position and number of days, we can track the maximum profit.\n\nLet's think about DP[i][j] as the maximum profit for the first i problems divided into j days.\n\nThe base case would be DP[0][0] = 0, but maybe it's better to think of DP[i][j] as the maximum profit for the first i problems split into j days.\n\nThe transition would be: For DP[i][j], we can look at all possible m < i where the j-th day is from m+1 to i. Then DP[i][j] = max(DP[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i])) for all m from j-1 to i-1 (since each day must have at least one problem).\n\nBut calculating the max for each segment each time would be O(n^3) time. For n up to 2000, that's 2000^3 = 8e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo we need a way to optimize this. Let's think about precomputing the max for all possible intervals. We can precompute a 2D array max_range where max_range[l][r] is the maximum value in a from index l to r (0-based or 1-based? Well, let's decide later). But for n=2000, this would be O(n^2) space, which is 4 million entries. That's manageable.\n\nOnce we have that, the DP transitions would take O(n^2k) time. Let's see: for each i from 1 to n, for each j from 1 to k, and for each m from j-1 to i-1. So for each DP[i][j], we have O(i) possibilities. For n=2000 and k=2000, this would be O(n^2k) = 2000^3 = 8e10 again. Which is way too slow.\n\nWait, but k can be up to n. So that approach may not work. Need a better idea.\n\nWait, but for the constraints of n up to 2000, maybe O(n^2k) is too slow. Let's check. For n=2000, and k=2000, the O(n^2k) is 2000*2000*2000 = 8e10 operations. That's way beyond what can be handled in Python in reasonable time. So this approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: since the problem requires splitting into exactly k days, and each day must have at least one problem, perhaps there's a way to optimize the DP transitions by considering that when we split the first i problems into j days, the last day could be of length 1, 2, ..., up to i - (j-1) problems. Wait, but that's similar to the previous approach.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe for each DP[i][j], we can compute the maximum in a smarter way. For example, when considering the j-th day, the last segment can be from m+1 to i, and for that segment, the maximum can be found incrementally. For example, when moving m from i-1 down to j-1, we can track the current maximum.\n\nLet me think. Suppose for DP[i][j], we want to find the best m. For each possible m (from j-1 to i-1), the segment [m+1, i] has a maximum value. If we can compute this maximum as we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, then we can avoid recomputing it each time.\n\nFor example, when considering the j-th day, and trying to split the first i problems into j days, the last day can be of length 1, 2, etc. Let's say we loop m from i-1 down to j-1. For each m, the segment is m+1 to i. So for m = i-1, the segment is [i], which is a[i]. For m = i-2, the segment is [i-1, i], max is max(a[i-1], a[i]), etc. So if we track the current max as we move m from right to left, we can compute the max for each segment in O(1) per step.\n\nThis would reduce the time complexity. Let's calculate:\n\nFor each i (from 1 to n), and for each j (from 1 to k), we can compute DP[i][j] by considering all possible m (from j-1 to i-1) and for each m, compute the max of the segment [m+1, i]. If we do this with the incremental max, then for each DP[i][j], the inner loop (for m) takes O(i) time. But the total time would be O(n^2k). However, for n=2000 and k=2000, this is still O(8e10) steps, which is way too slow. But perhaps for the given constraints, with n up to 2000 and k up to n, but in practice, maybe some optimizations can be done.\n\nWait, but what's the actual maximum value of k? Since k can be up to n. For example, when k = n, each day must have exactly one problem. Then the answer is the sum of all elements. So in this case, the DP would be straightforward. But for general cases, how to proceed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the constraints are tight enough that even O(n^2k) is manageable with some optimizations. Let's think about the numbers. Let's say n=2000, k=2000. Then the worst case would be O(2000^3) = 8e10 operations. Even if each operation is a simple addition, in Python, which can handle about 1e6 operations per second, this would take 8e4 seconds, which is impossible. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nWe need a better idea. Let's think again about the problem.\n\nAnother observation: since each day's segment is a prefix of the next day. For example, the first day's segment is some length t1, the second day's starts after that, etc. So the split is into k parts, each of which is a consecutive block starting from the previous end.\n\nNow, for the DP approach, maybe we can find a way to optimize the transitions.\n\nAnother idea: For the DP[i][j], the maximum profit for the first i problems split into j days. To compute DP[i][j], we can consider that the j-th day ends at i. So the j-th day could be of length l, where l ranges from 1 to i - (j-1) (since the previous j-1 days must have at least j-1 problems). So for each possible l (the length of the j-th day), the previous part is i - l problems split into j-1 days.\n\nThus, DP[i][j] = max over l (DP[i - l][j-1] + max(a[i - l + 1 ... i]))\n\nBut again, the same problem of computing the max for each interval.\n\nBut if we can compute the max for a[i - l + 1 ... i] quickly, perhaps using a precomputed structure.\n\nBut even so, for each DP[i][j], we need to try all possible l. For example, for j=1, l must be i, so DP[i][1] = max(a[1..i]).\n\nBut for j>1, for each i and j, we need to consider all possible l (lengths of the last day) from 1 to i - (j-1). So for each DP[i][j], the number of possible l is O(i). Again, leading to O(n^2k) time.\n\nBut perhaps with some optimizations, like precomputing the max for all intervals, and then using that in the DP transitions.\n\nLet's think about precomputing a max_range array. For each start and end, store the max. This can be done in O(n^2) time. For n=2000, that's 4 million entries, which is manageable.\n\nOnce that's precomputed, then for each possible l, the max of the last segment can be retrieved in O(1) time.\n\nBut even with that, the DP is O(n^2k) time. Which is still too slow for n=2000 and k=2000.\n\nWait, but what is the actual value of k? For example, if k is small, like 1 or 2, then the time is manageable. But for larger k, it's not. However, perhaps the constraints of the problem are such that the intended solution uses this approach, and with n=2000, the O(n^2k) might be acceptable with some optimizations. Let's see:\n\nIf n is 2000, and k is 2000, then O(n^2k) is 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too big for Python. But if k is up to 2000, but for each i and j, the inner loop is O(1) or O(n), perhaps with some optimizations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to optimize the DP further. Let's think about the constraints on j. Since j can't exceed i, because each day must have at least one problem. So for each i, j ranges up to min(k, i). Also, for j=1, the answer is the max of the entire array up to i.\n\nAnother idea: For the DP[i][j], the maximum value can be computed using the fact that when adding a new day, the last segment's maximum is the maximum between the previous max and the new element. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, for example, when considering the last day's segment. Suppose we have a segment that ends at position i, and starts at position m+1. As we move m from i-1 down to some value, the segment [m+1, i] increases in length. The maximum can be tracked as we go. For example, when considering the last day's segment, for the current i and j, we can iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, and track the current maximum. For each m, the segment is m+1 to i. So when m decreases by 1 (i.e., moving left), the segment becomes longer by one element on the left. So the new max is max(current_max, a[m+1]).\n\nWait, that's a good point. Let's think for a specific i and j. Let's say we're trying to compute DP[i][j]. For this, we can iterate m from i-1 down to j-1 (so that the last day's segment is of length 1, 2, ..., i - (j-1) ). For each m, the last day's segment is from m+1 to i. Let's track the current maximum as we go. For example, when m = i-1, the segment is [i], max is a[i]. When m = i-2, the segment is [i-1, i], max is max(a[i-1], a[i]). When m = i-3, the segment is [i-2, i], max is max(a[i-2], previous max). So for each m, we can keep track of the current maximum. This way, for each i and j, the inner loop (over m) can be done in O(i) time, but with O(1) per step for computing the max.\n\nSo, combining this with the DP transitions:\n\nDP[i][j] = max( DP[m][j-1] + current_max )\n\nwhere m ranges from j-1 to i-1, and current_max is the max of the segment [m+1, i].\n\nThis approach would allow us to compute the DP[i][j] in O(n^2) time for all i and j. Wait, no. For each i and j, the inner loop is O(i) steps, so overall O(n^2k) steps.\n\nBut perhaps with the optimized max calculation, the code can be written efficiently enough in Python to pass for n=2000 and k=2000.\n\nBut wait, for n=2000, and k=2000, the total steps would be 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e10. That's way too big. Even if each step is a single operation, it's impossible. So there's a problem here.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe we can find that for certain values of j, we can compute the DP more efficiently. For example, when j is small. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nWait, another thought: the problem requires that each day has at least one problem. So for the DP[i][j], we have j ≤ i. Also, the minimal value of j is 1, maximal is i.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize the DP[i][j] for j.\n\nLet me think again about the constraints. For example, for j=1, DP[i][1] = max of a[1..i]. For j=2, DP[i][2] = max over m from 1 to i-1 of (DP[m][1] + max(a[m+1..i])).\n\nBut for j=2, the DP[i][2] can be computed by considering all possible splits into two parts. However, with the optimized max calculation, this can be done in O(n) for each i.\n\nBut again, for general j, it's O(n^2k) time.\n\nAnother idea: Let's think about the maximum possible k. For example, when k is large, but not equal to n. For instance, when k is close to n. But I don't see how that helps.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem can be transformed into a different form. For example, since the maximum profit is the sum of the maxima of each segment, and each segment is a consecutive block. The problem resembles the problem of partitioning the array into k segments to maximize the sum of the maxima of each segment.\n\nThis seems similar to some known DP problem. Let me think about the standard approach for such problems.\n\nYes, the standard DP approach for this kind of problem is the one I mentioned before, where DP[i][j] is the maximum sum for the first i elements partitioned into j segments. And the transitions involve trying all possible previous positions m, and taking the max of DP[m][j-1] + max of the segment m+1 to i.\n\nBut the issue is the time complexity. However, for n=2000 and k=2000, this approach is not feasible. However, perhaps the constraints in the problem are not tight. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nThe input constraints are 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2000. So, n can be 2000, and k can be 2000. So, for the worst case, the approach is O(n^2k) = 8e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: Can we find a way to reduce the time complexity? Let's think about the following: For each j, when computing DP[i][j], can we find a way to compute it in O(n) time per j?\n\nAnother observation: For j days, the minimal number of problems is j. So for i < j, DP[i][j] is invalid. So for each j, we can process i from j to n.\n\nBut again, this doesn't help with the time complexity.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem as follows. Since each day's segment is a consecutive block, and the profit is the maximum in that block, the optimal way to split into k days is to have the largest elements in their own segments. For example, the top k elements should be in separate segments. However, this is only a heuristic and may not hold in all cases. For example, in the sample input, the three largest elements are 9, 6, 5. But the optimal split includes 9 as a single segment, 6 as a segment, and 5 as a segment. But the sample input's split is [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2]. So the maxima are 5,6,9. So indeed, the three largest elements (5,6,9) are each in their own segments. However, the third segment's max is 9, which is the largest. The second segment's max is 6, which is the second largest. The first segment's max is 5, which is the third largest. But there are other elements (like 2000 in the third example) which are even larger.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal strategy is to select the k largest elements and assign each to a segment. However, the positions of these elements matter. For example, if the largest element is in the middle of the array, then the segments must be arranged so that each of the k largest elements is in a separate segment. However, the rest of the elements can be grouped in a way that their maxima are as high as possible.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nThis seems like a greedy approach. However, it's unclear how to implement it, especially considering overlapping segments and dependencies between choices.\n\nBut maybe the DP approach can be optimized with some observations. Let's think again about the DP[i][j] and the way to compute it.\n\nFor example, when we compute DP[i][j], we can consider that for the last segment, which is of length l, and the previous j-1 segments are on the first i - l elements. For each possible l (from 1 to i - (j-1)), the DP[i][j] is max(DP[i-l][j-1] + max(a[i-l+1 ... i])).\n\nNow, for each i and j, the max over l. But how to find this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following: For each j, we can compute DP[i][j] based on DP[i-l][j-1] and the max of the last segment. But how to find the best l for each i and j.\n\nBut even with this, it's not obvious.\n\nAlternative idea: For each j, we can compute the DP[i][j] for all i in O(n^2) time. For example, for j=1, O(n) time. For j=2, O(n^2) time. But for j up to k, this would be O(kn^2) time. Which is the same as before.\n\nBut perhaps for the given constraints, even O(n^2k) is manageable with some optimizations. Let's do some calculations.\n\nAssume that n is 2000, and k is 2000. Then O(n^2k) is 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. Even if each operation is a simple arithmetic operation, Python can't handle that. But perhaps the actual code can be optimized.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, the test cases don't have k=2000. Or maybe there's a way to optimize the DP.\n\nAnother idea: For the case when k is large, like k = n, the answer is simply the sum of all elements. Because each day has exactly one problem, so the profit is the sum of all elements. Similarly, when k = 1, it's the maximum of the entire array.\n\nBut for other cases, perhaps there's a way to find that for j days, the DP[i][j] can be computed in O(n) time per i. But I don't see it.\n\nWait, but maybe for each j, the DP[i][j] can be computed using some convex hull trick or other optimization. However, I don't see an obvious way to apply those techniques here.\n\nLet me think again about the DP[i][j] recurrence. For DP[i][j], it's the maximum over m < i of DP[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nIf I can find for each i and j, the best m to split, then I can compute DP[i][j].\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother observation: the max(a[m+1..i]) is non-decreasing as m decreases. Because when m decreases, the segment [m+1..i] grows to the left, including more elements. Therefore, the max can only stay the same or increase as m decreases. \n\nWait, no. For example, if the new element added is smaller than the previous max, the max remains the same. If it's larger, it increases. So yes, as m decreases (i.e., the segment becomes longer), the max is non-decreasing.\n\nSo, for a fixed i and j, when we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, the max of [m+1..i] is non-decreasing.\n\nNow, let's consider the DP[m][j-1] + max_val. Since max_val is non-decreasing as m decreases, and DP[m][j-1] is something else. How does that affect the maximum?\n\nIt's unclear. But perhaps there's a way to find for each i and j, the optimal m.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of an example. Suppose for a particular i and j, when we decrease m, the max_val increases. However, DP[m][j-1] could be decreasing or increasing. So the sum could have various behaviors.\n\nBut perhaps we can use this property to find the optimal m for each i and j.\n\nAnother idea: For each i and j, the optimal m is somewhere where the DP[m][j-1] is as large as possible, and the max_val is also as large as possible. However, since these two factors are in conflict (increasing m decreases the max_val but allows for more elements in the previous segments), it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, since the max_val is non-decreasing with m decreasing, and DP[m][j-1] is the value for the first m elements in j-1 days, perhaps there's a way to find the optimal m quickly.\n\nBut I'm stuck here.\n\nLet me think of the sample input. For the first example:\n\nn=8, k=3, a=[5,4,2,6,5,1,9,2]\n\nThe DP[8][3] is 20, achieved by splitting into [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2]. The maxima are 5,6,9.\n\nNow, during the computation of DP[8][3], for m=5 (i=8, j=3), the previous part is first 5 elements split into 2 days. The max of the segment [6,5] is 6. So DP[5][2] + 6. What's DP[5][2]?\n\nWell, for DP[5][2], we can split the first 5 elements into two days. The optimal split would be [5,4,2], [6,5], which gives 5+6=11. So DP[5][2] = 11.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nBack to the DP approach. Maybe the code can be written with the optimized max calculation, and hope that it passes within the time constraints.\n\nLet me think about implementing this approach.\n\nFirst, precompute the max_range array. But perhaps during the DP computation, we can calculate the max on the fly.\n\nFor example, during the computation of DP[i][j], for each possible m (from i-1 down to j-1), we can track the current max as we move m.\n\nLet me outline the steps.\n\nInitialize a DP table with dimensions (n+1) x (k+1). Since the problem is 1-based or 0-based? Probably easier to use 1-based indices.\n\nInitialize DP[0][0] = 0. For other entries, initialize to -infinity or something.\n\nThen for each i from 1 to n:\n\n   for each j from 1 to min(k, i):\n\n       if j == 1:\n\n           DP[i][j] = max of a[1..i]\n\n       else:\n\n           current_max = 0\n\n           for m in range(i-1, j-2, -1):\n\n               current_max = max(current_max, a[m+1])\n\n               if j-1 <= m:\n\n                   DP[i][j] = max( DP[i][j], DP[m][j-1] + current_max )\n\nSo for each i and j, we iterate m from i-1 down to j-1, and track the current_max as the max of the segment [m+1, i].\n\nThis way, for each i and j, the inner loop runs O(i) times, but with O(1) per step.\n\nThis approach would be O(n^2k) time.\n\nBut for n=2000, and k=2000, this is 8e10 operations. Which is way too slow for Python.\n\nBut perhaps the actual test cases are not that bad. For example, maybe the time limit is lenient, or the actual code can be optimized with some tricks.\n\nBut given that the problem is from a programming competition, and the sample inputs have n=8, 5, 4, etc., perhaps the intended solution is this DP approach with the optimized max tracking.\n\nBut how can this be feasible for n=2000 and k=2000?\n\nWait, but for j=1, the code runs O(n) steps. For j=2, O(n^2) steps. For j=3, O(n^2) steps, etc. So the total time is O(kn^2). But for k=2000 and n=2000, this is 8e10 steps, which is way too big.\n\nBut perhaps there's another observation: the maximum value of k is n. So, for example, when k = n, the answer is sum of all elements. So perhaps we can handle this case separately. Similarly for other cases where k is large.\n\nBut even then, for general cases, the DP approach is still too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think about the fact that for the DP[i][j], when j increases, the value of DP[i][j] can be computed in a certain way. For example, when j increases by 1, we need to split into one more segment.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: the maximum possible value for DP[i][j] is the sum of the j largest elements in the first i elements. But how to ensure that they are in separate segments. But this is just a heuristic and not directly helpful.\n\nWait, but perhaps the optimal solution for splitting into j segments is to select the j largest elements in the array, and make sure that each of them is in a separate segment. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose the array has elements [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n], and the j largest elements are located at positions p_1, p_2, ..., p_j. Then, to ensure that each of them is in a separate segment, we need to split the array such that each of these elements is in its own segment. The rest of the elements can be grouped into the segments in a way that their maxima are as large as possible.\n\nBut how to find this split?\n\nThis seems like a greedy approach, but again, it's not clear how to implement it.\n\nAlternatively, for the DP approach, perhaps we can find that for j days, the optimal way to split the first i elements is to take the best possible split for j-1 days up to m, and then take the max of the remaining segment. But again, this brings us back to the same DP approach.\n\nAt this point, I think that the DP approach is the only way forward, and perhaps the problem expects us to implement it with the optimized max calculation, and hope that it's fast enough with some optimizations in Python.\n\nSo let's proceed with writing the code for the DP approach.\n\nNow, considering that in Python, nested loops are slow, but perhaps with n=2000 and k=2000, it's not feasible. However, for the problem's constraints, perhaps the actual test cases are not the worst case. For example, if k is small, then the code would run faster.\n\nBut for the worst case, it's impossible. So perhaps there's a way to optimize further.\n\nWait, another idea: for each j, we can compute the DP[i][j] for all i in O(n^2) time. But for j up to k. However, the same as before.\n\nAnother observation: For each j, the DP[i][j] depends only on DP[m][j-1], which for j-1 is already computed. So we can compute the DP in order of increasing j.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nIn Python, for n=2000 and k=2000, even with O(n^2k) steps, it's impossible. So perhaps the problem has a different approach.\n\nLet me think again about the problem. The total profit is the sum of the maxima of each segment. How to maximize this sum.\n\nAnother observation: Each time we split the array into segments, the sum of the maxima is the sum of the maximums of each segment. To maximize this sum, we want each segment to have as high a maximum as possible. However, since the segments are contiguous and ordered, splitting the array into segments where each segment contains one of the largest elements.\n\nFor example, the largest element must be in its own segment. Otherwise, if it's in a segment with other elements, the maximum of that segment is the largest element, but if we split it into its own segment, then we can have that maximum counted once. However, if we have multiple large elements, they should be in their own segments.\n\nBut how to formalize this.\n\nLet me think about the following approach: the optimal solution is to have the k largest elements each in their own segments. Then, the sum is the sum of these k elements. But this is only possible if the k largest elements are positioned in the array in a way that allows them to be in separate segments. For example, if the k largest elements are in positions that allow splitting the array into k segments, each containing one of them.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, the three largest elements are 9, 6, and 5. The optimal split has each of them in their own segments. The sum is 9 + 6 +5 = 20, which matches the sample.\n\nIn the third example, the array is [1,2000,2000,2], k=2. The two largest elements are 2000 and 2000. Splitting into [1,2000] and [2000, 2] gives sum 2000 + 2000 = 4000.\n\nSo the idea is that the maximum sum is the sum of the k largest elements, provided that they can be placed into separate segments.\n\nBut how to ensure that.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes, you cannot split the array into k segments each containing one of the k largest elements. For example, if the k largest elements are all clustered together. But in that case, you can't have each in their own segment unless you split them into individual segments.\n\nWait, for example, if the array is [5, 5, 5, 5], and k=2. The maximum sum is 5 +5 = 10. Which is the sum of the two largest elements (which are all 5s). So it works.\n\nBut what if the array is [10, 9, 8, 7], and k=2. The two largest elements are 10 and 9. To split into two segments, you can split after the first element, giving [10], [9,8,7], sum 10+9=19. Or split after the second element, giving [10,9], [8,7], sum 10+8=18. Or split after third element, [10,9,8], [7], sum 10+7=17. So the best is 19, which is the sum of the two largest elements.\n\nSo this suggests that the optimal solution is to select the k largest elements and have each of them in their own segment. But how to ensure that this is possible.\n\nBut how to do that in code.\n\nThe idea is to find the positions of the k largest elements, and split the array into segments such that each of these elements is in its own segment. However, the positions of these elements must be such that they can be separated into segments.\n\nFor example, suppose the array is [5, 3, 4, 2, 6, 1, 7], and k=3. The three largest elements are 7,6,5. Their positions are 7 (index 6), 6 (index 4), 5 (index 0). To split into three segments, each containing one of these elements. So the first segment could be [5], the second [3,4,2,6], the third [1,7]. But that's not possible because the third segment would have to come after the second. So the segments must be in order.\n\nSo the segments must be split such that the positions of the k largest elements are in increasing order.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n1. Find the k largest elements in the array.\n\n2. Ensure that these elements are in increasing order of positions (since the segments are contiguous and ordered).\n\n3. Split the array into segments so that each of these elements is in a separate segment.\n\nBut how to find these positions.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, the three largest elements are 9, 6, 5. Their positions are 6 (0-based?), 3, 0. But since the segments are in order, the first segment must contain the first element (position 0), the second segment must contain position 3, and the third segment must contain position 6. So the splits would be after position 0 (segment 1), then after position 3 (segment 2), then the rest (segment 3). This gives the split [5,4,2], [6,5], [1,9,2], which matches the sample.\n\nSo the idea is to select the k largest elements, ensuring that they are in order of their positions, and split the array into k segments such that each segment contains one of these elements.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- Select the k largest elements. For example, if there are duplicates, like multiple 2000s, we need to choose the earliest ones to allow for splitting.\n\n- Sort these elements' positions in increasing order. Let's call them pos_1 < pos_2 < ... < pos_k.\n\n- Split the array into k segments as follows:\n\n   segment 1: from start to pos_1 (inclusive)\n\n   segment 2: from pos_1 + 1 to pos_2 (inclusive)\n\n   ...\n\n   segment k: from pos_{k-1} + 1 to end.\n\nBut this would ensure that each segment contains one of the largest elements, and thus the sum of the maxima is the sum of these k elements.\n\nHowever, this is only possible if the k largest elements are spread out enough to allow such a split.\n\nBut what if there are not enough elements to split into k segments? Well, since k <= n, and we're choosing k elements, it's possible.\n\nBut how to handle cases where there are multiple elements with the same value. For example, if the array is [2000, 2000, 2000], and k=2. We need to choose two of the 2000s to be in separate segments. The best split would be [2000], [2000, 2000], which gives sum 2000 + 2000 = 4000. Alternatively, [2000, 2000], [2000], which also gives the same sum.\n\nSo the approach of selecting the k largest elements and splitting them into segments would work.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Find the k largest elements in the array, and their positions. If there are multiple elements with the same value, we need to choose the earliest ones to allow for splitting.\n\nWait, but if we choose the earliest ones, then the positions are in increasing order, which allows for the split.\n\nFor example, if the array has multiple elements with the same value, we can select the first k occurrences of the largest values.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nLet's think of the following:\n\n- Create a list of tuples (value, index) for all elements.\n\n- Sort this list in descending order of value, and ascending order of index for ties.\n\n- Take the first k elements from this sorted list. These will be the k largest elements, with their positions.\n\n- Now, sort these k elements by their index in increasing order. Let's call them positions pos_",
