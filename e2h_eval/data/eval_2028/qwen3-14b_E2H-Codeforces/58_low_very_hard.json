You are given an undirected graph consisting of n vertices and m edges, not necessarily connected, without parallel edges and loops. You need to find t — the minimum number of edges that must be added to the given graph in order to form a simple cycle of an odd length, consisting of more than one vertex. Moreover, he must find w — the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle of an odd length (consisting of more than one vertex). It is prohibited to add loops or parallel edges.Two ways to add edges to the graph are considered equal if they have the same sets of added edges.Since Vitaly does not study at the university, he asked you to help him with this task.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers n and m ( — the number of vertices in the graph and the number of edges in the graph.Next m lines contain the descriptions of the edges of the graph, one edge per line. Each edge is given by a pair of integers ai, bi (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n) — the vertices that are connected by the i-th edge. All numbers in the lines are separated by a single space.It is guaranteed that the given graph doesn't contain any loops and parallel edges. The graph isn't necessarily connected.\n\n## Output\nPrint in the first line of the output two space-separated integers t and w — the minimum number of edges that should be added to the graph to form a simple cycle of an odd length consisting of more than one vertex where each vertex occurs at most once, and the number of ways to do this.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 4\\n1 2\\n1 3\\n4 2\\n4 3', '3 3\\n1 2\\n2 3\\n3 1', '3 0']\n\n### Output\n['1 2', '0 1', '3 1']\n\n## Note\nThe simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the minimum number of edges to add to a graph to form an odd-length cycle, and also count the number of ways to do that. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's required. The key here is that the cycle must be simple (no repeated vertices) and of odd length. Also, the graph is undirected, no loops or parallel edges.\n\nWait, so the original graph might already have such a cycle. In that case, t would be 0, and w would be 1? Or maybe there are multiple ways to form such cycles. But wait, the problem says that we need to find the minimal t. So if the graph already has an odd-length cycle, then t is 0, and w is the number of such possible cycles? No, no. Wait, no. Because the question is about adding edges to form such a cycle. If the original graph already contains at least one such cycle, then the answer is t=0 and w=1? Or maybe the number of ways to add zero edges (which is 1 if there's at least one existing cycle). Wait, the problem says that w is the number of ways to add t edges to form such a cycle. So if the original graph has such a cycle, then adding zero edges is one way. But how many such ways are there? Because any existing cycle would count as a way. But no, the problem says that the way is considered equal if they have the same set of added edges. Since adding zero edges would mean that the existing cycle is part of the graph. However, the problem requires that the added edges form such a cycle. But if the original graph already has such a cycle, then there's at least one way (the existing cycle). But how do we count the number of such possibilities?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the output is the number of ways to add t edges in order to form a cycle. So for example, if the original graph already has an odd-length cycle, then t is 0, and w is the number of such cycles? Or perhaps the number of possible ways to choose edges (but since no edges are added, it's just 1 way if there's at least one such cycle). But that doesn't make sense. Because the problem says that the existing cycles are already present, so the way is to not add any edges. But how many different ways can you do that? Well, if there are multiple existing cycles, but adding zero edges would imply that you're choosing any of them. However, according to the problem statement, two ways are considered the same if they have the same set of added edges. Since adding zero edges would have exactly one set (empty set), but if there are multiple existing cycles, then the answer would still be 1. Because the way is determined by the set of edges added. So even if there are multiple existing cycles, the way to add zero edges is only one way. Because you're not adding any edges. So in this case, when the graph already contains an odd-length cycle, then t is 0, and w is 1. \n\nBut looking at the sample input. For example, the second input is a triangle (3 nodes connected in a cycle). The output is 0 1. Which matches that. So yes, when the graph already has such a cycle, then t is 0 and w is 1. \n\nSo the first step is to check whether the graph already contains an odd-length cycle. If it does, then t is 0 and w is 1. Otherwise, we need to compute the minimal t and the number of ways.\n\nBut how to check if the graph has an odd-length cycle? That's equivalent to checking if the graph is bipartite. Because a bipartite graph cannot have any odd-length cycles. If the graph is not bipartite, then it contains at least one odd-length cycle. So if the graph is not bipartite, then t is 0, w is 1. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the cycle must consist of more than one vertex. Well, a cycle of length 1 is impossible because there are no loops. So the minimal cycle is length 3. So if the graph is not bipartite, then there exists an odd-length cycle. So the first thing to check is whether the graph is bipartite. If not, then answer is t=0, w=1. \n\nBut if the graph is bipartite, then we need to find the minimal number of edges to add to create an odd-length cycle. \n\nSo the problem splits into two cases: \n\nCase 1: The graph is not bipartite. Then answer is t=0, w=1.\n\nCase 2: The graph is bipartite. Then we need to find the minimal t and count the ways.\n\nNow, the question is",
    "response": "To solve the problem of determining the minimum number of edges to add to form an odd-length cycle and the number of such ways, we follow these steps:\n\n---\n\n### **Key Concepts**\n\n- A graph contains an **odd-length cycle** if it is **not bipartite**.\n- If the graph is already **non-bipartite**, then:\n  - `t = 0` (no edges need to be added).\n  - `w = 1` (only one way: use the existing cycle).\n\n- If the graph is **bipartite**, then we must add edges to make it **non-bipartite**, which means introducing an **odd-length cycle**.\n\n---\n\n### **Strategy for Bipartite Graphs**\n\nFor a **bipartite graph**, we can introduce an odd-length cycle by connecting two nodes in the same partition (i.e., nodes that are in the same group of a bipartition). \n\nLet’s say the graph has `k` connected components. For each component, we can compute the number of nodes in each partition (`A`, `B`). The number of possible edges that would create an odd-length cycle between two nodes in the same partition is the number of pairs within `A` or within `B`.\n\nThe **minimum number of edges** needed to create an odd-length cycle is `1`, because adding **just one** edge between two nodes in the same partition introduces an odd-length cycle.\n\nThe **number of such ways** is the sum over all components of the number of such possible edges in that component.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Steps**\n\n1. **Check if the graph is bipartite** using BFS or DFS.\n2. **If not bipartite**, output `0 1`.\n3. **If bipartite**, for each connected component:\n   - Count the number of nodes in each partition.\n   - Compute the number of valid edges between nodes in the same partition (i.e., combinations within each group).\n4. **Sum all such valid edges** across all components.\n5.
