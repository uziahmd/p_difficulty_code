The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The problem is about calculating the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the conditions required for such a configuration. The key here is to model the valid configurations of towers that allow for such a setup. \n\nFirst, the signal power assignments must ensure that each town is covered exactly once. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower. \n\nLet me think about what the tower placements must look like. For example, if there's a tower at position i, its signal power p must be chosen such that it covers some towns. But how can we arrange the towers so that their coverage areas don't overlap except in allowed ways?\n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern here. For example, in the first sample where n=2, the valid case is when both towers 1 and 2 are built. Then each can have power 1. That way, town 1 is covered by tower 1, town 2 by tower 2. Towns 0 and 3 are not covered. But if only tower 1 is built, then you need to set its power to 2, but that would cover town 0 (since |0-1| < 2 → 1 < 2 → yes. So that's invalid. Similarly, if only tower 2 is built, same problem. If both are built, but you set tower 1's power to 2, then town 0 is covered, which is invalid. So the only valid case is when both towers are built and set to 1 each.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets of towers (each present with 1/2 probability) that can be arranged in such a way that there's a valid assignment of signal powers. Then multiply by (1/2)^n, since each subset has probability 1/(2^n).\n\nThe challenge is to find the number of valid subsets S of {1, ..., n} such that there exists a way to assign power to each tower in S so that all constraints are met.\n\nHow can we model these subsets? Let's think about the structure of the subsets. \n\nEach tower's coverage must be such that:\n\n- The coverage of each tower does not include town 0 or n+1. So for a tower at position i, the maximum possible power is i (since if you set power to i, then the leftmost town covered is i - (i-1) = 1. Wait, the condition is |c - i| < p. So for town 0, |0 - i| < p → i < p. But since the tower is at i, which is between 1 and n, then if p is larger than i, then town 0 is covered. So to prevent that, the power of tower i must be ≤ i. Similarly, for town n+1: |n+1 -i| < p → (n+1 -i) < p. So p must be > (n+1 -i). But since p is an integer between 1 and n, then for the tower at i, the maximum p that doesn't reach n+1 is p ≤ n+1 -i. Wait, because if p is larger than (n+1 -i), then town n+1 is covered. So the maximum allowed p for tower i is min(i, n+1 -i). Wait, but the problem says that the signal power can be any integer from 1 to n. However, for the tower to not reach town 0 or n+1, the power must satisfy:\n\nFor town 0: i - p ≥ 1 → p ≤ i - 1? Wait, no. Let's re-express the condition that town 0 is not covered. The tower at i has power p. Town 0 is not covered if |0 - i| >= p → i >= p. So p must be <= i. Similarly, for town n+1: |n+1 - i| >= p → (n+1 - i) >= p → p <= n+1 -i. Therefore, the maximum allowed p for a tower at i is min(i, n+1 -i). But since p can be up to n, but for the tower to not reach 0 or n+1, the p must be ≤ min(i, n+1 -i). However, when setting the power, the tower's p can be any value as long as it doesn't reach 0 or n+1. But how does this affect the coverage of the towns?\n\nBut perhaps the main thing is that the coverage of the towers must",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly building radio towers in towns from 1 to n (each with a 50% chance), there exists a valid configuration of signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Valid Configurations**: For a valid configuration, each town must be covered by exactly one tower, and towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered. This implies that towers must be placed in such a way that their coverage areas do not overlap improperly.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: We use dynamic programming to count the number of valid configurations. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns.\n3. **Transition Between States**: The transitions between states involve considering whether a tower is built at position `i` or not. If a tower is built at position `i`, it can cover towns up to `i` without affecting the validity of the configuration.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses to handle divisions efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    if n == 1:\n        print(0)\n        return\n    \n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        # Case 1: no tower at i\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1]\n        # Case 2: tower at i, then previous must be handled\n        if i >= 2:\n            dp[i] += dp[i - 2]\n        dp[i] %= MOD\n    \n    result = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_result = pow(result, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    ans = dp[n] * inv_result % MOD\n    print(ans)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: We define `dp[i]` as the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns. The base case `dp[0] = 1` represents an empty configuration.\n2. **Transitions**:\n   - If no tower is built at position `i`, the number of valid configurations is the same as `dp[i-1]`.\n   - If a tower is built at position `i`, we consider configurations where the previous valid configuration ends at `i-2` (to ensure no overlap).\n3. **Modular Inverses**: The result is computed as the number of valid configurations divided by `2^n` (since each tower placement has a 50% chance). This division is handled using modular inverse under modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required probability using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, ensuring it handles large values of `n` up to 200,000 efficiently.",
