He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives me a and b (or R), and then a number c in base a. My job is to convert c to base b, handling Roman numerals when needed.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps. The process should be:\n\n1. Convert the input number c (which is in base a) to a decimal integer.\n2. Then, convert that decimal integer to base b. But if b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals instead.\n\nSo the main parts are: converting from base a to decimal, then converting decimal to base b or Roman.\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst part: converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have leading zeros, but that's okay. For example, if a is 10 and c is '001', that's 1 in decimal.\n\nBut how to handle the conversion? Well, for each digit in the string, we can process it as a digit in base a. However, note that if a is greater than 10, the digits might be letters. For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase?), but the problem says that in bases greater than 10, letters are used (like A for 10, B for 11, etc). But the input c is given as a string. So, for example, if a is 12, then the digits can be 0-9 and A (for 10), B (for 11).\n\nWait, the problem says that in the input, the number c is in base a. So, for example, if a is 12, then the digits of c can be 0-9, A, B (since 10 and 11 are represented by letters). However, the input c may have letters? The problem says that the input is a single non-negative integer in base a. So for example, in the sample input, one of the cases is '16 R\\n5' which is a=16, c=5. So 5 in base 16 is 5 in decimal.\n\nBut when converting from base a to decimal, I need to parse each character of the string c as a digit in base a. For example, if the input c is 'A', and a is 12, that's 10 in decimal. So how to handle the characters?\n\nThe problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros, but its length is up to 10^3. So for the conversion from base a to decimal, we need to process each character of the string as a digit in base a. But how to map characters to their numerical values?\n\nFor example, if the digit is a letter, like 'A', it's 10, 'B' is 11, up to 'Z' for 35? But since a can be up to 25, the maximum digit value is 24 (since base a is up to 25). So for example, if a is 25, the digits can be 0-9, A-O (since 10 is A, 11 B, ..., 14 is E, 15 F, ... up to 24 which would be O? Wait, 10 is A, so 24 is 24-10=14 letters after A. Let's see: A is 10, B 11, ..., O is 14 + 10? No, wait: the letters go from A for 10, B for 11, up to whatever is needed. For example, in base 16, digits are 0-9, A-F (10-15). So for base 25, digits can be 0-9, A-O (since 10 is A, 15 is F, 16 is G, ..., 24 is O). So the letters are uppercase?\n\nBut the input c may have letters in lowercase? The problem says that the input is given as a string. But the sample inputs show that in the case of '5 R\\n4', the output is 'IV'. So the input c is given as a string, perhaps with letters in uppercase? Or maybe the problem expects that the input is in uppercase, but the problem says nothing about that. However, the problem says that in the input, the number is written in base a. So, for example, if a is 12, then the digits can be 0-9, A, B. So the input c will have letters in uppercase? Probably, but the problem says nothing about that. However, since the problem says that the input is correct, perhaps the input is given with uppercase letters for digits above 9.\n\nBut in any case, the code needs to process the input string correctly. So for each character in c, we need to convert it to its corresponding value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So for a digit in the string, if it's a digit, then its value is int(c), else it's ord(c) - ord('A') + 10. But what if the input uses lowercase letters? Well, the problem says that in the input, the number is in base a. So perhaps the input is given with uppercase letters. But the problem statement doesn't specify, but the sample input includes 'A' in one of the cases, like the fifth sample input is '12 13\\nA', which is converted to 'A' in base 13. So the code must handle letters as uppercase.\n\nSo, assuming that the input c is in uppercase letters for digits beyond 9.\n\nSo, the first step is to convert c from base a to decimal. How to do that?\n\nLet's think of the code for that. For example, for each character in the string, we process it as a digit. For example:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nBut wait, this is assuming that the input is valid. The problem says that the input is correct, so we don't have to handle invalid digits.\n\nSo that's the first part.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value, then we need to convert it to base b, or to Roman numerals if b is R.\n\nNow, the second part: converting from decimal to base b, or to Roman numerals.\n\nSo, first, let's handle the case where b is not R. Then, we need to convert the decimal number to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A, B, etc. for digits >=10.\n\nFor example, if the decimal number is 10, and base is 16, it's 'A'.\n\nBut also, the output must not have leading zeros. So, for example, if the decimal is zero, but according to the problem statement, when Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. However, for other cases, the input c could be zero. Wait, the problem says: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510.\" So when converting to Roman, the number is not zero. But for other cases, the number could be zero. However, the input c is a non-negative integer. So for example, if the input is '2 2\\n0', then the output is '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must omit leading zeros. So, for example, if the decimal number is zero, the output is '0'.\n\nSo, the code for converting decimal to base b (when b is not R) must handle zero correctly.\n\nSo, how to convert decimal to base b:\n\nIf the number is zero, output '0'.\n\nElse, we need to generate the digits in base b. For each digit, we take the remainder when divided by b, then divide the number by b, and repeat. Then reverse the digits.\n\nBut for digits >=10, we need to represent them as letters. For example, 10 is A, 11 is B, etc.\n\nSo for example, the code would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but the problem says that the output must omit leading zeros. However, in this code, when the number is zero, it returns '0', which is correct. For other numbers, the code will generate digits without leading zeros, because when n is positive, the loop runs until n becomes zero. So for example, if the number is 10 in base 16, the code returns 'A'.\n\nBut what about when the input is zero? For example, if the input is '10 10\\n0', the output is '0'.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nNow, the other case is when b is R, then we need to convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nSo, how to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nThe standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For each value, subtract as many times as possible from the number, appending the corresponding symbols.\n\nThe standard Roman numerals have the following values:\n\nM 1000\nCM 900\nD 500\nCD 400\nC 100\nXC 90\nL 50\nXL 40\nX 10\nIX 9\nV 5\nIV 4\nI 1\n\nSo the list would be:\n\nroman_numerals = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each pair, we take as many as possible.\n\nFor example, for 4, it's 'IV'.\n\nSo the code for converting decimal to Roman is:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when converting to Roman, the number is guaranteed to be non-zero and <= 3000. So we don't need to handle 0 here.\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nThe steps are:\n\nRead the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R'. Then the next line is the number c in base a.\n\nSo, for each test case (the input seems to be multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input, the input is given as a list of test cases. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWhich seems to be multiple test cases. But in reality, the actual input is read from stdin. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a ...\n\nSo, the input is for a single test case. But looking at the sample input, the user provided multiple test cases. However, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code must process one test case per run. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the sample input, the input is given as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code must read from stdin. For example, the sample input shows that for each test case, the first line is a and b, then the next line is c. So the code must read two lines per test case. But the sample input shows that the user provided multiple test cases. But the problem says that the code must read from stdin. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo, the input is for one test case. But in the sample input, there are multiple test cases. That suggests that perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases. But the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code must read from stdin. Wait, the sample input and output are given as lists. But in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case. However, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nWhich suggests that the code must read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, then the next line contains c. Which implies that each test case is two lines. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. But the problem's input description is unclear. However, looking at the sample input, the code must read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, then the next line contains c. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case, but the sample input is given as multiple test cases. That's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that each element of the list is a separate test case. For example, the first test case is:\n\nInput line 1: '10 2'\n\nInput line 2: '1'\n\nOutput is '1'\n\nSo the code must read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, then the next line contains c. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a programming competition problem where the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b. But the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases. So the code must read all lines from stdin, processing each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, the input is given as two lines per test case. So for example, the first line is a and b, the second is c. Then another line for a and b, etc. But how to read that in Python?\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, each representing a test case. For example, the first test case is '10 2\\n1' which is two lines: first line is '10 2', second is '1'.\n\nSo the code must read from stdin, which may have multiple test cases. But how to know how many test cases there are? Well, perhaps the input is such that each test case consists of two lines. So the code can read all lines, and process them in pairs.\n\nBut in practice, for programming competition problems, the input is usually given as multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, then the next line contains c. So perhaps it's a single test case. But the sample shows multiple test cases. This is conflicting.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nSo, for each of these input strings, which represents two lines (split by \\n), the code produces the corresponding output.\n\nTherefore, the code must process multiple test cases. Each test case is two lines. So the code must read all lines from stdin, split into pairs of lines, and process each pair as a test case.\n\nBut in Python, how to read the input? For example, the input is read via sys.stdin.read().splitlines(), and then process each pair of lines.\n\nBut the problem's input may have multiple test cases. Therefore, the code must process each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nFor each test case, take two consecutive lines: first line is a and b, second line is c.\n\nSo, for example, the code would process the lines in pairs.\n\nBut how to handle if the number of lines is odd? Well, the problem says that the input is correct, so the number of lines is even.\n\nSo, the code in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n    a_line = lines[i]\n    c_line = lines[i+1]\n    # process a_line and c_line\n\nBut the problem says that the first line contains a and b, then the next line contains c. So for each test case, the code processes two lines.\n\nNow, the code must process each test case as follows.\n\nFirst, parse the first line into a and b. But b can be 'R'.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input line, '10 2' is parsed as a=10, b=2.\n\nThen, the second line is the c string.\n\nOnce we have a, b, and c, we need to:\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal.\n\nThen, convert decimal to base b (if b is not R) or to Roman numerals (if b is R).\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nParse a and b. For example, split the first line into parts. For example, if the line is '16 R', then a=16, b='R'.\n\nThen, parse the c string.\n\nConvert c to decimal.\n\nThen, if b is 'R', convert to Roman numerals. Else, convert to base b.\n\nNow, the code for converting c from base a to decimal.\n\nBut the code must handle letters in c. For example, if a is 12, then the digits can be 0-9, A, B.\n\nSo, the code for converting the string c to decimal is:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nBut what if the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, it's a non-negative integer, so it's at least 0. But the input may be '0' (with leading zeros allowed). For example, if c is '000', then it's 0 in decimal.\n\nNow, once we have the decimal value, proceed.\n\nNow, for the conversion to base b:\n\nIf b is not R:\n\nWe need to convert the decimal value to base b, using letters for digits >=10. Also, leading zeros are omitted.\n\nBut what if the decimal value is zero? Then the output is '0'.\n\nElse, proceed with the conversion.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nBut what if the number is zero? For example, the input is '2 2\\n0' → output is '0'.\n\nNow, for the Roman case:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut first, the code must read the input lines in pairs.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        # parse a and b\n        a_str, b_str = a_line.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        b = b_str\n        # parse c_line\n        c = c_line.strip()\n        # convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_val = to_decimal(c, a)\n        # process based on b\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n\nWait, but what if the input is zero and b is not R? For example, if the input is '10 10\\n0', then the output is '0', which is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 10 2\\n1 → decimal_val is 1 → converted to base 2 is 1 → output '1'.\n\nSample Input 2: 16 R\\n5 → decimal_val is 5 → Roman is V → output 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3: 5 R\\n4 → decimal_val is 4 → Roman is IV → output 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4: 2 2\\n1111001 → 1111001 in base 2 is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 → 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Converting to base 2 again gives 1111001 → output is same as input. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 5: 12 13\\nA → A in base 12 is 10 in decimal. Convert to base 13: 10 is 'A' in base 13. So output is 'A'.\n\nYes, the sample outputs match.\n\nNow, check edge cases.\n\nCase when c is zero and b is not R: output '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=2, c='0', then decimal is 0, converted to base 10 is '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=10, c='000' → decimal is 0 → output '0'.\n\nWhat about when converting to base b which is larger than 10? For example, decimal value is 10, base is 11 → output is 'A'.\n\nAnother case: decimal is 10, base is 16 → 'A'.\n\nAnother case: decimal is 35, base is 16 → 23 (since 35 is 2*16 + 3 → '23')? No, 35 in base 16 is 23? Wait 16*2=32, 35-32=3 → yes. So the code would output '23'.\n\nBut if base is 16, then digits are 0-9 and A-F. So for 10, it's A. For 35, 35 divided by 16 is 2 with remainder 3 → digits are 2 and 3 → '23'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when the decimal value is zero and b is R? According to the problem statement, this case is not possible, because when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So the code can safely assume that in such cases, the decimal value is non-zero.\n\nNow, testing the code for the sample input.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nWhat if the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, it's a non-negative integer, but the input may have leading zeros. But the code will process it as per the function.\n\nAnother possible issue is when the base a is 1? But according to the problem statement, a is between 2 and 25. So the code doesn't need to handle a=1.\n\nAnother possible issue: when converting c to decimal, the code may have a very large number. For example, if the input c is a 1000-digit number in base 25. But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's not a problem.\n\nAnother possible issue is when converting to Roman numerals. For example, the problem says that the number is guaranteed to be <= 3000. So the code can handle that.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle all cases. Let's see.\n\nAnother test case: input a=5, b=R, c=4. Which is 4 in base 5 → decimal is 4 → Roman is IV. Which is sample case 3.\n\nAnother test case: input a=2, b=2, c=1111001 → which is 121 in decimal. Converted to base 2 again is 1111001. Which is sample case 4.\n\nAnother test case: input a=12, b=13, c=A → decimal is 10. Converted to base 13 is A. Which is sample case 5.\n\nNow, the code should work.\n\nNow, code formatting. The code must read from stdin, process multiple test cases, etc.\n\nBut what about leading zeros in the output? For example, if the decimal is 0, the code returns '0', which is correct. For other cases, the code returns the digits without leading zeros. For example, if the decimal is 10 in base 16, the code returns 'A'.\n\nAnother example: if the decimal is 10 in base 10, the code returns '10'.\n\nNow, the code for decimal_to_base returns '0' when n is zero. Otherwise, the digits are generated without leading zeros.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nPotential corner cases:\n\nTest case where a is 2, c is '0' → output is 0.\n\nTest case where a is 2, c is '0000' → output is 0.\n\nTest case where b is R and decimal is 3000 → MMM.\n\nAnother test case: decimal is 1999 → MCMXCIX.\n\nThe code should handle that.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base or to Roman numerals. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its original base to decimal, and then converting the decimal number to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert from Base a to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a`, which may include digits beyond 9 represented by letters (A-Z). We convert this number to a decimal integer by processing each digit according to its value in base `a`.\n2. **Convert from Decimal to Target Base or Roman Numerals**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is 'R' (Roman numerals) or another base, we convert the decimal number accordingly:\n   - If `b` is not 'R', convert the decimal number to base `b`, using letters for digits greater than 9.\n   - If `b` is 'R', convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        a_str, b_str = a_line.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        b = b_str\n        c = c_line.strip()\n        decimal_val = to_decimal(c, a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_val))\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as lines from standard input. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains the original base `a` and the target base `b` (or 'R' for Roman numerals), and the second line contains the number in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` processes each digit of the input number, converting it from base `a` to a decimal integer.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base or Roman Numerals**:\n   - **Decimal to Base Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal number to the target base, handling digits greater than 9 with letters.\n   - **Decimal to Roman Numerals**: The function `decimal_to_roman` uses a list of value-symbol pairs to construct the Roman numeral representation of the decimal number.\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, including leading zeros and large numbers, leveraging Python's ability to handle arbitrarily large integers.",
