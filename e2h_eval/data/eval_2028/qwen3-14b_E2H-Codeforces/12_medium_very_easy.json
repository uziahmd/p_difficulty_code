The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Xenia moving around a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's take the first example input: n=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps between tasks.\n\nThe tasks are in order 3, 2, 3. But since each task must be done in order, she has to do them sequentially. So:\n\n- First task is at 3. Starting from 1, how long to get there? Well, moving clockwise, from 1 to 3 is two steps (1→2→3). But wait, the initial position is 1. So for the first task, the time taken is (3-1) = 2 steps? Or maybe (current position to a_i clockwise). Wait, the movement is along the ringroad, which is clockwise. So moving from current position to the target house in the clockwise direction.\n\nBut when you're on a ringroad, the distance between two houses can be calculated as (target - current) mod n, but if the target is behind (counter-clockwise), then you have to go all the way around. Wait no, because movement is only allowed clockwise. So for example, if current is at position 3, and target is 2, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. So the distance between current and target is (target - current + n) % n. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nIf current is at position x, and target is at position y. Since movement is clockwise, the number of steps needed is (y - x) mod n if y >=x, else (y -x +n) mod n? Wait, no. For example, x=3, y=2, n=4. Then the steps would be (2 -3 +4) = 3 steps. Which is correct. So the formula is (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x +n). Which can be written as (y -x +n) %n. But since in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values, perhaps better to compute (y -x) %n. Wait, for example, (2-3) is -1 mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So the distance between x and y is (y -x) %n. But wait, if x is 3, y is 3, then distance is zero. So yes.\n\nBut in the problem, the movement is from current position to the next task's position. So for each task, we need to calculate the time taken to get from the previous position to the current task's position, and accumulate that.\n\nBut the tasks are given in order. So the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. However, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if a_i is same as a_{i-1}, then moving takes zero time. So, the approach is to track the current position, and for each task in order, calculate the distance from current position to a_i, add that to the total time, then update current position to a_i.\n\nWait, but the problem says that she must complete all tasks with numbers less than i before doing task i. So the order is strictly the order of the list. So for example, if the list is [3, 2, 3], then she must do task 1 (at 3), then task 2 (at 2), then task 3 (at 3). So the movement is from 1 to 3 (time 2), then from 3 to 2 (time 3 steps?), then from 2 to 3 (time 1 step). Total is 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the first example.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current_position = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each a_i in the list a:\n\n   distance = (a_i - current_position) %n \n\n   total_time += distance\n\n   current_position = a_i\n\nBut wait, why does this work? Because for each step, moving from current position to the next a_i, taking the minimal steps clockwise.\n\nYes. Because the movement is only allowed clockwise, so the distance between current and a_i is (a_i - current) mod n. For example, when current is 3, a_i is 2, n=4: (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod4 = 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntime = 0\n\nfor each ai in a:\n\n    delta = (ai - current) %n\n\n    time += delta\n\n    current = ai\n\nprint(time)\n\nWait, but let's check the first example:\n\nn=4, a is [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) mod4 is 2. time is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod4 is -1 mod4 = 3. time becomes 5. current is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1. time becomes 6. Which is correct.\n\nYes. And the second example input is '4 3\\n2 3 3'. Let's see:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: (2-1) mod4 is 1. time is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1. time is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-3) mod4 is 0. time remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then the time is (1-1) mod2=0. So total is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Time is (1-1) mod2=0, then (2-1) mod2=1. Total is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. First step: (2-1) mod2=1. Then (1-2) mod2= -1 mod2=1. Total is 2.\n\nWhich makes sense. Because starting at 1, go to 2 (1 step), then from 2 to 1 (1 step). So total 2 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is read from stdin. So in Python, the code would read the first line as n and m, then the second line as m integers.\n\nBut note that in the sample input, the input is given as two lines. For example, the first example input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich would be read as n=4, m=3, and the list is [3,2,3].\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the first line, split into n and m.\n\nRead the second line, split into m integers.\n\nThen process as per the algorithm.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead from stdin, perhaps using input().split().\n\nBut for large inputs, using sys.stdin might be better, but for Python, even with m up to 1e5, it's manageable.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    delta = (ai - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = ai\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but wait, in Python, the modulo operation returns a non-negative result. For example, (-1) %4 is 3, which is correct.\n\nYes, so that's handled correctly.\n\nBut let's test the case where ai is same as current. For example, if current is 3, and ai is 3. Then delta is 0, so no time added. Which is correct.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nLet me check the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]. The code gives 2+3+1=6. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3]. The code gives:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 2: (2-1) mod4 is 1 → total 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond ai is 3: (3-2) mod4 is 1 → total 2. current is 3.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-3) mod4 is 0 → total remains 2. So output is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case where the tasks are all in the same house. Like m=5, a=[1,1,1,1,1]. The total time is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, a=[5,1]. The first step is (5-1) mod5 =4. Then (1-5) mod5 is ( -4 ) mod5 = 1. So total is 4+1=5. Which is correct. Because moving from 1 to 5 (4 steps), then from 5 to 1 (1 step clockwise).\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work. Now, implement it in Python.\n\nBut wait, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but when using split(), it's handled.\n\nSo the code is as follows.\n",
