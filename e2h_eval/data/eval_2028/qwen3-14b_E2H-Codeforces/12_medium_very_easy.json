The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks. Moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are [3, 2, 3]. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break that down:\n\n- Starting at 1. First task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise, that's 2 steps (1→2→3). But wait, the movement is along the ringroad, which is clockwise. So moving from current position to the next house in clockwise direction. So for each task, we need to compute the time taken to get from the previous position to the current task's house, considering the circular nature.\n\nBut how do we compute the time between two positions?\n\nLet's say Xenia is currently at position prev. She needs to go to position curr. Since the road is a circle, moving clockwise, the number of steps is (curr - prev) mod n if curr is ahead of prev. Wait, no. For example, if prev is 3 and curr is 2, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. But (2 -3) is -1, mod 4 would be 3. So yes, the formula (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Or equivalently, (curr - prev) % n? Wait, no. Because if curr is less than prev, then (curr - prev) is negative. For example, prev=3, curr=2, n=4. (2-3) = -1. Mod 4 would be 3. Which is correct. So the steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Which is equivalent to (curr - prev) % n if the mod is computed properly. But since in Python, the modulo operator can return negative results, maybe we need to adjust it.\n\nWait, for example, (2 -3) is -1. In Python, (-1) %4 is 3. So yes, (curr - prev) %n gives the correct number of steps. So for each consecutive task, we can compute the steps between the previous position and the current task's position, and accumulate that.\n\nBut wait, the tasks have to be done in order. So for the list a_1 to a_m, we need to process them in order. But the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So, for example, if a_i is same as a_{i+1}, then moving from a_i to a_{i+1} takes zero steps.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1.\n\nTotal time is 0.\n\nFor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   compute the steps from current position to a_i, add to total time.\n\n   update current position to a_i.\n\nBut how to compute the steps between current position and a_i?\n\nYes, using the formula (a_i - current) %n ?\n\nWait, no. Because for example, if current is 3, and a_i is 2, then (2-3) mod 4 is 3, which is correct. So that's the right way.\n\nBut wait, let's test with the first example.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=4, tasks are [3,2,3].\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 3. Steps from 1 to 3: (3-1) mod4 = 2. Correct. Add 2. Total is 2. Current position is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. Steps from 3 to 2: (2-3) mod4 = -1 mod4 = 3. So add 3. Total is 5. Current position is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. Steps from 2 to 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1. Add 1. Total is 6. Which matches the sample.\n\nYes. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother sample input is '4 3\\n2 3 3'. Output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial position is 1.\n\nFirst task is 2. Steps: (2-1) mod4 = 1. Total is 1. Current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: steps (3-2) mod4=1. Total is 2. Current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: steps (3-3) mod4=0. Total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, the algorithm is straightforward: iterate through the list of a_i, compute the steps between current position and a_i, add to the total, and update current position.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list of m integers.\n\nInitialize current = 1, total_time =0.\n\nFor each ai in the list:\n\n   delta = (ai - current) %n\n\n   total_time += delta\n\n   current = ai\n\nThen print total_time.\n\nWait, but why is that correct?\n\nBecause for each task, you have to move from your current position to the ai's position, and the minimal steps is exactly the delta computed as (ai - current) mod n.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's think about when the current is 1, and ai is 1. Then delta is 0. So no movement.\n\nBut what if the list has multiple tasks in the same house? Like [1,1,1], then the total time is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent =1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: (3-1) mod4=2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond ai is 2: (2-3) mod4 = -1 mod4=3. total is 5. current is 2.\n\nThird ai is 3: (3-2) mod4=1. total is 6. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nai=2: (2-1) mod4=1. total=1. current=2.\n\nai=3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1. total=2. current=3.\n\nai=3: (3-3)=0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=1, a1=1. Then the steps are (1-1) mod2=0. So total is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. Steps:\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nfirst ai=2: (2-1) mod2=1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nsecond ai=1: (1-2) mod2= -1 mod2=1. total is 2. So answer is 2. Which makes sense: 1→2 (1 step), then 2→1 (1 step). Total 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead input: first line is n and m. Second line is m integers.\n\nBut note that in the input examples, the input is given as something like ['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3'], but perhaps the actual input is two lines. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m.\n\nThe second line contains m integers a1...am.\n\nSo for example, the first sample input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich would be read as n=4, m=3, and the list [3,2,3].\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, there are two examples. However, the user probably wants to read from stdin. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the next line as list of integers.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen current = 1, total =0.\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n\n    total += delta\n\n    current = num\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what about when n is 1? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 2. Because the first line says 2 ≤ n ≤ 1e5.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nLet me check the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]. The code gives 2+3+1=6. Correct.\n\nSample 2: n=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3]. The code gives 1+1+0=2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, write the Python code accordingly.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase where all tasks are in the same house. For example, n=5, m=3, a=[1,1,1]. The total is 0.\n\nAnother case where the movement wraps around. For example, n=5, current is 1, next is 3. Steps: 2. If current is 3, next is 1: steps (1-3) mod5 is -2 mod5 = 3. Which is correct (3→4→5→1: 3 steps).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The key challenge is efficiently calculating the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and she can only move clockwise around the ringroad.\n2. **Circular Movement Calculation**: The time to move from one house to another clockwise can be calculated using modular arithmetic. For two houses `current` and `target`, the number of steps required is `(target - current) % n`, where `n` is the total number of houses. This formula handles both direct and wrap-around movements efficiently.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task in sequence, compute the time required to move from the current house to the target house of the task, accumulate this time, and update the current position.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    delta = (num - current) % n\n    total_time += delta\n    current = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains two integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks). The second line contains `m` integers representing the house numbers for each task.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n3. **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current house to the target house using modular arithmetic. This ensures that both direct and wrap-around movements are handled correctly.\n4. **Accumulate Time**: Add the calculated time for each movement to the total time and update the current position to the target house after each task.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle circular movements, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.",
