For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the distances between the notes work. The notes are arranged in a cyclic order. The list given is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, wait, wait. Oh right, the problem says that after H comes C again. So the order is cyclic with 12 notes. Each consecutive pair is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. But the distance between two notes is calculated as the number of semitones when moving from the lower to the higher note. For example, C to E is 4 semitones (since between C and D is 1, D to D# is another, D# to E is another? Wait, no. Let me think. Let me count the steps between C and E. Let's see:\n\nThe order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, ... So from C to E, there's C to C# (1), C# to D (2), D to D# (3), D# to E (4). So yes, four semitones. So the distance between X and Y is the number of steps you take moving forward from X to Y. So for example, between E and C, since moving forward from E would go through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the distance is 8 semitones. But for the problem, when checking the triad, the order matters. For a major triad, the first interval is 4 semitones, then 3. For minor, first 3 then 4.\n\nSo the approach is: given three notes, check all possible permutations of them. For each permutation, check if the first to second is 4 and second to third is 3 (major), or first to second is 3 and second to third is 4 (minor). If any permutation satisfies major, then output major. Similarly for minor. Otherwise, strange.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between two notes?\n\nFirst, I need to map each note to its index in the list. Let's create a list of the notes in order. Let me see:\n\nThe order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Wait, the problem says that the notes are listed as C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the order is as such. So the indexes are 0 to 11. So for example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc., up to H which is 11. Then, the next note after H is C again.\n\nSo for any two notes X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12? No, because if Y is after X, then it's Y_index - X_index. But if Y is before X, then it's (12 - (X_index - Y_index))? Wait, no. For example, if X is C (index 0), Y is H (index 11). The distance from X to Y is 11 semitones. Because moving forward from C to H is 11 steps. But if X is H (index 11), Y is C (index 0), the distance is 1 semitone? Wait, no. Because according to the problem statement, the distance is measured from the lower to upper note. So if X is H and Y is C, then the distance is 1 semitone? Because moving from H to C is one step. But how do we compute that?\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones when moving from X to Y along the scale. So if X is before Y in the list, then the distance is Y_index - X_index. But if Y is before X, then the distance is (12 - X_index + Y_index) ?\n\nWait, for example, X is H (index 11), Y is C (index 0). The distance from X to Y is 1 semitone. Because moving from H to C is one step. So the formula would be (Y_index - X_index + 12) % 12? Wait, but (0 - 11) is -11, adding 12 gives 1. So yes. So the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But since the distance is measured as moving forward from X to Y, that's correct. Because if Y is after X, then the difference is positive, otherwise, adding 12 gives the correct number of semitones.\n\nWait, but for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), then the distance is 4-0 =4. Which is correct. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8, which is correct. Because moving from E to C requires going through F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H, C. That's 8 steps. So the formula for distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper note, perhaps the formula is (Y_index - X_index) if Y is after X, else (12 - (X_index - Y_index))? But that's equivalent to (Y_index - X_index) mod 12, but since mod can be negative, but in Python, mod is handled with positive numbers. Wait, in Python, (Y - X) % 12 would give the correct value. For example, if Y is 0 and X is 11, (0 - 11) % 12 = (-11) % 12 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the distance between X and Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper note. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y_index - X_index. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is 12 - (X_index - Y_index). Which is the same as (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. So that's the way to calculate the distance between two notes.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Create a list of the notes in order. Let's make a list called note_order, where note_order[0] is 'C', note_order[1] is 'C#', etc. Then, for each note, we can get its index.\n\n- For the three input notes, generate all possible permutations (since the order matters for checking the intervals). There are 3! = 6 permutations.\n\n- For each permutation (X, Y, Z), check if the distance between X and Y is 4 and between Y and Z is 3. If yes, then it's a major triad.\n\n- Also check if the distance between X and Y is 3 and between Y and Z is 4. If yes, then it's a minor triad.\n\n- If any of the permutations satisfy major, then output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate all permutations? Well, in Python, itertools.permutations can be used. So for the three notes, generate all possible orderings.\n\nNow, the steps:\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is three space-separated notes. For example, in the sample input, the first case is ['C E G'], which is split into three notes. So, the code needs to read a line, split into three elements.\n\nThen, for each of the three notes, get their indexes in the note_order list.\n\nOnce we have the indexes, we can generate all permutations of the three indexes, and check for each permutation if it meets the major or minor conditions.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the triad is an unordered set. So, the order of the three notes in the input doesn't matter. So, we need to check all possible orderings of the three notes to see if any of them fits the major or minor criteria.\n\nSo, for example, for the input 'C E G', the permutation (C, E, G) would have X=C, Y=E, Z=G. Distance between X and Y is 4 (E is index 4, C is 0, 4-0=4). Then between Y and Z (E to G is index 7-4=3. So yes, that's a major triad. So the code would find that.\n\nAnother example: 'C# B F' is the second input. Let's see. The notes are C#, B, F. Let's look at their indexes. Let's build the note_order list.\n\nLet me list the note_order:\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, the problem says the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the indexes are:\n\nC: 0\n\nC#:1\n\nD:2\n\nD#:3\n\nE:4\n\nF:5\n\nF#:6\n\nG:7\n\nG#:8\n\nA:9\n\nB:10\n\nH:11.\n\nSo for example, B is index 10, H is 11.\n\nSo for the input C# B F:\n\nThe notes are C# (1), B (10), F (5). Now, considering permutations. Let's take the permutation (B, C#, F). So X=B (10), Y=C# (1), Z=F (5). The distance between X and Y is (1 - 10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Because (1 -10) is -9, adding 12 gives 3. So that's 3 semitones. Then between Y and Z: (5 -1) mod 12 =4. So that's 4 semitones. So that's a minor triad. Hence, the answer is minor.\n\nSo the code needs to generate all permutations of the three notes, and for each permutation, check if the first two intervals are 4 and 3 (major) or 3 and 4 (minor).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Create a note_order list as described.\n\n2. Read the three input notes, split into a list.\n\n3. For each note in the input, get its index from note_order.\n\n4. Generate all permutations of the three indexes.\n\n5. For each permutation (x, y, z):\n\n   a. Compute distance between x and y: (y - x) % 12.\n\n   b. Compute distance between y and z: (z - y) % 12.\n\n   c. Check if distance1 is 4 and distance2 is 3. If yes, then it's a major.\n\n   d. Else, check if distance1 is 3 and distance2 is 4. If yes, then minor.\n\n6. If any permutation meets the major condition, output 'major'. Similarly for minor. If none, output 'strange'.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there's no need to check for overlapping conditions.\n\nSo in code:\n\nWe can loop through all permutations, and check for major or minor. Once any permutation satisfies major, we can immediately return 'major'. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Using itertools.permutations.\n\nSo in code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nThen, for each note in notes, get its index. Let's create a list called indices.\n\nindices = [note_order.index(note) for note in notes]\n\nBut wait, what if the note is not present? Well, the problem says that the input is three valid notes, so we don't have to handle that.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the indices. For example, permutations(indices, 3) gives all possible orderings.\n\nThen, for each perm in itertools.permutations(indices):\n\n   x, y, z = perm\n\n   d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n   d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n       print('major')\n\n       exit\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       print('minor')\n\n       exit\n\nIf none of the permutations meet either condition, then print 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous, so there's no case where both major and minor are possible. So once we find any permutation that meets major, we can return 'major', and similarly for minor.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the three notes.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nCheck each permutation for major or minor.\n\nIf any permutation satisfies major, output 'major'.\n\nElse, check if any permutation satisfies minor, output 'minor'.\n\nElse, output 'strange'.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can check for all permutations, and if any of them meets major, then return major. Similarly for minor.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_order.index(n) for n in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\n\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor p in permutations(indices):\n\n    x, y, z = p\n\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n\n    if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        found_major = True\n\n    if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n\n    print(\"major\")\n\nelif found_minor:\n\n    print(\"minor\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but this code checks all permutations, and if any permutation meets the major condition, found_major becomes True. Similarly for minor. But since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, there's no case where both are true. So after checking all permutations, if found_major is True, output major, else if found_minor is True, output minor, else strange.\n\nBut wait, perhaps in some permutation, the first two intervals are 4 and 3, and another permutation has 3 and 4. But according to the problem statement, the answer is unambiguous. So the code can safely check for any occurrence of major or minor.\n\nBut let's test this code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input: ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nFirst case: C E G.\n\nIndices are 0, 4, 7.\n\nPermutations include (0,4,7). Let's check:\n\nd1 = 4-0 =4 mod12 is 4. d2 is 7-4=3. So yes, major. So found_major is True.\n\nSecond case: C# B F. Notes are C#, B, F. Their indices are 1, 10, 5.\n\nLooking at permutations. One of the permutations is (10, 1, 5). Let's compute:\n\nd1 is (1-10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. d2 is 5-1 =4 mod12 is 4. So this is minor. So found_minor is True.\n\nThird case: A B H. Indices are 9, 10, 11.\n\nCheck all permutations. Let's see:\n\nFor example, permutation (9, 10, 11):\n\nd1 = 10-9=1. d2=11-10=1. Not 3/4 or 4/3.\n\nAnother permutation (9, 11, 10):\n\nd1 is (11-9) =2. d2 is 10-11 mod 12 is ( -1 ) mod 12 = 11. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation (10, 9, 11): d1 is (9-10) mod 12 = 11. d2 is 11-9=2. No.\n\nAnother permutation (10, 11, 9): d1 is 11-10=1. d2 is 9-11 mod 12 = ( -2 ) mod 12 = 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation (11, 9, 10): d1 is 9-11 mod 12 = ( -2 ) mod 12 = 10. d2 is 10-9=1. No.\n\nAnother permutation (11, 10, 9): d1 is 10-11 mod 12 = 11. d2 is 9-10 mod 12 = 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. So output is strange. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works for the sample.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for each permutation, it checks whether the first two intervals are 4 and 3 (major) or 3 and 4 (minor). So for each permutation, even if the same permutation could be checked for both, but the code checks for both.\n\nBut in the code above, for each permutation, it checks for both conditions. So, for example, if a permutation meets both conditions (which is impossible?), but according to the problem statement, it's impossible. So the code is okay.\n\nBut the code will check for all permutations. So even if one permutation meets major, and another permutation meets minor, but according to the problem statement, this can't happen. So the code will return the first found condition. But since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, the code will not have both found_major and found_minor as True.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, possible edge cases.\n\nWhat about a case where the same note is repeated? But according to the problem statement, the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. But the problem says that the input is three notes. However, the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So perhaps the input is guaranteed to have three distinct notes. But the code can handle duplicates. However, for example, if the three notes are C, C, C. Then, the distance between any two is zero. So no major or minor. So output strange.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a valid chord. However, the problem says that the input is three notes, but the code can process them regardless.\n\nAnother edge case: for example, the notes are C, E, G. Which is major. But what if the permutation is E, G, C. Let's check:\n\ndistance between E (4) and G (7) is 3. Then between G (7) and C (0) is (0 -7) mod 12 = 5. Which is 5. So not 3 and 4. So that permutation would not trigger anything. But another permutation (C, G, E) would have distance between C and G is 7 semitones. So not 4 or 3. So only the correct permutation would trigger the major.\n\nSo the code would find the correct permutation.\n\nAnother example: for a minor triad. Let's say B, C#, F. Which is the second sample input. So the code would find that permutation (B, C#, F) gives d1 = 3, d2 = 4.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code uses permutations. For three elements, there are 6 permutations. So it's manageable.\n\nNow, the code uses note_order.index(n). However, note that in Python, the list.index() method returns the first occurrence. However, since the note_order list is unique, each note is present once, so it's okay.\n\nBut what about the note notation? For example, the input is 'C#', which is in the note_order list as 'C#'. So the code will correctly find the index.\n\nBut the input may have 'B' and 'H' as per the note_order. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut the code must read from stdin. The input is given as a single line with three space-separated notes.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'], but that's probably a mistake. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nSo the input is a single line with three notes. For example, the sample input is:\n\nC E G\n\nBut the sample input in the problem shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nWhich seems to be a list of three test cases. But the actual input for the code is a single line. So perhaps the sample input is a list of three test cases, but the code is supposed to process one line of input. So the user is supposed to read the three notes from the input.\n\nSo in the code, the input is read as:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nWhich splits the input line into three elements.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code for the sample input. Let's take the first case:\n\nInput line: C E G → split into ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nindices are [0,4,7]. permutations would include (0,4,7) which gives d1=4, d2=3 → major. So code returns 'major'.\n\nSecond case: input line C# B F → split into ['C#', 'B', 'F']. indices are 1, 10, 5. permutations would include (10, 1, 5) → d1 is (1-10) mod 12 → ( -9 ) mod 12 is 3. d2 is 5-1=4. So minor.\n\nThird case: input line A B H → indices 9, 10, 11. All permutations checked, none meet the conditions.\n\nSo the code outputs the correct results.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, the modulo operation can return negative numbers if the numerator is negative. Wait, no. In Python, the modulo operator returns a result with the same sign as the denominator. So for example, (-9) % 12 is 3, which is correct. Because 12 * (-1) is -12. -9 - (-12) = 3. So yes, (y - x) % 12 is correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_order.index(n) for n in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor p in itertools.permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = p\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nBut wait, in the code, for each permutation, it checks both conditions. So even if a permutation meets both (which is impossible), but according to the problem statement, it's not possible. So the code is safe.\n\nThis should work.\n\nTesting for the sample input.\n\nBut let's think about the third example in the sample input: A B H.\n\nNotes are A (index 9), B (10), H (11).\n\nLet's check all permutations:\n\nFor example, permutation (9, 10, 11):\n\nd1 = 1, d2 = 1 → no.\n\npermutation (9, 11, 10):\n\nd1 is (11-9) =2. d2 is (10-11) mod 12 → -1 mod 12 = 11. So no.\n\npermutation (10, 9, 11):\n\nd1 = (9 -10) mod 12 → 11. d2 = 11 -9 = 2. No.\n\npermutation (10, 11, 9):\n\nd1 is 1. d2 is (9 - 11) mod 12 → -2 mod 12 → 10. No.\n\npermutation (11, 9, 10):\n\nd1 = (9-11) mod 12 → -2 → 10. d2 = 10 -9 =1. No.\n\npermutation (11, 10, 9):\n\nd1 = (10 - 11) mod 12 → 11. d2 = 9-10 mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nSo no conditions met. Output is strange. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: C E G → major.\n\nAnother test case: C# B F → minor.\n\nAnother test case: C E G# → what's that?\n\nLet me see. C is 0, E is 4, G# is 8. Let's check permutations.\n\nFor example, (C, E, G#): d1 is 4, d2 is 4 (8-4=4). So no. So not major or minor. What about other permutations?\n\nLet's see permutation (E, G#, C):\n\nd1 = (G# index is 8 - E's index 4) → 4. d2 = (C's index 0 - 8) mod 12 → (0 -8) mod12 is 4. So 4 and 4. No.\n\nAnother permutation (C, G#, E): d1 is 8-0=8. d2 is 4-8 mod 12 → ( -4 ) mod 12 → 8. No.\n\nSo this would be strange.\n\nAnother example: C, E, B. Let's see. C is 0, E is 4, B is 10.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's take (C, E, B). d1 is 4, d2 is 6 (10-4=6). No. Another permutation (C, B, E). d1 is (B is 10 - 0) → 10. d2 is 4-10 mod 12 = ( -6 ) mod 12 = 6. No. Another permutation (E, C, B): d1 is (C is 0 - E's 4 → 0-4 = -4 mod 12 → 8. d2 is B (10) - C (0) → 10 mod 12 → 10. No. Hmm. What about permutation (E, B, C)? d1 is B - E = 10 -4 =6. d2 is C - B = 0 -10 mod12 = 2. No. So this is strange.\n\nSo code returns strange.\n\nAnother test case: C, E, G → major.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, minor triad, or is neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the given notes to see if they fit the criteria for a major or minor triad based on specific semitone distances between the notes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Representation**: The musical notes are represented in a cyclic order with each note separated by a semitone. We use a list to map each note to its corresponding index.\n2. **Permutations Check**: For the given three notes, generate all possible permutations. This allows us to check each possible ordering of the notes to see if they form a major or minor triad.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the semitone distance between consecutive notes in each permutation. For a major triad, the distances should be 4 semitones followed by 3 semitones. For a minor triad, the distances should be 3 semitones followed by 4 semitones.\n4. **Result Determination**: If any permutation meets the criteria for a major triad, the result is \"major\". If any permutation meets the criteria for a minor triad, the result is \"minor\". If none meet the criteria, the result is \"strange\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport itertools\n\nnote_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nindices = [note_order.index(n) for n in notes]\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor p in itertools.permutations(indices):\n    x, y, z = p\n    d1 = (y - x) % 12\n    d2 = (z - y) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    if d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Note Order Mapping**: The list `note_order` maps each musical note to its respective index, which helps in calculating distances between notes.\n2. **Input Handling**: The input is read and split into individual notes. Each note is converted to its corresponding index using the `note_order` list.\n3. **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible orderings of the three notes are generated. For each permutation, the distances between consecutive notes are calculated.\n4. **Distance Calculation**: The distances are calculated using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale. This ensures that distances wrap around correctly when moving from higher to lower notes.\n5. **Result Determination**: After checking all permutations, the presence of valid major or minor triads is determined. The result is printed based on the checks performed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the given notes to determine their classification as a major, minor, or strange triad.",
