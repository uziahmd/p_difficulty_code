For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes is major, minor, or strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor criteria.\n\nFirst, let me understand the note order and distances. The notes are in a cyclic order: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it loops back to C. Each consecutive pair is a semitone apart, which is 0.5 tones. But the problem mentions that the distance between two notes is measured as the number of semitones from the lower to the higher. For example, C to E is 4 semitones. Wait, let me think: between C and C# is 1 semitone. Then C to D is 2, C to D# is 3, C to E is 4. Yes. So the distance between X and Y is calculated as (Y's position - X's position) mod 12, but since the order is cyclic, but when moving upwards. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the distance is from the lower to the upper. So for example, between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones because if you go up from E to C, you have to wrap around. But how is that calculated?\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance between X and Y is measured along the musical scale. So for example, if X is lower than Y, then the distance is the number of semitones between them. But if Y is lower than X, then the distance would be (Y's position + 12 - X's position)? Or maybe the distance is computed as (Y - X) mod 12, but considering that the distance is always positive. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says that the distance between two consecutive notes is one semitone. So the distance between X and Y is the number of steps you take moving upward from X to reach Y. For example, between C and E, moving up, there are 4 semitones. Between E and C, moving up, you have to go E->F (1), F->F# (2), F#->G (3), G->G# (4), G#->A (5), A->B (6), B->H (7), H->C (8). So 8 semitones. So the distance between X and Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12, but if the result is negative, add 12? Wait, no. Because if Y is after X, then the distance is Y - X. If Y is before X, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). So for example, if X is C (index 0) and Y is H (index 11), then the distance is 11 - 0 = 11 semitones. But if X is H (index 11) and Y is C (index 0), then the distance is 0 + 12 - 11 = 1 semitone? Wait, no. Wait, according to the problem statement, the distance between E and C is 8 semitones. Let's see: E is index 4. C is index 0. So (0 - 4) mod 12 is 8? Because (0 -4) is -4, mod 12 is 8. So perhaps the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is from the lower to upper. So if X is lower than Y, then it's Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). Which is equivalent to (Y - X) mod 12. Because if Y is less than X, then (Y - X) mod 12 would be (Y - X + 12) mod 12. Which equals (Y - X) + 12 if Y < X. But that's not correct. Let's take X as E (4) and Y as C (0). Then Y - X is -4, mod 12 is 8. Which matches the example. So the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is from the lower to the upper, perhaps the actual way to compute it is (Y - X) if Y is higher than X, else (Y + 12 - X). Which is the same as (Y - X) mod 12. So for example, the distance between X and Y is (Y - X) mod 12. However, in the problem's example, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones. Which is (E - C) = 4 - 0 = 4. So yes.\n\nSo, the key is to assign each note a numerical index. Let's create a list of the notes in order. Let's see:\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nWait, but the problem says the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. So the indexes are 0 to 11.\n\nSo for any note, we can find its index in this list. Then, for two notes X and Y, the distance from X to Y is (Y_index - X_index) mod 12. But since the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to the upper, perhaps this mod 12 gives the correct value. For example, if X is E (index 4) and Y is C (index 0), then (0 -4) mod 12 is 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the first step is to convert each note into its index. Then, for three notes, we need to check all permutations of them to see if any permutation satisfies the major or minor conditions.\n\nLet me think about the steps needed:\n\nGiven three notes, say A, B, C. We need to check all possible orderings of these three notes. For each ordering (X, Y, Z), check if the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones and Y to Z is 3. If yes, then it's a major chord. Similarly, check if any permutation has X to Y as 3 and Y to Z as 4, which would be a minor chord.\n\nBut since the chord is unordered, the three notes can be arranged in any order. So for each of the 3! = 6 permutations of the three notes, check if the first two steps meet the major or minor condition.\n\nBut since the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, we can check all permutations and see if any of them meet the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Create a mapping from note names to their indices. For example, 'C' is 0, 'C#' is 1, etc.\n\n2. Read the three input notes. Let's call them note1, note2, note3.\n\n3. Generate all possible permutations of these three notes. For each permutation (X, Y, Z):\n\n   a. Compute distance between X and Y. Let's call it d1.\n\n   b. Compute distance between Y and Z. Call it d2.\n\n   c. If d1 is 4 and d2 is 3 → major.\n\n   d. If d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 → minor.\n\n4. If any permutation meets the major condition, output 'major'.\n\n5. If any permutation meets the minor condition, output 'minor'.\n\n6. Else, output 'strange'.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Well, since there are only 6 permutations, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for the three notes, we can check all possible orderings where X, Y, Z are the three notes. For example, for each possible ordering of the three notes, check the two distances.\n\nSo, for the three notes, the permutations can be generated using itertools.permutations.\n\nBut since the code needs to be written in Python, perhaps using itertools.permutations would be straightforward.\n\nSo, first, create a list of the three notes. Then generate all permutations of length 3.\n\nFor each permutation (x, y, z):\n\nCompute d1 = distance between x and y.\n\nCompute d2 = distance between y and z.\n\nCheck if d1 == 4 and d2 ==3 → major.\n\nCheck if d1 ==3 and d2 ==4 → minor.\n\nIf any permutation meets major, then return major. Similarly for minor.\n\nNow, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so there's no case where both major and minor conditions are met.\n\nSo, the steps for code:\n\nFirst, create a dictionary to map note names to their indices.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nThen, for each input note, get their indices.\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nFor each permutation, check the distances.\n\nNow, how to compute the distance between two notes. Let's say x and y are two notes. Their indices are x_idx and y_idx.\n\ndistance = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\nWait, but in the example given, the distance between C and E is 4. Let's check:\n\nC is index 0, E is index 4. (4-0) mod 12 is 4 → correct.\n\nAnother example: between E and C, the distance is (0 -4) mod 12 = 8 → correct.\n\nSo yes, that formula works.\n\nSo, for each permutation (X, Y, Z), compute:\n\nd1 = (Y_idx - X_idx) % 12\n\nd2 = (Z_idx - Y_idx) % 12\n\nThen, check if d1 is 4 and d2 is 3 → major.\n\nOr if d1 is 3 and d2 is 4 → minor.\n\nOnce any of these conditions is found, return the corresponding result.\n\nNow, for example, the first sample input is ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nLet's see:\n\nC is index 0, E is 4, G is 7.\n\nPermutation (C, E, G):\n\nd1 = 4-0 =4 → correct. d2 is 7-4=3 → yes. So major.\n\nSo returns 'major'.\n\nAnother example, input ['C#', 'B', 'F'].\n\nNotes: C# is index 1, B is index 10, F is index 5.\n\nLooking for permutations. One of them is B, C#, F.\n\nB is index 10, C# is 1. So distance between B and C#: (1 -10) mod 12 → (1-10) = -9 → mod 12 is 3. Because 12 -9 = 3. So d1 is 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5): 5-1=4. So d2 is 4. So that's minor. Hence the output is minor.\n\nThird example, input ['A', 'B', 'H'].\n\nNotes: A is index 9, B is 10, H is 11.\n\nCheck permutations.\n\nLet me think: for example, A, B, H.\n\nd1 between A and B: 10-9=1. d2 between B and H: 11-10=1 → not 3 or 4.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A. d1 is (H - B) → 11-10=1. d2 is A - H → 9 -11 = -2 mod 12 is 10. Not helpful.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B. d1 is H - A: 11-9=2. d2 is B - H: 10-11 = -1 mod 12 is 11. Not helpful.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B. d1 is A - H: 9-11 = -2 mod 12 is 10. d2 is B - A: 1 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H. d1 is A - B: 9-10= -1 mod 12 is 11. d2 is H - A: 11-9=2 → no.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A. d1 is B - H: 10 -11 = -1 mod 12 is 11. d2 is A - B: 9-10 = -1 mod 12 is 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the major or minor conditions. Hence output is 'strange'.\n\nSo the code should correctly handle these cases.\n\nNow, coding steps:\n\nRead the input line. The input is three space-separated notes. So for example, in the sample input, the input is given as ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']? Wait, the example shows that the input is a list of three strings, each being a triad. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\nWait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput is ['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H'] — but that's probably a mistake. Wait, the problem says that the input is a single line with 3 space-separated notes. For example, the sample input is probably:\n\nFor example, the input could be \"C E G\" and the output is \"major\".\n\nBut the example given in the problem shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting error. Because the problem says that the input is a single line with 3 notes. So the actual input is three notes separated by spaces, e.g., \"C E G\".\n\nBut the sample input seems to be a list of three examples. Maybe that's a typo. But the problem says that the input is a single line. So for the code, the input is a single line, which is three notes, like \"C E G\".\n\nSo the code needs to read three notes from the input. So in Python, the code would read input().split().\n\nBut the sample input shows that for example, the first input is 'C E G', which would be split into ['C', 'E', 'G'].\n\nSo the code will process that.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the note_to_index mapping.\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\nThen, read the three notes. For example:\n\nnotes = input().split()\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the three notes.\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nfor perm in permutations(notes):\n\n   x, y, z = perm\n\n   x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n\n   y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n\n   z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n\n   d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n   d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n   if d1 ==4 and d2 ==3:\n\n       print(\"major\")\n\n       exit()\n\n   elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n       print(\"minor\")\n\n       exit()\n\nAfter checking all permutations, if none found, print 'strange'.\n\nBut wait, the code must check all permutations. For example, if the first permutation is not matching, but another permutation is.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe can loop through all permutations, and check for any of them meeting the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nfound_major = False\n\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(input_notes):\n\n    x, y, z = perm\n\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 ==3:\n\n        found_major = True\n\n    elif d1 ==3 and d2 ==4:\n\n        found_minor = True\n\n# After checking all permutations\n\nif found_major:\n\n    print(\"major\")\n\nelif found_minor:\n\n    print(\"minor\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nBut wait, what if multiple permutations trigger the same condition? For example, if two permutations are major. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous, so the code can just check if any permutation meets major or minor.\n\nBut in the code above, even if multiple permutations meet the same condition, the code will set found_major to True once, and then proceed.\n\nBut this code would work. Because once any permutation meets the major condition, found_major is True, and similarly for minor.\n\nBut in the code, for each permutation, we check if it meets major or minor. So if any permutation meets major, then found_major is set to True. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut what if a permutation meets both major and minor? Well, according to the problem statement, that's impossible. Because for a permutation to meet both, d1 must be 4 and 3 at the same time, which is impossible. So the code is safe.\n\nBut the code checks for each permutation, and if any permutation meets major, then found_major is True. Similarly for minor.\n\nBut what if, for example, a permutation meets major and another permutation meets minor? According to the problem statement, this can't happen. So the code can safely check for found_major and found_minor, and output accordingly.\n\nBut the problem says that the answer is always unambiguous. So the code can check if found_major is True, then output 'major'; else if found_minor is True, output 'minor'; else 'strange'.\n\nSo that's the approach.\n\nNow, test the sample input.\n\nSample Input: 'C E G'\n\nPermutations:\n\nOne of them is (C, E, G). d1 = 4, d2=3 → found_major becomes True. So output is major.\n\nSample Input: 'C# B F' → permutations include (B, C#, F). Let's compute:\n\nB is index 10, C# is 1. So d1 is (1 -10) mod 12 = ( -9 ) mod 12 = 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5): 5-1=4. So d2=4. So this permutation triggers minor. So found_minor is True. So output is minor.\n\nThird sample input: 'A B H' → permutations. Let's check all permutations. For example, A, B, H:\n\nd1 between A (9) and B (10) is 1. d2 between B (10) and H (11) is 1. No.\n\nAnother permutation: A, H, B. d1 is H - A → 11-9=2. d2 is B - H → 10 - 11 = -1 mod 12 is 11. No.\n\nAnother permutation: B, A, H. d1 between B (10) and A (9): (9 -10) mod 12 is 11. d2 between A (9) and H (11): 2. No.\n\nAnother permutation: B, H, A. d1 between B (10) and H (11): 1. d2 between H (11) and A (9): (9-11) mod 12 → -2 mod 12 → 10. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, A, B. d1 between H (11) and A (9): (9 -11) mod 12 = (-2) mod 12 = 10. d2 between A (9) and B (10): 1. No.\n\nAnother permutation: H, B, A. d1 between H (11) and B (10): (10 -11) mod 12 → -1 mod 12 → 11. d2 between B (10) and A (9): (9-10) mod 12 → 11. No.\n\nSo none of the permutations meet the conditions, so output is strange.\n\nThus, the code would work.\n\nNow, what about some edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: All three notes are same. But according to the problem statement, the input is three notes. But the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. However, the problem says that the input is three notes, but the code can handle it. For example, if all three are C. Then for any permutation, d1 is 0, d2 is 0. So neither major nor minor. So output strange.\n\nAnother edge case: notes that wrap around. Like C, E, B. Let's see. For example, permutation C, E, B. d1 is 4 (E - C). d2 is B - E. B is index 10, E is 4. (10 -4) = 6 → mod 12 is 6. Not 3. So no. Another permutation: E, B, C. d1 between E (4) and B (10) is 6. d2 between B (10) and C (0) is (0-10) mod 12 = 2. No. Another permutation: B, C, E. d1 is C - B → 0 - 10? Wait, no. Wait, B is index 10, C is index 0. So d1 is (0 - 10) mod 12 → 2? Wait, no. Wait, (y_idx - x_idx) mod 12. For x=B (10), y=C (0): (0 - 10) mod 12 → (-10) mod 12 is 2. So d1 is 2. Then between C (0) and E (4) → 4. So d2 is 4. So d1 is 2, d2 4. Not matching. So no.\n\nAnother example: C, E, G. Which is major.\n\nAnother case: C, E flat? Well, the notes are fixed. So the code uses the given note names.\n\nNow, code-wise, the note_to_index must have the correct note names. Let me check the order again.\n\nProblem says the order is:\n\nC, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H.\n\nYes. So the notes_order list is correct.\n\nAnother example: Check the note 'H' which is index 11. The next note is C (index 0).\n\nSo, for example, a permutation with H, C, E. Let's see:\n\nH is 11, C is 0. d1 is (0 -11) mod 12 → 1. Then between C (0) and E (4) is 4. So d1 is 1, d2 is 4. Not matching.\n\nBut if the permutation is H, C#, F. Let's see:\n\nH is 11, C# is 1. d1 is (1 - 11) mod 12 → ( -10 ) mod 12 → 2. Then between C# (1) and F (5) is 4. So d1 is 2, d2 is 4. Not matching.\n\nBut if the permutation is C#, H, F. Let's see:\n\nC# is 1, H is 11. d1 is (11 -1) = 10. Then between H (11) and F (5) → (5-11) mod 12 → -6 mod 12 = 6. So no.\n\nAnother example: Let's check the minor chord example given: C# B F. The permutation B, C#, F.\n\nB is index 10, C# is 1. So d1 is (1 -10) mod 12 → -9 mod 12 is 3. Then between C# (1) and F (5): 5-1 =4. So d1=3, d2=4. So minor.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, need to import permutations from itertools.\n\nBut in some programming competition environments, itertools may not be available. However, in Python, it's standard. So the code can use it.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing all that.\n\nBut for the code to run, the code must read from stdin, process, and output.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nWait, but the code checks all permutations. However, once a permutation is found that meets the condition, the code can immediately break and return the answer. However, since the code is checking all permutations, even if one permutation meets the condition, others may also meet it. However, the problem says that the answer is unambiguous. So even if multiple permutations meet the same condition, the code will still set the flags properly.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps once a major or minor is found, we can break early. But since there are only 6 permutations, it's negligible.\n\nBut for code efficiency, perhaps we can check each permutation and return as soon as possible. However, in code, the code checks all permutations regardless. But since the code is for a programming competition, and the input is small, it's acceptable.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input.\n\nSample input: 'C E G' → outputs 'major'.\n\nSample input 'C# B F' → outputs 'minor'.\n\nSample input 'A B H' → outputs 'strange'.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, check for possible errors.\n\nWhat if the input has notes with different capitalization? The problem says that the input is in the given notation. So the code assumes that the input is correct. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother possible error: the note_to_index mapping. For example, the note 'H' is in the list. Let me check the notes_order list.\n\nYes, the list is:\n\n['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n\nYes, 'B' is index 10, 'H' is index 11.\n\nAnother example: note 'F#' is index 6, 'G' is 7, etc.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother possible test case: 'C E G#'. Let's see.\n\nC is 0, E is 4, G# is 8.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's check (C, E, G#):\n\nd1 = 4-0=4. d2 = 8-4=4. So not 3. So no.\n\nAnother permutation: C, G#, E. d1 is G# - C → 8-0=8. d2 is E - G# → 4 - 8 = -4 mod 12 is 8. No.\n\nAnother permutation: E, C, G#. d1 is C - E → (0-4) mod 12 = 8. d2 is G# - C → 8-0=8. No.\n\nAnother permutation: E, G#, C. d1 is G# - E = 8-4=4. d2 is C - G# → 0-8 = -8 mod 12 is 4. So d1=4, d2=4. Not matching.\n\nAnother permutation: G#, C, E. d1 is C - G# → 0-8 = -8 mod 12 is 4. d2 is E - C → 4-0=4. So d1=4, d2=4. No.\n\nAnother permutation: G#, E, C. d1 is E - G# → 4-8 = -4 mod 12 is 8. d2 is C - E → 0-4 = -4 mod 12 is 8. No.\n\nSo no match. So output is strange.\n\nAnother test case: 'C# E G#'. Let's see. Let's check if this is a major or minor.\n\nCheck permutations. Let's try (C#, E, G#). d1 is E - C# → 4 - 1 = 3. d2 is G# - E → 8 -4 =4. So this is minor. So the code would output minor.\n\nYes. So the code would find that permutation and set found_minor to True.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given set of three musical notes forms a major triad, a minor triad, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the three notes to see if they meet the criteria for either a major or minor triad based on semitone distances.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Note Mapping**: Convert each note to its corresponding index in a predefined list of musical notes. This helps in calculating the semitone distances between notes.\n2. **Permutations Check**: Generate all permutations of the three input notes. For each permutation, check if the distances between consecutive notes match the criteria for a major or minor triad.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate the semitone distance between consecutive notes using modulo arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n4. **Criteria Check**: For each permutation, check if the distances between the first and second note (d1) and between the second and third note (d2) match the criteria for a major triad (d1 = 4 and d2 = 3) or a minor triad (d1 = 3 and d2 = 4).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nnotes_order = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\nnote_to_index = {note: idx for idx, note in enumerate(notes_order)}\n\ninput_notes = input().split()\n\nfound_major = False\nfound_minor = False\n\nfor perm in permutations(input_notes):\n    x, y, z = perm\n    x_idx = note_to_index[x]\n    y_idx = note_to_index[y]\n    z_idx = note_to_index[z]\n    d1 = (y_idx - x_idx) % 12\n    d2 = (z_idx - y_idx) % 12\n    if d1 == 4 and d2 == 3:\n        found_major = True\n    elif d1 == 3 and d2 == 4:\n        found_minor = True\n\nif found_major:\n    print(\"major\")\nelif found_minor:\n    print(\"minor\")\nelse:\n    print(\"strange\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Note Mapping**: The `notes_order` list defines the sequence of musical notes, and `note_to_index` maps each note to its respective index for quick lookup.\n- **Permutations Check**: Using `itertools.permutations`, we generate all possible orderings of the three input notes. This ensures that we check every possible arrangement to find a valid triad.\n- **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using modulo 12 arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of the musical scale. This ensures that distances wrap around correctly from H back to C.\n- **Criteria Check**: For each permutation, we check if the distances between consecutive notes meet the criteria for a major or minor triad. If any permutation meets these criteria, the result is determined accordingly.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of the input notes and ensures that the solution is both correct and unambiguous as specified by the problem constraints.",
