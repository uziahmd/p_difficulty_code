    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0s and 2s directly. Hmm.\n\nSo, what's allowed? Let me think. The swaps allowed are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). So, for example, 0s can move past 1s, but not past 2s. Similarly, 2s can move past 1s but not past 0s. Wait, no. Because if you can swap 1 and 2, then 2 can move through 1s. But 0s can only move through 1s. So 0s can't move past 2s. So the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because you can't swap them. So any 0 that comes before a 2 in the original string will still be before it in the final string, and vice versa. Because you can't swap 0 and 2. So the positions of 0s and 2s relative to each other are fixed. Only the 1s can move around between 0s and 2s?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose I have a 0 followed by a 2. Since they can't be swapped, their order is fixed. But if there's a 1 in between, maybe the 1 can move around. For example, if the string is 0 1 2. Then the 1 can move left or right. But the 0 can't move past the 2. So the 0 and 2's positions relative to each other are fixed. So the overall idea is that the 0s and 2s can't pass each other. So the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. However, the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s. So for example, if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0 (but that's not possible because the 0 and 1 can be swapped. Wait, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. So the original order is 0 and 1 can be swapped. So the 1 can move left past 0s, and right past 2s. So the 1s can be arranged in any order, but the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative positions.\n\nWait, but how? Let me think of an example. Suppose the original string is \"02\". Then we can't swap them. So the minimum is \"02\". If the original string is \"20\", same thing. But if the original string is \"012\", then the 1 can be moved between 0 and 2. So the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0? No, because the 0 and 1 can be swapped. So for example, \"012\" can become \"102\" (swap 0 and 1). Then, the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. Wait, but then the 1 is before the 0. But the 1 can be moved past 0s. So the 1 can be anywhere between the 0s and 2s. Wait, but the 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. So the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order. So the 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s. So the problem reduces to arranging the 1s in such a way that they are as left as possible, but considering that the 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other.\n\nSo the approach would be: the 0s and 2s are in their original order, but the 1s can be arranged between them. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think of the entire string as consisting of blocks of 0s, 1s, and 2s. But since 0s and 2s can't be swapped, their relative positions are fixed. So the positions of 0s and 2s in the original string are fixed. However, the 1s can be rearranged between the 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s can be moved freely among the 0s and 2s, but the 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. So the idea is that the 0s and 2s are in their original order, but the 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest possible string from a given ternary string (composed of '0', '1', and '2') by performing specific adjacent swaps. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1' or between '1' and '2'. However, '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly, which means their relative order in the original string must remain unchanged.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Fixed Positions**: Since '0' and '2' cannot be swapped, their relative positions in the original string must remain fixed. This means that the positions of '0's and '2's in the final string will be the same as in the original string.\n2. **Reorganize '1's**: The '1's can be freely moved between '0's and '2's. Therefore, we can rearrange all '1's to be as left as possible within the constraints of the fixed positions of '0's and '2's.\n3. **Construct Result**: Using the positions of '0's and '2's from the original string, we construct the result by placing '1's in the remaining positions in a way that ensures the smallest lexicographical order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    # Collect the positions of '0's and '2's\n    zeros = []\n    twos = []\n    ones = []\n    \n    for i, c in enumerate(s):\n        if c == '0':\n            zeros.append(i)\n        elif c == '2':\n            twos.append(i)\n        else:\n            ones.append(i)\n    \n    # Now, build the result\n    result = [''] * len(s)\n    idx_zero = 0\n    idx_two = 0\n    idx_one = 0\n    \n    # Fill the positions with '0's and '2's in their original order\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if idx_zero < len(zeros) and i == zeros[idx_zero]:\n            result[i] = '0'\n            idx_zero += 1\n        elif idx_two < len(twos) and i == twos[idx_two]:\n            result[i] = '2'\n            idx_two += 1\n        else:\n            # This position is for '1's, fill them in order\n            result[i] = '1'\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    print(min_ternary_string(input_str))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Collect Positions**: We first collect the indices of '0's, '1's, and '2's from the input string.\n2. **Build Result String**: We then create an empty list to hold the result. We iterate through the positions of the original string, placing '0's and '2's at their original indices. The remaining positions are filled with '1's, ensuring they are placed in the smallest possible lexicographical order.\n3. **Efficiency**: This approach ensures that we only traverse the string once to collect positions and once more to build the result, making the solution efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is optimal for handling input sizes up to 100,000 characters.",
