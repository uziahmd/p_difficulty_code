The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the problem reduces to counting how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, for the keys, count how many are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, yes. Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, and each odd chest can be paired with an even key. But each key can be used once, and each chest can be opened once. So the total is the sum of those two minima.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nBut wait, let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's see their parities:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9, 11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Their parities: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys = 1 (7).\n\nThen min(even_chests (3), odd_keys (1)) is 1. min(odd_chests (2), even_keys (3)) is 2. Sum is 3, which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example input:\n\nChests: 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0.\n\nKeys: 5 (odd). So even_keys=0, odd_keys=1.\n\nSo min(5,1) is 1, min(0,0) is 0. Total 1, which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are all even (20,30,40,50). So even_keys=4, odd_keys=0. So min(even_chests (1) and odd_keys (0)) is 0. min(odd_chests (0) and even_keys (4)) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this logic seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to count the number of even and odd chests and keys, then compute the sum of the two minima as described.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a_i. Count even_a and odd_a.\n\nRead the list of b_j. Count even_b and odd_b.\n\nThe answer is min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nYes. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, how to count even and odd? For each number in a, check if it's even or odd. Same for b.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the next line as list of integers for a.\n\nThen read the next line as list of integers for b.\n\ncount_even_a = number of elements in a where x % 2 == 0.\n\ncount_odd_a = n - count_even_a.\n\nSimilarly for count_even_b and count_odd_b.\n\nThen compute the answer as min(count_even_a, count_odd_b) + min(count_odd_a, count_even_b).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\ncount_even_a: 14,6,2 → 3. count_odd_a is 2.\n\nb is [8,4,7,20]. count_even_b is 3 (8,4,20), count_odd_b is 1.\n\nmin(3,1) is 1. min(2,3) is 2. Sum 3. Correct.\n\nSecond sample:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na is [2,4,6,8,10]. even_a=5, odd_a=0.\n\nb is [5]. even_b=0, odd_b=1.\n\nmin(5,1) is 1. min(0,0) is 0. Total 1.\n\nThird sample:\n\nn=1, m=4.\n\na is [10]. even_a=1, odd_a=0.\n\nb is [20,30,40,50]. even_b=4, odd_b=0.\n\nmin(1,0) is 0. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input. But note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the input is given as per the examples. Wait, the first line of input is n and m. Then the second line is a's, third line is b's. So for each test case, it's three lines.\n\nBut looking at the sample input given, the first example input is:\n\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nWait, perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases? Or perhaps that's a mistake in the problem statement?\n\nWait, no. The original problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe input description says:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m. The second line has n integers. Third line has m integers.\n\nSo for each test case, it's three lines. But in the sample input, there are three separate test cases. For example, the first input line is \"5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20\", which is the first test case. Then the second input is another test case, etc. So the code needs to process multiple test cases?\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first line is ['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\nWait, maybe the sample input is three separate test cases. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases, and the code needs to process them all.\n\nWait, but the original problem statement's sample input shows that the input is three separate test cases. For example, the first input line is the first test case, then the second line is the second test case, etc. However, in the problem statement's input description, the input is given as three lines for a single test case.\n\nThis is conflicting. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nIn the problem statement's input section, it says:\n\nThe first line contains integers n and m. The second line contains n integers. The third line contains m integers.\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, in the sample input, there are three test cases. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nSample Input:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nSample Output:\n\n3\n\nBut in the given sample input, the user provided three test cases, and the output is three lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description doesn't mention that. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three strings, which probably represent three separate test cases. The sample output is a list of three outputs. So the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. However, the problem's input description says that the input is for a single test case. This is conflicting. \n\nBut perhaps the original problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases, and the code needs to process them all. However, the problem statement's input description may not have mentioned that, but the sample shows that.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as three separate test cases. For example, the first input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nWhich corresponds to the first example. Then the second input is:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\nAnd the third is:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\nSo the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m. Which implies that the code is supposed to read one test case. But the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking at the problem's original statement, the sample input is given as a list of three input strings, and the output is a list of three outputs. So the code must handle multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is not clear on that. But perhaps the original problem is from a programming competition where the code is supposed to read from standard input, and the input may contain multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description may not mention that. \n\nBut in the problem's input description, the first line is n and m. So perhaps the code should process a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the original problem is that the code should process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as a separate input. But the actual code is supposed to read one test case. However, that's not the case. For example, in the problem's sample input, the first input line is for the first test case. But the user's code must read all test cases. \n\nBut how can we know? Well, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and print to stdout. So in programming competitions, sometimes the code is expected to handle multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is not clear. However, the sample input and output suggests that there are multiple test cases. For example, the sample input has three test cases and the output has three answers. \n\nBut looking back at the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of three input strings. But in reality, the code should read from standard input, which for programming competitions, could be multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. But that would not explain the sample input. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that the first line is the first test case's input, and so on. But the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how to know how many test cases there are? \n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is written as a list of three input strings, but the actual input for the code would be given as multiple lines. For example, perhaps the code is supposed to read until EOF. \n\nBut in the problem's original statement, the sample input is given as a list of three input strings. However, in practice, the code must read from stdin. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. \n\nBut how to determine how many test cases there are? Well, in programming competitions, sometimes the number of test cases is given in the first line. But in this problem's case, the problem's input description does not mention that. \n\nBut looking at the sample input, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. \n\nBut how to handle this in the code? For example, in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\nThen the third test case is:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\nSo for each test case, the code reads three lines. So the code should read all lines until EOF. \n\nBut how to do that in Python? Well, perhaps read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of three lines. But that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case, and the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as a separate input. But that would not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of three input strings, but in reality, the code is supposed to read a single test case. However, the sample input shows that the code must process three test cases, which would imply that the code should read multiple test cases. \n\nBut the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n and m.

Therefore, the code must read all test cases, each consisting of three lines. \n\nBut how to read them? Well, in Python, the standard way is to read all lines from stdin, and process them. \n\nSo, for example, the code could read all lines, then process them in groups of three. \n\nBut perhaps the code should read until EOF, processing each test case. \n\nBut how to handle that in code? Let's think. \n\nIn programming contests, sometimes the code is supposed to read from standard input until EOF. For example, for each test case, the code reads three lines. So for the code, the approach is:\n\nRead all lines from stdin, split into groups of three lines. For each group, process the test case.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? Well, the code can read all lines at once, and then process them in chunks of three. \n\nBut for example, the code could do something like:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(lines):\n\n    n, m = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n    b = list(map(int, lines[i+2].split()))\n\n    # process the test case here\n\n    i += 3\n\nBut that's assuming that the input is given as multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. \n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20' — which is three lines.

So the code must process three test cases. \n\nThis is conflicting. However, given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. So the code should read multiple test cases. \n\nBut how to determine how many test cases there are? Well, in programming contests, sometimes the number of test cases is given in the first line. However, in this problem's case, it's not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written incorrectly, and the code is supposed to process a single test case. \n\nBut in that case, the sample input would have three lines. However, the sample input shows three test cases. \n\nWell, perhaps the problem is that the user provided the sample input as a list of three test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read a single test case.

For example, the sample input is given as a list of three strings, and the output is a list of three strings. This suggests that the code should process multiple test cases, each of which is three lines. \n\nTherefore, the code must read multiple test cases. \n\nSo the code will read all lines from stdin, process them in groups of three. \n\nBut how to handle this in Python? Let's proceed with that approach. \n\nSo the code would:\n\nRead all lines from stdin. \n\nFor each group of three lines, process the test case. \n\nBut what if the number of lines is not a multiple of three? Well, the problem's input is correct, so that's not an issue. \n\nThus, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead all lines. Iterate through them in groups of three. For each group, process the test case. \n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first test case's input is:\n\nLine 1: 5 4\n\nLine 2: 9 14 6 2 11\n\nLine 3: 8 4 7 20\n\nSo for each group of three lines, process the test case. \n\nNow, the code for each test case is straightforward. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n and m\n\n        n, m = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        b = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        # process\n\n        even_a = 0\n\n        for num in a:\n\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n\n                even_a += 1\n\n        odd_a = n - even_a\n\n        even_b = 0\n\n        for num in b:\n\n            if num % 2 == 0:\n\n                even_b += 1\n\n        odd_b = m - even_b\n\n        res = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n\n        print(res)\n\nBut wait, this code would process each test case. \n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample input lines are:\n\nLine 1: 5 4\n\nLine 2: 9 14 6 2 11\n\nLine 3: 8 4 7 20\n\nLine 4: 5 1\n\nLine 5: 2 4 6 8 10\n\nLine 6: 5\n\nLine 7: 1 4\n\nLine 8: 10\n\nLine 9: 20 30 40 50\n\nSo the code would process three test cases. \n\nFor the first test case, the code returns 3, as expected. \n\nFor the second test case, even_a is 5, odd_a 0. even_b is 0, odd_b 1. min(5,1)=1, min(0,0)=0. total 1. \n\nThird test case: even_a is 1, odd_a 0. even_b is 4, odd_b 0. min(1,0) is 0, min(0,4) is 0. total 0. \n\nWhich matches the sample outputs. \n\nThus, this code should work. \n\nBut what about when the input is only one test case? Well, the code handles it. \n\nBut what if the input is not a multiple of three lines? Well, the problem says that the input is correct. \n\nThus, the code should work. \n\nNow, the code can be written as follows. \n\nBut in Python, for reading from stdin, sometimes the input is read via input() function. However, for multiple test cases, using sys.stdin.read() is better. \n\nBut in some cases, when the input is large, using sys.stdin.read() is more efficient. \n\nBut for the problem's constraints, n and m up to 1e5, the code should be efficient. \n\nBut for the code, the processing of each test case is O(n + m), which is acceptable. \n\nThus, the code should be correct. \n\nNow, write the code accordingly. \n\nAnother thing to note: the code must read the input correctly. For example, the lines may have leading or trailing spaces, but splitting by whitespace is handled by split(). \n\nYes. \n\nThus, the code should be as follows.\n",
