    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and the output is the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nHmm. How do I check all possible substrings and their occurrences?\n\nAn idea: for each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's any substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once we find the largest such L, return it. If no such substring exists, return 0.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Iterate possible lengths L from min(len(s), max possible) down to 1.\n   For example, for a string of length N, the maximum possible L is N//2, because you need two occurrences. Wait, not exactly. For example, if the string is 'aaa', then for L=2, there are two occurrences (positions 0-1 and 1-2). So the maximum possible L is floor(N/2) maybe? Or maybe up to N-1? Because for a string of length 1, you can't have two occurrences. So the maximum possible L is len(s)-1, but for that to have two occurrences, the string must be at least two characters long. But for the problem, the input is non-empty. So for each possible L from len(s)-1 down to 1, check if any substring of length L appears at least twice.\n\nWait, but for example, if the string is length 5, like 'abcde', then the maximum possible L is 2. Because for L=3, the first occurrence would be positions 0-2, the next would need to start at position 2 (but then the substring is 2-4, which is length 3. But that's possible. Wait, the length of the substring is L, so for a string of length N, the maximum L for which there can be two occurrences is N-1. Because the first occurrence starts at 0, and the second starts at 1. For example, in 'aaaaa', L=4: substrings 'aaaa' starting at 0 and 1. So yes, for L up to N-1.\n\nBut for the problem, the maximum possible L is len(s) - 1. However, for the case where the entire string is the same character, like 'zzz', then for L=2, there are two occurrences (positions 0-1 and 1-2). So the answer would be 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFor each possible length L starting from the maximum possible (len(s)-1) down to 1:\n\n   Check all possible substrings of length L. For each substring, check if it appears at least twice. If any such substring exists, return L as the answer.\n\nIf after checking all possible L down to 1, none are found, return 0.\n\nNow, the question is how to efficiently check for each L.\n\nFor each L, generate all substrings of length L, and track their counts. For example, using a dictionary where keys are the substrings, and values are the number of times they appear. Then, for any substring with count >=2, return True for that L.\n\nBut since the string can be up to 100 characters, the maximum possible L is 99. For each L, the number of possible substrings is (n - L + 1). For example, for L=50, there are 51 substrings. For each L, checking all substrings and storing them in a hash map is feasible.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nfor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n   create a set or a dictionary to track substrings of length L\n\n   for i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n       substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n       if substr is already in the set, then return L as the answer\n\n       else add it to the set\n\n   if after checking all substrings for this L, none are found, continue to L-1\n\nWait, but for the first occurrence of a substring, we can check if it's already in the set. So for example, when processing the substrings for a given L, once a substring is found twice, we can immediately return L as the answer.\n\nBut for the problem, we need to check all possible substrings of length L. So for each L, we can collect all substrings and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nBut for the purpose of checking, even if there's one substring that occurs twice, we can return L as the answer. So for each L, we can iterate through all possible substrings and track their occurrences. Once any substring is found to occur at least twice, we can return L.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For each L, we can loop through all possible starting indices. For each substring, check if it's been seen before. If yes, then return L. Else, add to the set. But wait, for example, if a substring occurs three times, then when we process the second occurrence, we can return L. So this approach would work.\n\nBut for the first occurrence, we add it to the set. For the second occurrence, we check if it's in the set, and if yes, return True.\n\nSo for each L, the code could be:\n\nseen = set()\n\nfor i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1):\n\n    substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n    if substr in seen:\n\n        return L\n\n    seen.add(substr)\n\nBut wait, this would miss cases where the same substring occurs more than once, but not in the first two occurrences. For example, if a substring occurs three times. However, the first time it's added to the set, then the second occurrence would trigger the condition. So this approach works.\n\nSo for each L, we can check all substrings and see if any of them occurs at least twice. If yes, then return L. Otherwise, proceed to check L-1.\n\nThis approach would work, but for each L, we have to check all substrings. However, since the maximum length of the string is 100, the total number of operations is acceptable.\n\nLet me think about the worst case. For a string of length 100, for each L from 100 down to 1:\n\nFor L=100, there is only one substring (the whole string). So no duplicates. Then L=99: two substrings (positions 0-98 and 1-99). Check if they are same. Then L=98: three substrings, etc. For each L, the number of substrings is O(n), and for each substring, we check in a set. So the total time is O(n^2) for the worst case. For n=100, this is 10^4 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nSo this approach is feasible.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead the input string. Then for L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n   for each possible starting index i, get the substring of length L.\n\n   check if any of these substrings occurs more than once.\n\n   if yes, return L.\n\nOnce the maximum L is found, return it.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd'\n\nCheck for L=4: only one substring. No duplicates. Then L=3: substrings 'abc', 'bcd'. No duplicates. Then L=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'cd'. No duplicates. Then L=1: 'a','b','c','d'. All unique. So answer is 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa'\n\nCheck for L=5: len(s) is 5. Only one substring. No. Then L=4: substrings 'abab' (positions 0-3) and 'baba' (positions 1-4). No duplicates. Then L=3: substrings 'aba' (0-2), 'bab' (1-3), 'aba' (2-4). When processing the third substring (i=2), we check if 'aba' is in the set. The first occurrence was at i=0. So yes, return 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz'. len is 3. Check L=3: one substring. No. Then L=2: substrings 'zz' (positions 0-1) and 'zz' (positions 1-2). When processing the second substring, we check if it's in the set. It is, so return 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, code-wise, the steps are:\n\nRead the input string. For example, the input is read from stdin. The input is a single line, which is the string. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as the first line containing the string. Wait, the sample input shows something like ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] but that's probably a mistake. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: the first input line contains the string. So the input is a single string. But the sample input shows three strings, which might be a mistake. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is written as:\n\nInput\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nOutput\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nBut that seems to be a mistake. Probably, the actual input is multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single string. Wait, the problem says:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. So the input is a single string. But the sample input shows three different strings. That suggests that perhaps the sample is written in a way that shows multiple test cases, but the actual problem is for a single test case. So the code should read a single string from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). So the input is a single string, and the output is a single number.\n\nBut the sample input and output shows multiple test cases. Maybe that's a formatting error. For example, maybe the sample input is three separate test cases, but the problem expects that the code is written to handle each input line as a separate test case. However, the problem says that the input is the first line containing the string. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not correct.\n\nBut looking back, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, etc.\n\nSo the code should read one line as input, and output one number. So for example, for the input 'ababa', the output is 3.\n\nBut the sample input shows three different strings. So perhaps the sample is written as a list of inputs and outputs, but the actual code needs to process one input string.\n\nTherefore, the code should read the input string from stdin, and output the answer.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nSo, in Python:\n\nRead the input string as input().strip()\n\nThen, compute the maximum length.\n\nSo, the code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            print(L)\n\n            exit()\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but for the sample input 'zzz', the code would check L=3, then 2. For L=3, the substr is 'zzz' once. Then for L=2, the first substr is 'zz' (i=0), added to seen. Then i=1, substr is 'zz', which is in seen. So returns 2. Correct.\n\nBut what about overlapping occurrences? For example, in 'ababa', L=3, the substrings are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). When i=2, the substr is 'aba' which is already in seen (from i=0). So returns 3. Correct.\n\nThis code seems to handle that.\n\nBut what about cases where the same substring appears more than once, but not in consecutive positions?\n\nLike 'abcab', for L=2: substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'ca', 'ab'. So when i=0, 'ab' is added. Then i=3, 'ab' is found again. So returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, test case for when the entire string is same characters. Like 'aaaaa' (length 5). For L=4: substrings are 'aaaa' (i=0), 'aaaa' (i=1). So returns 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaa' (length 6). For L=3, substrings are 'aab', 'abb', 'bba', 'baa'. Wait, but there's 'aab' (i=0), 'abb' (i=1), 'bba' (i=2), 'baa' (i=3). But the substring 'aab' occurs again? No. But for L=2: substrings are 'aa', 'ab', 'bb', 'ba', 'aa'. So when i=0, 'aa' is added. Then i=4, 'aa' again. So returns 2. But there's also 'aa' in positions 0-1 and 4-5. But for L=3, maybe there's a longer substring. For example, 'aab' occurs once. 'abb' once. 'bba' once. 'baa' once. So no. But for L=2, the answer is 2.\n\nBut what about 'aabbaa' has 'aa' in positions 0-1, 4-5, and also 0-1 and 3-4 (if L=2). Wait, the substrings for L=2 are:\n\ni=0: aa\n\ni=1: ab\n\ni=2: bb\n\ni=3: ba\n\ni=4: aa\n\nSo when i=4, substr is 'aa' which is in the set (from i=0). So returns 2. So the code returns 2. But there is a longer substring. For example, 'aab' occurs once, but 'aab' is not repeated. What about 'aabbaa' has 'aab' and 'aab' again? No. But for L=3, the first occurrence is i=0: 'aab', then i=1: 'abb', i=2: 'bba', i=3: 'baa'. So no duplicates. So the maximum is 2.\n\nBut in the case of 'aabbaa', the maximum is 2. But if the string is 'abab', then for L=2, 'ab' occurs at positions 0 and 2. So the code returns 2. But for L=3, the substrings are 'aba', 'bab'. No duplicates. So the maximum is 2.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'abcabc' (length 6). For L=3, substrings are 'abc', 'bca', 'cab'. No duplicates. For L=2, substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'ca', 'ab', 'bc'. So when i=0, 'ab' is added. Then i=3, 'ab' is found again. So returns 2. But the maximum is 3? No, because the substrings of length 3 are all unique. So the maximum is 2. But the code returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about 'abcab'? For L=3, substrings are 'abc', 'bca', 'cab'. No duplicates. For L=2: 'ab', 'bc', 'ca', 'ab'. So returns 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling edge cases.\n\nCase when the string is of length 1. Then, the output is 0.\n\nCase when the string is of length 2, like 'aa'. Then L=2: one substring. Then check L=1. For L=1, the substrings are 'a' and 'a'. So when i=1, the substr is 'a' which is in the set. So returns 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'aa', output is 1.\n\nAnother case: 'aaa' (length 3). For L=2: substrings are 'aa' (i=0) and 'aa' (i=1). So returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input string, then for each L from len(s) down to 1, check for duplicates in the substrings. If found, return L. If none, return 0.\n\nSo the code:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but in Python, the exit() function may not be the best. But in code submission, using sys.exit() is better. However, in the code, the code is supposed to print the answer and exit. So perhaps, using print and break.\n\nBut in the code as written, once a substring is found, print L and exit. So in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            sys.exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nBut the code may not have sys.exit, but in Python, the code can use return, but since it's a script, the code can just print and break.\n\nWait, but in the code, the code is written as a script. So for example, once the code finds the correct L, it prints it and exits. Otherwise, after checking all possibilities, it prints 0.\n\nBut in Python, the code can use 'exit()' but perhaps it's better to use 'break' and flags. However, for code efficiency, the code can proceed as written.\n\nBut in Python, the code may not have 'sys.exit()', but in code submission, the code can use 'print' and break.\n\nWait, but in the code above, once we find the L, we print it and exit. Otherwise, after checking all L, print 0.\n\nBut in Python, the code will need to import sys to use sys.exit(). Alternatively, we can use a flag.\n\nBut for code submission, the code can be written as:\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nmax_len = 0\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nWait, but in Python, the exit() function is in the sys module, and using exit() may not be allowed in some environments. However, in code submission, using sys.exit() is acceptable. But in the code, the code uses exit(), which in Python is available in the standard environment. But perhaps it's better to use sys.exit().\n\nSo, perhaps the code should import sys and use sys.exit().\n\nBut in code submission, sometimes people use return, but in a script, the code can't return. So, the code would need to use sys.exit().\n\nBut in the code, after printing, the code can exit. So, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            sys.exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n\nBut in the case of the sample input, for example, when the input is 'ababa', the code would print 3 and exit.\n\nBut what about when the code is run in an environment where sys.exit() is not allowed? Well, in programming competitions, it's acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, the code can also use a flag. For example:\n\nfound = False\nfor L in ...:\n   ...\n   if found:\n       break\nBut in this case, the code would need to break out of the loops.\n\nBut the code as written with sys.exit() is concise and efficient.\n\nBut in the code submission, the code must not have any extra outputs. For example, when the code finds the answer, it prints and exits. Otherwise, after all possibilities, it prints 0.\n\nBut the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd' → output 0.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → output 3.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' → output 2.\n\nBut the code would handle these correctly.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' → output 4 (since for L=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' (positions 0-3) and 1-4. So during the loop, when i=1, substr is 'aaaa', which is already in the set (from i=0). So returns 4.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaa' → output 2.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, considering that the problem says that the input is a single string, and the code reads from stdin. So the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences of the substring can overlap, which adds complexity to the solution.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: Start from the maximum possible length of the substring (which is the length of the string minus one) down to 1. This ensures that we check for the longest possible substrings first.\n2. **Track Substrings Using a Set**: For each length, generate all possible substrings and use a set to track their occurrences. If a substring is found more than once, we immediately return its length as the result.\n3. **Early Termination**: As soon as we find a valid substring length that meets the criteria, we print it and exit the program to ensure efficiency.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ns = input().strip()\nn = len(s)\nfor L in range(n, 0, -1):\n    seen = set()\n    for i in range(n - L + 1):\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n        if substr in seen:\n            print(L)\n            sys.exit()\n        seen.add(substr)\nprint(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input string is read and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.\n- **Loop Through Lengths**: We start checking from the longest possible substring length down to 1. This ensures that the first valid length found is the longest possible.\n- **Check Substrings**: For each length, we generate all substrings of that length and check if they have been seen before using a set. If a duplicate is found, we print the length and exit immediately.\n- **Efficiency**: By checking from the longest possible length downwards and using a set for quick lookups, the solution efficiently finds the answer without unnecessary computations.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle all edge cases, including strings where no valid substrings exist, by defaulting to a length of 0. The use of a set allows for constant time complexity checks for substring occurrences, making the solution both efficient and straightforward.",
