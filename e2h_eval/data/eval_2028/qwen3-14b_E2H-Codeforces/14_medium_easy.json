He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is, given an integer m, find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. Then output the count followed by the sorted list of those n's.\n\nHmm. So first, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s.\n\nThe formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo for a given m, I need to find all n's where this sum equals m.\n\nBut how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For example, in the sample input where m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. For 5! the count is 1 (5/5=1). For 6! it's still 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1). Similarly up to 9. Then 10! would have 2 zeros (10/5=2, plus 10/25=0, total 2).\n\nSo the problem is to find all n's where the trailing zero count is exactly m. But how?\n\nFirst, I need to find for a given m, the possible n's. However, there's a catch here. For some m, there might be no n's. For example, if m=5, maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Wait, let's check. Let's compute for n=24: 24/5=4, 24/25=0. Total 4. For n=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So between 24 and 25, there's a jump from 4 to 6. So there's no n with exactly 5 trailing zeros. Therefore, for m=5, the answer would be 0.\n\nSo the problem requires that we check if there exists any n that gives exactly m zeros, and if so, collect all such n's.\n\nNow, the approach:\n\nFirst, for a given m, find the possible n's. How?\n\nWe can think of this as a binary search problem. Because the number of trailing zeros increases as n increases. However, the function is not strictly increasing. For example, for n=5,6,7,8,9, the count is 1. So for m=1, there are 5 numbers. But for some m, there may be no numbers.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the minimal n such that the number of trailing zeros is >= m. Let's call this low.\n\n2. Check if the count for low is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the range of n's that give exactly m.\n\nBut how to find the range?\n\nAlternatively, for each m, the possible n's are in a consecutive range. Because when you increase n, the count of zeros can stay the same or increase. So for example, when you reach a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1 (or more if it's a multiple of higher powers of 5).\n\nBut for a given m, the numbers n that produce exactly m zeros would form a contiguous range. For example, in the sample case m=1, the numbers 5-9 all produce exactly 1 zero. So the count is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the idea is to find the lower and upper bounds of n where the count is exactly m.\n\nBut how to find these bounds?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, find the smallest n where the count is >= m. Let's call this n_low.\n\nThen check if the count for n_low is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the largest n where the count is exactly m. Let's call this n_high.\n\nThen all numbers between n_low and n_high (inclusive) would be valid. The count would be n_high - n_low + 1.\n\nBut how to find n_low and n_high?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, the possible n's are in the range [a, b], where a is the first n that gives exactly m zeros, and b is the last such n.\n\nBut how to find a and b?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nWe can use binary search to find the minimal n where f(n) = m. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps first find the minimal n where f(n) >= m. Let's call this x. Then check if f(x) is equal to m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1. Let's call this y. Then the numbers from x to y-1 will have exactly m zeros. So the count is y - x.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because for example, in the sample case m=1:\n\nFind x where f(x) >=1. The minimal x is 5. Then find y where f(y) >=2. The minimal y is 10. So the numbers between 5 and 9 (y-1) are the ones with exactly 1 zero. The count is 9-5 +1 = 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example, m=5. Let's see:\n\nFind x where f(x) >=5. Let's compute:\n\nFor n=24: f(24)=4+0=4.\n\nn=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, total 6. So the minimal x where f(x)>=5 is 25. But f(25) is 6, which is greater than m=5. Therefore, there are no solutions. Hence the answer is 0.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Find x = the minimal n where f(n) >= m.\n\n- Check if f(x) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n- Else, find y = the minimal n where f(n) >= m+1.\n\n- The numbers from x to y-1 are the valid n's. So the count is y - x.\n\nThus, the steps are:\n\nFor given m, find x and y as above.\n\nBut how to compute x and y?\n\nWe can use binary search for that.\n\nSo first, implement a function count_zeros(n) that returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThen, for x, perform a binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nSimilarly for y, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nOnce we have x and y, check if count_zeros(x) == m. If yes, then the answer is the numbers from x to y-1. The count is y - x.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple numbers where count_zeros(n) = m?\n\nYes, but according to the logic, the numbers between x and y-1 will all have count_zeros(n) = m. Because x is the first n where count_zeros(n) >=m, and y is the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So between x and y-1, the count is exactly m.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nImplement count_zeros(n) as:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nNow, for a given m, find x where count_zeros(x) >=m and x is the minimal such. Then check if count_zeros(x) is m. If not, return 0. Otherwise, find y as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the answer is the numbers from x to y-1.\n\nSo for example, for m=1:\n\nx is 5 (count_zeros(5) = 1). y is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=2. Which is 10. So the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code needs to find x and y.\n\nNow, how to find x via binary search.\n\nThe binary search for x:\n\nWe need to find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe possible range for n is from 1 to ... Well, for m=1, the maximum possible n is 5. But for larger m, the upper bound can be 5*m. Because for n=5*m, the count_zeros(n) is at least m. Because 5*m /5 = m, and higher terms add more. So for example, for m=1, 5*1=5, which gives 1. For m=2, 5*2=10, which gives 2 (from 10/5=2, 10/25=0). So the upper bound can be 5*m.\n\nBut perhaps even 5*m is not enough? Let's think for m=5. Let's say we want to find x where count_zeros(x) >=5. For example, n=25 gives 6, which is >=5. But 5*5=25. So that works. So the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m. But maybe even higher. But for binary search, the upper bound can be set as 5*m. Because for any m, the minimal n that gives count_zeros(n) >=m is <=5*m.\n\nWait, let's think. For example, m=5. The minimal n is 25, which is 5*5. For m=6, the minimal n is 25, which is 5*5. So 5*m is 30. So 25 is less than 30. So yes, 5*m is an upper bound.\n\nAnother example: m=2. The minimal n is 10, which is 5*2. So yes.\n\nSo for binary search, the upper bound can be 5*m.\n\nSo for binary search, the left is 0, right is 5*m.\n\nBut what about for m=0? Well, the problem says m starts from 1.\n\nSo for the binary search to find x, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nOnce x is found, check if count_zeros(x) ==m. If not, then no solution. Otherwise, proceed to find y.\n\nSimilarly, for y, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Then the numbers from x to y-1 are the valid ones.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nRead m.\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nSo, for m given:\n\nCompute x as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m.\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m: then answer is 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute y as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nthen the numbers are x, x+1,..., y-1.\n\nthe count is y -x.\n\nSo, the code needs to implement this logic.\n\nNow, how to implement the binary search.\n\nLet me think about the binary search function.\n\nFunction to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nWait, but for example, if target is 1, then low starts at 0, high is 5*1=5.\n\nLoop:\n\nInitially low=0, high=5.\n\nmid = 2. count_zeros(2) is 0 <1 → low becomes 3.\n\nmid = (3+5)/2=4. count_zeros(4)=0 <1 → low=5.\n\nNow low=5, high=5. Exit loop. return 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: target=6. Let's see.\n\nWhat is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=6?\n\nWell, 25 gives 6. So the function should return 25.\n\nLet's see:\n\nlow=0, high=5*6=30.\n\nmid=15. count_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). 3 <6 → low=16.\n\nmid= (16+30)/2=23. count_zeros(23) is 4 (23//5=4, 23//25=0). Still less than 6. low=24.\n\nmid= (24+30)/2=27. count_zeros(27) is 5 (27//5=5, 27//25=1 → 5+1=6? Wait wait:\n\nWait count_zeros(27) is 27//5=5, 27//25=1, 27//125=0. So total is 5+1=6. So for target=6, the function would check mid=27. count_zeros(27) is 6 >= target. So high=27. Now low=24, high=27.\n\nmid = (24+27)//2=25.5 → 25. count_zeros(25) is 25//5=5, 25//25=1 → 5+1=6. So >= target. So high=25. Now low=24, high=25.\n\nmid=24. count_zeros(24) is 24//5=4, 24//25=0 → 4 <6. So low=25. Now low=high=25. return 25. Which is correct.\n\nSo the function works.\n\nSo, once we have x = find_min_n(m), and check if count_zeros(x) ==m. If not, return 0. Else, find y = find_min_n(m+1). Then the answer is the numbers from x to y-1.\n\nSo, for example, m=1:\n\nx = find_min_n(1) →5.\n\ncount_zeros(5) is 1 → yes.\n\ny = find_min_n(2) →10.\n\nso numbers from 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would generate that.\n\nNow, what about when m is such that there are multiple n's?\n\nAnother example: m=2.\n\nfind_min_n(2) is 10 (count_zeros(10) is 2). Then find_min_n(3) is 15 (count_zeros(15) is 3). So numbers from 10 to 14. That's 5 numbers.\n\nWait, let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(10) is 2.\n\ncount_zeros(11) is 2 (11//5=2, 11//25=0 → 2).\n\nSame for 12, 13, 14. Then 15: 15//5=3, 15//25=0 →3. So yes, the numbers are 10-14. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would output 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, the edge cases.\n\nCase when m=5.\n\nfind_min_n(5) is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So the answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: m=6. find_min_n(6) is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) is 25? Or 25's count is 6. Let's see.\n\nWhat is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7?\n\nLet me compute for n=25: 6. n=25+1=26: same as 25. 26//5=5, 26//25=1 → 6. So same as 25. So need to go higher.\n\nn=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → total 7. So the minimal n is 25? No. Wait, 25 gives 6. So the minimal n for target 7 is 25? No. Let me think again.\n\nWait, for target=7, find_min_n(7) would be the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\nLet me compute for 25: count_zeros(25) is 6. So not enough. So need to go higher.\n\nLet me try n=25: 6. n=26: same. n=27: same. n=28: same. n=29: same. n=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 6+1=7. So the minimal n is 25? No, 30.\n\nSo the function find_min_n(7) would return 25? Or 30?\n\nLet me simulate the binary search for target=7. The upper bound is 5*7=35.\n\nInitially low=0, high=35.\n\nmid=17. count_zeros(17) is 3. <7 → low=18.\n\nmid= (18+35)/2=26.5 →26. count_zeros(26) is 5+1=6 <7 → low=27.\n\nmid=(27+35)/2=31. count_zeros(31) is 6 (31//5=6, 31//25=1 → 6+1=7? Wait 6+1=7? Oh yes. So count_zeros(31) is 7. So >= target. So high=31.\n\nNow, low=27, high=31. mid= (27+31)/2=29. count_zeros(29) is 29//5=5, 29//25=1 → total 6. <7 → low=30.\n\nNow low=30, high=31. mid=30.5 →30. count_zeros(30) is 6 + 1 (from 30//25=1) → 7. So >= target. high=30. Now low=30, high=30. return 30.\n\nWhich is correct. So for target=7, the minimal n is 30. So the code would find that.\n\nSo for m=6, the x is 25 (count_zeros(25)=6). Then y is find_min_n(7)=30. So the numbers from 25 to 29. Let's check:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. 26: same. 27: same. 28: same. 29: same. 30:7. So the numbers 25-29 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. So the answer would be 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0. But according to the input constraints, m is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: m=100000. Need to make sure that the code can handle large numbers efficiently. Since the binary search is O(log (5*m)) steps, and each step is O(log n) for the count_zeros function. Which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python.\n\nFirst, implement count_zeros(n).\n\nThen, implement find_min_n(target) function.\n\nBut in Python, for the binary search, the function find_min_n(target) can be written as follows.\n\nBut for the binary search, the upper bound can be 5 * target. However, for very large m (like 1e5), 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nNow, for m=1e5, the upper bound is 5e5. The binary search would take log2(5e5) steps, which is around 20 steps. Each step involves count_zeros(n), which for n up to 5e5, is O(log n) steps. So overall, it's efficient.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut the input is a single line containing m. Wait, the example input shows ['1', '5'] as input, but that's probably for multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is a single integer m. The example shows two cases, but perhaps the actual input is one line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000).\n\nBut the example shows input as ['1', '5'] and output as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']. Which suggests that perhaps the original problem is part of a programming competition where multiple test cases are given, but the user's code must read from stdin. However, the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the example is for multiple test cases, but the actual code must process a single m per run.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the example input, the input is ['1', '5'], but perhaps that's a mistake. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer m. The sample input shows for example, when m is 1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9' and for m=5, the output is 0. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases. But the code must read a single m from input.\n\nTherefore, the code must read a single integer m from stdin, and output the required answer.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input, m is 1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. In the second sample, m is 5, output is 0.\n\nSo, the code should read m from input, process it, and output the answer.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead m from input. Then:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count =0\n    while n>0:\n        n = n//5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low =0\n    high =5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high)//2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nThen:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nx = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(x) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    y = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = y -x\n    print(k)\n    if k>0:\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n\nWait, but for example, when k is 5, the range from x to y-1 is x, x+1, ..., y-1. So the code would generate range(x, y) as the list. Because range in Python is [start, end). So for example, x=5, y=10 → range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nBut in Python, when you do range(x, y), it includes x, x+1,..., y-1.\n\nSo, the code for the output is:\n\nprint(k)\nprint(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n\nBut when k is 0, which can't happen here because we checked that count_zeros(x) ==m. Because if count_zeros(x) ==m, then y is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m+1. So x is the first n with count m, and y is the first n with count >=m+1. So the numbers from x to y-1 are all the numbers with count m. So the count is y -x. Which is k.\n\nBut in code, when k is zero? Well, no. Because if count_zeros(x) ==m, then y is find_min_n(m+1). So, for example, if m=5, and x is 25, but count_zeros(x) is 6, which is not equal to m=5. So the code would not enter the else clause.\n\nSo in the else clause, the code is safe.\n\nBut what about when m is such that there are multiple numbers. For example, m=1, the code outputs 5 numbers.\n\nBut when m is 1, the code would generate range(5,10) which is [5,6,7,8,9], which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut let's test some cases.\n\nTest case 1: m=1.\n\nx = find_min_n(1) →5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\ny = find_min_n(2) →10. So k=10-5=5. Output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nTest case 2: m=5.\n\nx = find_min_n(5). Let's compute what that returns.\n\nLet me compute for target=5.\n\nThe minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet me compute for n=24: count_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 =4. n=25: 6. So the minimal n is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So the code would print 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nx = find_min_n(6) is 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So proceed. Then find_min_n(7) is 30. So numbers from 25 to 29. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo code would output 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nAnother case: m=2. x=10, y=15. So numbers 10-14. 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about m=0? Well, the problem says m is at least 1. So no need to handle.\n\nNow, what about when m is very large, like 1e5?\n\nBut the code should handle it. Because the binary search is efficient.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut need to handle the case where the output is 0. For example, m=5.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nBut in the code, after checking if count_zeros(x) is m, else print 0.\n\nElse, compute y and output the numbers.\n\nBut in code, when k is zero? Well, no, because if count_zeros(x) is m, then y is the first n with count >=m+1. So x is the first n with count m, and y is the first n with count >=m+1. So the numbers between x and y-1 are all with count m. So the count is y-x. So for example, if x is 25 and y is 25, then y -x is zero. But how can that happen?\n\nOnly if find_min_n(m+1) returns x. Which would be possible if count_zeros(x) is m, and count_zeros(x) is also >= m+1. Which is not possible. Because count_zeros(x) is m. So for m+1, the find_min_n(m+1) would return x only if count_zeros(x) >= m+1. Which is not possible since count_zeros(x) is m. So in that case, the code would have y=x. Then k=0. But that would mean that there are no numbers with exactly m zeros. Which contradicts the earlier check that count_zeros(x) is m. So how can this happen?\n\nWait, no. Because for example, if m is 5, but x is 25, and count_zeros(25) is 6. Then the code would not enter the else clause. But if the code is in the else clause, that implies that count_zeros(x) is m. So for example, if m is 6, x is 25, count_zeros(x) is 6. Then find_min_n(7) would be 30. So y=30. So k=30-25=5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nBut what if there is a case where find_min_n(m+1) returns x?\n\nOnly if count_zeros(x) >= m+1. But since we are in the else clause, count_zeros(x) is m. So m >= m+1? No. So this can't happen. So y is always larger than x.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code for the output part is:\n\nprint(k)\nprint(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n\nBut when k is zero? Well, in the else clause, k is y -x. Which is at least 1? Because y is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Since count_zeros(x) is m, then count_zeros(y) is >= m+1. So x must be less than y. Because if x is the first n with count_zeros(n) = m, then for y, which is the first n with count_zeros(n) >= m+1, it must be that y is larger than x. Because count_zeros(x) is m, which is less than m+1.\n\nSo y is larger than x, so k is y -x >=1.\n\nSo in the else clause, the code can safely print k and the list.\n\nBut what about when the list is empty? No, because k is y -x, which is at least 1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the case where the list is empty, but the code is in the else clause. That can't happen.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the output, when k is 5, the code prints '5' followed by the numbers.\n\nBut the code for the output is:\n\nprint(k)\nprint(' '.join(...))\n\nBut when k is 5, the first line is 5, and the second line is the numbers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nNow, the code for the sample input m=1 would output 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nNow, the code must handle the case when the list is empty. But according to the code, that's not possible.\n\nSo, the code is:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute x = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(x) !=m: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute y = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nk = y -x.\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint the numbers from x to y-1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nBut for the case where k is zero? Well, no.\n\nBut for example, if m is 5, and x is 25, count_zeros(x) is 6, so the code would not enter the else.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut for the code, the functions need to be defined.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nx = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(x) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    y = find_min_n(m+1)\n    k = y -x\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n\nWait, but in the sample input, for m=1, the output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. But the code would print 5, then the list. Which is correct.\n\nBut when the code prints the list, for example, range(x,y) is 5 to 10, which is 5,6,7,8,9. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what if m is such that there are multiple numbers, but the code returns them in order?\n\nYes, because the range is from x to y-1, which is in increasing order.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code for m=5.\n\nx = find_min_n(5) → let's compute.\n\ntarget is 5.\n\nThe minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet me compute for n=24: count_zeros(24) = 4 + 0 =4.\n\nn=25: 6. So the binary search would find 25 as the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=5. But count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So code prints 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. x is 25, count_zeros(x) is 6. So proceed. y is find_min_n(7) →30. So k=5. Output is 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nAnother test case: m=2. x is 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. y is find_min_n(3) →15. So numbers 10-14. Which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, what about m=0? Well, the input constraints say m is ≥1. So no need to handle.\n\nNow, what about m=3?\n\nLet me compute:\n\nfind_min_n(3) →15?\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0 →3). So yes. Then find_min_n(4) is 20? Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(20) is 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0). So yes. So numbers from 15 to 19. Which is 5 numbers. So code would output 5 and 15 16 17 18 19.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, the code seems correct. But what about when the numbers are not 5 in count?\n\nLike for m=4. Let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(4) is 20. count_zeros(20) is 4. Then find_min_n(5) is 25. So numbers from 20 to 24. Let's check count_zeros(20) is 4, 21: same, 22, 23, 24. Then 25 is 6. So 5 numbers. So code outputs 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code is ready. Let me write it in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, when m is 1e5, the 5*m is 5e5, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, when m is 1e5, the code may take some time, but it's acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin and write to stdout. So the code is:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nx = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(x) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    y = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = y - x\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n\nWait, but for the sample input, when m=1, the code outputs 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5, output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when there are zero numbers? Like m=5, code outputs 0.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple numbers?\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut there's one thing to note: when m is very large, like 1e5, the 5*m could be up to 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nAnother thing: when m is 0, but the code doesn't handle it, but the input constraints say m ≥1.\n\nSo this should be okay.\n\nNow, test case for m=2:\n\nSample input 2, output is 5 numbers.\n\nAnother test case: m=3",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers `n` such that the factorial of `n` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently searching for valid values of `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in `n!` is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of factors of 5.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: Given the constraints, a direct approach to check each number up to a large value would be inefficient. Instead, we use binary search to find the smallest number `n` such that the count of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least `m`. We then determine the range of numbers that produce exactly `m` trailing zeros.\n\n3. **Range Calculation**: Once we find the smallest number `x` where the trailing zeros count is at least `m`, we check if it exactly matches `m`. If not, there are no valid numbers. Otherwise, we find the smallest number `y` where the trailing zeros count is at least `m + 1`. The valid numbers are those between `x` and `y - 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\nm = int(input())\n\nx = find_min_n(m)\nif count_zeros(x) != m:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    y = find_min_n(m + 1)\n    k = y - x\n    print(k)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, range(x, y))))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in `n!` by repeatedly dividing `n` by 5 and summing the quotients until `n` becomes zero.\n\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer `n` such that the number of trailing zeros in `n!` is at least the given target value. This helps in efficiently narrowing down the range of possible values for `n`.\n\n3. **Main Logic**: \n   - Read the input value `m`.\n   - Use `find_min_n` to determine the smallest number `x` where the trailing zeros count is at least `m`.\n   - Check if `x` indeed gives exactly `m` trailing zeros. If not, print `0`.\n   - If valid, determine the next smallest number `y` where the trailing zeros count is at least `m + 1`. The valid range of `n` values is from `x` to `y - 1`, which are printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the valid range using binary search, making the solution both optimal and scalable for large values of `m`.",
