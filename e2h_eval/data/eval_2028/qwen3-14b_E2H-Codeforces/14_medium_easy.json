Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nWait, let's think about how the trailing zero count increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the trailing zero count either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. Wait, no. For example, when n crosses a multiple of 5, the count increases. But when n is a multiple of higher powers of 5, like 25, then it adds more. For instance, 25 contributes two 5s. So when n increases from 24 to 25, the count increases by 2. So for some m, there might be no n's. Or maybe there's a range of n's that give the same count.\n\nBut how to find for a given m, what are the possible n's?\n\nLet me think. Let's say I want to find all n such that the number of trailing zeros in n! is exactly m. Let's denote the function f(n) as the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nSo, for each m, there can be 0, 1, or 5 possible n's? Wait, the sample input shows for m=1, there are 5 numbers (5,6,7,8,9). Let me check why. For 5! it's 120 (1 zero), 6! is 720 (1), 7! 5040 (1), etc. So up to 9! which is 362880 (still one zero). Then 10! adds another 5 (so 2 zeros). So for m=1, the numbers are from 5 to 9. That's five numbers.\n\nSo the idea is that for some m, there could be multiple n's. But how to find them?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\n1. Find the minimum n such that f(n) = m. Let's call this n_min.\n2. Then check how many consecutive numbers after n_min have f(n) = m. Because once n reaches a value where adding 1 increases the count, then the next numbers would have higher counts.\n\nBut how to find if there are any n's for a given m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given m, there are either 0, 1, or 5 possible n's? Wait, no. Let me think. For example, when m is 5, what happens? Let's calculate f(24) = 24/5 + 24/25 = 4 + 0 = 4. f(25) is 25/5 + 25/25 = 5 + 1 = 6. Wait, so between 25 and ... Well, for m=5, there's no n. Because when you reach 25, the count jumps from 4 (for 24) to 6 (for 25). So there is no n where f(n) = 5. Therefore, for such m, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the problem is to find if there exists n such that f(n) = m. If there is, then find all such n's.\n\nSo the steps I need to take:\n\nFirst, find the possible n's where f(n) = m. How?\n\nAn approach is to use binary search to find the lower and upper bounds of n for which f(n) = m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: For a given m, find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there are no solutions. Otherwise, find the range of n's where f(n) equals m.\n\nBut how to find the range?\n\nWait, for example, if m is 1, then the minimal n is 5. Then the maximum n is 9. So the numbers from 5 to 9 inclusive. How do I find the maximum n where f(n) = m?\n\nWell, perhaps the maximum n is the minimal n where f(n) = m+1 minus 1. Because once you reach that point, the count increases.\n\nSo for example, if for m=1, the minimal n is 5, and the next step is when the count becomes 2. The minimal n for m=2 is 10. So the maximum n for m=1 is 10-1=9.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\nFind the lower bound (the first n where f(n) = m) and upper bound (the last n where f(n) = m). Then all numbers between lower and upper are valid.\n\nBut how to find those bounds?\n\nLet me think. To find the lower bound, we can find the smallest n where f(n) = m. To find the upper bound, find the smallest n where f(n) = m+1, then subtract 1. Then check if the upper bound is indeed such that f(upper) = m.\n\nBut how do I find the smallest n where f(n) = m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given m, the possible n's are in a certain range, and we can find the lower and upper bounds via binary search.\n\nBut first, how to compute f(n) efficiently?\n\nYes, the function f(n) can be computed as:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem is to find all n where count_zeros(n) == m.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think: For a given m, we can find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this n_low. Then check if count_zeros(n_low) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1, call it n_high. Then the numbers from n_low to n_high -1 will have count_zeros equal to m. So the count is n_high - n_low.\n\nWait, but for example, in the sample case m=1:\n\nn_low is 5, since count_zeros(5) is 1. Then n_high is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= 2. Which is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (inclusive) are 5 numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: m=5. Let's see. Let's find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Let's compute count_zeros(24) is 4 + 0 = 4. count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. Hence, there are no solutions. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call it low.\n\n2. Check if count_zeros(low) is exactly m. If not, return 0.\n\n3. Else, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call it high.\n\n4. The numbers from low to high-1 are all the possible n's. So the count is high - low.\n\nBut wait, how do we find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m? We can use binary search for that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor a given m, perform binary search to find the lower bound (the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m). Then check if count_zeros(lower) == m. If not, return 0. Else, find the upper bound (the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1). Then the answer is all numbers from lower to upper-1.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem are:\n\n- For the given m, compute the lower bound (using binary search) for the first n with count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\n- Check if count_zeros(lower) == m. If not, output 0.\n\n- Else, compute upper bound for m+1. Then the numbers are from lower to upper-1.\n\nBut how to find the lower bound via binary search?\n\nThe binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nThe possible range of n can be from 0 to 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m (since 5*m /5 = m, and higher divisions add more). So the upper bound for binary search can be 5*m.\n\nWait, but for m=1, 5*1=5, which is the correct lower bound. For m=5, 5*5=25, which is the lower bound where count_zeros(25) is 6, which is greater than 5. So that works.\n\nSo the binary search for the lower bound would be between 0 and 5*m.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think of the binary search function. For example, to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nLet me write a helper function called find_min_n(target) which returns the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nSimilarly, for the upper bound, we can find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nOnce we have that, then the numbers are from lower to upper-1.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead m.\n\nIf m is 0, then the answer is 1 (n=0?), but according to the problem statement, the input is m ≥1. So no need to handle that.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute lower = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower) != m → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute upper = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthe numbers are from lower to upper-1, inclusive. The count is upper - lower.\n\nSo, for example, for m=1:\n\nlower is 5, upper is 10. So numbers 5-9, count 5.\n\nSo the code needs to generate these numbers.\n\nBut how to handle cases where upper is not found? Well, for m+1, the find_min_n would return some value.\n\nBut what if m is very large, like 1e5? Well, the binary search should handle it.\n\nNow, the key is to implement find_min_n(target).\n\nImplementing find_min_n(target):\n\nWe can perform binary search between low=0 and high=5*target (or something like that). Because for n=5*target, the count_zeros(n) is at least target (since 5*target//5 = target, and higher terms add more). So the upper bound for binary search can be 5*target.\n\nBut perhaps even higher? Well, for example, for target=1, 5*1=5, which is the correct value. For target=2, 5*2=10, which is the correct value. So that seems okay.\n\nSo the binary search steps for find_min_n(target):\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = 5*target.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n   if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n      high = mid\n\n   else:\n\n      low = mid + 1\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nOnce we have that, proceed as before.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: m=5.\n\nfind_min_n(5) returns 25? Let's compute count_zeros(25) is 6, which is >=5. But the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25?\n\nWait, let's check for n=24: count_zeros(24) is 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 =4 <5. So yes, the minimal n is 25. Then count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So the answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: m=6. Let's see. The lower bound is find_min_n(6). Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25. Then check if count_zeros(25) is 6 → yes. Then find upper bound for m+1=7.\n\nfind_min_n(7) → find the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=7. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6, count_zeros(29) is 29//5=5 + 29//25=1 → 6. count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 → 7. So the minimal n is 30. So the numbers are from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers. So the answer would be 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo for m=6, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: m=0. But according to the problem statement, m starts at 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: m=100000. How does the code handle that? Well, the binary search would work, but the 5*m could be very large. But for Python, even with m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable. The binary search would take log2(5e5) steps, which is about 20 steps. Each step involves computing count_zeros(n), which is O(log n) steps. So overall, it's manageable.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement the find_min_n function.\n\nThen, for the given m:\n\nCompute lower = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower) != m → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nupper = find_min_n(m+1)\n\nthe numbers are from lower to upper-1.\n\nSo the count is upper - lower.\n\nThen, output the count followed by the numbers in order.\n\nBut for m=1, the numbers are 5,6,7,8,9. So upper is 10, lower is 5. upper - lower is 5 numbers. So that's correct.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut wait, what if m is such that there are multiple n's. For example, when m=2, the lower is 10, upper is 15. Because count_zeros(10) is 2. count_zeros(14) is 2. count_zeros(15) is 3. So upper is 15. So the numbers are 10-14 (5 numbers). So the code would output 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, let's code.\n\nBut first, let's code the count_zeros function.\n\nThen, the find_min_n function.\n\nBut in Python, for the binary search.\n\nLet me code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nThen, the find_min_n function:\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nBut wait, for example, if target is 1, then 5*target is 5. The loop would find the correct value.\n\nOnce that is done, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, the main code:\n\nRead m from input. But the input is given as a single integer. For example, the sample input is ['1', '5'] which may be a list of test cases. Wait, the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. But the sample shows that the input is given as a list, perhaps for multiple test cases? Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user provided an example where the input is ['1', '5'] and output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'].\n\nWait, perhaps this is a mistake in the problem description. Because the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. But in the sample input, it's given as a list, perhaps indicating that there are multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is for two different test cases. For example, when the input is 1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers. When the input is 5, the output is 0.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read from standard input. So perhaps the original problem is that the input is a single integer m, and the code must process that.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is given as a list, but perhaps that's part of the way the problem is presented here. For example, in the problem statement, the input is given as a single integer m. So the code must read m from stdin.\n\nSo the code must read m from stdin, process it, and output the answer.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input, m is 1, and output is 5 followed by 5 6 7 8 9.\n\nIn the second sample input, m is 5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code should read m from input, process, and output accordingly.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead m from input. Then process.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead m as integer.\n\nThen:\n\nlower = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    upper = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    numbers = list(range(lower, upper))\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but range(lower, upper) gives numbers from lower to upper-1, which is correct.\n\nBut for example, lower is 5, upper is 10. range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9 → correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if upper is 0? Well, for m=0, but m starts from 1.\n\nBut for m=1, upper is 10, which is correct.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nlower = find_min_n(1) → returns 5. count_zeros(5) is 1 → yes.\n\nupper = find_min_n(2) → returns 10. So numbers from 5 to 9 → 5 numbers. Output is 5 followed by the numbers.\n\nSample input 2: m=5.\n\nlower = find_min_n(5) → returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5 → output 0.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nlower is find_min_n(6) → returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Then upper is find_min_n(7) → returns 30. So numbers from 25 to 29 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo output is 5 followed by 25 26 27 28 29.\n\nAnother test case: m=2. lower is 10. upper is 15. So numbers 10-14 → 5 numbers.\n\nBut let's check count_zeros(10) is 2, count_zeros(14) is 2. count_zeros(15) is 3. So yes.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut need to handle m=0? Well, according to problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for the input, we need to read from stdin. So:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    lower = find_min_n(m)\n\n    if count_zeros(lower) != m:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        upper = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n        numbers = list(range(lower, upper))\n\n        print(len(numbers))\n\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the output for m=1 is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So the first line is the count, then the numbers. So the code for the else part prints len(numbers), then the numbers.\n\nBut in the code above, when len(numbers) is 5, it prints 5 followed by the numbers. But in the sample output, the first line is 5, then the next line is the numbers. However, the code as written would print the len and the numbers on the same line. Wait, no:\n\nIn the code:\n\nprint(len(numbers)) → outputs the length followed by a newline.\n\nprint(' '.join(...)) → outputs the numbers on the next line.\n\nWhich matches the sample. For example, the first sample output is:\n\n5\n\n5 6 7 8 9\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input given by the user, the output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'], which suggests that for input 1, the output is two lines: first line is 5, second line is the numbers. Which is exactly what the code does.\n\nBut in the code, when the output is 0, it prints 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut for the case when the answer is zero, the code prints 0. But according to the problem statement, the output should first print k (the number of values), then print the k integers. So when k is 0, the second line is not printed. But the code for that case is:\n\nprint(0) → which outputs 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for m=5, the output is '0' (as in the second example). So that's correct.\n\nNow, testing the code.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? Well, the problem says m ≥1.\n\nNow, what about m=2?\n\nBut code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\nWhat if 5*target is not sufficient? For example, for very large m?\n\nBut for target m, the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m is at most 5*m. Because count_zeros(5*m) is 5m/5 + 5m/25 + ... = m + m/5 + m/25 + ... which is larger than m. So yes, 5*m is a safe upper bound.\n\nBut for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5, which is manageable.\n\nAnother possible optimization: perhaps the upper bound can be 5*m, but for some cases, it's possible that the minimal n is less than 5*m. But the binary search would handle that.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in the code, when m is 0, but the problem says m starts from 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: m=3.\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0). So lower is 15. Then upper is find_min_n(4). What is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=4?\n\ncount_zeros(15) is 3. count_zeros(20) is 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0). So upper is 20. So numbers from 15 to 19. Let's check count_zeros(15)=3, 16: same, 17, 18, 19. So 5 numbers. So output is 5 followed by 15 16 17 18 19.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother case: m=24. Let's see.\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24 (100/5=20, 100/25=4, 100/125=0 → total 24). So lower is 100. Then upper is find_min_n(25). What is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=25?\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(101) is same. count_zeros(104) is same. count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21 + 105//25=4 + 105//125=0 → 25. So upper is 105. So numbers from 100 to 104. So 5 numbers. Thus, code returns 5 numbers.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about m=25?\n\nlower is find_min_n(25). Let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(25) would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=25. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(105) is 25. So lower is 105. Then check count_zeros(105) is 25. Then upper is find_min_n(26). What is that?\n\ncount_zeros(109) is 25. count_zeros(110) is 110//5=22 + 110//25=4 + 110//125=0 → 26. So upper is 110. So numbers from 105 to 109. 5 numbers. So output is 5 numbers.\n\nSo code handles that.\n\nAnother case: m=6. As discussed earlier, returns 5 numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut what about when the upper bound is not found? Well, the code uses find_min_n(m+1), which will find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So even if m+1 is very large, it's handled.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nThe code reads from stdin. So for example, in the sample input, the input is '1' and '5' as separate test cases? Or is the input a single line with m?\n\nThe original problem says that the input is a single integer m. So the code is written for that. However, in the sample input given by the user, it's given as ['1', '5'], which might be a list of test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is for two different test cases. But the code is written to read a single m. So for example, in the first sample input, the input is 1, and the output is 5 followed by the numbers. For the second input, 5, output is 0.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should be as written.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, when the numbers are printed, the code uses print(len(numbers)), then print(' '.join(...)), which for the sample input would produce two lines. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the output is given as ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0'], which implies that for m=1, the output is two lines. The first line is 5, the second is the numbers. Which is what the code produces.\n\nBut the code for the case when there are numbers would print len(numbers) and then the numbers. So that's correct.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n2. **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the smallest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least $ m $, we use binary search. This helps us quickly narrow down the range of possible values for $ n $.\n3. **Range Determination**: Once we find the smallest $ n $ (let's call it `lower`) where the trailing zeros count is exactly $ m $, we then find the smallest $ n $ (let's call it `upper`) where the trailing zeros count is $ m+1 $. The valid values of $ n $ lie between `lower` and `upper - 1`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    lower = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(lower) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        upper = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        numbers = list(range(lower, upper))\n        print(len(numbers))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the target value. The upper bound for the binary search is set to $ 5 \\times \\text{target} $, which ensures that we cover all possible values of $ n $.\n3. **Main Function**: The main function reads the input value $ m $, determines the range of valid $ n $ values using the helper functions, and prints the results. If no valid $ n $ values are found, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the count of valid $ n $ values followed by the values themselves in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values of $ n $ using binary search, ensuring optimal performance even for large values of $ m $.",
