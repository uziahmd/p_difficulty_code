The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says that the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. But the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because each ring takes away two cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom). So for each ring, the dimensions decrease by 4 each time. Like, for the first ring, the rectangle is w × h, then for the second, it's (w-4) × (h-4), etc. Wait, but the ring itself is the border of that rectangle. So the number of cells in each ring would be the perimeter of that rectangle, but adjusted for the fact that when you take a border of a rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(width + height - 2). Because for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the perimeter (the border cells) would be 2*(m + n) - 4. Because each side has m or n cells, but the corners are counted twice. So subtracting 4. Alternatively, for a rectangle of width w and height h, the number of cells in the border is 2*w + 2*(h-2) = 2*(w + h) -4. Because the top and bottom rows have w cells each, and the left and right columns have (h-2) each (since the top and bottom are already counted).\n\nSo for each ring i, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that each subsequent ring is possible. For example, if the dimensions are too small, then the rings can't be formed. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. So the input ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions after subtracting 4*(i-1) from both w and h are at least 3? Or maybe not. Wait, the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense because for the first ring, the rectangle is 3x3, and the next would be 3-4= -1, which isn't possible. So the input ensures that for each i from 1 to k, the dimensions after subtracting 4*(i-1) are valid. So we don't have to check that.\n\nSo the plan is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)), then sum all these perimeters.\n\nWait, but how do we calculate the perimeter for each ring?\n\nLet me take the first example: input is 3 3 1. The rectangle is 3x3. The perimeter is 2*(3 + 3) -4 = 8, which matches the first sample output.\n\nAnother example: input 7 9 2. Let's compute for each ring:\n\nFirst ring: i=1, dimensions are 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 32-4=28. Then for i=2, the dimensions are 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. Wait, but the sample output for the third input (7 9 2) is 40. Adding 28 + 12 gives 40. Which matches. So that's correct.\n\nSo the formula for each ring is 2*(current_width + current_height) -4. So for each i from 1 to k, compute current_width = w - 4*(i-1), current_height = h - 4*(i-1). Then add 2*(current_width + current_height) -4 to the total.\n\nSo the steps for the code:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\nInitialize total =",
