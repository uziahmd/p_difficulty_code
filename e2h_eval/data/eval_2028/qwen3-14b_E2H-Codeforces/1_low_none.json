The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells.

Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. But the formal definition says the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so for each ring, the width and height decrease by 4*(i-1) over time. Wait, for example, the first ring (i=1) is the border of the original rectangle. The next ring (i=2) is the border of a rectangle that's 4*(2-1) = 4 units smaller in both dimensions. Wait, but how does that work? Let me think.\n\nFor example, if the original rectangle is w x h. The first ring is the perimeter of the entire rectangle. The number of cells in that perimeter would be 2*(w + h - 2). Because for a rectangle, the perimeter in cells is 2*(width + height) - 4 (since the corners are counted twice). Wait, no. Let me think again. For a rectangle of width w and height h, the number of cells in the perimeter (the outer ring) is 2*w + 2*(h-2). Because the top and bottom rows have w cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the corners already counted) have (h-2) each. So total is 2w + 2(h-2) = 2(w + h -2). Alternatively, 2*(w + h) -4. Which is the same as 2*(w + h - 2). So that's the formula for the perimeter.\n\nBut for each subsequent ring, the dimensions are reduced by 4*(i-1) in both width and height. Wait, for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). But the ring itself is the perimeter of that rectangle. So for each ring, we calculate the perimeter of that rectangle, and sum all those perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So for example, for the first ring, the rectangle is w x h. Then the second ring is (w-4) × (h-4), but wait, that's only if i=2. So for each ring, we take the perimeter of that rectangle. So the total number of cells is the sum of perimeters for each of these rectangles for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, what if the rectangle becomes too small? Like, if the dimensions are such that after some steps, the rectangle has zero area? But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's valid. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(n,m)+1)/4 ), which probably ensures that each ring is possible. So we don't have to worry about invalid cases.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle with dimensions (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)), then sum all those perimeters.\n\nWait, but let's check the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. So the rectangle is 3x3. The perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4 = 8. Which matches the output of 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1. The perimeter is 2*(7 +9 -2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. So first ring is 7x9, perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Second ring: i=2, so subtract 4*(2-1) =4 from each dimension. So new dimensions are 7-4=3 and 9-4=5. The perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output. So that seems correct.\n\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of gilded cells on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that it forms a border around an inner rectangle, and the dimensions of these inner rectangles decrease progressively as we move inward.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is formed by the perimeter of a rectangle. The first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle, the second ring is the perimeter of a smaller rectangle inside the first, and so on.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle is calculated using the formula: `2 * (width + height - 2)`. This formula accounts for the top and bottom rows and the left and right columns, excluding the corners which are counted twice.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each of the `k` rings, compute the perimeter of the respective inner rectangle and sum these values to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The dimensions of the plate (`w`, `h`) and the number of rings (`k`) are read from the input.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the dimensions of the inner rectangle by adjusting the width and height based on the current ring index.\n3. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each inner rectangle, compute its perimeter using the formula and accumulate the total number of gilded cells.\n4. **Output Result**: Print the total number of gilded cells after processing all rings.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and summing up their perimeters, ensuring correctness and efficiency within the given constraints.",
