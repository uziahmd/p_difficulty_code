She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. Let's think about how she can do this optimally.\n\nFirst, the initial setup: there are n tabs, and the mouse is at position pos. She needs to leave only tabs from l to r. So any tabs outside that range must be closed. The challenge is figuring out the fastest way to do that.\n\nLet me think about the operations. Each second, she can move left or right, or close tabs on one side. Closing tabs takes 1 second, but moving takes 1 second per step. So, for example, if she needs to close tabs to the left, she might need to move to the correct position first.\n\nLet me consider the possible scenarios. The required segment is [l, r]. So, the tabs to the left of l (if any) need to be closed, and tabs to the right of r (if any) need to be closed. But how?\n\nLet's think about the closing operations. To close tabs to the left of the current position, she can do that in one second. Similarly for closing to the right. But she needs to be positioned at the correct spot to perform those closes.\n\nFor example, to close all tabs to the left of the segment, she needs to be at position l. Because closing to the left of the current position would close everything from a (the current min) up to i-1. Wait, but when she closes tabs to the left, it's all tabs from a to i-1. So if she wants to close tabs that are left of l, then perhaps she needs to be at l, and then close all tabs to the left. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r, she needs to be at r, then close to the right.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's think about the steps:\n\nCase 1: The current position is already within [l, r]. Then, she can close left and right as needed. But how?\n\nFor example, if she needs to close tabs to the left of l. So, she needs to move to l, then close left. Similarly for the right.\n\nBut maybe she can do both steps. Let's take the first example input: 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The required segment is [2,4]. So she needs to close tabs 1 and 5,6.\n\nIn the example explanation, she moves to tab 2, closes left (which would close tab 1), then moves to 3, then to 4, then closes right (closing 5 and 6). Let's count the steps:\n\nMove from 3 to 2: 1 sec. Then close left: 1 sec. Then move from 2 to 3 (1 sec), then 3 to 4 (another sec). Then close right (1 sec). Total steps: 1+1+1+1+1 = 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. Let's think: What if she first moves to 4, then closes right? But then she has to close left. Let's see. Suppose she starts at 3. She could move right to 4 (1 sec). Then close right (tabs 5,6 are closed). Then she needs to close tabs left of 2. So she needs to move to 2 (from 4: two steps left?), but wait, after closing the right, the a and b would be adjusted. Let me think.\n\nWait, when you close tabs to the right, the current a and b are the min and max of the remaining tabs. So after closing the right, the maximum tab is now 4 (since r is 4). So if she's at 4, and closes right, then the a and b would be 1 to 4. Then, to close tabs to the left of 2, she needs to be at 2. So she could move from 4 to 2 (two steps), then close left. That would take 2 steps to move, then 1 step to close. So total steps for this path would be:\n\nMove from 3 to 4 (1 sec) → close right (1 sec) → move to 2 (2 steps) → close left (1 sec). Total is 1+1+2+1 = 5. Same as before.\n\nSo the order of closing left and right may not matter, but the movement steps depend on the current position.\n\nSo the problem reduces to figuring out the minimal steps required to:\n\n- Close all tabs left of l (if l > 1)\n- Close all tabs right of r (if r < n)\n\nBut how to do that optimally.\n\nLet me think about the steps required for each part.\n\nFirst, for closing the left part: the tabs to the left of l. To do this, she must be at position l, then close left. So the steps needed to reach l from the initial position, then 1 second to close.\n\nSimilarly for the right part: she must be at position r, then close right. Steps needed to reach r from current position, then 1 second.\n\nBut if she needs to do both, then she has to decide the order. For example, if she first moves to l, closes left, then moves to r (from l), then closes right. Or vice versa.\n\nBut what's the minimal steps?\n\nLet me think: the total steps would be:\n\nsteps_to_l + 1 (close left) + steps_from_l_to_r + 1 (close right).\n\nOr steps_to_r + 1 (close right) + steps_from_r_to_l + 1 (close left).\n\nBut which is better?\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. For example, if she can reach a position where she can close both in one go. But that's probably not possible unless l = r. So in general, she has to do two operations: close left and close right.\n\nBut wait, what if l is 1 and r is n? Then no closing is needed. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the problem is to calculate the steps needed to reach the positions to perform the closes, and then the closes themselves.\n\nBut also, maybe she can do some of the steps in a way that overlaps.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps is the sum of the steps needed to reach the positions for each close, plus 2 (for the two closes). However, if she can perform the closes in a way that the movement between the two positions is optimized.\n\nLet me think about the steps required for each scenario.\n\nLet me consider the case where l > 1 and r < n. So she needs to close both left and right.\n\nShe needs to perform two closes: left and right.\n\nThe question is: what's the minimal steps to reach the positions for these closes and perform them.\n\nLet me imagine that she can choose the order. For example, she can first close the left, then the right, or vice versa.\n\nLet me think of the steps for each option.\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then close right.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Move from pos to l: takes |pos - l| steps.\n\n- Close left: 1 sec.\n\n- Then move from l to r: takes |l - r| steps.\n\n- Close right: 1 sec.\n\nTotal: |pos - l| + 1 + |l - r| + 1 = |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2.\n\nOption 2: Close right first, then left.\n\nSteps:\n\n- Move from pos to r: |pos - r| steps.\n\n- Close right: 1 sec.\n\n- Then move from r to l: |r - l| steps.\n\n- Close left: 1 sec.\n\nTotal: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nWhich of these is better? Well, depends on which of |pos - l| + |l - r| or |pos - r| + |r - l| is smaller. Since |l - r| is same in both, the difference is between |pos - l| and |pos - r|. So, the minimal between the two options is the minimum of (|pos - l| + |l - r| + 2) and (|pos - r| + |r - l| + 2). Which is equivalent to adding 2 + |l - r| + min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|).\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Like, maybe she can reach a point where she can do both closes with less steps. For example, if she can reach a position that allows her to do both closes in one movement. But I don't think so. Because to close left, she has to be at l, and to close right, she has to be at r. So regardless of the order, she has to move from l to r or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps she can do some movement while doing the closes. But I think the steps are fixed.\n\nBut wait, what if she is already in the l or r position?\n\nAnother case: suppose l = r. Then, she needs to close tabs on both sides. But since l = r, the required segment is just one tab. So, she needs to close all tabs to the left and right. But in that case, she can be at l (same as r), and close left and right. But how?\n\nIf she is at l, then closing left would close all tabs to the left, and closing right would close all tabs to the right. So she can do that in two steps: move to l (if needed), then close left and close right. But how much time does that take?\n\nSo, for example, if she is already at l, then she can close left (1 sec) and then close right (1 sec). So total 2 steps. But the movement steps are zero.\n\nSo, in general, when l = r, the steps are:\n\nIf the current position is already l, then 2 seconds (close left and right). Otherwise, steps to reach l (|pos - l|) + 2.\n\nBut in this case, the steps for closing left and right would be 2 seconds.\n\nSo, putting this together, the overall approach seems to be:\n\nCheck if the current [l, r] is already the entire range. If l=1 and r=n, then no steps needed.\n\nElse, check if the current position is already within [l, r]. Then, the steps would be based on whether we need to close left and/or right.\n\nBut how to handle the cases where l is 1 (so no need to close left) or r is n (no need to close right).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Determine whether we need to close left (i.e., l > 1) and/or close right (r < n).\n\n- If no closing is needed (l=1 and r=n), then answer is 0.\n\n- Else:\n\n   - If only left needs to be closed (r = n), then steps are steps to reach l from pos, then 1 second to close left.\n\n   - If only right needs to be closed (l = 1), then steps are steps to reach r from pos, then 1 second to close right.\n\n   - Else (both left and right need to be closed):\n\n      - Compute the two options (close left first or right first) and take the minimal.\n\nBut wait, in the case where she needs to close both left and right, the minimal steps would be min( (steps to l) + (steps from l to r) + 2, (steps to r) + (steps from r to l) + 2 ). But steps from l to r is |l - r|. But since l <= r, it's r - l. So the steps from l to r is (r - l) steps. So the total for option 1 is (|pos - l|) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSimilarly for option 2: (|pos - r|) + (r - l) + 2. So the total is (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut perhaps there's another way. For example, if she can move directly to l or r, then do both closes. But how?\n\nWait, no. Because once you close left, then the a and b change. But in the problem statement, the a and b are the min and max of the unclosed tabs. So, for example, if you first close left (all tabs to the left of l), then the a becomes l. Then, when you close right, you have to be at r, and close right. So the steps are still the same.\n\nBut what if she can do something smarter. Like, for example, if she is at position pos, and l is to the left of pos, and r is to the right. Maybe she can move to l, close left, then move to r (which is to the right of l), and close right. Or maybe she can move to r first, close right, then move to l, and close left. Which is the same as the two options considered earlier.\n\nSo the minimal steps is min( (steps to l) + (r - l) + 2, (steps to r) + (r - l) + 2 ), which equals (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut wait, steps to l is |pos - l|, steps from l to r is (r - l). So the total for option 1 is |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2. Similarly for option 2: |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2. So the minimal between the two is (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut maybe there's another way. For example, what if she can reach a position that allows her to close both in one step? Probably not. Because to close left and right, you need to be at l and r respectively. So she has to do two operations.\n\nSo, for the case where both left and right need to be closed, the total steps is (r - l) + 2 + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| )\n\nBut let me test with the first example.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4. So l=2, r=4. So r - l = 2. min(|3-2|, |3-4|) is min(1, 1) = 1. So total steps is 2 + 2 + 1 = 5. Which matches the sample output. So that's correct.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is '6 3 1 3'. So l=1, r=3. So we need to close right (since r=3 < 6). So steps to reach r (3) is |3-3|=0. Then close right (1 sec). So total steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nThird sample: '5 2 1 5' → l=1, r=5. So no need to close anything. So answer is 0.\n\nSo, the algorithm seems to be:\n\nCompute:\n\nif l == 1 and r == n → 0.\n\nelse:\n\n   need_left = l > 1\n\n   need_right = r < n\n\n   if not need_left and not need_right → 0.\n\n   elif not need_left → steps to reach r, then 1.\n\n   elif not need_right → steps to reach l, then 1.\n\n   else:\n\n      steps = min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2\n\nBut wait, why is that? Because in the case of needing both, the steps are (steps to get to l or r) + (distance between l and r) + 2 (for the two closes).\n\nBut what if the pos is already in between l and r?\n\nFor example, if pos is between l and r. Then, the steps to reach l is |pos - l|, and steps to reach r is |pos - r|. So the minimal between them is added.\n\nBut what if pos is already at l? Then steps to reach l is 0, then steps from l to r is r - l. Then add 2.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nBut let's think of another example. Suppose n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4. So need to close left and right. So need_left is 2>1 → yes. need_right is 4 <5 → yes.\n\nSo steps is min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1 ) + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 =5. Which would be the same as the first sample.\n\nAnother example: pos is at l. So for example, pos=2, l=2, r=4. Then steps to reach l is 0. steps from l to r is 2. +2. total 0+2+2=4. So steps would be: close left (but l is 2, so closing left would close tabs from a (which is 1) to i-1 (i is 2). So closes tab 1. Then move to r (4) which is 2 steps. Then close right (1 sec). So total steps 1 (close left) + 2 (move) + 1 (close right) = 4. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows.\n\nFirst, read n, pos, l, r.\n\nThen check if l == 1 and r == n → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nneed_left = l > 1\n\nneed_right = r < n\n\nif not need_left and not need_right → 0.\n\nElse:\n\nif need_left and need_right:\n\n   steps = min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) ) + (r - l) + 2\n\nelif need_left:\n\n   steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif need_right:\n\n   steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nBut wait, in the case where need_left is true and need_right is false, then we have to close left. So steps to reach l, then close left. So steps is |pos - l| + 1. Similarly for need_right.\n\nBut wait, what if the pos is already at l? Then steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the pos is already at l and need to close left. For example, n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=5. So need to close left (since l=2>1). So steps is |2-2| + 1 = 1. Which is correct: close left (tabs 1) in 1 sec.\n\nBut what if the pos is already in the [l, r] range, but need to close left and/or right?\n\nYes, the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut what about when the pos is outside the [l, r] range?\n\nFor example, n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So need to close left (since l=2>1) and right (r=3 <5). So steps would be min( |1-2|=1, |1-3|=2 ) → 1. Then add (3-2) = 1. Then add 2. Total 1+1+2=4.\n\nLet's think. The steps would be:\n\nMove to l (2) from pos 1: 1 sec. Close left (tabs 1). Then move to r (3) from 2: 1 sec. Close right (tabs 4,5). So total steps: 1 +1 + 1 +1 = 4. Correct.\n\nAnother example: pos is 5, l=2, r=3. So steps would be min( |5-2|=3, |5-3|=2) → 2. Then add (3-2)=1. Then add 2. Total 2+1+2=5. How?\n\nMove to r (3) from 5: 2 steps. Close right (tabs 4,5). Then move to l (2) from 3: 1 step. Close left (tabs 1). So steps: 2 +1 +1 +1 = 5. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: l=1 and r <n. So need to close right. So steps is |pos - r| +1.\n\nFor example, n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=3. So need to close right. So steps is |3-3| +1 = 1. Which is correct. Because she is already at r=3, and can close right (tabs 4 and 5) in 1 sec.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=5. Then answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=2, n=5, pos=5. Then steps is |5-2| +1 = 3+1=4. Let's see:\n\nShe needs to close tabs to the right of r=2 (tabs 3,4,5). So she needs to be at r=2, then close right. So steps to move from 5 to 2: 3 steps. Then close right: 1. Total 4. Correct.\n\nAnother case: l=3, r=5, n=5. So need to close left (since l=3>1). So steps is |pos - l| +1. For example, pos=1: |1-3| +1 = 2 +1=3. Steps: move to 3 (2 steps), close left (tabs 1,2). So total 3 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother case: l=3, r=5, n=5. pos=4. So steps is |4-3| +1 = 1+1=2. Which is correct: move to 3 (1 step) and close left (tabs 1,2). But wait, the current position is 4. How to get to 3? That's one step left. Then close left. So steps is 1+1=2. Correct.\n\nNow, considering all that, the code can be written as:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    need_left = l > 1\n\n    need_right = r < n\n\n    if not need_left and not need_right:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    elif need_left and need_right:\n\n        # compute min between moving to l or r first\n\n        steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        print(steps)\n\n    elif need_left:\n\n        # need to close left only\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n        print(steps)\n\n    else: # need_right\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n        print(steps)\n\nWait, but what if the pos is already in the [l, r] range? For example, pos is at l, and need to close left. Then steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut let me test the sample input.\n\nSample 1: 6 3 2 4 → need_left and need_right. So steps = min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1 ) + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 =5. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3. need_left is 1>1? No. So need_left is false. need_right is 3 <6 → yes. So steps is abs(3 - 3) +1 → 0+1=1. Correct.\n\nSample 3: 5 2 1 5 → l=1 and r=5 → output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=4. So need_right is true (4 <5). steps is |2-4| +1 = 2 +1=3. Let's see: move to 4 (2 steps), close right (1 step). Total 3 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=4. Need to close right (r=4 <5). steps is |5-4| +1 =1+1=2. So move from 5 to 4 (1 step), close right (1 step). Correct.\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=3, pos=1. So need to close left (l=2>1) and right (r=3 <n (assuming n is 4, for example). So steps = min( |1-2|=1, |1-3|=2 ) → 1 + (3-2) + 2 = 1 +1 +2=4. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if n is 3, l=2, r=2. So need to close left and right. Because l=2>1, and r=2 <3. So steps = min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r-l) + 2. Since r-l is 0. So steps is min( |pos - 2|, |pos - 2| ) + 0 + 2 → |pos-2| + 2. For example, pos=1: 1 + 2 =3. Let's see: steps would be move to 2 (1 step), close left (tabs 1) (1 sec), then close right (tabs 3) (1 sec). So total 1+1+1=3. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input. Wait, the input is given as a list of multiple test cases? Or is it a single line?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers on one line. But the sample input shows three lines, but perhaps that's an example of multiple test cases. Wait, the user's input is given as:\n\nIn the sample input, the input is given as:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\" So perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects a single test case. Wait, the problem says \"the only line of input contains four integers...\", so perhaps the sample input is for three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one line of input.\n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is given as four integers. But the sample input shows three lines. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input formatting. For example, the sample input may be three separate test cases, and the code should read each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says: \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\". So perhaps the sample input is given as three separate test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the user's code is to read from stdin. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. So for example, the sample input is given as three lines, but each line represents a separate test case. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps that's a mistake in the problem's sample input.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single line with four integers. So the code should read one line, split into four integers, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple lines, but that's perhaps a mistake in the problem description. For example, the sample input shows three test cases, each with their own input and output. So the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple lines. But according to the problem statement, the input is a single line. However, the sample input shows three lines. Which is confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nThis suggests that there are three test cases, each given in a line. But the problem says that the input is \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\".\n\nThis is conflicting. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers...\n\nSo the code should read one line of input. However, the sample input shows three lines, which is likely a formatting error. Perhaps the sample input is written as multiple lines for readability, but in reality, the code should read one line per test case. But the problem says that the input is only one line. Therefore, the code should read one line of input.\n\nBut the sample input and output show three test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting to read multiple test cases. But the problem statement says \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\".\n\nThis is confusing. However, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the user intended that the code should process multiple test cases. For example, in the sample input, each line is a separate test case. So the code should read each line, process it, and output the answer for each line.\n\nBut the problem says \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\" which suggests that the code should process a single test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three lines, which is a contradiction.\n\nThis is a bit ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input and output, the first input line is '6 3 2 4' which produces output 5. The second input line is '6 3 1 3' which produces 1, etc. So the code is supposed to read multiple lines of input, each being a test case.\n\nBut the problem says \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\" which is conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement is wrong in the sample input. For example, the sample input may be three separate test cases, and the code is supposed to read multiple lines. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output show multiple lines, I think that the code should read multiple lines of input, each line being a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers...\". So this is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the original problem's note, the first example says:\n\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations...\n\nWhich implies that there are multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read multiple lines of input, each line containing four integers, and output the corresponding answers.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? For example, the code can read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single line. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows multiple lines, and the sample output shows multiple lines, I think that the code should process multiple test cases, each given in a separate line.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from stdin, split each into four integers, process each, and output the result for each.\n\nBut in the problem statement's input description, it says that the input is one line. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output show multiple lines, I think that the problem is expecting multiple test cases. Hence, the code should process each line as a test case.\n\nBut to resolve this ambiguity, perhaps looking at the original problem's source.\n\nBut since I can't do that, I'll proceed based on the sample input and output. So the code will read multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nSo the code will read all lines from stdin, for each line, split into n, pos, l, r, and compute the answer as per our logic.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as four integers. However, the sample shows three lines. Therefore, the code should process multiple lines.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can read all lines from input, for each line, split into four integers, and compute the answer.\n\nSo, the code will be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    n, pos, l, r = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # process\n\n    if l == 1 and r == n:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        need_left = l > 1\n\n        need_right = r < n\n\n        if not need_left and not need_right:\n\n            print(0)\n\n        elif need_left and need_right:\n\n            steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n\n            print(steps)\n\n        elif need_left:\n\n            steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n            print(steps)\n\n        else:\n\n            steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n            print(steps)\n\nBut let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 3 2 4 → output 5.\n\nProcessing:\n\nl=2, r=4. need_left (yes) and need_right (yes). steps = min(1, 1) + 2 + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 =5. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2: 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. need_left is false (l=1), need_right is true (3 <6). So steps = abs(3-3) +1 → 0 +1=1. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 5 2 1 5 → l=1, r=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=3, r=3. So l=3>1, r=3 <5. So need_left and need_right. steps = min( |2-3|=1, |2-3|=1 ) + (3-3) + 2 → 1 +0 +2 =3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut what about when l=1 and r <n. For example, n=5, l=1, r=3. So need_right. steps is |pos - r| +1.\n\nIf pos is 5, then steps is 5-3=2 steps to move to r, then 1 sec. Total 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=3, n=5, pos=1. So need_left and need_right. steps = min(1-2=1, 1-3=2) → 1. + (3-2) =1. +2 → 1+1+2=4. Which is correct.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead each line from stdin, process as above.\n\nThus, the code is as written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given position `pos` in her browser. The solution involves efficiently moving the cursor and closing tabs to minimize the time spent.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no actions are needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Determine Actions Needed**: Check if tabs to the left of `l` or to the right of `r` need to be closed.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Steps**:\n   - **Only Left Tabs Need Closing**: Move to `l` and close all tabs to the left.\n   - **Only Right Tabs Need Closing**: Move to `r` and close all tabs to the right.\n   - **Both Left and Right Tabs Need Closing**: Calculate the minimum steps required to either move to `l` first or `r` first, then close both sides accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        n, pos, l, r = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        if l == 1 and r == n:\n            print(0)\n        else:\n            need_left = l > 1\n            need_right = r < n\n            if not need_left and not need_right:\n                print(0)\n            elif need_left and need_right:\n                steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n                print(steps)\n            elif need_left:\n                steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n                print(steps)\n            else:\n                steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n                print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] covers all tabs, no actions are needed.\n- **Need Left and Right Closes**: Calculate the minimum steps required to move to either `l` or `r`, then account for the movement between these points and the closing operations.\n- **Single Close Needed**: Directly compute the steps required to move to the respective end of the segment and close the tabs.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal steps required by considering both possible paths (moving to `l` first or `r` first) and choosing the optimal one based on the initial position.
