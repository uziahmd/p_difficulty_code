Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two main things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All elements on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other elements must be the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all elements not on either diagonal are the same. Let's call this 'o_char'.\n3. Ensure that d_char is not equal to o_char.\n\nBut how to check these?\n\nFirst, let's think about how to iterate through the diagonals.\n\nFor the main diagonal, the positions are (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor the anti-diagonal, the positions are (i, n-1 -i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut since n is odd, the two diagonals intersect at the center cell. So that cell is part of both diagonals. But when checking, we need to make sure that all elements in both diagonals are the same. So for example, if the main diagonal has all 'x's and the anti-diagonal has all 'x's, then that's okay.\n\nBut how to collect all the characters in both diagonals and check they are all the same.\n\nWait, but for the main diagonal and anti-diagonal, all their elements must be the same. So first, collect all elements from both diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same. However, note that the center element is part of both diagonals, but that's okay because it's counted once.\n\nWait, but when collecting the elements, perhaps we need to collect all elements from both diagonals, but avoid duplicates? Or just check that all elements in the main diagonal are same as each other, and all elements in the anti-diagonal are same as each other, and that the main and anti-diagonal have the same character. Wait, but maybe the main diagonal is all 'a's, and the anti-diagonal is all 'a's. Then that's okay. But if the main is 'a' and anti is 'b', then that's invalid.\n\nSo first, check that all elements on the main diagonal are same. Then check that all elements on the anti-diagonal are same. Then check that the main and anti-diagonal have same character.\n\nBut wait, what if the main diagonal has all same elements, and the anti-diagonal also has all same elements, but they are different from each other? Then the condition is not met. So the first step is to check that both diagonals have same characters. So for example, the main diagonal's character must be same as the anti-diagonal's character.\n\nSo, for example, if the main diagonal has all 'x's, and the anti-diagonal has all 'x's, that's okay. But if the main is 'x's and anti is 'y's, then it's invalid.\n\nSo how to check that?\n\nLet me think. For the main diagonal, collect all elements. Check that they are all same. For the anti-diagonal, collect all elements. Check that they are all same. Then check that the main's character equals the anti's character.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more efficient way. For example, check that for every cell in the main diagonal, it's equal to the first cell of the main diagonal. Similarly for the anti-diagonal. Then check that the first cell of the main diagonal equals the first cell of the anti-diagonal.\n\nBut perhaps that's easier.\n\nSo, for the main diagonal, check all elements are same as the first element of the main diagonal. Similarly for the anti-diagonal. Then check that the first element of the main and anti-diagonal are same.\n\nBut then, perhaps the first element of the main and anti-diagonal are same. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the main diagonal starts at (0,0), and the anti-diagonal starts at (0,2). So for the first cell of the main diagonal, which is (0,0), and the first cell of the anti-diagonal, which is (0,2), they must be same. But if the entire main and anti-diagonals are same, then that's okay.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\nCheck that all elements on the main diagonal are same as the first element of the main diagonal (let's say d_char).\n\nCheck that all elements on the anti-diagonal are same as the first element of the anti-diagonal (let's say a_char).\n\nThen check that d_char == a_char.\n\nOnce that is done, then check all other cells (not on diagonals) are same as each other, and different from d_char.\n\nSo, for the non-diagonal cells, collect all of them and check that they are all same. Also, check that this value is different from d_char.\n\nBut how to collect the non-diagonal cells?\n\nFor each cell (i,j), check if it is on either of the diagonals. If not, then it's part of the non-diagonal group.\n\nBut how to check if (i,j) is on either diagonal.\n\nFor a cell (i,j):\n\nIt is on the main diagonal if i == j.\n\nIt is on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo, for each cell, if i == j or i + j == n-1, it's on a diagonal. Else, it's not.\n\nSo, for all cells not on the diagonals, collect their characters, check that they are all same, and that they are different from the diagonal's character.\n\nNow, how to implement this in code.\n\nLet me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of length n. Let's store this as a grid, perhaps a list of lists.\n\nThen:\n\nStep 1: Check the main diagonal.\n\nCheck that all elements in the main diagonal are same as the first element (grid[0][0]).\n\nSimilarly for the anti-diagonal.\n\nBut wait, the first element of the anti-diagonal is grid[0][n-1].\n\nBut for example, in the case of n=3, the anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the first element is (0,2). So, for the anti-diagonal, check that all elements are equal to grid[0][n-1].\n\nBut what if the anti-diagonal's first element is different from the main's first element? Then the check would fail.\n\nSo, for example, if main diagonal is all 'x's, and anti-diagonal is all 'x's, then that's okay. But if main is 'x's and anti is 'y's, then the check would fail.\n\nSo, first, check for the main diagonal:\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0], then invalid.\n\nThen check for anti-diagonal:\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   j = n-1 -i\n\n   if grid[i][j] != grid[0][n-1], then invalid.\n\nThen check if grid[0][0] == grid[0][n-1]. Because if the main and anti-diagonal's first elements are same, then all their elements are same (since they are checked to be same as their respective first elements). So, if the main and anti's first elements are same, then all elements on both diagonals are same.\n\nWait, no. Suppose the main diagonal's first element is 'x', and all others are 'x's. The anti-diagonal's first element is 'x', and all others are 'x's. Then yes, all elements on both diagonals are 'x's.\n\nBut if the main's first element is 'x', and the anti's first element is 'x', but some elements on the anti-diagonal are not 'x's, then the check would have failed.\n\nSo the code for the diagonals is:\n\nCheck that all elements on the main diagonal are same as grid[0][0].\n\nCheck that all elements on the anti-diagonal are same as grid[0][n-1].\n\nThen check that grid[0][0] == grid[0][n-1].\n\nIf any of these checks fail, return NO.\n\nOnce that is done, proceed to check the other cells.\n\nNow, for the other cells:\n\nWe need to collect all cells that are not on the diagonals. Then check that all of them are same, and that this value is different from the diagonal's value (which is grid[0][0]).\n\nBut how to collect these cells?\n\nWe can loop through all cells (i,j), check if i == j or i + j == n-1. If not, then collect the character.\n\nBut for n up to 300, this is O(n^2) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for large n, like 299, n^2 is about 89401, which is manageable.\n\nOnce we have all those characters, check that they are all same. Also, check that they are not same as the diagonal's character.\n\nBut what if there are zero non-diagonal cells? Well, since n is odd and >=3, for n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 9 - 3 (diagonals) = 6? Wait, for n=3, the main diagonal has 3 elements, the anti-diagonal also has 3 elements. But the intersection is one cell (the center). So total unique cells on diagonals is 3 + 3 -1 =5. So the non-diagonal cells are 9-5=4. For example, in 3x3 grid, the cells (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1) are not on the diagonals.\n\nSo for the non-diagonal cells, there are some cells, and they must all be same, and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, for the non-diagonal cells:\n\nIf there are none, then perhaps the problem is trivial. But for n=1, but n is >=3. So no problem.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCollect all the non-diagonal cells. Let's collect their characters into a list.\n\nIf the list is empty, then perhaps it's allowed? But for n=3, there are 4 cells. So no, for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nNow, check that all elements in this list are same. Let's say the first element is o_char. Then check that all elements are equal to o_char. Also check that o_char != d_char.\n\nBut what if the list is empty? Well, for n=3, it's not possible. For example, n=3, the diagonals have 5 cells. The total cells is 9. So non-diagonal cells are 4.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nOnce the diagonals are checked, proceed to check the non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut how to collect them.\n\nLet me think of code steps:\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nif the main and anti diagonals are all same as their respective first elements, and d_char equals the anti's first element (grid[0][n-1]).\n\nThen, for all cells (i,j):\n\nif (i == j) or (i + j == n-1): continue\n\nelse:\n\n   check if the cell's character is same as o_char.\n\nBut how to get o_char?\n\nWell, the first non-diagonal cell's character is o_char, but what if all non-diagonal cells are same? So, for example, take the first non-diagonal cell's character, then check all others against it.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but n is >=3. So no.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nCollect all non-diagonal characters into a list. Then check:\n\nif len(list) == 0: then it's okay? But for n >=3, that's not possible.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nif the list is empty, then we can skip checking. But that's not possible. So, proceed.\n\nBut for the case where the list is not empty, check that all elements are same. Also, check that this value is different from d_char.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check that all elements in non_diagonal_chars are same.\n\nBut how to check that? For example, take the first element, and check that all others are same as it.\n\nBut what if the list is empty? Well, for n=3, it's 4 elements. So for n >=3, the list is not empty.\n\nSo, if the list is empty, then perhaps the code is not needed. But in practice, for n >=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif len(non_diagonal_chars) == 0:\n\n   # impossible, but perhaps handle it?\n\nBut for our problem, it's not needed.\n\nSo, for the non_diagonal_chars list:\n\nif all elements are same as the first element, and that first element is not equal to d_char.\n\nBut what if the list is empty? Well, for n=3, it's not.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nif the non_diagonal_chars is empty, then proceed? But no.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nif all(c == non_diagonal_chars[0] for c in non_diagonal_chars) and non_diagonal_chars[0] != d_char:\n\n   then proceed.\n\nElse, return NO.\n\nBut what if the non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n=3, it's not. So, for example, n=3, the code will have non_diagonal_chars with 4 elements.\n\nBut what if n=1? Well, the input constraints say n is >=3 and odd. So no problem.\n\nSo, putting all together.\n\nNow, code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines. Each line is a string. So, for example, for the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo, grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nCheck the main diagonal (positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)):\n\nValues: x, x, x, x, x. So all same. So main diagonal is okay.\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,4) is x, (1,3) is x, (2,2) is x, (3,1) is x, (4,0) is x. All same. So the diagonals are same. Then check that the first element of main and anti are same. x and x, so okay.\n\nThen check the non-diagonal cells.\n\nFor example, cell (0,1) is o. Cell (0,2) is o. Cell (0,3) is o. Cell (1,0) is o. Cell (1,2) is o. Cell (1,4) is o. Cell (2,0) is s. Which is different from o. So the non-diagonal chars would include s. Hence, the non-diagonal chars are not all same. So the output is NO. Which matches the first sample.\n\nSo the code would correctly return NO.\n\nAnother sample: input 3:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck main diagonal: (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w. All same. Anti-diagonal: (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w. All same. So d_char is w. Then check non-diagonal cells.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,1): s\n\n(1,0): s\n\n(1,2): s\n\n(2,1): s\n\nSo all are s. And s != w. So output YES.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nGrid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0)=x, (1,1)=x, (2,2)=e. So here, the main diagonal elements are x, x, e. So the first check for main diagonal (all same as grid[0][0] = x) would fail. Because (2,2) is e != x. So the code returns NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code steps in Python.\n\nRead n from input. Then read n lines.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of strings, but in the problem statement, the input is given as first line n, then n lines.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is a list of strings, but that's probably for testing. In actual code, the input is read from stdin.\n\nBut in the problem, the user needs to read from standard input.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string. So:\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut then, for each row, we can access grid[i][j].\n\nNow, check the main diagonal.\n\nFirst, check that all elements on main diagonal are same as grid[0][0].\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nThen check the anti-diagonal:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    j = n - 1 - i\n\n    if grid[i][j] != grid[0][n-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nThen check if grid[0][0] == grid[0][n-1]. If not, print NO.\n\nIf all that is okay, then proceed.\n\nThen check the non-diagonal cells.\n\nCollect all non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut how to collect them.\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            continue\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check that all elements in non_diagonal_chars are same as the first element (if any). Also, check that this is different from d_char (grid[0][0]).\n\nBut what if non_diagonal_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, it's not possible. So proceed.\n\nif len(non_diagonal_chars) == 0:\n\n    # but for n >=3, this is not possible. So maybe no need to handle.\n\nBut in code, perhaps proceed.\n\nBut for example, n=3, the non_diagonal_chars has 4 elements.\n\nSo:\n\nif len(non_diagonal_chars) == 0:\n\n    # then all cells are on diagonals. But for n=3, that's not possible.\n\nBut perhaps for n=1, but n is >=3. So no.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nNow, check if all non_diagonal_chars are same as the first element.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal chars? Then, perhaps the code would crash. But for n >=3, there are non-diagonal chars.\n\nSo:\n\nif not non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    # but impossible, so perhaps proceed.\n\nBut let's assume that there are elements.\n\nSo:\n\no_char = non_diagonal_chars[0]\n\nfor c in non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    if c != o_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nThen check if o_char != grid[0][0].\n\nIf not, print NO.\n\nElse, print YES.\n\nSo putting all together.\n\nBut code in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if grid[i][i] != d_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nCheck anti-diagonal:\n\na_char = grid[0][n-1]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    j = n-1 -i\n\n    if grid[i][j] != a_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nCheck if d_char == a_char:\n\nif d_char != a_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    exit()\n\nNow, collect non-diagonal chars.\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            continue\n\n        non_diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif not non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    # but for n >=3, this is not possible. So proceed.\n\n    # but for example, n=3, non_diagonal_chars has 4 elements.\n\n    # So perhaps, proceed.\n\nelse:\n\n    o_char = non_diagonal_chars[0]\n\n    for c in non_diagonal_chars:\n\n        if c != o_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n            exit()\n\n    if o_char == d_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if non_diagonal_chars is empty? For example, n=1. But n is >=3, so no.\n\nBut code may have to handle it. However, since n is >=3, it's not possible.\n\nBut for example, n=3, the code will have non_diagonal_chars with 4 elements.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nTesting sample input 2:\n\nSample input 2 is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ngrid[0][0] is 'w', grid[0][2] is 'w'.\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\neach grid[i][i] is 'w' (row 0: 'w', row1: 'w', row2: 'w').\n\nanti-diagonal: for i=0, j=2: 'w'; i=1, j=1: 'w'; i=2, j=0: 'w'. All same as a_char 'w'.\n\nd_char and a_char are same.\n\nnon_diagonal_chars:\n\ncells (0,1) is 's', (0,2) is on diagonal. (0,1) is not on diagonal. So:\n\ncells (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). All are 's'.\n\no_char is 's' which is different from d_char 'w'. So output YES.\n\nSample input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ngrid[0][0] is 'x'.\n\nCheck main diagonal:\n\ni=0: grid[0][0] is x.\n\ni=1: grid[1][1] is x.\n\ni=2: grid[2][2] is e. Which is not equal to x. So code prints NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: the sample input 1, where the non-diagonal has 's' in (2,0). So during the non-diagonal check, the code would find that some elements are not same as o_char (which is 'o'?), but let's see:\n\nIn the first sample input, the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nThe non-diagonal cells are all cells except those on the diagonals.\n\nFor example, cell (2,0) is s. Which is not on the diagonals. So during the non-diagonal check, the code collects all these cells. The first non-diagonal cell is (0,1) which is 'o'. But cell (2,0) is 's' which is not 'o', so the code would detect that and print NO.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, the code uses exit(), but in practice, perhaps using sys.exit() and importing sys. However, in code submission, perhaps using return or breaking.\n\nBut in code, the code can use:\n\nimport sys\n\nBut in Python, for code submission, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut the code must read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines.\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut in code, for the main diagonal check:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if grid[i][i] != grid[0][0]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nBut in Python, exit() may not be allowed. So perhaps using sys.exit().\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nBut in code submission, it's allowed.\n\nBut in code, perhaps the code will be:\n\nBut the code must be written as a Python script.\n\nSo, the full code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check main diagonal\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if grid[i][i] != d_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\n# Check anti-diagonal\n\na_char = grid[0][n-1]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    j = n - 1 - i\n\n    if grid[i][j] != a_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\n# Check if d_char and a_char are same\n\nif d_char != a_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    exit()\n\n# Now check non-diagonal cells\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            continue\n\n        non_diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Check if non-diagonal chars are all same and different from d_char\n\nif not non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    # impossible, but for safety\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\n    exit()\n\no_char = non_diagonal_chars[0]\n\nfor c in non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    if c != o_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nif o_char == d_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, in Python, exit() may not be the best way. Because in some environments, exit() may not be allowed. Instead, perhaps using sys.exit().\n\nBut in the code, perhaps replace exit() with sys.exit().\n\nBut in the code, the code may have to import sys.\n\nSo, modifying code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\ngrid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check main diagonal\n\nd_char = grid[0][0]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if grid[i][i] != d_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        sys.exit()\n\n# Check anti-diagonal\n\na_char = grid[0][n-1]\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    j = n - 1 - i\n\n    if grid[i][j] != a_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        sys.exit()\n\n# Check if d_char and a_char are same\n\nif d_char != a_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    sys.exit()\n\n# Now check non-diagonal cells\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n            continue\n\n        non_diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Check if non-diagonal chars are all same and different from d_char\n\nif not non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    # impossible, but for safety\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\n    sys.exit()\n\no_char = non_diagonal_chars[0]\n\nfor c in non_diagonal_chars:\n\n    if c != o_char:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        sys.exit()\n\nif o_char == d_char:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    sys.exit()\n\nprint(\"YES\")\n\nBut what about when the non_diagonal_chars is empty? For example, n=1, but n is >=3. So no.\n\nBut in code, the code handles it by printing \"YES\". But that's not possible. However, for n=3, it's not possible. So this code is safe.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all cells are on diagonals. For example, the grid is:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nBut the non-diagonal cells would be (0,1) is a? Wait, no. For the grid:\n\nRow 0: a a a\n\nRow 1: a b a\n\nRow 2: a a a\n\nThen the diagonals are (0,0), (0,1) is on main diagonal? No. Wait, main diagonal is (i,i). So (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The anti-diagonal is (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So for (0,1), it's not on any diagonal. So in this case, non_diagonal_chars includes (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Which are a, a, a, a. So o_char is a, which is same as d_char a. So the code would print NO.\n\nWhich is correct, because the non-diagonal cells are same as the diagonal's character. Which violates the second condition.\n\nSo the code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonal are 'b'. Then code returns YES.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where all non-diagonal are same, but same as diagonal. Then code returns NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonal are 'a' → output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonal are 'b' → output YES.\n\nAnother case: diagonals are 'a', non-diagonal has some 'b' and some 'c' → code returns NO.\n\nSo code handles all these cases.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3, the non-diagonal cells are all same but different from the diagonal. So code returns YES.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all elements on both diagonals must be the same, and all other elements (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: Ensure all elements on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n2. **Check Consistency Between Diagonals**: Ensure the character on the main diagonal is the same as the character on the anti-diagonal.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: Ensure all elements not on the diagonals are the same and different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    grid = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n    \n    # Check main diagonal\n    d_char = grid[0][0]\n    for i in range(n):\n        if grid[i][i] != d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n    \n    # Check anti-diagonal\n    a_char = grid[0][n-1]\n    for i in range(n):\n        j = n - 1 - i\n        if grid[i][j] != a_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n    \n    # Check if main and anti diagonals have the same character\n    if d_char != a_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    # Collect non-diagonal characters\n    non_diagonal_chars = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                continue\n            non_diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n    \n    # Check non-diagonal characters\n    if not non_diagonal_chars:\n        print(\"YES\")\n        return\n    \n    o_char = non_diagonal_chars[0]\n    for c in non_diagonal_chars:\n        if c != o_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n    \n    if o_char == d_char:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    \n    print(\"YES\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. The first line gives the size of the grid `n`, followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n2. **Main Diagonal Check**: We iterate through each element of the main diagonal and check if all elements are the same as the first element of the main diagonal.\n3. **Anti-Diagonal Check**: Similarly, we check each element of the anti-diagonal against the first element of the anti-diagonal.\n4. **Consistency Check**: Ensure that the characters on both diagonals are the same.\n5. **Non-Diagonal Elements Check**: Collect all elements not on the diagonals and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\nThis approach ensures that all conditions for forming the letter 'X' are checked efficiently, adhering to the constraints provided.",
