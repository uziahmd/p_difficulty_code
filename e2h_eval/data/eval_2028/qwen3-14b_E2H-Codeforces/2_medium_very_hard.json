Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two main things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All elements on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other elements must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all elements not on either diagonal are the same. Let's call this 'o_char'.\n3. Ensure that d_char is not equal to o_char.\n\nBut how to check these?\n\nFirst, let's think about how to iterate through the diagonals.\n\nFor the main diagonal, the positions are (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor the anti-diagonal, the positions are (i, n-1 -i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut since n is odd, the two diagonals intersect at the center cell. So that cell is part of both diagonals. But when checking, we need to make sure that all elements in both diagonals are the same. So for example, if the main diagonal has all 'x's and the anti-diagonal has all 'x's, then that's okay.\n\nBut for the non-diagonal elements, they must all be the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, first, collect all the characters from both diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut how to collect the characters?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n- Read the grid as a list of lists, perhaps.\n\nThen:\n\n- For each cell (i,j), check if it is on either diagonal. If yes, check if it's equal to the diagonal character. If not, check if it's equal to the other character.\n\nBut how to find the diagonal characters?\n\nLet me think. First, the first diagonal's first element (0,0) is the starting point. All elements on the main diagonal must be equal to this. Similarly for the anti-diagonal. But also, the two diagonals must have the same character. Wait, the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letters. So all elements on both diagonals must be the same. So for example, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the anti-diagonal has 'x', then that's okay. But if the main has 'x' and the anti has 'y', then it's invalid.\n\nSo first, collect all the elements from both diagonals and check they are all the same.\n\nBut how to collect them? For each cell in the grid, check if it's on either diagonal. Then collect those elements. Then check all are same.\n\nOnce that is done, collect all elements not on either diagonal. Check they are same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Read the grid.\n\n2. Check that all elements on the diagonals are same. Let's call this d_char.\n\n3. Check that all elements not on the diagonals are same and different from d_char.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string. So grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j), check if it's on either diagonal.\n\nBut for checking, perhaps:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n -1 → it's on one of the diagonals.\n\nSo, for all cells in the grid, check whether they are on the diagonals.\n\nNow, for all cells on the diagonals, collect their characters. Then check that all are same.\n\nSimilarly for the other cells.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think. Let's first collect all the diagonal characters. Let's take the first diagonal character (grid[0][0]) and check that all other diagonal elements are equal to it.\n\nBut maybe there's a case where the first element is not part of the anti-diagonal. Wait, for n=3, the center cell (1,1) is part of both diagonals. So, for example, in the first step, the first element (0,0) is part of the main diagonal. The anti-diagonal starts at (0,2), then (1,1), then (2,0). So for the first cell (0,0), it's part of the main diagonal. So, the first diagonal character is grid[0][0], but the anti-diagonal starts with grid[0][n-1].\n\nSo, perhaps, the first step is to check that all elements on both diagonals are same as grid[0][0]. But wait, what if the anti-diagonal's first element is different from grid[0][0]?\n\nSo, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x's and the anti-diagonal is all 'x's, then it's okay. But if the main diagonal is 'x's and the anti is 'y's, then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the way to check is:\n\nTake the first element of the main diagonal (grid[0][0]) as the candidate for d_char. Then check that all elements on the main diagonal and anti-diagonal are equal to this.\n\nBut what if the anti-diagonal's first element (grid[0][n-1]) is different from grid[0][0]? Then that's invalid.\n\nSo, for example, in the first step, we can collect all elements from both diagonals and check that they are all the same.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1 → part of diagonals.\n\nSo, collect all these characters into a set. If the length of the set is 1, then all are same. Else, invalid.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the set would include all the elements from both diagonals. So if all elements are same, then the set has size 1. Otherwise, no.\n\nYes. So that's a way to check.\n\nBut then, once that is done, we need to check that all the other elements are same and different.\n\nSo, for the non-diagonal elements, collect all of them into a set. If the set has size 1, and that element is different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nCheck for diagonals:\n\ndiagonal_chars = {grid[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n) if i == j or i + j == n-1}\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1 → return NO.\n\nElse, d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n\nThen check the non-diagonal elements:\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = {grid[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n) if not (i == j or i + j == n-1)}\n\nif len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1 → NO.\n\nElse, o_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n\nif o_char == d_char → NO.\n\nElse → YES.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the non-diagonal elements are empty? Well, since n is at least 3. For example, n=3, the diagonals have 3 elements each, but overlapping in the center. So total elements on diagonals is 3 + 3 - 1 = 5. The total grid has 9 elements. So non-diagonal elements are 4. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal elements. So in general, for any n >=3, the non-diagonal elements are present.\n\nBut for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nSo, this approach seems correct.\n\nBut let's test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nNow, check diagonals. For each cell (i,j) where i==j or i+j=4 (since n=5, n-1=4).\n\nFor i=0, j=0 → x. Also, i=0, j=4 → x.\n\ni=1, j=1 → x. i=1, j=3 → x.\n\ni=2, j=2 → x. i=2, j=2 → same (since i + j = 4? 2+2=4? Yes, for n=5, n-1 is 4. So yes. So the center cell is part of both diagonals.\n\ni=3, j=1 → i + j = 4? 3+1=4 → yes. So j=1. And i=3, j=1 is part of anti-diagonal. Also, i=3, j=3 is part of main diagonal.\n\nSo, the diagonal elements are:\n\nLooking at all the cells on diagonals:\n\nRow 0: x (0,0), x (0,4)\n\nRow 1: x (1,1), x (1,3)\n\nRow 2: x (2,2) → and (2,2) is also part of anti-diagonal (since 2 + 2 = 4).\n\nRow 3: x (3,1) → i=3, j=1. Also, (3,3) is main diagonal.\n\nRow 4: x (4,0), x (4,4).\n\nBut looking at row 2, column 2: the cell is 'x'? In the sample input, the third line is 'soxoo' → row 2 is s o x o o. So (2,2) is x. So yes.\n\nSo the diagonal elements are all x. So the diagonal_chars is {'x'}, so len is 1. Then check non-diagonal elements.\n\nWhat are the non-diagonal elements? All elements not on the diagonals. Let's check some cells.\n\nFor example, row 0, column 1: o. Which is not on any diagonal. So in the non-diagonal set.\n\nBut looking at row 2, column 0: s. That's not on any diagonal. So that's part of non-diagonal. So in this case, the non-diagonal elements include 's', 'o', etc. So the non-diagonal set would have multiple characters. Hence, the first sample input returns NO. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo grid:\n\nrow 0: w s w\n\nrow 1: s w s\n\nrow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) → w, (0,2) → w. (1,1) → w. (2,0) → w, (2,2) → w. So all diagonals are 'w'. So diagonal_chars is {'w'}.\n\nNon-diagonal elements: cells not on diagonals. For 3x3 grid, the diagonals are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). The other cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Let's see their values:\n\nrow 0, column 1: s.\n\nrow 1, column 0: s.\n\nrow 1, column 2: s.\n\nrow 2, column 1: s.\n\nSo non-diagonal elements are all 's'. So the non-diagonal set is {'s'}, which is different from 'w'. So output is YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nrow 0: x p x\n\nrow 1: p x p\n\nrow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) = x, (0,2) = x. (1,1) = x. (2,0) = x. (2,2) = e. So the diagonals include x, x, x, x, e. So the diagonal_chars set is {x, e} → len is 2 → invalid. So output is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. So grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, collect the diagonal characters.\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n    # Now check non-diagonal\n\n    non_diagonal_chars = set()\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n\n                non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n    if len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        o_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n        if o_char == d_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal elements? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal elements. So the code is safe.\n\nBut let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals are 'b' → YES.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a' and non-diagonals are 'a' → NO.\n\nAnother case: diagonals have different letters. Like, for n=3, main diagonal is 'a', anti-diagonal is 'b' → then diagonal_chars is {a, b} → len 2 → output NO.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the non-diagonal elements are empty? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines. Then process.\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin. So in the code, the input is read via input() function.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is a list of strings. However, the actual input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n, then n lines follow.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is given as a list of strings. But in reality, when the code is run, the input comes from standard input, like:\n\nFor example, the first sample input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhich would be read as n=5, then 5 lines.\n\nSo the code should read n as the first input line, then read n lines.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut for the sample inputs given in the problem, the first input is a list like ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo...'] but that's probably for testing in some other context. But the actual code will read from stdin.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n, then read n lines.\n\nNow, implement the steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for the code, perhaps:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n    non_diagonal_chars = set()\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        for j in range(n):\n\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n\n                non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n    if len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        o_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n        if o_char == d_char:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what about when there are no non-diagonal elements? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut for n=3, the non-diagonal elements are 4 elements, so the code works.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 5, then the grid as described. The code checks the diagonals. The diagonals have x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait for n=5, the diagonals are:\n\nEach cell (i,j) where i==j or i + j =4.\n\nFor example, for i=0, j=0 (main), i=0, j=4 (anti). i=1, j=1 (main), i=1, j=3 (anti). i=2, j=2 (both). i=3, j=1 (anti), i=3, j=3 (main). i=4, j=0 (anti), i=4, j=4 (main).\n\nSo total of 5 + 5 -1 = 9 elements. Because the center cell is counted twice.\n\nSo in the first sample input, the diagonals have:\n\nLooking at row 0: x (0,0), x (0,4).\n\nRow 1: x (1,1), x (1,3).\n\nRow 2: x (2,2).\n\nRow 3: x (3,3), x (3,1).\n\nRow 4: x (4,4), x (4,0).\n\nWait, but in the sample input, row 2 is 'soxoo' → (2,0) is 's', (2,1) is 'o', (2,2) is 'x', (2,3) is 'o', (2,4) is 'o'.\n\nSo the cell (2,2) is x. So all the diagonal elements are x except for (2,0) and others not on diagonals.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars is {x}.\n\nBut the non-diagonal elements include, for example, (2,0) which is 's', and others. So the non-diagonal set would contain 's', 'o', etc. So the code would output NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the diagonals are (0,0) w, (0,2) w, (1,1) w, (2,0) w, (2,2) w. So diagonal_chars is {w}.\n\nNon-diagonal elements are (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s → set {s}, which is different from w. So output YES.\n\nThird sample input: 3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nDiagonals:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x; (2,2) e. So diagonal_chars is {x, e} → len is 2 → output NO.\n\nThus, the code works for samples.\n\nBut what about a case where the non-diagonal elements are all same but same as diagonal?\n\nLike, n=3, all cells are 'a'. Then diagonals are 'a', non-diagonal are 'a' → so code returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a' and non-diagonals are 'b' → returns YES.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, the code may have to read from stdin. So, the code is as written above.\n\nBut what about performance? For n up to 300, the code loops through 300*300 = 90,000 elements. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, the code uses two loops for checking diagonals and non-diagonals. But perhaps, for efficiency, we can collect the characters in one pass. However, for code clarity, it's better to do as written.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n, then read the grid.\n\nThen check the diagonals.\n\nBut perhaps, for the first part, the code could check if all the diagonal elements are same.\n\nBut the code as written is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, when collecting the diagonal characters, the code adds all the elements on the diagonals. Then, if the set has length 1, proceeds.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing for the case where the diagonals are same, but non-diagonals have multiple characters.\n\nLike, n=3, diagonals are all 'a', and non-diagonals are 'b' and 'c' → code returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are 'a', non-diagonals are 'b' → returns YES.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that the code must read from stdin, and output to stdout.\n\nThus, the code is as follows:\n\nRead n, then grid.\n\nThen proceed with the steps.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n    non_diagonal_chars = set()\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if not (i == j or i + j == n - 1):\n                non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n    if len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        o_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n        if o_char == d_char:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            print(\"YES\")\n\nThis should work.\n\nBut let's check for the case where n=3, and the grid is:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nSo diagonals are all a. The non-diagonal elements are (0,1) a, (1,0) b, (1,2) b, (2,1) a. So non-diagonal chars are {a, b} → len is 2 → output NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal elements are all same but same as diagonal: output NO.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
