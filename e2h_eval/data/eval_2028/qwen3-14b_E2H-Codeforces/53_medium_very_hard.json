    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and the output is the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nHmm. How do I check all possible substrings and their occurrences?\n\nAn initial idea is to generate all possible substrings for the given string, track their occurrences, and then find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nBut generating all substrings might be computationally intensive, but since the maximum length is 100, it's manageable. Let's think about the steps:\n\nFor each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's any substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer. Because we start from the largest possible, the first occurrence would be the maximum.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate possible lengths from min(len(s), max possible) down to 1.\n   For example, for a string of length N, the maximum possible L is N-1 (since you need two occurrences, but for N=5, like 'aaaaa', the substring of length 4 occurs twice: positions 0-3 and 1-4).\n   Wait, but for a string of length N, the maximum possible L where a substring can appear twice is floor(N/2). Or maybe not? For example, if the string is 'aaa', length 3. Then substring of length 2 appears twice (positions 0-1 and 1-2). So for N=3, maximum possible L is 2. Which is N-1.\n\nSo for each possible L starting from the maximum possible (which is len(s)-1) down to 1, check if there exists a substring of length L that occurs at least twice. Once found, return L.\n\nSo for each L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n   For all possible starting indices i in 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n      Take substring s[i:i+L]\n\n      Check if this substring appears again in the string (at least once more)\n\n      If yes, then return L as the answer.\n\nBut how to check if the substring appears again?\n\nWe can collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nFor each L, generate all substrings of length L, and store them in a dictionary with their counts. Then check if any count is >=2.\n\nBut for each L, this would take O(N) time (since there are O(N) substrings of length L), and for each substring, we can check if it's been seen before.\n\nAlternatively, for each L, we can collect all the substrings of length L, and check if there are duplicates.\n\nSo for example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So 'aba' occurs twice. So the answer is 3.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nLoop L from max possible down to 1:\n\n   For current L, collect all substrings of length L, and check if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\n   If yes, return L.\n\nIf no such L found, return 0.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read the input string. Then, for each possible L from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   Create a set or a dictionary to track the substrings we've seen.\n\n   For each i from 0 to len(s) - L:\n\n      substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n      if substr is already in the set, then return L as the answer.\n\n      else add it to the set.\n\n   Wait, but this approach would check for duplicates as we go. However, for example, if a substring appears multiple times, but the first occurrence is checked and added, and then another occurrence comes, then when we check if it's in the set, we can return immediately.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps for each L, we can collect all the substrings and check if any of them occurs more than once. But for that, perhaps using a set and checking if the size of the set is less than the number of substrings (since if there are duplicates, the set will have fewer elements). But that's not sufficient because even if there are duplicates, the set may have same elements. For example, if there are two same substrings, then the set will have one entry, and the count would be 2. But how to check for that?\n\nAlternatively, for each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and check if there's any duplicate. For example, using a set: for each substring, if adding it to the set returns False (i.e., it was already present), then we know that there's a duplicate. So in that case, we can return L.\n\nBut in code, for each L, we can loop through all possible substrings of length L, and for each, check if it's already in a set. If yes, then return L. Otherwise, add to the set.\n\nThis way, for each L, we can check if there's any duplicate substring. If so, return L.\n\nBut the problem is that for a substring that occurs multiple times, but the first occurrence is not the same as the second. For example, if the same substring appears three times, then the first time it's added to the set, then the second time, it's found in the set, and we return L.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nBut the problem is that for some L, there might be multiple substrings that are duplicates. But the first occurrence of a duplicate would trigger the return.\n\nSo for example, in the case of 'zzz', for L=2, the substrings are 'zz' (positions 0-1), 'zz' (positions 1-2). So during the iteration, when the second substring is checked, it's already in the set, so return 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm would work.\n\nNow, the code structure would be:\n\nRead the input string s.\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n   seen = set()\n\n   for i in range(0, n - L +1):\n\n      substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n      if substr in seen:\n\n          print(L)\n\n          exit\n\n      else:\n\n          seen.add(substr)\n\nSo, for each L, we check all substrings of that length. If any of them is found again, then return L.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the case where a substring appears more than once, but not in the first occurrence. For example, for L=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba' (i=0), 'bab' (i=1), 'aba' (i=2). So during the loop, when i=0, substr is 'aba', added to the set. Then i=1, 'bab' is added. Then i=2, substr is 'aba', which is in the set. So returns 3. Correct.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring appears more than once, but not consecutively. For example, 'abcab', L=2. Substrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'ca', 'ab'. So when i=0, 'ab' added. Then i=3, 'ab' is found in the set. So returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this approach would work.\n\nNow, what about the edge cases?\n\nCase 1: All characters are unique. Like 'abcd'. Then for L=3, the substrings are 'abc', 'bcd'. No duplicates. For L=2, 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' — no duplicates. For L=1, each character occurs once. So the answer is 0.\n\nWhich matches the first example input.\n\nAnother case: 'zzz'. For L=2, the substrings are 'zz', 'zz'. So returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaaa'. For L=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' (positions 0-3), 'aaaa' (positions 1-4). So returns 4.\n\nSo the code would return the correct answer.\n\nNow, the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait the input is given as a list of strings? Wait the example input shows:\n\nInput is ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and outputs ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, etc.\n\nBut in the example input, it's given as a list of strings. That's probably a mistake. Wait, perhaps the problem is presented as a list of test cases. But in the actual problem, the input is a single string. Or perhaps the problem is part of a programming competition where the input is a list of test cases. But the original problem description says:\n\nThe first input line contains the string. So for example, in the sample input, perhaps the input is three separate test cases, but the user is supposed to read one string per line?\n\nWait the original problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. So the input is a single string. But the sample input shows something else. Wait looking back:\n\nThe example input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] and outputs ['0', '3', '2']. That seems to suggest that the input is a list of strings, but perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Maybe the original problem is expecting multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single string. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\nSo, the input is a single string. But the example shows three inputs. That suggests that perhaps the example is not properly formatted. Maybe the example input is three separate test cases, but the code should process a single string per run.\n\nBut the user's task is to write a Python script that reads input from stdin and outputs the desired output. So perhaps the actual input is multiple lines, each being a separate test case. But the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the example is a list of inputs and outputs, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one string per input.\n\nBut the example shows that for input 'abcd', the output is 0; for 'ababa' it's 3, and for 'zzz' it's 2. So perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line. But the original problem's input description says that the first input line contains the string. Which is a bit conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the example is written in a way that the input is a list of strings, but the actual code is supposed to read a single string. But that's unclear. However, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the code must read the input from stdin. So, perhaps the input is a single line, which is the string. For example, for the sample input, perhaps the user inputs 'ababa' and the output is 3. But the sample input shows a list of three strings. So perhaps the problem's example is incorrect, but the actual code is supposed to process a single string.\n\nBut the problem's example shows that for the input ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], the output is ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nBut that would imply that the code is supposed to read multiple strings as input, perhaps each on a separate line. However, the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the example is not well written. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one string per test case.\n\nBut the user's code needs to read from stdin. So, perhaps the input is a single string, and the sample input is presented as a list for illustration. For example, the first input line is 'abcd', output is 0. Then, another input line is 'ababa', output is 3, etc.\n\nBut how to handle that? Well, the problem says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one string, process it, and output the result. However, the sample input shows three strings. So maybe the problem is that the user is supposed to process multiple test cases, each given in a line.\n\nBut the original problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not accurate, and the code should process a single string. But the sample output shows three outputs. That's confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the example, input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], output as ['0', '3', '2'].\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the example is wrong. But perhaps the problem is that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each on separate lines. For example, the code reads all lines from input, and for each line, outputs the answer.\n\nBut the problem's input says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written in a way that's not correct, and the actual code is supposed to read a single string.\n\nBut the user's code needs to read input from stdin. So perhaps the input is a single line, and the sample input is a list of test cases, but the code is supposed to process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is the first line. So maybe the code is supposed to read one line, and output one number.\n\nBut the sample input shows three different strings. So perhaps the sample input is not the actual input format, but the code should process one string. But the sample output shows three outputs. That's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read a list of strings, each on a separate line, and output the corresponding answers. For example, the input is three lines, each being a string, and the output is three numbers, each on a line.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the first input line contains the string. Which implies that there is only one string. But the sample input shows three strings. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is presented in a way that the input is a list of test cases, and the code is supposed to process them. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single string. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says: \"You're given a string...\" So the input is a single string. However, the sample input shows three strings. That's probably a mistake in the problem statement. Perhaps the sample input is for multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case per line. For example, the input is multiple lines, each line is a string, and the output is the corresponding answer for each line.\n\nBut the problem statement's input says that the first line contains the string. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list, but the actual code should read one string, and output one number.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows three strings and outputs three numbers, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single string. So I'm confused.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as a list for illustrative purposes, but the actual code should read one string. For example, the sample input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but the actual code is supposed to read one string per line, and output the answer for each line.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is the first line, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single string. But the sample output shows three outputs. So this is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the code should read a list of strings as input, and output a list of answers. But how?\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a string. So perhaps the sample input is written incorrectly, and the code should process one string, and output one number.\n\nBut how to proceed?\n\nWell, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input: ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nSample Output: ['0', '3', '2']\n\nSo for each of these strings, the code should output the respective numbers. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple lines, each line being a string, and output the answer for each line.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the problem's sample input is incorrect, and the actual code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem statement says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. So the code should read a single line, process it, and output the answer.\n\nBut in that case, the sample input is not matching. However, perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that's not correct. For example, maybe the sample input is three separate test cases, and the code is supposed to process them. But how to read them?\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin can be done via input() or sys.stdin. For example, if the code is supposed to read multiple lines, then for each line, process it.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the input is a single string. So perhaps the sample input is wrong, and the code is supposed to read a single string.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows three strings, perhaps the problem is intended to have multiple test cases, and the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut how to reconcile with the problem statement's input description?\n\nWell, perhaps the problem's input is a single string, and the sample input is written as a list of test cases. For example, the sample input is three separate test cases, and the code is supposed to process them. But the problem's input description is incorrect.\n\nBut given that the user's code is supposed to read from stdin, perhaps the code should read all lines from input, process each as a separate string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the problem's sample input shows three strings and outputs three numbers, which implies that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nIn that case, the code would read all lines from input, process each line as a string, and output the answer for each.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first line contains the string. Which suggests that there's only one string. However, given the sample input, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple lines, each being a test case.\n\nBut this is a bit ambiguous. However, given the sample input and output, I'll proceed under the assumption that the code should process multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, the code could read all lines from stdin, split them, and process each.\n\nBut perhaps the input is a single line. For example, the sample input is written as a list, but in reality, the input is one line, such as 'abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz' — but that's not possible. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not accurate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the input is a list of strings, but the code is supposed to process one string. But that's unclear.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the original problem's sample input is written in a way that's not correct. For example, the sample input is three separate test cases, and the code should read each line as a separate string.\n\nBut given that the problem says that the input is a single string, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single string. However, the sample input shows three strings, and the output three numbers. So perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to write code that can process multiple test cases, but the problem's description is incorrect.\n\nBut given that the user has to write a Python script that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout, perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the answer for each line.\n\nSo, for example, in the sample input, if the input is three lines, each being one of the strings, then the code would output three lines with the respective answers.\n\nIn that case, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    s = line.strip()\n\n    # process s and output the answer\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nBut let's proceed with that approach, given the sample input and output.\n\nSo, for each string in the input, compute the maximum length of a substring that appears at least twice.\n\nNow, back to the code for solving the problem.\n\nSo, for a given string s, the code should compute the maximum L as discussed.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead the input strings (each line is a string).\n\nFor each string:\n\n   n = len(s)\n\n   for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n       seen = set()\n\n       for i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\n           substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n           if substr in seen:\n\n               print(L)\n\n               break\n\n           else:\n\n               seen.add(substr)\n\n       else:\n\n           continue\n\n       break\n\n   else:\n\n       print(0)\n\nBut wait, the code for the loop.\n\nLet me think: for each L, we check all substrings of length L. If any of them appears twice, then return L. Else, proceed to check L-1.\n\nSo, for each L, the code loops through all possible substrings. For each substring, if it's already in the set, then return L. Otherwise, add to the set.\n\nBut in code, the for loop for i would be from 0 to (n - L) inclusive. Because for example, if the length is 3, and L is 2, then the substrings are 0-1, 1-2. So the number of substrings is (n - L + 1). So for i in range(0, n - L + 1).\n\nSo the code for the inner loop would be:\n\nfor i in range(0, n - L + 1):\n\nBut in Python, the range is exclusive of the upper bound. So the code would be:\n\nfor i in range(0, (n - L + 1)):\n\nSo, for example, if n - L + 1 is 3, then i ranges from 0, 1, 2.\n\nNow, in the code, for each L, we loop through all substrings, and check if any of them is in the set. Once found, print L and break out of the loops.\n\nBut in Python, the code would look like:\n\ndef max_substring_length(s):\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n        seen = set()\n\n        for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n            substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n            if substr in seen:\n\n                return L\n\n            seen.add(substr)\n\n    return 0\n\nBut wait, for example, for the string 'zzz', len is 3. For L=2, n-L+1 is 3-2+1=2. So i ranges from 0 and 1. The substrings are s[0:2] = 'zz', s[1:3] = 'zz'. When i=0, substr is added to the set. When i=1, substr is in the set, so returns 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: 'ababa', len is 5. For L=3, the substrings are:\n\ni=0: 'aba'\n\ni=1: 'bab'\n\ni=2: 'aba' → found in the set, returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this function returns the correct value.\n\nNow, the code for the entire problem would be:\n\nRead each line from input, process each string, and print the result.\n\nBut how to read input? For example, if the input is given as multiple lines, each being a string.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        found = False\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(L)\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        else:\n\n            print(0)\n\nBut wait, the code for the for loop. For example, after processing each L, if found is True, break out of the loop and print L. Else, after all Ls, print 0.\n\nBut in the code above, for each line in sys.stdin, process it.\n\nBut what if the input is empty lines? Well, the problem says that the string is non-empty, so perhaps the code can assume that each line is a non-empty string.\n\nTesting this code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nSample Output:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nLet's see:\n\nFor 'abcd' (len 4):\n\nCheck L=3:\n\nsubstrings are 'abc', 'bcd' → no duplicates.\n\nL=2: substrings 'ab', 'bc', 'cd' → no duplicates.\n\nL=1: substrings 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' → no duplicates. So returns 0.\n\nFor 'ababa' (len 5):\n\nCheck L=4: substrings are 'abab', 'baba'. No duplicates.\n\nL=3: 'aba', 'bab', 'aba' → the third substring is 'aba' which is in the set (added when i=0). So returns 3.\n\nFor 'zzz' (len 3):\n\nCheck L=2: substrings 'zz', 'zz' → returns 2.\n\nThus, the code would output 0, 3, 2 for the three lines.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code above, the for loop for L starts from n-1 down to 1. For example, for 'zzz' (n=3), L starts from 2, then 1. For L=2, the code returns 2.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring appears more than once, but not consecutively?\n\nLike 'abcab' (len 5). For L=2:\n\nsubstrings are 'ab', 'bc', 'ca', 'ab'. So during the loop, when i=0, 'ab' is added. Then i=3, substr is 'ab' which is in the set. So returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaaa' (len 5). For L=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' (positions 0-3), 'aaaa' (positions 1-4). So returns 4.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about the case where the same substring appears multiple times but not overlapping? For example, 'ababab' (len 6). For L=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba', 'bab'. So during the loop, when i=0, 'aba' is added. Then i=2, 'aba' is found in the set. So returns 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases correctly.\n\nNow, what about when the string is of length 1? For example, input 'a'. Then, len is 1. The loop for L is from 0 down to 1, but since the range is n-1=0, and the range is range(0, 0, -1) → which is empty. So the code proceeds to print 0. Which is correct, since there's no substring that appears twice.\n\nAnother case: string of length 2, e.g., 'aa'. Then, L starts from 1 (n-1 = 1). For L=1, the substrings are 'a' (i=0) and 'a' (i=1). When i=0, add to set. Then i=1, substr is 'a' which is in the set → returns 1. So output is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: 'aab', len 3. For L=2: substrings are 'aa', 'ab'. No duplicates. For L=1: substrings 'a', 'a', 'b'. So during L=1, the first 'a' is added. Then the second 'a' is found, returns 1. So output is 1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python. Also, note that in Python, the for loop for L in range(n-1, 0, -1) will start from n-1 down to 1. For example, if n is 3, then range(2, 0, -1) → 2, 1.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, handling the input.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as a single string. However, based on the sample input, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. Hence, the code reads all lines from stdin and processes each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut the problem says that the first input line contains the string. Which suggests that there is only one string. However, the sample input shows three strings. Therefore, perhaps the problem's sample input is incorrect, but the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code as written earlier would handle that.\n\nBut if the problem expects only one string, then the code should read one line and process it. For example:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nBut in the sample input, the code would output 0, 3, 2 for the three test cases. But if the code is supposed to read one line, then the sample input is not applicable. However, given that the user's code is to be written, and the sample input shows three cases, perhaps the code should process multiple lines.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the first input line contains the string. So, the code should read one line. However, the sample shows three test cases. This is conflicting.\n\nBut given that the sample shows three test cases, and the output is three numbers, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. Hence, the code reads all lines from stdin and processes each line as a separate test case.\n\nTherefore, the code is written as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        s = line.strip()\n\n        n = len(s)\n\n        found = False\n\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n\n            seen = set()\n\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n                if substr in seen:\n\n                    print(L)\n\n                    found = True\n\n                    break\n\n                seen.add(substr)\n\n            if found:\n\n                break\n\n        else:\n\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut in the sample input, for example, if the input is three lines, then the code would output three lines. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut in the problem statement's example input, the input is given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], which would correspond to three lines. So the code would process each line, and output the respective answers.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single string. However, the sample shows three strings, which implies that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nThus, the code is written as above.\n\nBut what if the input is a single line? For example, the code would process that line and output the answer. So this code handles both cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first input line contains the string. So perhaps the code should process only one line. However, the sample input suggests multiple lines. Therefore, this is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, the code should process multiple lines. Hence, the code is written as above.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input:\n\nFor the input lines:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nThe code would output:\n\n0\n\n3\n\n2\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaa' → len 3. For L=2, substrings are 'aa' and 'aa' → returns 2.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaa' → len 6. For L=3, substrings are 'aab', 'abb', 'bba', 'baa'. No duplicates. For L=2: substrings are 'aa', 'ab', 'bb', 'ba', 'aa'. When i=0, 'aa' added. Then i=4, 'aa' is found. So returns 2. But there's also longer substrings. For example, 'aa' occurs at positions 0-1, 4-5. But also, the substring 'aab' occurs once, but maybe there's a longer substring. Wait, what about L=3? Are there any duplicates?\n\nNo. But for L=2, the answer is 2. But perhaps there's a longer substring. For example, 'aabbaa' has 'aab' once, 'abb' once, 'bba' once, 'baa' once. No duplicates. So the maximum is 2.\n\nBut if the string is 'aabbaa', then the substring 'aa' occurs twice. But also, the substring 'aabbaa' has 'aabbaa' of length 6, but can't occur twice. So the code returns 2.\n\nAnother test case: 'ababab' → len 6. For L=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba', 'bab'. So when i=0, 'aba' added. i=2, 'aba' found. So returns 3. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code is written. Now, the problem says that the code must read input from stdin and output to stdout. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code uses sys.stdin, which reads all lines. But for cases where the input is provided as a single line, the code would process that line. For example, if the input is 'ababa', the code would process it and output 3.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The solution must efficiently handle overlapping substrings and work within the constraints of the input size.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read multiple lines of input, each representing a separate test case.\n2. **Substring Analysis**: For each string, iterate over possible substring lengths starting from the maximum possible down to 1.\n3. **Set Utilization**: For each length, use a set to track seen substrings. If a substring is encountered again, it means we have found a valid duplicate, and we can immediately return the current length.\n4. **Early Termination**: As soon as a valid duplicate substring is found for the current length, we terminate further checks for smaller lengths and return the result.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        s = line.strip()\n        n = len(s)\n        found = False\n        for L in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            seen = set()\n            for i in range(n - L + 1):\n                substr = s[i:i+L]\n                if substr in seen:\n                    print(L)\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                seen.add(substr)\n            if found:\n                break\n        else:\n            print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads all lines from standard input, stripping any extraneous whitespace.\n2. **Iterating Lengths**: For each string, we check possible substring lengths starting from the longest possible (length of the string minus one) down to 1.\n3. **Tracking Substrings**: Using a set, we keep track of substrings of the current length. If a substring is found in the set, it indicates a duplicate, and we print the current length.\n4. **Efficiency**: By checking from the longest possible length downwards and breaking early upon finding a valid duplicate, the solution ensures optimal performance even for the upper constraint of input size (100 characters).\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest valid substring with minimal redundant checks, leveraging the properties of sets for quick lookups and ensuring correctness through systematic iteration over possible substring lengths.",
