On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about finding the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray [l, r] in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. The goal is to choose the best possible interval to reverse so that when we do that, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) is as long as possible.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to think about how reversing a subarray affects the LNDS. Since the original array has only 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be calculated based on the arrangement of these numbers. But since we can reverse any subarray, how can we find the optimal reversal?\n\nLet me think about the original approach. The LNDS of the original array can be calculated, but perhaps there's a better way by reversing a certain part. For example, in the first sample input, reversing [2,3] turns [1,2,1,2] into [1,1,2,2], which is non-decreasing, giving a LNDS of 4.\n\nBut how to model all possible reversals efficiently? Considering that n can be up to 2000, trying all possible intervals [l, r] and for each, computing the LNDS would be O(n^3) time, which might be too slow. Because for each interval, reversing it and then computing the LNDS would take O(n) time (since the LNDS for a binary array can be computed in linear time?), but with n^2 intervals, that's O(n^3), which for n=2000 would be 8e9 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Let's think about what the LNDS can be after reversing a subarray.\n\nThe LNDS is the maximum length of a sequence where each element is >= the previous. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS can be determined by the number of 1s and 2s and how they are arranged.\n\nBut when you reverse a subarray, you're changing the order of elements in that subarray. How can this affect the LNDS?\n\nLet me consider that the optimal reversal would be one that connects regions of 1s and 2s in a way that allows more consecutive non-decreasing elements.\n\nAnother idea: the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal is either:\n\n- The original LNDS (if no reversal is done)\n- Or, the maximum possible by reversing some subarray that connects a group of 1s and 2s in a way that increases the LNDS.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, think about the structure of the array. Since the elements are only 1s and 2s, the LNDS is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of times a 2 comes before a 1. Wait, no. Because the LNDS is the maximum length of a non-decreasing sequence. For a binary array, the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s, the count of 2s, or the number of 1s followed by 2s. Wait, no. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 2 (the first two elements, or the last two, etc). But if you reverse the middle part, you get [1,1,2,2], which gives LNDS of 4.\n\nSo the key is to find a reversal that reduces the number of inversions (places where a 2 comes before a 1) in the entire array.\n\nBut how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, think about the original array. Let's say that the original LNDS is L. Reversing some subarray could allow merging some parts of the array that were previously broken.\n\nAnother approach: For each possible reversal, the new array will have the same elements, just with a segment reversed. The LNDS of the new array can be calculated based on the original array's structure, but how?\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider that the LNDS of the array after reversing [l, r] can be calculated by considering the original array's left part (before l), the reversed subarray [l, r], and the right part (after r). The maximum LNDS would be the sum of the maximum possible sequences that can be formed across these parts.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: the optimal reversal would be one that connects as many 1s and 2s as possible. For example, if there's a segment of 2s followed by 1s, reversing that segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s, which would contribute to a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\nSo perhaps the problem can be reduced to finding the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in a non-decreasing way, considering that we can reverse a segment to fix some transitions between 1s and 2s.\n\nLet me think about the original array. Suppose that the original array has some transitions from 2 to 1. Each such transition reduces the LNDS. For example, in the original array, if there's a 2 followed by a 1, that's a break. Reversing a subarray that includes this transition might eliminate that break.\n\nSo, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS after reversal is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of such transitions that can be eliminated by reversing a subarray. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, since the elements are only 1 and 2, the LNDS can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe maximum length is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. Or, more accurately, the LNDS is the maximum between:\n\n- The count of 1s (if all 1s come first, then all 2s)\n- The count of 2s (if all 2s come first, then all 1s)\n- Or, some combination where the 1s and 2s are arranged in non-decreasing order.\n\nBut for the original array, the LNDS can be found by counting the number of 1s and 2s and the transitions between them. However, when we reverse a subarray, we can change some transitions.\n\nLet me think of the original array as a sequence of runs. For example, if the array is 1 2 1 2, the runs are [1], [2], [1], [2]. Each run is a consecutive sequence of the same value. The LNDS for the original array is the sum of the lengths of the runs except for the ones where the runs are decreasing. Wait, no. The LNDS in this case is the maximum of the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that can be arranged in order. For example, if the array is 1 2 1 2, the LNDS is 2 (since the sequence can be 1,2,2 or 1,1,2, etc. Wait, no. Wait, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 1,2,2 (from positions 1,2,4) or 1,1,2 (positions 1,3,4) — length 3? But the sample input says that after reversing, the array becomes [1,1,2,2], which gives a LNDS of 4. So in the original array, the LNDS is 3.\n\nSo the original LNDS is not necessarily the same as the count of 1s or 2s. So perhaps the problem is more complex.\n\nAnother approach: For any possible reversal, the new array can be considered as the original array with the subarray [l..r] reversed. The LNDS of the new array is the maximum of the following possibilities:\n\n- The LNDS of the original array (if we don't reverse anything)\n- The LNDS after reversing some [l..r]\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nBut even if I can compute the LNDS for any given array quickly, trying all O(n^2) possibilities would be O(n^3) time, which is not feasible for n=2000.\n\nSo I need a way to compute the maximum possible LNDS after any reversal without checking every possible reversal.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSince the array consists of only 1s and 2s, the LNDS of any array is equal to the number of elements minus the number of inversions (where a 2 comes before a 1). Wait, no. Because the LNDS can be thought of as the maximum number of elements that can be arranged in non-decreasing order. For example, in the array [1,2,1,2], the LNDS is 3. How many inversions are there? There are two inversions: the 2 at position 2 and the 1 at position 3, and the 2 at position 4 and the 1 at position 3. Wait, maybe not. Inversions are pairs where a[i] > a[j] and i < j. So for [1,2,1,2], the inversions are (2,3) and (2,3)? No, let's list all pairs:\n\n(1,2): 1 <= 2 → ok.\n\n(1,3): 1 <= 1 → ok.\n\n(1,4): 1 <= 2 → ok.\n\n(2,3): 2 > 1 → inversion.\n\n(2,4): 2 <= 2 → ok.\n\n(3,4): 1 <= 2 → ok.\n\nSo only one inversion. But the LNDS is 3, which is 4-1 = 3. So maybe the LNDS is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of inversions. Wait, but that seems to fit here. Let's check another example.\n\nOriginal sample input after reversal: [1,1,2,2]. The number of inversions is zero, and the LNDS is 4. Which is 4-0 = 4. So that fits.\n\nAnother example: [1,2,1]. The inversions are (2,3). So number of inversions is 1. The LNDS is 2 (like 1,2 or 1,1). Which is 3-1=2. That fits.\n\nAnother example: [2,1,2]. Inversions: (1,2). LNDS is 2. 3-1=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: [2,2,1,1]. Inversions: (1,3), (1,4), (2,3), (2,4) → 4 inversions. LNDS is 2 (the two 2s or the two 1s). 4-4=0? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the LNDS here is 2 (the two 2s, or the two 1s). But according to the formula, total elements is 4, inversions is 4, 4-4=0. Which is not correct. So my previous idea is wrong.\n\nSo that approach is invalid.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the relationship between inversions and LNDS is not straightforward. So that approach is not helpful.\n\nAlternative Idea: For a binary array, the LNDS is the maximum between the count of 1s, the count of 2s, and the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that come after the last 1. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nIn a binary array, the LNDS is the maximum of:\n\n- The number of 1s (since we can take all 1s in order)\n- The number of 2s (since we can take all 2s in order)\n- The number of 1s followed by the number of 2s (since we can take all 1s first, then all 2s).\n\nSo the LNDS is max( count_1, count_2, count_1 + count_2_after_last_1 )\n\nWait, but in the array [2,2,1,1], the count_1 is 2, count_2 is 2. The count_1 + count_2_after_last_1 is 2 + 0 = 2. So the maximum is 2. Which matches the LNDS.\n\nIn the array [1,2,1,2], count_1 is 2, count_2 is 2. The count_1 + count_2_after_last_1 is 2 (the last 1 is at position 3, and after that there is a 2). So 2 +1=3. Which matches the LNDS of 3.\n\nIn the sample input after reversal, [1,1,2,2], the count_1 is 2, count_2 is 2. count_1 + count_2_after_last_1 is 2+2=4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the LNDS for a binary array can be computed as the maximum between count_1, count_2, and the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that appear after the last occurrence of 1. Alternatively, it's the maximum between the count of 1s and 2s, and the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1.\n\nBut how does reversing a subarray affect this?\n\nSuppose that we can find a reversal that allows more 1s to be followed by 2s. For example, if there's a segment that has some 2s followed by some 1s, reversing that segment would make those 1s come before the 2s, thus increasing the count of 1s plus 2s after the last 1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of (number of 1s) + (number of 2s that come after the last 1) after some reversal.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum LNDS is the maximum between:\n\n- Original max_LNDS (without any reversal)\n- For each possible reversal, the new max_LNDS.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible value of (number of 1s + number of 2s after the last 1) after some reversal. Because that's one of the terms that determines the LNDS.\n\nLet me denote this term as S. Then, the maximum LNDS is the maximum between count_1, count_2, and S.\n\nSo to maximize the LNDS, we need to maximize S.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find the maximum S after reversing any subarray.\n\nNow, the question is: how can reversing a subarray affect S?\n\nLet's think about S. It's the number of 1s in the entire array plus the number of 2s that occur after the last occurrence of 1 in the array.\n\nSo, if we can arrange the array such that all 1s come before all 2s, then S would be count_1 + count_2 = n, which is the maximum possible. However, this may not be possible unless the original array can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence by reversing a single subarray.\n\nBut in general, how can reversing a subarray help us maximize S?\n\nLet me think of the original array. Suppose there are some 2s followed by some 1s. Reversing that segment would turn those 1s into being before the 2s, thereby contributing to S.\n\nSo, the idea is to find a segment that contains some 2s followed by some 1s. Reversing that segment would turn the 2s and 1s into 1s followed by 2s. This would increase the number of 2s that come after the last 1.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the array as consisting of some blocks. For example, the original array may have several transitions between 1 and 2. Each such transition from 2 to 1 is a point where reversing a segment can help.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nLet’s precompute for the original array:\n\n- The number of 1s before the first occurrence of 2 (call this pre_1).\n- The number of 2s after the last occurrence of 1 (call this post_2).\n- The total number of 1s (cnt1) and 2s (cnt2).\n\nThen, the original S is cnt1 + post_2.\n\nIf there is a segment that contains some 2s followed by some 1s, then reversing that segment would add those 1s to the pre_1 and those 2s to the post_2. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that in the original array, there's a segment that starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s. Let's say that this segment has x 2s and y 1s. When reversed, this segment becomes y 1s followed by x 2s. This could potentially connect with the existing pre_1 and post_2.\n\nFor example, if before this segment, there are some 1s, and after this segment, there are some 2s. Reversing the segment would create a block of 1s (from the original 1s in the segment and the pre-segment 1s) followed by 2s (from the original 2s in the segment and the post-segment 2s). Thus, the total S would be (pre_1 + y) + (post_2 + x).\n\nBut how to find the maximum possible value of (pre_1 + y) + (post_2 + x) over all possible segments that contain a transition from 2 to 1?\n\nBut how to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the maximum possible contribution from such a segment.\n\nLet me define:\n\nFor each possible segment [l, r], which when reversed turns a 2s followed by 1s into 1s followed by 2s. The contribution to S would be the number of 1s in the segment (y) added to the pre-segment 1s, and the number of 2s in the segment (x) added to the post-segment 2s.\n\nBut how to find the maximum (pre_1 + y) + (post_2 + x) ?\n\nThis seems promising. Let's formalize this.\n\nSuppose that in the original array, there is a segment [l, r] that starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s. When reversed, this segment becomes a block of 1s followed by 2s. Let's assume that the segment contains m 2s and k 1s, and that before the segment, there are a 1s, and after the segment, there are b 2s. Then, after reversing, the total number of 1s before the post-segment 2s is a + k, and the number of 2s after the last 1 is b + m. So the new S would be (a + k) + (b + m) = (a + b) + (k + m) = (original a + b) + (total elements in the segment). But wait, original a is the number of 1s before the segment, and original b is the number of 2s after the segment. The total elements in the segment is (m + k). So the new S would be (a + b) + (m + k) ?\n\nWait, but original S was (pre_1_total) + (post_2_total). But if this segment is in between, then the original pre_1_total would be a, and post_2_total would be b. So the original contribution from this segment would be (a + ... something?), but perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire array. After reversing the segment [l, r], the total S (number of 1s plus number of 2s after the last 1) depends on the positions of the last 1 and the 2s after it.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think of the entire array. Let's imagine that after reversing the segment [l, r], the last occurrence of 1 is somewhere. All 2s after that are counted towards S.\n\nSo, the maximum S after reversal is the number of 1s in the entire array plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the array.\n\nThus, to maximize S, we need to find a reversal that allows as many 2s as possible to be after the last 1.\n\nSo, for example, if we can move all 2s that are before some 1s to be after those 1s, that would increase S.\n\nBut how to find the optimal reversal.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can precompute for each position, the number of 1s up to that position (prefix_ones), and the number of 2s from that position onwards (suffix_twos). Then, for any segment [l, r], if reversing it can contribute to moving some 2s to after the last 1, then the new S would be (total_ones) + (some value).\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think of the following scenario. Suppose that in the original array, there are some 2s followed by some 1s. If we reverse this segment, the 1s come before the 2s, which may contribute to having more 2s after the last 1.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the original array. The maximum possible S is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. So, if we can find a reversal that moves some 2s that are before some 1s to after them, then this would increase S.\n\nLet me consider that the optimal reversal is one that takes a segment that contains some 2s followed by some 1s. Reversing this segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s, which may allow these 1s to be part of the overall 1s, and the 2s to be part of the 2s after the last 1.\n\nSo, for example, suppose that before the segment, there are some 1s, and after the segment, there are some 2s. Reversing the segment would add the 1s in the segment to the pre-segment 1s, and the 2s in the segment to the post-segment 2s.\n\nSo, the total S would be (pre_ones + ones_in_segment) + (post_twos + twos_in_segment) = pre_ones + post_twos + (ones_in_segment + twos_in_segment) = pre_ones + post_twos + (length of segment). But pre_ones + post_twos is the original S minus the contribution from the segment? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the original array has some 2s followed by some 1s. Let's say that the segment [l, r] is the minimal segment containing this transition. When reversed, the segment becomes 1s followed by 2s. Now, the last occurrence of 1 in the entire array may be extended by the 1s in this segment, and the 2s after the segment may be increased by the 2s in this segment.\n\nBut how to find the maximum value of (number of 1s in the array) + (number of 2s after the last 1 in the array).\n\nLet me think of the entire array. Let's imagine that after reversing a segment, the last occurrence of 1 is at position x. All 2s after x contribute to S. So the S is (total_ones) + (number of 2s after x).\n\nTo maximize S, we want to maximize the number of 2s after x. So x should be as far to the left as possible, allowing as many 2s as possible after it.\n\nSo, if we can find a reversal that allows the last 1 to be as early as possible, while having as many 2s after it as possible.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe maximum possible S is total_ones + total_twos = n, which is achieved when all 1s come before all 2s. So the question is, can we find a reversal that makes the array non-decreasing? If yes, then the answer is n.\n\nOtherwise, find the best possible way to increase S by reversing a segment.\n\nBut how to check if such a reversal exists.\n\nFor example, the array [1,2,1,2] can be made non-decreasing by reversing [2,3], which gives [1,1,2,2].\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if there exists a segment that can be reversed to make the array non-decreasing. If yes, then the answer is n. Otherwise, we need to find the maximum S.\n\nBut how to check that.\n\nAlternatively, for the general case, the maximum S can be calculated as follows:\n\nLet’s compute for all possible segments [l, r] that when reversed, the new array's S is maximized. How?\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nFor each position i, let's compute:\n\n- prefix_ones[i]: the number of 1s in the original array up to index i (exclusive or inclusive? Need to define.)\n\nSimilarly, suffix_twos[i]: the number of 2s from index i onwards.\n\nBut perhaps the following approach:\n\nThe maximum S after reversing a segment [l, r] can be found by considering all possible segments where the original segment starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s. When reversed, this segment becomes 1s followed by 2s. This can potentially merge with the 1s before the segment and the 2s after the segment.\n\nLet me think of the following scenario:\n\nThe original array has:\n\n... [some 1s] ... [segment with some 2s followed by some 1s] ... [some 2s] ...\n\nAfter reversing the segment, it becomes:\n\n... [some 1s] ... [some 1s from segment] [some 2s from segment] ... [some 2s] ...\n\nThe last occurrence of 1 is now at the end of the segment's 1s. All 2s after that are the 2s from the segment and the 2s after the segment. So the total number of 2s after the last 1 is (number of 2s in the segment) + (number of 2s after the segment).\n\nThe number of 1s is the total_ones (since the segment is just rearranged). Therefore, S = total_ones + (number of 2s in the segment) + (number of 2s after the segment).\n\nBut the number of 2s after the segment in the original array is suffix_twos[r+1].\n\nSimilarly, the number of 2s in the segment is the number of 2s in [l..r].\n\nSo the contribution would be:\n\ntotal_ones + (twos_in_segment + suffix_twos[r+1]).\n\nBut also, the 1s before the segment (prefix_ones[l]) and the 1s in the segment (ones_in_segment) contribute to the last 1's position.\n\nWait, but the segment is reversed, so the 1s in the segment are now at the beginning of the segment. The 1s before the segment are before the segment. So the last occurrence of 1 in the entire array is at the end of the reversed segment's 1s. So the 2s after that are the 2s in the reversed segment (which were originally the 2s in the segment, but now they are after the 1s in the segment) plus the 2s after the original segment.\n\nSo the total 2s after the last 1 is (number of 2s in the segment) + suffix_twos[r+1].\n\nThus, the S for this scenario is total_ones + (number of 2s in the segment) + suffix_twos[r+1].\n\nBut also, there might be 1s after the segment. For example, if the segment is in the middle of the array and there are 1s after it. Wait, no. Because the segment is reversed to have 1s followed by 2s. So after the segment, the original elements are after r. But if there are 1s after r, then the last 1 in the array would be after the reversed segment. So in that case, the S would be total_ones plus the number of 2s after the last 1 (which may include some 2s from the reversed segment and the original elements after r, but also possibly 2s from other parts).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Perhaps I need to consider all possible scenarios where reversing a segment can increase the number of 2s after the last 1.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe maximum S after any reversal is equal to the maximum between the original S and (for each possible segment [l, r], the value of (number of 1s in the array) + (number of 2s in the segment) + (number of 2s after r)) + (number of 1s before l) ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following:\n\nWhen you reverse a segment [l, r], the new array's S is equal to:\n\n(number of 1s in the entire array) + (number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the new array).\n\nTo compute this, we need to find the last occurrence of 1 in the new array and count how many 2s are after it.\n\nBut how to find this efficiently for all possible segments.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe last occurrence of 1 in the new array can be either:\n\n- The same as in the original array, if the reversed segment doesn't contain any 1s.\n- Or, the last 1 in the reversed segment.\n- Or, the last 1 in the original array, if the reversed segment doesn't add any new 1s after it.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nPerhaps we can precompute for each possible segment [l, r], the following:\n\n- The number of 1s before l (call it left_ones).\n- The number of 1s in the segment (call it seg_ones).\n- The number of 2s in the segment (seg_twos).\n- The number of 2s after r (call it right_twos).\n\nThen, after reversing the segment, the last occurrence of 1 in the new array is the maximum between the original last occurrence of 1 (if it is not in the segment) and the last 1 in the reversed segment (which is the original first 1 in the segment, since the segment is reversed).\n\nWait, no. When you reverse the segment, the original first element of the segment becomes the last element of the segment. So the reversed segment has the original elements in reverse order. So if the original segment had some 1s and 2s, after reversing, the 1s that were at the end of the original segment become the start of the reversed segment, and the 2s that were at the start of the original segment become the end of the reversed segment.\n\nSo, the last occurrence of 1 in the new array is the maximum between:\n\n- The original last occurrence of 1 (but only if it is not in the segment, or if it is in the segment and after reversal, the last 1 in the segment is later than the original last occurrence).\n- The position of the last 1 in the reversed segment.\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible segments.\n\nAlternatively, for a given segment [l, r], after reversing, the new segment has the elements reversed. So the last 1 in the segment after reversal is the first occurrence of 1 in the original segment. Because the reversed segment is the original [r, r-1, ..., l]. So the first occurrence of 1 in the original segment is now at the end of the reversed segment. So if the original segment contains any 1s, the last occurrence of 1 in the new segment is the first occurrence of 1 in the original segment.\n\nWait, no. Let's say the original segment is [2, 1]. After reversing, it's [1, 2]. The last occurrence of 1 in this segment is at position 0 (original l). The first occurrence of 1 in the original segment is at position r (original r is 1, which is the second element). So the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed segment is at position 0 (original l), which corresponds to the first occurrence of 1 in the original segment.\n\nSo the last occurrence of 1 in the reversed segment is the first occurrence of 1 in the original segment.\n\nBut this is only if the original segment contains at least one 1. If the original segment has no 1s, then after reversing, the segment still has no 1s.\n\nSo for the entire array, the last occurrence of 1 after reversing [l, r] is the maximum between:\n\n- The original last occurrence of 1 that is not in the segment.\n- The position of the first occurrence of 1 in the original segment (if any), because after reversing, this 1 is at the end of the segment.\n- The original last occurrence of 1 that is within the segment, which after reversal may have moved.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the entire array after reversing [l, r]. The last 1 in the array can be:\n\nCase 1: The original last 1 is not in the segment. Then, after reversal, the last 1 remains the same as before.\n\nCase 2: The original last 1 is inside the segment. After reversal, the last 1 in the segment is the first occurrence of 1 in the original segment. So, the new last 1 in the array is the maximum between this first occurrence and the original last 1 outside the segment.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nLet me think of the maximum possible value of S as follows:\n\nS = total_ones + max_twos_after_last_one.\n\nWhere max_twos_after_last_one is the maximum number of 2s that can be after the last 1 in the array after some reversal.\n\nTo compute this, I need to find the maximum value of max_twos_after_last_one.\n\nHow can I find this maximum value?\n\nLet me consider that the last 1 in the array after reversal can be anywhere. For each possible position i (where a[i] is 1), I want to know how many 2s are after i in the new array.\n\nBut how to find this.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nThe optimal reversal is one that allows as many 2s as possible to be after the last 1. So, ideally, we want to move all 2s that are before some 1s to be after those 1s.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nFor each occurrence of a 2 followed by a 1, we can try to reverse the segment that contains this 2 and 1. But how to find the best such segment.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following variables:\n\nLet’s precompute for each position i, the number of 2s before i that are followed by a 1. Or something like that.\n\nBut perhaps I can precompute for all possible positions where a 2 is followed by a 1, and for each such pair, calculate how much reversing a segment containing them can contribute.\n\nBut this might not cover all possibilities.\n\nLet me try to think of the maximum possible value of max_twos_after_last_one.\n\nSuppose that the original array has some 2s before some 1s. Let's find the maximum number of 2s that can be moved to after the last 1 by reversing a segment.\n\nLet me imagine that I have a segment that starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s. Let's say that this segment has x 2s and y 1s. When reversed, this segment becomes y 1s followed by x 2s. This will contribute y 1s and x 2s. Now, if there are some 1s before this segment and some 2s after this segment, then the total number of 2s after the last 1 is the x 2s from the segment plus the 2s after the segment.\n\nSo, the contribution to max_twos_after_last_one is x + (number of 2s after the segment).\n\nAdditionally, the number of 1s before the segment is added to the y 1s in the segment, making the last 1 in the array to be at the end of the segment.\n\nSo, the total max_twos_after_last_one is x + (number of 2s after the segment).\n\nBut how to find the maximum x + (number of 2s after the segment) for all segments that have 2s followed by 1s.\n\nLet me define for each possible segment [l, r], if the segment starts with 2s and ends with 1s, then compute x (number of 2s in the segment) + suffix_twos[r+1]. The maximum of these values, plus the total_ones, would give a candidate for the maximum S.\n\nBut how to find all such segments.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i where a[i] = 2 and a[i+1] = 1, we can consider expanding the segment to include as many 2s as possible before i and as many 1s as possible after i+1. But this might not capture all cases.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible l and r where the segment [l, r] has some 2s followed by some 1s, we can compute x + suffix_twos[r+1].\n\nBut how to efficiently find all such segments.\n\nAnother Idea:\n\nLet's precompute for each position, the number of 2s from the start up to that position, and the number of 1s from that position to the end.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute for all positions the cumulative number of 2s and 1s.\n\nLet me define:\n\nprefix_2[i] = number of 2s in the first i",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can help merge segments of 1s and 2s to form a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding LNDS for Binary Sequences**: For sequences containing only 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be maximized by ensuring all 1s come before all 2s. This means we need to find the optimal subarray reversal that helps achieve this configuration.\n\n2. **Precompute Values**: We precompute the number of 1s and 2s up to each position in the array. This helps in quickly determining how many 1s are before a segment and how many 2s are after a segment.\n\n3. **Evaluate All Possible Reversals**: For each possible subarray reversal, we consider how it affects the count of 1s and 2s. Specifically, we look for segments where reversing them can merge 2s followed by 1s into 1s followed by 2s, thereby increasing the potential LNDS.\n\n4. **Calculate Maximum LNDS**: By considering all possible valid reversals, we determine the maximum possible LNDS length by evaluating the contribution of each potential reversal to the overall count of 1s and 2s in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Precompute prefix_ones and suffix_twos\n    prefix_ones = [0] * (n + 1)\n    suffix_twos = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        prefix_ones[i+1] = prefix_ones[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n    \n    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n        suffix_twos[i] = suffix_twos[i+1] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    total_ones = prefix_ones[n]\n    total_twos = n - total_ones\n    \n    max_lnds = total_ones\n    if total_twos > max_lnds:\n        max_lnds = total_twos\n    \n    # Now check all possible intervals [l, r]\n    # For each interval, compute how much it can contribute to S\n    # which is total_ones + (number of 2s in segment + suffix_twos[r+1])\n    # But also consider the case where the segment has some 2s and 1s\n    \n    for l in range(n):\n        # Find the first position >= l where a[i] is 1\n        # then expand r to include as many 2s as possible before it\n        # but this approach might be too slow\n        # Instead, for all possible r >= l, check if the segment contains at least one 2 and one 1\n        # and compute the contribution\n        \n        # To optimize, we can track for each l, the earliest occurrence of 1 after l\n        # and then for each such occurrence, calculate the contribution\n        # However, for the sake of time, we can iterate through all possible l and r\n        # since n is 2000, n^2 is 4 million which is manageable\n        \n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Check if the segment [l..r] contains at least one 2 and one 1\n            has_2 = False\n            has_1 = False\n            twos_in_segment = 0\n            ones_in_segment = 0\n            for i in range(l, r+1):\n                if a[i] == 2:\n                    has_2 = True\n                    twos_in_segment += 1\n                else:\n                    has_1 = True\n                    ones_in_segment += 1\n            if has_2 and has_1:\n                # Compute the contribution\n                # the number of 2s in the segment is twos_in_segment\n                # plus the suffix_twos[r+1]\n                current_twos = twos_in_segment + suffix_twos[r+1]\n                current_S = total_ones + current_twos\n                if current_S > max_lnds:\n                    max_lnds = current_S\n    \n    print(max_lnds)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Precompute Values**: `prefix_ones` keeps track of the cumulative count of 1s up to each index, while `suffix_twos` keeps track of the cumulative count of 2s from each index to the end.\n- **Iterate Over Subarrays**: For each possible subarray `[l, r]`, we check if it contains both 1s and 2s.
