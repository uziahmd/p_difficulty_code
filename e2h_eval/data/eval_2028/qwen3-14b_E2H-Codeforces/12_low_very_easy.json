The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Xenia moving around a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's take the first example input: n=4, m=3, a=[3,2,3]. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps between tasks.\n\nThe tasks are in order 3, 2, 3. But since each task must be done in order, she has to do them sequentially. So:\n\n- First task is at 3. Starting from 1, how long to get there? Well, moving clockwise, from 1 to 3 is two steps (1→2→3). But wait, the initial position is 1. So for the first task, the time taken is (3-1) = 2 steps? Or maybe (current position to a_i clockwise). Wait, the movement is along the ringroad, which is clockwise. So moving from current position to the target house in the clockwise direction.\n\nBut when you're on a ringroad, the distance between two houses can be calculated as (target - current) mod n, but if the target is behind (counter-clockwise), then you have to go all the way around. Wait no, because movement is only allowed clockwise. So for example, if current is at position 3, and target is 2, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. So the distance between current and target is (target - current + n) % n. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nIf current is at position x, and target is at position y. Since movement is clockwise, the number of steps needed is (y - x) mod n if y >=x, else (y -x +n) mod n. Wait, but that's equivalent to (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x +n). Which is the same as (y - x + n) % n. But since the movement is clockwise, the minimal steps would be (y - x) if y >=x, else (y -x +n). For example, x=3, y=2: (2-3) is -1, adding n (4) gives 3 steps. Which is correct.\n\nSo for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to calculate the steps between them. But also, the initial position is 1. So for the first task, the steps are from 1 to a_1. Then from a_1 to a_2, then a_2 to a_3, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the tasks are given as a list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m. But Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if a_i is the same as a_{i+1}, then moving from a_i to a_{i+1} takes zero steps. So the total time is the sum of the steps between consecutive tasks, including the initial step from 1 to a_1.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nInitialize current position as 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nFor each task in the list a:\n\n   calculate the steps from current position to this task's position.\n\n   add that to total_time.\n\n   update current position to this task's position.\n\nSo the question is, how to calculate the steps between current and the next position.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think. For current position curr and next position next:\n\nif next >= curr: steps is next - curr.\n\nelse: steps is (n - curr) + next.\n\nBut that's equivalent to (next - curr) if next >= curr, else (next - curr + n). Which can be written as (next - curr + n) % n. However, since the movement is only clockwise, the steps are (next - curr) mod n. But wait, for example, if curr is 3, next is 2, then (2-3) mod 4 is (-1) mod 4 = 3, which is correct. So yes, the steps between curr and next is (next - curr) mod n. But wait, no. Because if next is equal to curr, then (next - curr) mod n is zero",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is efficiently calculating the time required to move between consecutive tasks considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house 1.\n2. **Task Sequence**: Process each task in the given order.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: For each task, calculate the time required to move from the current position to the next task's position. Since movement is only allowed clockwise, the distance between two positions `curr` and `next` can be calculated as `(next - curr) % n` if `next >= curr`, otherwise `(next - curr + n) % n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor next_house in a:\n    diff = next_house - current\n    if diff <= 0:\n        diff += n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = next_house\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of houses) and `m` (number of tasks), followed by a list of `m` integers representing the house numbers for each task.\n2. **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time initialized to 0.\n3. **Iterate Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the task's house. If moving directly clockwise would result in a negative or zero distance, adjust by adding `n` to ensure the correct clockwise distance.\n4. **Update Total Time**: Accumulate the time taken for each move and update the current position after each task.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad. The complexity is linear with respect to the number of tasks, making it efficient even for large inputs.",
