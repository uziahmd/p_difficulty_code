The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Xenia moving around a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement. But how?\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are at 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break that down.\n\nThe first task is at 3. Starting from 1, moving clockwise to 3: that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Then, the second task is at 2. But since she's at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around: 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. Then the third task is at 3 again. From 2, moving to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is that for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to calculate the time to move from the current position to the next task's house, considering the direction (clockwise only). But since the movement is clockwise, the time between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nWait, the movement is along the ringroad in clockwise direction. So if Xenia is currently at position current and needs to go to position next, the time taken is (next - current) mod n if next is greater than current? Or wait, no. Because if current is 3 and next is 2, then moving clockwise would take (n - current + next) steps. For example, when n=4, current=3, next=2: moving clockwise would be 3→4→1→2, which is 3 steps. Which is (4 - 3 + 2) = 3? Wait, 4-3 is 1, plus 2 is 3. Yes. So the general formula for the time between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Wait no, because if next is less than current, then moving clockwise would require going all the way around. So the formula is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). But that can be written as (next - current) % n if the movement is allowed only clockwise. Wait, no. Because for example, when next is 2 and current is 3, (2-3) is -1, mod 4 would be 3. Which is correct. So the time between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current, else (next - current + n). Which is equivalent to (next - current) % n if the modulo is positive. But since in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values, maybe it's better to compute it as (next - current) if next >= current else (next - current + n). Alternatively, (next - current + n) % n. Because adding n ensures that even if next - current is negative, adding n gives the correct positive value.\n\nBut for example, if current is 3 and next is 2, (2 -3 +4) = 3, which is correct. If current is 2 and next is 3, (3-2 +4) mod 4 is 1, which is correct. So the formula for the time between current and next is (next - current) if next >= current else (next - current + n). Which can also be written as (next - current) % n if the result is non-negative. Wait, but in Python, (next - current) % n would give the correct value. For example, (2-3) %4 is 3. Which is correct. So perhaps the formula is (next - current) % n. But wait, when next is greater than current, (next - current) is positive, mod n is same as the difference. So yes. So the time between current and next is (next - current) % n.\n\nWait, but in the first example, when moving from 3 to 2, the time is 3 steps. (2-3) mod 4 is 3. Correct. So that's the formula.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Start at",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circular manner. The movement is only allowed clockwise, and each task must be completed in sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Since the ringroad is circular and movement is only clockwise, the time taken to move from one house to another can be calculated using modular arithmetic. Specifically, moving from house `current` to house `next` takes `(next - current) % n` units of time if `next` is greater than or equal to `current`, otherwise it wraps around the circle.\n\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from house 1, we iterate through each task in sequence. For each task, we calculate the time required to move from the current position to the next task's house and accumulate this time.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By iterating through the list of tasks and maintaining the current position, we can efficiently compute the total time required for all tasks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor next_house in a:\n    diff = (next_house - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = next_house\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1 and initialize the total time to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task location in the list, we calculate the time needed to move from the current house to the next task's house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n- **Update Position**: After calculating the time for each move, update the current position to the next task's house.\n- **Output Total Time**: The accumulated total time is printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement constraints, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
