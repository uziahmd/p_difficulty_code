The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about simulating a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to find out how many times each loses in n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round step by step is impossible. So we need an efficient way to calculate this without iterating through all n rounds.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Each player uses their own sequence, which repeats cyclically. For example, if Nikephoros's sequence is \"RPS\", then his moves are R, P, S, R, P, S, etc. Similarly for Polycarpus's sequence.\n\nFor each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what move each player makes. Then determine who wins, and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't check each round individually. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, compute the number of wins in one cycle, then multiply by the number of full cycles and add the remaining rounds.\n\nThe key idea here is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, so the pattern of moves will repeat. So, the total number of rounds can be divided into full cycles of LCM(m, k) and a remainder.\n\nSo, first, compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call this period_length. Then, for each round in 0 to period_length-1, we can compute the moves of both players and determine who wins. Then, count the number of wins for each player in one full period. Then, multiply that by the number of full periods in n rounds, and then add the results from the remaining rounds (n % period_length).\n\nBut wait, what if the LCM is very large? For example, if m and k are both 1000, their LCM could be up to 1e6. But since m and k are up to 1000, the LCM would be up to 1e6, which is manageable. Because even if n is 2e9, the number of periods is 2e9 / 1e6 = 2e3, which is manageable. So the total steps would be O(period_length) which is O(1e6) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period_length.\n\n2. For each of the period_length rounds, determine the moves of A and B, and count how many times each player loses in this period. Let's call these count_a (number of times A loses) and count_b (number of times B loses).\n\n3. Compute how many full periods fit into n rounds: full_periods = n // period_length.\n\n4. The remaining rounds are rem = n % period_length.\n\n5. The total for A is full_periods * count_a + the number of losses in the first rem rounds of the period.\n\nSame for B.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating for each of the period_length rounds, the moves and the outcome, and then doing the math.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute for each round in the period, what the moves are for A and B.\n\nFor a given round index i (starting from 0?), the move for A is A[i % m], and for B is B[i % k]. Because their sequences repeat every m and k rounds respectively.\n\nSo for each i in 0 to period_length - 1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen, determine who wins. If a wins, then B gets a spot. If B wins, A gets a spot. If draw, nothing.\n\nSo, for each of these steps, we can compute the number of A's losses and B's losses in the period.\n\nOnce we have that, multiply by the number of full periods and add the remaining part.\n\nNow, how to compute LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So we need to compute GCD. For that, Euclidean algorithm.\n\nSo first, implement a function to compute GCD, then LCM.\n\nBut in Python, there's math.gcd, but it returns positive integers, and for Python 3.5+. However, since m and k are positive, we can proceed.\n\nBut note that the LCM can be very big. However, since m and k are up to 1000, their product is up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo, for example, if m=3, k=4, LCM is 12. So for each of 12 rounds, we check the moves.\n\nNow, the next thing is to precompute for each round in 0 to period_length - 1, the outcome. Then, for the full periods, multiply by the counts.\n\nBut for the remaining rem rounds, we need to process the first rem rounds of the period.\n\nSo, the steps in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A as a string, m = len(A)\n\nRead B as a string, k = len(B)\n\nCompute period_length = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute for each i in 0 to period_length -1:\n\n   a_move = A[i % m]\n\n   b_move = B[i % k]\n\n   determine outcome, and accumulate count_a and count_b.\n\nOnce we have count_a and count_b per period, then:\n\nfull_periods = n // period_length\n\nrem = n % period_length\n\ntotal_a = full_periods * count_a + count_in_rem_a\n\ntotal_b = full_periods * count_b + count_in_rem_b\n\nBut how to compute count_in_rem_a and count_in_rem_b?\n\nWe can precompute for each possible i in 0 to period_length-1, the outcome, and store them in a list. Then, for the rem rounds, we can iterate from 0 to rem-1 and sum the counts.\n\nBut for rem up to period_length-1, which can be up to 1e6, this is acceptable.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, the full_periods could be up to 2e9 / 1 (if m and k are 1, LCM is 1). But even then, the code would handle it.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nprecompute a list of tuples (a_loss, b_loss) for each round in the period.\n\nThen, for the full_periods, multiply the total count_a and count_b by full_periods.\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, sum the first rem entries in the list.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\ndef compute_gcd(a, b):\n\n    while b:\n\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // compute_gcd(a, b)\n\nThen:\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\nlcm = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to lcm-1:\n\n   a_move = A[i % m]\n\n   b_move = B[i % k]\n\n   determine if a wins, b wins, or draw.\n\n   for each, add to count_a and count_b.\n\nOnce we have the per-period counts, then:\n\nfull_periods = n // lcm\n\nrem = n % lcm\n\nThen, compute the total for the full periods.\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, loop through 0 to rem-1, and check the same as before, adding to the totals.\n\nBut how to compute the per-round outcomes?\n\nWe can precompute a list of (a_loss, b_loss) for each of the lcm rounds. Then, for the rem rounds, we can take the first rem elements and sum their a_loss and b_loss.\n\nSo, for example, during the pre-processing phase, create a list called 'per_round' where each element is (a_loses, b_loses). Then, for the full periods, total_a = full_periods * sum_a_per_period, and similarly for total_b. Then, for the rem rounds, sum the first rem elements of per_round.\n\nBut how to compute a_loses and b_loses for each round.\n\nLet me think: for each round, given a_move and b_move, determine who wins.\n\nThe rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beat paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nIf same, draw.\n\nSo, for a_move and b_move:\n\nif a_move == b_move: no loss.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a_move beats b_move): then B loses (so a_loses is 0, b_loses is 1?)\n\nWait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So, if Nikephoros (A) wins, then Polycarpus (B) gets a spot. So, Nikephoros's loss count is when he loses. So, for each round:\n\nif A wins: B gets a spot. So, Nikephoros's count (the first output number) is incremented by 0, and Polycarpus's count (second number) is incremented by 1.\n\nIf B wins: Nikephoros's count is incremented by 1, and Polycarpus's count by 0.\n\nIf draw: both 0.\n\nSo, for each round, we need to check whether A wins, B wins, or draw.\n\nSo, for a_move and b_move:\n\nif a_move == b_move: no change.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a_move beats b_move):\n\n   B loses: so Nikephoros's count increases by 0, Polycarpus's by 1.\n\nelse:\n\n   A loses: Nikephoros's count increases by 1, Polycarpus's by 0.\n\nSo, for each round, we can compute a_loss and b_loss (each 0 or 1).\n\nSo, for the per_round list, each entry is (a_loss, b_loss).\n\nSo, how to implement this check?\n\nWe can write a helper function:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # A wins, B loses\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # B wins, A loses\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each a and b, this returns the increments for a's loss and b's loss.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, considering the example input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, A is \"RPS\" (m=3), B is \"RSPP\" (k=4). LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo, for each of 12 rounds, we check the moves.\n\nLet me compute for each i from 0 to 11:\n\ni=0:\n\nA: 0%3=0 → R\n\nB: 0%4=0 → R → same. (0,0)\n\ni=1:\n\nA:1%3=1 → P\n\nB:1%4=1 → S → P vs S. S beats P? Wait, S is scissors, P is paper. Scissors cut paper. So S beats P. So B's move is S, which beats A's P. So B wins. So A loses. So (1,0).\n\nWait, the function says:\n\nif a is P and b is S: then a is P, b is S. So, (a, b) is P vs S. According to the rules, S beats P. So B wins. So the function returns (1,0) because A loses. So yes.\n\nSo for i=1, the result is (1,0).\n\nSimilarly, for each i in 0-11, compute the result.\n\nBut for the sample input, the first 7 rounds are:\n\nRound 1: i=0 → R vs R → draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 2: i=1 → P vs S → B wins. (1,0)\n\nRound 3: i=2 → S vs P → A's move is S, B's is P. S beats P. A wins. So B loses. (0,1)\n\nRound 4: i=3 → A is 3%3=0 → R. B is 3%4=3 → P. R vs P. P beats R. B wins. So A loses. (1,0)\n\nRound 5: i=4 → A is 4%3=1 → P. B is 4%4=0 → R. P vs R. P beats R. A wins. B loses. (0,1)\n\nRound 6: i=5 → A is 5%3=2 → S. B is 5%4=1 → S. Draw. (0,0)\n\nRound 7: i=6 → A is 6%3=0 → R. B is 6%4=2 → P. R vs P. B wins. (1,0)\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds, the total is:\n\nLooking at the sample explanation, the output is 3 and 2. Let's see:\n\nIn the sample explanation, Nikephoros has 3 losses. Let's see:\n\nRound 2: Nikephoros loses (count 1)\n\nRound 4: Nikephoros loses (count 2)\n\nRound 7: Nikephoros loses (count 3)\n\nThen, in the sample explanation, the other rounds:\n\nRound 3: Polycarpus loses (count 1)\n\nRound 5: Polycarpus loses (count 2)\n\nSo the total for Nikephoros is 3, and Polycarpus 2.\n\nSo according to the code:\n\nfor the first 7 rounds, which is the sample input, the code would compute:\n\nthe per_round list for the first 7 rounds (assuming the period is 12, and rem is 7).\n\nSo the code would compute the sum of the first 7 entries in the per_round list.\n\nBut the code needs to generate for each of the 12 rounds the (a_loss, b_loss) values.\n\nSo, in the sample case, the per_round list for the first 7 rounds would be:\n\ni=0 → (0,0)\n\ni=1 → (1,0)\n\ni=2 → (0,1)\n\ni=3 → (1,0)\n\ni=4 → (0,1)\n\ni=5 → (0,0)\n\ni=6 → (1,0)\n\nSo summing the a_loss (first element) for these 7 entries:\n\n0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 3 → which is correct for Nikephoros's losses.\n\nSumming the b_loss (second element) for these 7 entries:\n\n0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2 → correct for Polycarpus's losses.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A, B.\n\nCompute m and k.\n\nCompute LCM.\n\nGenerate the per_round list for LCM rounds.\n\nCompute sum_a and sum_b for the entire period.\n\nThen, full_periods = n // LCM.\n\nrem = n % LCM.\n\ntotal_a = full_periods * sum_a + sum of the first rem elements' a_loss.\n\nSame for total_b.\n\nNow, for the per_round list, generating it for LCM rounds.\n\nBut for LCM up to 1e6, this is manageable.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut let's think about handling the input. The input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nThe second line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is read as:\n\nThe first line is n, then the second line is A, third line is B.\n\nBut the user's example shows that the input is passed as two lines, but perhaps the original problem's input is:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nThe second line is the sequence A.\n\nThe third line is the sequence B.\n\nSo, in code, in Python, the input is read as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut the sample input shows that for the first case, the input is 7, then RPS, then RSPP.\n\nSo, the code should read n, then A, then B.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplementing the steps.\n\nBut for very large n (like 2e9), but the code is O(LCM(m, k)) which is up to 1e6 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement compute_gcd and compute_lcm.\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd exists, but returns the absolute value. However, since m and k are positive, we can proceed.\n\nBut note that in Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists. Also, for the case where one of m or k is zero? But the problem states that m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut for a and b being m and k.\n\nOnce that is done, proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, A, B.\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\nlcm = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\nThen, create a list per_round of tuples (a_loss, b_loss) for each of the lcm rounds.\n\nsum_a = 0\n\nsum_b = 0\n\nper_round = []\n\nfor i in range(lcm):\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    # compute result\n\n    if a_move == b_move:\n\n        per_round.append( (0, 0) )\n\n    else:\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            per_round.append( (0, 1) )\n\n        else:\n\n            per_round.append( (1, 0) )\n\nThen, compute sum_a and sum_b for the entire period:\n\nsum_a_period = sum( x[0] for x in per_round )\n\nsum_b_period = sum( x[1] for x in per_round )\n\nThen, full_periods = n // lcm\n\nrem = n % lcm\n\ntotal_a = full_periods * sum_a_period\n\ntotal_b = full_periods * sum_b_period\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, we need to sum the first rem elements of per_round.\n\nsum_rem_a = sum( x[0] for x in per_round[:rem] )\n\nsum_rem_b = sum( x[1] for x in per_round[:rem] )\n\ntotal_a += sum_rem_a\n\ntotal_b += sum_rem_b\n\nThen, print(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut for the sample input, let's test.\n\nSample input:\n\nn=7, A=RPS (m=3), B=RSPP (k=4). lcm(3,4)=12.\n\nper_round is for 12 rounds.\n\nsum_a_period is the sum of all a_loss in the 12 rounds.\n\nBut in the sample, the first 7 rounds contribute 3 and 2. However, the full_periods is 7//12=0, rem=7. So the total is sum_rem_a and sum_rem_b.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second example:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo, n=5, A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8), B is \"R\" (k=1). LCM(8,1) is 8.\n\nEach round in the 8 rounds:\n\nA's move is R, since i % 8 is 0-7, but for any i, A is R. B's move is R (since i%1=0 always). So all rounds are draws. So sum_a_period is 0, sum_b_period is 0. rem is 5. So total_a is 0, total_b is 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works for that.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then, the code computes lcm(1,1)=1. For i=0: A is R, B is S. R beats S. So A wins. B loses. So (0,1). sum_a_period is 0, sum_b_period is 1. full_periods = 1//1=1. rem=0. total_a = 0*1 + 0 = 0. total_b = 1*1 + 0 = 1. So output is 0 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then, LCM is 1. full_periods = 2//1=2. rem=0. sum_a is 0, sum_b is 1. total_a is 0*2=0, total_b is 2*1=2. So output 0 2. Correct.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the LCM is larger than n? Like n is 5 and LCM is 10. Then rem is 5, and we process the first 5 rounds.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut for very large LCM (like 1e6), the per_round list may take some time, but for Python it's manageable.\n\nBut for m and k up to 1000, LCM is up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code is as follows.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    lcm = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\n    per_round = []\n\n    for i in range(lcm):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            per_round.append( (0, 0) )\n\n        else:\n\n            if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n                per_round.append( (0, 1) )\n\n            else:\n\n                per_round.append( (1, 0) )\n\n    sum_a_period = sum(x[0] for x in per_round)\n\n    sum_b_period = sum(x[1] for x in per_round)\n\n    full_periods = n // lcm\n\n    rem = n % lcm\n\n    total_a = full_periods * sum_a_period\n\n    total_b = full_periods * sum_b_period\n\n    # add the remaining rounds\n\n    sum_rem_a = sum(x[0] for x in per_round[:rem])\n\n    sum_rem_b = sum(x[1] for x in per_round[:rem])\n\n    total_a += sum_rem_a\n\n    total_b += sum_rem_b\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first example's code would generate:\n\nlcm is 12. For n=7, full_periods is 0. rem=7. sum_rem_a is sum of first 7 elements of per_round.\n\nWhich in the sample case is 3 and 2. So the code outputs 3 2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code, for the per_round list, the code is generated for i in range(lcm). So for the first example, the per_round is 12 elements. Then, for rem=7, per_round[:7] is the first 7 elements.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code should handle all cases.\n\nBut what if the LCM is 0? No, since m and k are at least 1.\n\nAnother edge case: n=0? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code can be written as such. However, in Python, for very large LCMs (like 1e6), the for loop for i in range(lcm) may take some time, but since 1e6 is manageable.\n\nBut given that m and k are up to 1000, LCM can be up to 1e6, which is acceptable.\n\nThus, this code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus after playing n rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player uses a cyclic strategy based on their respective sequences. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even when n is very large (up to 2·10^9).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use sequences that repeat cyclically. This means their moves repeat every m and k rounds respectively for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The key insight is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This LCM gives the period after which both sequences align again, allowing us to determine the pattern of moves and outcomes.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By calculating the outcomes for one full cycle (LCM length), we can determine the number of losses for each player in one cycle. Using this, we can compute the total losses for the entire game by considering the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    lcm = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    per_round = []\n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        if a_move == b_move:\n            per_round.append((0, 0))\n        else:\n            if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or \\\n               (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or \\\n               (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n                per_round.append((0, 1))\n            else:\n                per_round.append((1, 0))\n    \n    sum_a_period = sum(x[0] for x in per_round)\n    sum_b_period = sum(x[1] for x in per_round)\n    \n    full_periods = n // lcm\n    rem = n % lcm\n    \n    total_a = full_periods * sum_a_period\n    total_b = full_periods * sum_b_period\n    \n    sum_rem_a = sum(x[0] for x in per_round[:rem])\n    sum_rem_b = sum(x[1] for x in per_round[:rem])\n    \n    total_a += sum_rem_a\n    total_b += sum_rem_b\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of sequences `A` and `B` is computed to determine the period after which both sequences realign.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within the LCM period, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome (losses for each player) is recorded.\n4. **Full Periods and Remainder**: The total number of full periods within `n` rounds is calculated. The results from these full periods are multiplied by the number of periods. The remaining rounds after the full periods are processed separately.\n5. **Result Calculation**: The total number of losses for each player is computed by summing the results from full periods and the remaining rounds.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle very large values of `n` by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, reducing the complexity from O(n) to O(LCM(m, k)), which is feasible given the constraints.",
