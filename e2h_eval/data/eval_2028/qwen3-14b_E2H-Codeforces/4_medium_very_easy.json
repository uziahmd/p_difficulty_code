The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players are playing rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which determines the number of red spots.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. Each character is R, S, or P. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what each player plays. Then check who wins, and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round directly. So simulating each round one by one is impossible. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key is to find patterns that repeat, and compute the number of losses in each cycle, then multiply by the number of full cycles and add the remainder.\n\nLet me think. For each round, the move of Nikephoros is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus, it's B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nThe problem is that for n up to 2e9, we can't iterate through all rounds. So we need to find the total number of times each player loses over all rounds.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. Find the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Let's call it lcm. Because after lcm rounds, the pattern of moves for both players will repeat. Because the sequences A and B are cycled, so their combined pattern repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\nSo, for example, if m=3 and k=4, LCM is 12. So the combination of moves for each round will repeat every 12 rounds.\n\nTherefore, the idea is:\n\n- Compute the number of complete LCM cycles in n rounds. Let's say total_cycles = n // lcm. And the remainder is rem = n % lcm.\n\n- For each of the LCM rounds, compute how many times each player loses. Let's call these per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly.\n\n- Then, multiply per_cycle_nik by total_cycles, and same for poly. Then, process the remaining rem rounds separately.\n\nBut how do I compute per_cycle_nik and per_cycle_poly?\n\nWell, for each of the LCM rounds, I can simulate each round once. Since m and k are up to 1000, their LCM could be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000 is 1e6). Wait, but LCM(m, k) is up to m*k. So for m and k up to 1000, LCM could be up to 1e6. So for each LCM cycle, we can simulate each round once, and count the number of losses for each player. Then multiply by the number of full cycles. Then handle the remaining rounds.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\nCalculate the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period.\n\nCompute how many full periods there are in n rounds: full_periods = n // period.\n\nCompute the remaining rounds: rem = n % period.\n\nFor each full period, calculate the number of losses for each player (nik_loss_per_period, poly_loss_per_period).\n\nThen, multiply those by full_periods.\n\nThen, simulate the rem rounds, adding to the counts.\n\nSo the total is:\n\ntotal_nik = full_periods * nik_loss_per_period + nik_loss_in_rem\n\ntotal_poly = full_periods * poly_loss_per_period + poly_loss_in_rem\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute the LCM of m and k. To compute LCM, we can use the formula LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So we need a function to compute GCD.\n\nIn Python, the math module has gcd, but for Python versions 3.5 and above. But since the problem says to write code that works, perhaps using math.gcd. Also, note that for Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nBut for LCM, we have to compute a*b // gcd(a,b). But since m and k can be up to 1000, their product is up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo, first, compute m and k, then compute the LCM.\n\nOnce that's done, simulate for each of the period rounds (up to 1e6 steps), which is acceptable.\n\nNow, for each round in 0 to period-1:\n\nFor round i:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nCheck who wins. Then increment the counts for the respective player.\n\nSo, for the per_period counts, we can loop from 0 to period-1, compute each round's outcome, and accumulate the counts.\n\nOnce that's done, multiply by full_periods.\n\nThen, for the remaining rem rounds, do the same loop from 0 to rem-1, and add the counts.\n\nSo the overall steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B. m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute period = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute full_periods = n // period.\n\nrem = n % period.\n\nCompute per_period_nik and per_period_poly.\n\nThen compute for rem rounds, rem_nik and rem_poly.\n\nTotal is full_periods * per_period_nik + rem_nik, and similar for poly.\n\nNow, how to compute the outcome between a and b.\n\nWe can have a helper function that takes a and b and returns who wins.\n\nFor example:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nElse:\n\nif (a beats b) then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a loss (so add to poly's count).\n\nElse, Nikephoros loses, add to nik's count.\n\nSo for example, when a is 'R' and b is 'S', Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a loss. So for that round, nik's loss count is 0, poly's is +1.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So for each round, if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a red spot (so his count increases). If Nikephoros loses, then his count increases.\n\nSo for each round, we need to check if Nikephoros is the loser. If yes, add 1 to his total. Else, if Polycarpus is the loser, add 1 to his total.\n\nSo the helper function can return which player loses, or whether it's a draw.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases:\n\nCase 1: a and b are same: no loss.\n\nCase 2: a beats b: Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus loses. So add 1 to poly's count.\n\nCase 3: b beats a: Nikephoros loses. Add 1 to nik's count.\n\nSo how to check if a beats b.\n\nWe can have a dictionary or a set of winning conditions.\n\nLike:\n\nif a is 'R' and b is 'S': a wins.\n\nif a is 'S' and b is 'P': a wins.\n\nif a is 'P' and b is 'R': a wins.\n\nElse, if a and b are different, then b wins.\n\nSo for a given a and b, check if (a, b) is in the winning conditions. If yes, then Nikephoros wins, else if (b, a) is in the winning conditions, then Polycarpus wins. Or perhaps, we can code it as:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nWait, no. Because the first case is when Nikephoros wins. So for that, the loser is Polycarpus. So the function returns (nik's loss, poly's loss). So for the case where Nikephoros wins, the nik's loss is 0, and poly's loss is 1. Otherwise, if Nikephoros loses, then nik's loss is 1, and poly's is 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, for each round, we can compute the (nik_loss, poly_loss) for that round.\n\nSo for the per_period counts, we can loop through each of the period rounds, compute the (nik, poly) for each, sum them up.\n\nSo, for example, in the first sample input:\n\nn is 7.\n\nA is RPS (m=3), B is RSPP (k=4).\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nfull_periods = 7 // 12 = 0, rem =7.\n\nSo for the first 0 periods, nothing added. Then process the 7 rounds.\n\nBut in the example, the output is 3 and 2.\n\nSo during the 7 rounds, the counts are calculated.\n\nSo for each of the 7 rounds, we need to check what each plays.\n\nSo for the code, the helper function is needed.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n from input. Then read A and B.\n\nCompute m and k.\n\nCompute LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute full_periods and rem.\n\nCompute per_period_nik and per_period_poly by looping through 0 to period-1.\n\nThen compute the rem rounds, loop 0 to rem-1.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplementing the LCM:\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    from math import gcd\n\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut need to handle when a or b is zero? Well, in the problem, m and k are at least 1.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport math\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\nlcm = m * k // math.gcd(m, k)\n\nOnce that is done, proceed.\n\nNow, for the simulation part.\n\nBut for the per_period calculation, for each i in 0 to lcm-1:\n\na = A[i % m]\n\nb = B[i % k]\n\nthen compute the result.\n\nBut for the code, for each i in range(period):\n\nBut period can be up to 1e6, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\ndef compute_losses(period, A, B, m, k):\n\n    nik = 0\n\n    poly = 0\n\n    for i in range(period):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses\n\n            poly +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # Nikephoros loses\n\n            nik +=1\n\n    return nik, poly\n\nWait, but in the code, the function returns (nik, poly) for the period.\n\nBut in the code, for the per_period, we need to calculate the total for the entire period.\n\nOnce we have that, then multiply by full_periods.\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, we can do the same loop for rem steps.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nThen, the total_nik = full_periods * per_period_nik + rem_nik.\n\nSame for poly.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, considering the example input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo m=3, k=4. LCM is 12.\n\nSo for the first 12 rounds, we compute per_period_nik and per_period_poly.\n\nBut since n is 7, which is less than 12, full_periods is 0, and rem is 7.\n\nSo we simulate 7 rounds.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me check the first sample's explanation.\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (because S beats P? Wait, no. Wait, the sample says in the first sample:\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R-R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S. So Nikephoros plays P (second round?), but maybe the rounds are numbered from 0?\n\nWait, perhaps the code uses i from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut in the example, the first sample's input is 7 rounds. Let me look at the sample explanation:\n\nThe first sample's rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R - R (draw)\n\nRound 2: P - S → Nikephoros loses?\n\nWait, according to the sample explanation, the second round is P vs S. Nikephoros loses. Let me see:\n\nIn the sample explanation, the first round is R-R (draw). Then the next rounds are:\n\nRound 2: P vs S. Nikephoros's move is P, Polycarpus's move is S. So S beats P. So Nikephoros loses. So that's why he gets a red spot. So the code would add 1 to nik's count.\n\nBut according to the code's helper function, for a = 'P', b = 'S':\n\nCheck if (a, b) is in the winning conditions. The winning conditions for Nikephoros are:\n\na is R and b is S → yes.\n\na is S and b is P → yes.\n\na is P and b is R → yes.\n\nSo for a = P, b = S: none of these. So the code would check if a beats b. No. So else clause: Nikephoros loses. So add 1 to nik's count. Which is correct.\n\nSo in that case, the code would correctly count that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m and k.\n\nCompute LCM.\n\nCompute full_periods and rem.\n\nCompute per_period_nik and per_period_poly.\n\nCompute rem_nik and rem_poly.\n\nTotal is full_periods * per_period_nik + rem_nik, and same for poly.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut how to handle reading the input?\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nBut in the example given in the problem statement, the input is:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is read as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nThen the second line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '7', then 'RPS', then 'RSPP'.\n\nSo in code, the input is read as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem statement, the input is given as a list of two elements, but perhaps that's a mistake. The actual input is three lines: first n, then A, then B.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nThe second line contains sequence A.\n\nThird line contains sequence B.\n\nSo code should read:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the code, the code needs to handle very large n. So for the code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    # compute LCM of m and k\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    period = lcm(m, k)\n\n    # compute per_period counts\n\n    per_period_nik = 0\n\n    per_period_poly = 0\n\n    for i in range(period):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # Nikephoros wins, so poly loses\n\n            per_period_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            # Nikephoros loses\n\n            per_period_nik += 1\n\n    # compute full periods and remainder\n\n    full_periods = n // period\n\n    rem = n % period\n\n    # total from full periods\n\n    total_nik = full_periods * per_period_nik\n\n    total_poly = full_periods * per_period_poly\n\n    # compute rem rounds\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            total_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            total_nik += 1\n\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first sample's output is 3 2. Let's see.\n\nSample input:\n\nn=7, A=RPS, B=RSPP.\n\nm=3, k=4. LCM is 12.\n\nfull_periods = 7//12 = 0. rem =7.\n\nSo the code loops for rem=7 rounds.\n\nLet's simulate:\n\nfor i in 0 to 6:\n\ni=0:\n\na = A[0%3] = A[0] = R\n\nb = B[0%4] = B[0] = R → same → no change.\n\ni=1:\n\na = A[1%3] = A[1] = P\n\nb = B[1%4] = B[1] = S → P vs S. Check if a beats b. P vs S: S beats P. So Nikephoros loses. So add 1 to total_nik.\n\ni=2:\n\na = A[2%3] = A[2] = S\n\nb = B[2%4] = B[2] = P → S vs P. S beats P. Nikephoros wins. So poly gets +1.\n\ni=3:\n\na = A[3%3=0] → R\n\nb = B[3%4=3] → B[3] = P. R vs P. P beats R. Nikephoros loses. So total_nik +=1.\n\ni=4:\n\na = A[4%3=1] → P\n\nb = B[4%4=0] → B[0] = R. P vs R: P beats R. Nikephoros wins. So poly +=1.\n\ni=5:\n\na = A[5%3=2] → S\n\nb = B[5%4=1] → B[1] = S. S vs S → draw.\n\ni=6:\n\na = A[6%3=0] → R\n\nb = B[6%4=2] → B[2] = P. R vs P → P beats R. Nikephoros loses. total_nik +=1.\n\nSo total_nik is 0 (from initial) + 1 (i=1) + 1 (i=3) + 1 (i=6) → total 3.\n\ntotal_poly is 0 + 1 (i=2) + 1 (i=4) → total 2. Which matches the sample output. So the code seems to work.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). LCM(8,1) is 8.\n\nn=5.\n\nfull_periods = 5 // 8 = 0, rem=5.\n\nsimulate 5 rounds.\n\nEach round, A[i%8] is R, B[i%1] is R. All draws. So total_nik and total_poly are 0. So output is 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if n is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, n ≥ 1.\n\nAnother case: when m=1 and k=1. So LCM is 1. For each round, check the same moves. So for n=1e9, the code would compute full_periods = 1e9, and per_period_nik and per_period_poly would be 0 (if same) or 1.\n\nAnother case: when A and B have all same elements. So all rounds are draws. Output is 0 0.\n\nAnother case: when A is R, B is S. So for each round, Nikephoros wins. So for n rounds, total_nik is 0, total_poly is n.\n\nBut code would compute period = LCM(1,1)=1. per_period_poly is 1. So full_periods = n // 1 = n. rem is 0. So total_poly is n * 1 = n. Correct.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code may have some issues with the LCM calculation. Let's check.\n\nFor example, m=2, k=2. LCM is 2. But if A is 'RS' and B is 'RS', then for period 2:\n\ni=0: A[0] = R vs B[0] = R → draw.\n\ni=1: A[1] = S vs B[1] = S → draw. So per_period_nik and per_period_poly are 0. So for any n, the answer is 0 0.\n\nAnother example: m=2, k=2. A is RS, B is SP.\n\nperiod is 2.\n\ni=0: A[0] R vs B[0] S → R beats S. Nikephoros wins → poly +=1.\n\ni=1: A[1] S vs B[1] P → S beats P → poly +=1.\n\nper_period_poly is 2. So for n=2, total is 2. For n=3, full_periods = 1, rem=1. So total_poly = 2*1 + 1 (from rem) = 3.\n\nYes.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut for the code, in Python, the math.gcd function returns the greatest common divisor of two numbers. However, in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code must read from stdin, and output to stdout.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    def lcm(a, b):\n\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\n    period = lcm(m, k)\n\n    per_period_nik = 0\n\n    per_period_poly = 0\n\n    for i in range(period):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            per_period_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            per_period_nik += 1\n\n    full_periods = n // period\n\n    rem = n % period\n\n    total_nik = full_periods * per_period_nik\n\n    total_poly = full_periods * per_period_poly\n\n    for i in range(rem):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            total_poly += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            total_nik += 1\n\n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nThis should be the code.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors, where each player follows a cyclic strategy based on their respective sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently determine the number of losses for each player over a potentially very large number of rounds (up to 2 billion).\n\n2. **Key Insight**: The sequences of moves for both players repeat cyclically. Therefore, the combined pattern of moves repeats every Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. This allows us to compute the results for one full cycle and then use this to determine results for all cycles and any remaining rounds.\n\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: By calculating the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences, we can determine the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds. We simulate the game for one full cycle to count the losses and then multiply by the number of full cycles. Any remaining rounds are simulated separately.\n\n4. **Determine Outcomes**: For each round, check the outcome based on the rules of rock-paper-scissors and update the loss counts accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    period = lcm(m, k)\n    \n    per_period_nik = 0\n    per_period_poly = 0\n    \n    for i in range(period):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            per_period_poly += 1\n        else:\n            per_period_nik += 1\n    \n    full_periods = n // period\n    rem = n % period\n    \n    total_nik = full_periods * per_period_nik\n    total_poly = full_periods * per_period_poly\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            total_poly += 1\n        else:\n            total_nik += 1\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the sequences of moves for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is computed to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Cycle**: For each round within one LCM period, the moves are determined, and the outcomes are recorded to count the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Handling Full Cycles and Remainder**: The number of full cycles is calculated, and the losses from these cycles are multiplied by the number of full cycles. The remaining rounds after the full cycles are simulated separately.\n5. **Output**: The total number of losses for both players is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the repeating nature of the sequences, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and correct.",
