They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about restoring the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on some given edges that have GCD and LCM values. The input gives us a graph where each edge has a GCD and LCM of the two nodes it connects. Our task is to find possible values for each node such that all the edges' GCD and LCM conditions are satisfied, or determine that it's impossible.\n\nFirst, let me think about the constraints for each edge. For any two nodes u and v connected by an edge with GCD g and LCM l, we know that:\n\n- The GCD of u and v must be g.\n- The LCM of u and v must be l.\n\nBut there's a relationship between GCD and LCM. Remember that for two numbers a and b, GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. So, for each edge, the product of the GCD and LCM must equal the product of the two node values. Also, since GCD divides both numbers and LCM is a multiple of both, there's a specific structure here.\n\nLet me think: For a given edge with GCD g and LCM l, then the two node values (say a and b) must satisfy:\n\na = g * x\nb = g * y\nwhere GCD(x,y) = 1. Because when you factor out the GCD, the remaining parts must be coprime.\n\nAlso, since LCM(a,b) = g * x * y (because LCM(a,b) = (a*b)/GCD(a,b) = (g x * g y)/g = g x y). Therefore, the LCM l must equal g * x * y. Which implies that x*y = l/g. But since x and y are coprime, this means that x and y must be divisors of l/g, and their product is exactly l/g. Also, since x and y are coprime, they must be factors of l/g that are coprime. So for example, if l/g is some number, say k, then x and y are coprime factors of k whose product is k. Which implies that x and y are coprime and their product is k. So that would mean that x and y are coprime factors of k, and one is a divisor of k and the other is k divided by that divisor. But since they are coprime, the only way for their product to be k is that they are coprime pairs such that x * y = k. So, for example, x could be 1 and y could be k, or x could be some other pair of coprime factors.\n\nBut how does this help me? Well, for each edge, the two nodes must be multiples of g, and their product must be g*l. So, for each edge, the product of the two nodes is g*l. Also, their GCD is g. Which implies that the nodes can be written as g * x and g * y, with x and y coprime, and x*y = l/g. So, for each edge, l must be a multiple of g, because l/g must be an integer. Wait! If l is the LCM of a and b, and g is the GCD, then l must be a multiple of g. Because LCM(a,b) is a multiple of both a and b, which are multiples of g. So if the given LCM is less than the GCD, that's impossible. So first check: for each edge, if LCM < GCD, then it's impossible. Also, if LCM is not divisible by GCD, then it's impossible. Because l/g must be integer. So that's a first check.\n\nSo, the first step is to check for each edge whether LCM is divisible by GCD. If not, output NO.\n\nOnce that's done, for each edge, we can represent the two nodes as g * x and g * y, with x and y coprime, and x*y = l/g. So for each edge, we can have x and y as coprime factors of (l/g), and their product is (l/g).\n\nBut how do we assign these values across the entire graph?\n\nThis seems like a graph problem where each node has a value, and edges impose constraints on the values of adjacent nodes.\n\nThe approach here might be to model this as a graph where each node's value is determined by the constraints from the edges. However, since each edge relates two nodes, we need to assign values in a way that satisfies all constraints.\n\nThis feels similar to a bipartition problem or a system of equations. However, since the relationships are multiplicative, perhaps we can model it using a Union-Find structure with some additional information, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since each edge defines a relationship between two nodes, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each connected component must have values that are consistent with the constraints. For example, in a connected component, we can choose a root node and assign a value to it, then propagate the values through the edges.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a connected component. Let's take one node and assign a value to it. Then, for each edge connected to this node, we can compute the value of the adjacent node. However, there's a possibility of conflicts when there are multiple paths between nodes. For example, if there's a cycle in the graph, the constraints must be consistent around the cycle.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- For each connected component in the graph, assign variables to the nodes such that all edges' constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's consider that for each edge between u and v, the values of u and v must be multiples of the GCD of that edge. Let's denote the GCD as g_uv and LCM as l_uv.\n\nFor each edge (u, v, g, l), we have:\n\ngcd(u, v) = g\n\nlcm(u, v) = l\n\nWhich implies that u = g * x, v = g * y, where gcd(x, y) = 1, and x * y = l/g.\n\nSo for each edge, x and y are coprime and their product is l/g.\n\nSo, for example, if we have a tree structure (no cycles), we can assign values starting from a root node. Let's say we assign a value to the root, then for each neighbor, we can compute their value based on the edge's constraints.\n\nBut how to handle cycles?\n\nFor example, suppose we have a cycle of edges. Then, when propagating values around the cycle, the constraints must be consistent. Otherwise, there's no solution.\n\nSo the idea is to model this as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to others, and during traversal, we check for consistency.\n\nLet me think of the variables as being in terms of the GCDs and the multiplicative factors. For example, for each node u, we can represent its value as a product of the GCD of the edge and some variable that's coprime with the other node's variable.\n\nBut how to model this? Perhaps, for each node, we can assign a value that is a multiple of some base value, and track the relations between nodes.\n\nAnother approach: For each edge, the product of the two nodes is g * l. Because GCD * LCM = product of the two numbers. So for each edge (u, v), u * v = g * l. So if we can assign values to the nodes such that for every edge, the product of the two nodes is equal to g * l.\n\nBut also, their GCD must be equal to g. So even if the product is correct, the GCD may not be. For example, suppose u=2, v=6. Their product is 12, and GCD is 2. Suppose the edge says GCD is 2 and LCM is 6. Then 2*6 = 12, which equals 2*6 = 12. So that works. But if u=4 and v=3, their product is 12, but GCD is 1. So in that case, the product is correct, but the GCD is wrong. Therefore, the product being correct is necessary but not sufficient.\n\nSo the product condition is necessary, but not sufficient. Therefore, we need to ensure that the GCD is exactly the given value.\n\nSo, the problem requires both the product and the GCD.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think again.\n\nIf u and v are such that u * v = g * l, and the GCD(u, v) = g, then the following must hold:\n\nLet me write u = g * a, v = g * b. Then, GCD(u, v) = g * GCD(a, b). But according to the problem statement, this should be equal to g. Therefore, GCD(a, b) must be 1. Also, since LCM(u, v) = g * a * b. Which must be equal to l. Therefore, l = g * a * b → a * b = l / g. So, the product of a and b must be l/g, and they must be coprime.\n\nSo for each edge, the product of the two nodes is g*l. Also, the GCD of the nodes is g. Which is equivalent to saying that the nodes can be written as g*a and g*b with a and b coprime, and a*b = l/g.\n\nTherefore, for each edge, l must be divisible by g. So, first check: for each edge, if l % g != 0, then it's impossible. Also, if l/g is not an integer, then impossible.\n\nSo, the first step is to check for each edge whether l is divisible by g. If not, output NO.\n\nNow, assuming that's true, then for each edge, we can proceed.\n\nNow, the problem becomes assigning a value to each node such that for every edge (u, v, g, l), the product of u and v is g*l, and GCD(u, v) = g.\n\nBut how to model this? It seems like a system of constraints where each edge imposes that u and v are multiples of g, and their ratio (u/g and v/g) are coprime and their product is l/g.\n\nLet me think of the variables as being in terms of their factors. For example, if I can model the variables as a product of g (from the edge) multiplied by some factors that are coprime with the adjacent nodes.\n\nBut how to do this in practice?\n\nPerhaps, we can model this as a graph where each node's value is determined relative to others. For example, for a connected component, we can assign a base value to one node, and then compute the values of others based on the edges.\n\nBut since the same node can be part of multiple edges, we need to make sure that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet me think of the graph as a collection of connected components. For each connected component, we can assign values to the nodes in a way that satisfies all edges in that component.\n\nLet me think of building a graph where each node's value is determined by the edges. For example, suppose we have a tree structure. We can pick a root node and assign a value to it, then for each child, compute the value based on the edge's constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose we have an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l. Then, u = g * a, v = g * b, with a*b = l/g and GCD(a,b) = 1.\n\nSo, if we have u's value, then v's value is (g*l) / u. Because u*v = g*l → v = (g*l)/u.\n\nBut wait, that's only if we know u. So, for example, if we have a tree, we can start with some arbitrary value for a node (like the root), then compute the adjacent nodes. But what value should we choose for the root?\n\nBut here's the problem: choosing a value for the root may not be arbitrary. Because for each edge, the value of the adjacent node must be (g*l)/u. However, when we have a cycle, the constraints must be consistent.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Choose a starting node, assign a value to it (but how?).\n\nWait, but the value of the node can be determined based on the constraints. However, there's some degrees of freedom. For example, in the case of a single edge between two nodes u and v. The product u*v must be g*l. But there are infinitely many possibilities. However, the GCD of u and v must be exactly g. So, the values of u and v are multiples of g, and their ratio (u/g and v/g) must be coprime and multiply to l/g.\n\nSo, for example, if l/g is k, then u/g and v/g are coprime factors of k whose product is k. So, the possible pairs (a, b) are (1, k), (k, 1), etc., depending on the factors of k.\n\nBut how to choose which pair to take? Because the choice affects the rest of the graph.\n\nBut in a connected component, perhaps we can assign values based on the constraints. For example, if we have a tree structure, we can assign a value to the root, and then compute the values of other nodes based on the edges. However, the root's value must be chosen such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how to choose the root's value?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value of the nodes can be represented in terms of their relations. For example, for each node, we can track a value that is a multiple of some base, and for each edge, we can track the ratio between the nodes.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's model the problem as a graph where each node's value is a multiple of some base value, and for each edge, the ratio between the nodes is fixed. However, since the product of u and v is fixed (g*l), the ratio between u and v is determined once one of them is fixed.\n\nBut how to handle the GCD constraints?\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each edge (u, v, g, l), u and v must be multiples of g, and their ratio (u/g) and (v/g) are coprime. So, if we can model the values of the nodes as g_i * x_i, where g_i is the GCD of the edge that connects them to their neighbors. Wait, no. Each node can be connected to multiple edges, each with different GCDs. So this approach may not work.\n\nHmm. Another thought: For each connected component, all nodes must be multiples of the GCDs of their edges. But since edges can have different GCDs, perhaps the nodes must be multiples of some common value.\n\nWait, but for example, if a node u is connected to two edges with different GCDs. Let's say, one edge has GCD 2 and another has GCD 3. Then u must be a multiple of both 2 and 3, hence a multiple of 6. So the node's value must be a multiple of the LCM of all the GCDs of edges connected to it.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node, the value must be a multiple of the GCD of all edges connected to it. Wait, no. Because each edge has its own GCD. For example, node u is connected to edge e1 with GCD g1 and edge e2 with GCD g2. Then, for e1, u must be a multiple of g1. For e2, u must be a multiple of g2. Therefore, u must be a multiple of LCM(g1, g2). So for each node, the value must be a multiple of the LCM of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. But how to compute that?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps during the traversal of the graph, we can track the required factors for each node.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can model the problem using a BFS or DFS approach. For each connected component, we can assign a value to a starting node, then propagate the values through the edges, checking for consistency.\n\nBut how to assign the initial value?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a connected component. Let's pick a starting node, say u. Let's assign a value to u. Then, for each edge connected to u, we can compute the value of the adjacent node.\n\nBut the problem is that the initial value of u is not known. However, for the constraints to be satisfied, the value of u must be compatible with all edges connected to it.\n\nWait, but the value of u must be such that for each edge (u, v, g, l), u is a multiple of g, and when combined with v's value, their product is g*l, and their GCD is exactly g.\n\nBut since v's value is (g*l)/u, then for that to be valid, u must divide (g*l), and v must be a multiple of g. Also, the GCD(u, v) must be exactly g.\n\nBut how can we find such a u?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value of u must be a divisor of (g*l) for each edge connected to it. However, since u is connected to multiple edges, each with their own g and l, this complicates things.\n\nThis seems challenging. Let's think of a small example. Suppose there's a single edge between u and v, with GCD 1 and LCM 3. Then, u and v must be 1 and 3 (or 3 and 1), since their product is 3, and their GCD is 1. So possible solutions are [1,3] or [3,1].\n\nIn this case, the initial value can be 1 or 3. But how to choose? Well, since the problem allows any valid solution, we can choose either.\n\nBut when there are multiple edges, how do we ensure that the choices are consistent?\n\nAnother example: suppose there are two edges. Edge 1: u-v with GCD 1 and LCM 3. Edge 2: v-w with GCD 1 and LCM 6. So, u and v must multiply to 3, and v and w must multiply to 6. Let's assume u is 1. Then v is 3. Then w must be 6/3 = 2. Now, check if the GCD of v and w is 1. GCD(3,2) is 1. Yes. So that's valid. Alternatively, if u is 3, then v is 1, and w is 6/1 = 6. GCD(1,6) is 1. Also valid. So there are multiple possible solutions.\n\nBut what if there's a cycle? Suppose three edges forming a triangle. Let's say u-v has GCD 1, LCM 6. v-w has GCD 1, LCM 6. w-u has GCD 1, LCM 6. So, each pair must multiply to 6. So u*v=6, v*w=6, w*u=6. Solving these equations: multiplying all three equations gives (u*v*w)^2 = 6^3 → u*v*w = 6^(3/2) → which is not possible. Therefore, no solution exists. Hence, the answer is NO.\n\nSo, in this case, the product constraints are not compatible, leading to no solution.\n\nSo, the approach of propagating the values via BFS or DFS, while checking for consistency, seems feasible. However, the challenge is determining the initial value of the starting node, and ensuring that all constraints are met.\n\nBut how to choose the initial value?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the relationships between nodes as ratios. Let's consider that for each edge (u, v) with GCD g and LCM l, the product u*v = g*l. Let's say that for this edge, we can express u and v as follows:\n\nu = g * a\n\nv = g * b\n\nwith a*b = l/g and GCD(a, b) = 1.\n\nNow, for each edge, a and b are coprime. So, for example, if we have a path from u to v through multiple edges, the product of the a's along the path must be compatible with the constraints.\n\nBut how to model this? Perhaps, for each node, we can track the ratio between its value and the value of the root node. But since the values are multiplicative, this could be done with a product of factors.\n\nBut perhaps we can model the problem as a graph where each node has a value that is determined relative to another node. For example, during BFS, we can assign to each node a value that is a multiple of the GCD of its edges, and track the required relations.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by union-find with weights. For each node, we can track a value relative to some root. For example, during BFS traversal, we can assign to each node a value that is a multiple of the GCD of the edges in the path from the root to that node. However, the exact value depends on the constraints of the edges.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me try to think of this in terms of variables. Suppose we have a starting node, say node A. Assign it a value of x. Then, for each neighbor connected by an edge, we can compute their value based on the edge's constraints.\n\nFor example, suppose node A is connected to node B via an edge with GCD g and LCM l. Then, A*B = g*l. So B = (g*l)/A. But since A is x, then B is (g*l)/x.\n\nBut then, for node B, any edges connected to it must also satisfy their constraints. However, this introduces dependencies. For example, if B is connected to another node C, then B*C must equal the product of the GCD and LCM of that edge.\n\nBut how do we ensure that this is possible?\n\nThis seems like a system of equations where variables are the node values. However, solving such a system for large n is not trivial.\n\nBut since the graph is connected, perhaps we can assign a value to the starting node and compute the rest, then check for consistency when we reach nodes that have already been assigned a value.\n\nSo, for example, in a BFS approach:\n\n- Start with a node u. Assign it a value. Then, for each neighbor v connected by an edge (u, v, g, l), compute v's value as (g*l)/u. Then, proceed to process v's neighbors, and so on.\n\nBut the problem is that the initial value of u is not known. How can we choose it?\n\nWait, but for the initial value of u, there may be multiple possibilities. However, the constraints of the edges connected to u may restrict the possible values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial value of u can be set to g * a, where a is a divisor of l/g. But since l/g is fixed for that edge, and a and b (the other factor) must be coprime, then a can be any divisor of l/g, and b = (l/g)/a.\n\nBut how do we choose a for the initial node?\n\nThis seems too vague. Let's think of the following approach:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Pick a starting node. Assign it a value of g * a, where a is some factor of (l/g) for the first edge connected to it. But since the starting node may have multiple edges, this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the traversal, we can assign the value of the starting node as a certain value, and then check for consistency. However, since the value of the starting node could be arbitrary (as long as it meets the constraints of the edges), but we need to find at least one possible assignment.\n\nBut how to find such a value?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value of the starting node must be a multiple of the GCD of all edges connected to it. Wait, but for each edge connected to it, the node must be a multiple of the GCD of that edge. Therefore, the value of the starting node must be a multiple of the LCM of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. So, for example, if the starting node is connected to edges with GCDs 2 and 3, then its value must be a multiple of LCM(2,3)=6.\n\nBut how to find such a value that also satisfies the product constraints of the edges?\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe for the starting node, we can assign a value that is the GCD of the edge multiplied by some factor, and then proceed.\n\nBut perhaps the key insight is that for each edge, the product of the two nodes must be equal to g * l. Therefore, if we have a tree structure, we can assign a value to the root node, then compute the values of other nodes based on their edges. However, the root's value must be chosen such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach for a connected component:\n\nAssume that the component is connected. Let's pick a starting node. Let's assign to it a value that is a multiple of the GCD of the first edge connected to it. Then, for each edge, compute the adjacent node's value. However, during traversal, if we encounter a node that has already been assigned a value, we must check whether the new computed value matches the existing one. If not, it's impossible.\n\nBut how to choose the initial value of the starting node? Because if we choose an arbitrary value, it might not satisfy the constraints of other edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial value of the starting node can be determined based on the constraints of the edges connected to it. For example, if the starting node has only one edge, then the value can be set as g * a, where a is a divisor of l/g, and then the adjacent node's value is determined. But if there are multiple edges connected to the starting node, then the value must be compatible with all of them.\n\nThis seems very complex. Perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think again about the product of the nodes. For any edge (u, v), u * v = g * l. So, if I can assign values to the nodes such that for every edge, this product holds, then the GCD condition may be automatically satisfied? No, that's not true, as discussed earlier. But perhaps if we can ensure that the product holds and that for each edge, the GCD is exactly the given g, then it's okay.\n\nBut how to ensure that the GCD is exactly the given value?\n\nLet me think: Suppose that for an edge (u, v), u * v = g * l. Also, the GCD(u, v) = g. Then, since u = g * a, v = g * b, then a and b are coprime and a*b = l/g. So, the product is satisfied, and the GCD is satisfied.\n\nBut how to ensure that when we compute u and v based on the product, their GCD is exactly g?\n\nWell, if we can ensure that when we compute u and v as per the product, their GCD is exactly g, then we are good.\n\nBut how to ensure that during the traversal?\n\nLet me think of the following scenario. Suppose I have a connected component and I assign values based on the product constraints. For example, during BFS:\n\nStart with node u, assign it a value. For each neighbor v connected via edge (u, v, g, l), compute v's value as (g*l)/u. Then, for each edge connected to v, compute the next node's value, etc.\n\nHowever, during this process, when we reach a node that has already been assigned a value, we need to check whether the computed value matches the existing one. If not, it's impossible.\n\nBut what about the GCD condition? How do we ensure that the GCD of u and v is exactly the given g?\n\nAh, this is the crux of the problem. Because even if the product is correct, the GCD may not be. For example, if u=2 and v=6, and the edge says GCD=2, LCM=6. Then product is 12 = 2*6. GCD is 2. Correct. But if u=4 and v=3, product is 12. Suppose the edge says GCD=1, LCM=12. Then it's correct. But if the edge says GCD=2, then it's incorrect.\n\nSo, during the BFS/DFS traversal, after computing the values based on the product, we need to check that the GCD of u and v is exactly the given g.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis suggests that after assigning values to nodes based on the product constraints, we need to verify that for each edge, the GCD of the two nodes equals the given g. If not, then the assignment is invalid.\n\nBut how can we ensure that during the traversal?\n\nThis seems computationally expensive, but perhaps manageable. Here's the plan:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n- Perform a BFS or DFS traversal.\n\n- Assign values to nodes based on the product constraint (u * v = g*l). For example, when visiting a node for the first time, assign it a value. Then for its neighbors, compute their value as (g*l)/current_value.\n\n- However, the initial value of the starting node is not known. How to choose it?\n\nWait, but for the first edge, the product of the two nodes is fixed. Let's take an example. Suppose the starting node is u, and it's connected to v via an edge with GCD g and LCM l. Then, u * v = g*l. So, if we assign a value to u, then v's value is determined. But how to choose u's value?\n\nBut here's the thing: u's value must be a divisor of g*l. Because v = (g*l)/u. So, u must divide g*l.\n\nBut how to choose which divisor to assign to u?\n\nThis seems like a problem. However, there's a possibility that for the connected component, the values of the nodes are uniquely determined up to a certain factor. For example, if the component is a tree, then the values are determined once we choose the value of the root node. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the values of the nodes are determined up to a multiplicative factor. For example, if we multiply all values by some constant k, then the product of u and v remains the same. But this would change the GCD and LCM.\n\nWait, no. If we multiply all node values by a constant k, then for an edge between u and v, the product u*v would become k^2 * original product. Which would not match the required product of g*l. So that approach won't work.\n\nHmm. This seems to suggest that the initial value of the root node cannot be chosen arbitrarily. It must be chosen such that for all edges in the component, the product constraint is satisfied and the GCD constraint is satisfied.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe we can find the initial value by looking at the constraints of the edges connected to the starting node.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nPick a starting node. For each edge connected to it, we can derive possible values for it. For example, if the starting node u is connected to v via edge (g, l), then u must be a divisor of g*l. But since u is connected to possibly multiple edges, the value of u must be a common divisor of all the products g_i * l_i for each edge connected to u.\n\nBut this may not be feasible. For example, if u is connected to two edges with products 6 and 12, then u must divide 6 and 12. So possible values are 1, 2, 3, 6.\n\nBut how to choose which one?\n\nThis seems like a dead end. Perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet me think back to the initial idea of modeling the problem as a graph where each node's value is determined by the edges, and during traversal, we check for consistency.\n\nLet me try to proceed with this idea, assuming that during traversal, we assign the values based on the product constraints, and then after the traversal, check all edges to see if their GCD matches the given value.\n\nBut how to handle the initial value of the starting node?\n\nPerhaps the starting node's value can be chosen as the GCD of the edge multiplied by a factor. For example, for the first edge, we can set the value of the starting node as g * a, and the adjacent node as g * b, with a*b = l/g and GCD(a,b) = 1. But how to choose a and b?\n\nSince the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can choose a=1 and b=l/g. This would satisfy the condition that a and b are coprime (assuming that l/g is an integer, which we have already checked).\n\nSo, for example, for the first edge, assign u = g * 1 = g, and v = g * (l/g) = l. Then, their product is g*l, and their GCD is g * GCD(1, l/g) = g * 1 = g. Which satisfies the conditions.\n\nSo, this seems promising. So, for the first edge, we can assign the starting node's value as g, and the adjacent node as l.\n\nThen, proceed to assign values for other nodes based on the product constraints.\n\nBut what if the starting node has multiple edges? Let's say the starting node is connected to multiple edges. For example, if the starting node u is connected to two edges: one with (g1, l1), and another with (g2, l2). In this case, the value of u must be such that:\n\nu * v1 = g1 * l1 → v1 = (g1*l1)/u\n\nu * v2 = g2 * l2 → v2 = (g2*l2)/u\n\nBut also, for each of these edges, the GCD of u and v1 must be g1, and the GCD of u and v2 must be g2.\n\nBut if we set u to be g1, then v1 = l1, and GCD(u, v1) = GCD(g1, l1). But the given GCD for that edge is g1. So this implies that GCD(g1, l1) must be equal to g1. Which means that g1 must divide l1. Which it does, since earlier we checked that l is divisible by g. So l1/g1 is an integer. So GCD(g1, l1) = g1 if and only if g1 divides l1. Which it does. So yes, GCD(g1, l1) = g1. Therefore, setting u = g1 for the first edge ensures that the GCD condition is satisfied for that edge.\n\nBut what about the other edge connected to u? If we set u = g1, then for the second edge (g2, l2), the value of u is g1. Then, the product of u and v2 is g2*l2. So v2 = (g2*l2)/u = (g2*l2)/g1. But for the GCD of u and v2 to be g2, we need that GCD(g1, (g2*l2)/g1) = g2.\n\nThis is not necessarily true. So this approach may not work for multiple edges connected to the starting node.\n\nSo, this suggests that choosing the initial value as the GCD of the first edge may not be sufficient for other edges connected to the same node.\n\nThus, this approach may not work for all cases.\n\nThis seems like a major hurdle. How to ensure that the initial value of the starting node satisfies all the constraints of its connected edges?\n\nPerhaps the problem is that the initial value of the starting node must be a common multiple of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. For example, for each edge connected to the starting node u, u must be a multiple of the GCD of that edge. Therefore, the value of u must be a multiple of the LCM of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it.\n\nBut how to find such a value?\n\nLet me think of this as follows: For the starting node u, let G be the LCM of the GCDs of all edges connected to u. Then, u must be a multiple of G. So, we can set u = G * k, where k is a positive integer. Then, for each edge connected to u with GCD g_i and LCM l_i, the value of u is G*k. Since G is a multiple of g_i, then G*k is also a multiple of g_i. So, the product of u and the adjacent node v_i is g_i * l_i. Thus, v_i = (g_i * l_i) / (G*k). \n\nBut for this to be valid, G*k must divide g_i * l_i for each edge connected to u. Since G is the LCM of the g_i's, it is divisible by each g_i. Let's say G = lcm(g_1, g_2, ..., g_k). Then, for each g_i, G is a multiple of g_i, so g_i divides G. Therefore, g_i * l_i is divisible by g_i, which is obvious. But how to ensure that G*k divides g_i * l_i?\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps this approach is not feasible.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for hints or think of other ways to model the problem.\n\nAnother idea: For each edge, the two nodes must be multiples of the GCD. Let me think of the values as being equal to the GCD multiplied by some coprime integers. For example, for edge (u, v), u = g * a, v = g * b, with GCD(a, b) = 1 and a*b = l/g.\n\nNow, if I can represent the values of the nodes in terms of these a's and b's, perhaps I can model this as a",
