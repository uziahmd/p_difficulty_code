The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is constructed in a specific way, so I need to understand the structure of such graphs.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement to make sure I get the construction rules right.\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) must be connected to k new vertices. This step has to be done at least once. So, the process is like building layers.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's model the structure.\n\nLet's consider the initial step. The first vertex is the root. Then, in the first expansion, we add k children. Now, each of those k nodes has only one connection (they are leaves). So, the next step requires adding k new nodes to each of them. So, each of those k nodes gets k new children. So, after that step, the total number of nodes is:\n\nInitial: 1\n\nAfter first expansion (level 1): 1 + k\n\nAfter second expansion (level 2): 1 + k + k*k\n\nWait, but the problem says that the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf must be done at least once. So, the minimal snowflake is when we do this once. For example, when k=4, the minimal snowflake has 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21? Wait, but the example given in the problem says that for k=4, the minimal snowflake is shown. But in the sample input, when n=13, the output is YES. Let me check that.\n\nWait, the sample input includes n=13 as a YES. Let's see: maybe for k=3, the snowflake could have 1 + 3 + 3*3 = 1+3+9=13. Oh right! So that's why n=13 is possible. So the structure is built in layers. Each time, the leaves from the previous step get k new children. And this expansion step (adding layers) must be done at least once.\n\nSo the total number of nodes depends on how many layers we have. Let's think recursively. Let's say the snowflake has m layers. The first layer is the root. Then, the second layer is the k children. Then, each of those has k children (third layer), etc. But the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the minimal case is two layers (the root, then the first expansion, then the second expansion). Wait, no: the initial step is the root. Then, the first expansion adds k children. Then, the second expansion adds k children to each of those k nodes. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But according to the example, when n=13, it's possible. 1 + 3 + 9 = 13. So yes, that's allowed.\n\nBut what if we have more layers? Like, after the second expansion, we do another expansion. For example, after the third layer, we add k children to each node in the third layer. Then the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. But this would require that the expansion step is done at least once. Wait, the problem says that the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf is done at least once. So the initial step (the first expansion) is required, and then the step of adding again (second expansion) is done once. So in the case of three layers, the expansion steps are done twice. So that's allowed.\n\nSo the general formula for the number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of expansions. But wait, how does m relate to the steps? Let me think again. The initial step is the root. Then, the first expansion adds k nodes (so m=1?), then the second expansion adds k^2 nodes (m=2?), etc. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 1. Because the expansion step must be done at least once. Wait, because the first expansion (adding k nodes) is the first step, and the second expansion (adding k^2 nodes) is the second step. So the total number of nodes is sum from i=0 to m of k^i, where m ≥ 1. Because the sum for m=1 is 1 + k. But according to the problem statement, the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf must be done at least once. So for the minimal case, when m=1, the sum is 1 + k. However, in the example given, the sample input n=6 is output as NO. Let's check. For example, if k=2, then 1 + 2 = 3. If m=2, then sum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. So for n=6, there's no k>1 that gives this sum. So the answer is NO.\n\nWait, but what about other possibilities? Because the problem says that the expansion step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) is done at least once. So the snowflake can have multiple layers. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 1. So for any n, we need to check if there exists some k>1 and m ≥1 such that n equals that sum.\n\nBut how can we check that?\n\nThe sum S = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). Because the sum of a geometric series from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1).\n\nSo for a given n, we need to check whether there exists integers k>1 and m≥1 such that (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nAlternatively, since m ≥1, m+1 is ≥2. So the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as a sum of a geometric series with ratio k>1, for some m ≥1 (so the number of terms is m+1 ≥2).\n\nBut how do we check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nLet's think about the approach. For each test case n, we need to check if there exists some k>1 and m ≥1 such that the sum S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = n.\n\nSo the problem becomes for each n, check whether there exists a pair (k, m) with k ≥2, m ≥1 such that S = n.\n\nNow, the question is how to check this efficiently.\n\nConstraints:\n\n- t is up to 1e4, and n can be up to 1e18.\n\nSo for each test case, we need an O(1) or O(log n) approach.\n\nLet me think about possible approaches.\n\nFirst, for a fixed m, we can check if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nFor example, for m=1, the sum is 1 + k = n → k = n-1. Since k must be ≥2, this implies that n-1 ≥2 → n ≥3. So for n ≥3, if n-1 is ≥2, then possible. But wait, for m=1, the sum is 1 + k, which is 1 +k. So for example, if n=3, then k=2. Which is valid. But the sample input says for n=3, the answer is NO. Wait, this contradicts the sample input. Let me check the sample input again.\n\nSample input includes n=3, output is NO. But according to this, for m=1, k=2, sum is 3. So why is the answer NO?\n\nAh, here's a mistake. The problem says that the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf must be done at least once. Wait, the initial step is adding k new vertices to the root. Then, the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf (which are the ones added in the first step) must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake has two layers. So the sum is 1 + k + k^2. Because the expansion step (adding to the leaves) is done once. So m is the number of expansions. So the initial step is the first expansion (adding k children). Then, the second expansion (adding k children to each of the first layer's nodes). So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. So the sum for m=2 expansions? Or perhaps m is the number of layers beyond the initial node?\n\nThis seems to be the crux of the problem. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the first step is adding k vertices to the root. Then, the second step (the step that must be done at least once) is adding k new vertices to each of the leaves (the k nodes added in the first step). So this step is done once. Thus, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k*k = 1 +k +k². So the sum is 1 +k +k².\n\nTherefore, the minimal snowflake requires that the expansion step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) is done once. Therefore, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. So for m=2 layers (the root, then first expansion, then second expansion). Thus, the general formula is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2? Or m ≥ something else?\n\nWait, let's model the number of layers. Let me think of the steps:\n\n- Step 0: 1 node (root)\n- Step 1: add k children to root. Now, 1 +k nodes.\n- Step 2: add k children to each of the k nodes from step 1. Now, 1 +k +k^2 nodes. This is the first expansion step (must be done once).\n- Step 3: add k children to each of the k^2 nodes from step 2. Now, total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 nodes. This would be the second expansion step.\n\nSo the expansion steps are steps 2, 3, etc. So the expansion steps must be done at least once. Which means that the total number of nodes must be at least 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2. Because the expansion steps (step 2, etc.) are done once or more. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe expansion step is the step where you take all current leaves (those with degree 1) and add k children to each. The initial step (adding k children to the root) is not considered an expansion step. The expansion step is the step that must be done at least once. So, the initial step is required, then the expansion step (adding to the leaves) must be done once. So the minimal case is 1 +k (initial step) plus k^2 (expansion step once). So the total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nBut then, if you do another expansion step (adding k children to each of the leaves of the previous step), then you get 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, etc.\n\nThus, the total number of nodes is S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2. Because m is the exponent. Wait, for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. For m=3, sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the number of expansion steps is m-1. Since the expansion steps must be done at least once, m-1 ≥1 → m ≥2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be expressed as S = sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥2 and k ≥2.\n\nSo for a given n, we need to check if there exists integers k ≥2 and m ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n.\n\nBut how can we check this?\n\nLet me think of possible approaches.\n\nFirst, for each possible m (number of terms in the sum), we can check if there exists a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut since m can be up to log_2(n), because for k=2, the sum is 2^{m+1} -1. For example, if n is 1e18, then m can be up to around 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18). So for each n, we can iterate m from 2 up to log_2(n), and for each m, find if there's a k ≥2 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n.\n\nSo the steps for each n are:\n\nFor each possible m (starting from 2 up to max possible):\n\n   compute the value of k such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n.\n\n   since sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\n   We can rearrange this equation to find k for a given m.\n\nBut solving for k is not straightforward. However, for a given m and n, we can perform a binary search on k. Because for fixed m, the sum increases as k increases.\n\nSo for each m, we can perform a binary search on k ≥2, and check if the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to find the maximum m to check?\n\nThe maximum possible m for a given n is such that for k=2, the sum is 2^{m+1} -1 ≤n. So m_max is about log2(n+1) -1. For example, for n=1e18, m_max is around 60.\n\nSo for each n, we can iterate m from 2 up to log2(n) (say, up to 60), and for each m, perform a binary search on k.\n\nIf for any m and k, the sum equals n, return YES.\n\nElse, after checking all possibilities, return NO.\n\nNow, let's think about the steps for a particular m.\n\nFor example, for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 = n. So solving for k: k^2 +k +1 =n →k^2 +k + (1-n)=0. The solution is k = [-1 ± sqrt(1 -4*(1-n))]/2. Which simplifies to sqrt(4n-3) -1 over 2. So for each m, the equation is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n. But solving for k is difficult except for small m.\n\nBut for binary search, given m, we can compute for a given k what the sum is, and compare to n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n   if n is 1: output NO (since the snowflake requires at least 1 +k +k^2, which for k≥2 is 1+2+4=7. So n=1 is not possible.)\n\n   else:\n\n      check for m from 2 up to max_m (like 60):\n\n         perform binary search on k in [2, ... upper_bound], to see if (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) ==n.\n\n         if found, return YES.\n\n      also, check for m=1? No, because m must be ≥2. Because the expansion step is done once. So m=2 corresponds to sum of 3 terms (i=0,1,2). So m is the exponent in the sum.\n\nWait, no. For m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is the sum from i=0 to m=2. So the number of terms is m+1. So for m=2, the number of terms is 3. So the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nSo for a given m, the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n. So for m ≥2, and k≥2.\n\nSo for each possible m (from 2 up to say 60), we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nNow, for each m, what is the possible range of k?\n\nThe sum for k is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n. For fixed m, the sum increases with k. So for a given m, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper limit. What's the upper limit?\n\nWell, for k ≥2, the sum is at least 1 +2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^m = 2^{m+1} -1. So if n is less than that, then no solution for this m. So for a given m, the upper limit for k can be found as follows:\n\nWe can compute the minimal sum for k=2, which is 2^{m+1} -1. If n is less than that, then for this m, no solution. Otherwise, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper bound. What's the upper bound for k?\n\nWell, the sum for k is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) = n. For k ≥2, the sum is at least 1 +k + ... +k^m. For example, when m is fixed, the sum is O(k^m). So for n being up to 1e18, the maximum possible k for a given m is roughly n^(1/m). So for binary search, the upper bound can be set to n^(1/m) +1.\n\nBut how to compute that? Well, for binary search, perhaps we can set the upper bound as n, but since for larger m, the upper bound for k is smaller, but for m=2, for example, the maximum k could be up to sqrt(n). For example, for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 =n. So k^2 ~n →k ~sqrt(n). So for binary search, we can set the upper limit as n, but in practice, it's better to compute it as something like n^(1/(m+1)) + 1.\n\nBut in code, for a given m, the upper limit can be set as something like 2e9, but since n is up to 1e18, and m can be up to 60, for m=2, the upper limit for k can be up to sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. So for each m, binary search from low=2 to high= some value, say, 1e6 or higher. Wait, but for m=2 and n=1e18, the k would be up to sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. So for binary search, we can set high to be n, but that might be too slow. However, since m is up to 60, and per test case, for each m, binary search is O(log n), and for t=1e4, it's manageable.\n\nBut let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, for each test case:\n\nif n is 1: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\n   for m in 2 to max_m:\n\n      compute the minimal possible sum for k=2. That is, (2^{m+1} -1)/(2-1) = 2^{m+1} -1.\n\n      if this value is greater than n, then for higher m, it will be even larger. So break the loop.\n\n      else:\n\n         perform binary search for k in [2, ... upper_bound] such that the sum equals n.\n\n         if found, return YES.\n\n   Also, check for m=1? No, because m must be ≥2.\n\nBut wait, what if there's a case where m=1? For example, if the expansion step is not done. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. So m must be ≥2. Hence, the code above is correct.\n\nSo, the steps for each m:\n\nCompute the minimal sum for k=2. If that's larger than n, break, since for larger m, the minimal sum would be even larger.\n\nBut for example, m increases, but for the same k, the sum increases. So for m=2, the minimal sum is 2^3 -1 =7. For m=3, the minimal sum is 2^4-1=15, etc. So once for a certain m, the minimal sum (for k=2) is larger than n, then for larger m, it will also be larger. Hence, we can break the loop.\n\nSo, for each m starting from 2 upwards, we can check if 2^{m+1} -1 <=n. If not, break.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute the sum for a given k and m, and check if it equals n.\n\nBut for large exponents, computing k^{m+1} could be problematic due to integer overflow. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large.\n\nBut during the binary search, we need to compute the sum S = (k^{m+1} -1) // (k-1). However, for large k and m, this could be expensive. Alternatively, we can compute the sum iteratively, and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nFor example, for a given k and m, compute the sum as 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. But for large m and k, this could be O(m) time. But since m is up to 60, this is acceptable.\n\nBut for binary search steps, perhaps it's better to compute the sum in a way that avoids overflow. However, in Python, there's no overflow, so it's manageable.\n\nSo, during binary search for k, for a given m, we can compute the sum as follows:\n\nsum = 0\n\ncurrent_term = 1 (k^0)\n\nfor i in 0 to m:\n\n   sum += current_term\n\n   current_term *=k\n\nBut this would be O(m) per check. For m up to 60, this is acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, compute using the formula (k^{m+1} -1) // (k-1). However, when k=1, this formula is invalid. But since in our case k≥2, this is okay.\n\nBut for very large exponents, like k=2 and m=60, k^{m+1} is 2^61 which is about 2e18. Which is manageable in Python.\n\nBut for k=1e9 and m=2, the sum is 1 +1e9 + 1e18, which is manageable.\n\nSo, for the binary search, perhaps using the formula is better. Let's think.\n\nBut in code, for a given k and m, compute the sum as (k^(m+1) -1) // (k-1). But how to compute this without overflow? Well, in Python, it's not an issue.\n\nBut for cases where k is large, and m is large, the exponentiation could be time-consuming. However, since m is up to 60, and per test case, this is manageable.\n\nSo, during the binary search for a given m, the steps are:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = ?\n\nWe can compute the upper bound for k. For example, since the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n. For k >=2, the sum is >=k^m. So k^m <=n →k <=n^(1/m). So for the upper bound, we can set high to be n^(1/m) + 1. But how to compute that in code?\n\nAlternatively, we can start with high=2, and double it until the sum for that k is larger than n. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, in code, we can set high to be something like n. But for large m, this would be very inefficient. However, for m up to 60, and n up to 1e18, even with high=1e9, the binary search would take about 30 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo, for each m:\n\n   compute the minimal sum for k=2. If it is larger than n, break.\n\n   else:\n\n      perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound (say, 2e6 or something) to see if there exists a k where the sum is equal to n.\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for k?\n\nAnother approach: for the sum to be equal to n, the sum is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) =n. Since k >=2, and m >=2.\n\nWe can note that for fixed m, the sum increases with k. So for binary search, we can find the minimal and maximal possible k.\n\nBut for binary search, we can set the initial high as n. Because for k >=2, the sum for m=2 is 1 +k +k^2. For k= n, the sum is way larger than n. So binary search between low=2 and high=n.\n\nBut for large m and n, this may take longer. However, given that m is up to 60, and for each m, binary search is O( log (n) ), and for t=1e4, this would be acceptable.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    n = input\n\n    if n ==1:\n\n        print NO\n\n    else:\n\n        found = False\n\n        for m in 2 to 60:\n\n            # compute the minimal sum for k=2\n\n            min_sum = (2^(m+1) -1) // (2-1) = 2^(m+1) -1\n\n            if min_sum >n:\n\n                break\n\n            else:\n\n                # perform binary search for k in [2, ... ] to see if sum equals n\n\n                low =2\n\n                high = ?\n\n                # for high, let's set it as n, but maybe we can find a better upper bound.\n\n                high = 2\n\n                while compute_sum(high, m) <n:\n\n                    high *=2\n\n                # now binary search between low and high\n\n                while low <= high:\n\n                    mid = (low + high) //2\n\n                    s = compute_sum(mid, m)\n\n                    if s ==n:\n\n                        found = True\n\n                        break\n\n                    elif s <n:\n\n                        low = mid +1\n\n                    else:\n\n                        high = mid -1\n\n                if found:\n\n                    break\n\n        if found:\n\n            print YES\n\n        else:\n\n            print NO\n\nBut how to compute compute_sum(k, m)?\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m):\n\n    # returns sum_{i=0}^m k^i\n\n    # which is (k^(m+1) -1) // (k-1) if k !=1.\n\n    # but in code, for k=1, it's m+1, but since k >=2, not needed here.\n\n    # but for k=1, the code would be invalid, but in our case, k >=2.\n\n    # However, for very large exponents, calculating k^(m+1) could be expensive.\n\n    # Alternatively, compute it iteratively.\n\n    # Let's compute it via the formula.\n\n    # However, in code, for k=2, m=60, k^(m+1) is 2^61 which is manageable.\n\n    # So:\n\n    numerator = pow(k, m+1) -1\n\n    denominator = k-1\n\n    return numerator // denominator\n\nBut wait, for example, when k=2 and m=2, the sum is 1+2+4=7. Using the formula (2^3 -1)/1=7, correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut for very large exponents, like m=60, and k=2, pow(2, 61) is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, pow is efficient.\n\nBut there's a problem: when m is large (like 60), and k is large, pow(k, m+1) could be a huge number, but since Python handles big integers, it's okay.\n\nBut for the binary search, when we compute the sum, if the sum is larger than n, we can break early. However, using the formula may be more efficient than the iterative approach.\n\nBut perhaps there's a problem with the formula when k is 1, but since k is ≥2, that's not a problem.\n\nBut in code, when k is 1, but since we have k ≥2, it's not needed.\n\nSo, the code for compute_sum is as above.\n\nBut there's a possibility of integer overflow in other languages, but in Python, it's not an issue.\n\nNow, let's test this approach with the sample input.\n\nSample input includes n=13. Let's see:\n\nCheck for m=2:\n\nmin_sum for k=2 is 2^3-1=7 ≤13. So proceed.\n\nbinary search for k between 2 and ... ?\n\nInitially, high starts at 2, and doubles until compute_sum(high, m) >=n.\n\nFor m=2, compute_sum(2, 2) is 7 <13. So high becomes 4. compute_sum(4, 2) is 1+4+16=21>13. So binary search between 2 and 4.\n\nmid = (2+4)//2 =3. compute_sum(3, 2) is 1+3+9=13 → equals n. So found. So returns YES.\n\nHence, for n=13, the answer is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=6. The output is NO. Let's see:\n\nCheck for m=2:\n\nmin_sum is 7>6 → break. So no solution for m=2. For m=1, which is not allowed. So no. So answer is NO.\n\nAnother sample input is n=255. Output is YES. Let's see:\n\nCheck for m=2:\n\nsum for k=2 is 7, for k=3 is 13, etc. For m=2, the maximum possible sum is when k is large. Let's see for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 =255 →k^2 +k +1 =255 →k^2 +k -254=0 →k=(-1 + sqrt(1 + 4*254))/2 → sqrt(1017) is about 31.9 → (31.9-1)/2≈15.45. So k=15: 15^2 +15 +1=225 +15+1=241 <255. k=16: 256+16+1=273>255. So no solution for m=2.\n\nCheck m=3: sum is (k^4-1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k^2 +k +1 =n=255.\n\nTry k=4: 64 + 16 +4 +1= 85 <255. k=5: 125 +25 +5 +1= 156 <255. k=6: 216 +36 +6 +1= 259>255. So no. k=5.5? Not integer. So no solution for m=3.\n\nCheck m=4: sum is (k^5-1)/(k-1) =k^4 +k^3 +k^2 +k +1. For k=3: 81 +27 +9 +3 +1= 121 <255. k=4: 256 +64 +16 +4 +1= 341>255. So between k=3 and 4. No solution.\n\nCheck m=7: For example, let's think about m=7, but perhaps there's a better way. Wait, what about m=7 and k=2? The sum is 2^8 -1 = 255. Yes! So for m=7, the sum is (2^8 -1)/(2-1) =255. Which equals n=255. So yes. So for m=7, k=2. So the answer is YES.\n\nThus, the code would find this.\n\nSo, the code would check for m=7, which is allowed. For m=7, the minimal sum for k=2 is 2^8 -1=255. Which equals n. So the code would find it.\n\nThus, the code would return YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=1000000000000000000 (1e18). The output is NO. Let's see why.\n\nWe need to check for any m and k such that sum is 1e18.\n\nBut let's see for m=2: 1 +k +k^2 =1e18. Solving for k: k^2 +k +1 =1e18. Approximately k^2 ≈1e18 →k≈1e9. Let's check if 1e9 squared is 1e18. 1e9^2 is 1e18. So 1e9^2 + 1e9 +1 = 1e18 + 1e9 +1 which is larger than 1e18. So for k=1e9-1, the sum would be (k^2 +k +1) which is less than 1e18. So no solution for m=2.\n\nFor m=3, sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 =n. For k=1e6, sum is 1 +1e6 + 1e12 + 1e18, which is way larger than 1e18. So perhaps for some k and m, but not sure.\n\nBut the sample output says NO for this case. So perhaps there is no such k and m.\n\nBut how to confirm that? Well, the code would check all possible m and k, and if none found, return NO.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these possibilities.\n\nNow, considering edge cases:\n\nn=7: which is 2^3 -1. For m=2 (sum is 1 +2 +4 =7). So answer is YES.\n\nn=1: output NO.\n\nn=3: check m=2. sum for k=2 is 7>3. So no. m=2 is the first to check. So no. Hence output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=15. For m=2, 1 +k +k² =15. k² +k -14=0. Discriminant 1 +56=57. sqrt(57) ≈7.55. So k=( -1 +7.55)/2 ≈3.27. So k=3: 1+3+9=13 <15. k=4: 1+4+16=21>15. So no solution. For m=3, sum is (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k^2 +k +1 =15. Try k=2: 8+4+2+1=15 → yes. So for m=3, k=2. So answer is YES. Hence, for n=15, output YES. Which matches the sample input (the sample input includes n=15 as YES).\n\nNow, the code needs to check for m=3.\n\nSo, for m=3, the minimal sum is 2^4-1=15. Which equals n=15. So the code would find this.\n\nNow, the code for m in 2 to 60, and for each m, check if the minimal sum is <=n.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nImplementing this:\n\nBut first, note that for m, the maximum value is such that for k=2, the sum is 2^{m+1} -1 <= 1e18. Let's compute m_max:\n\nFor 2^{m+1} -1 <=1e18 → 2^{m+1} <=1e18 +1 → m+1 <= log2(1e18). Since log2(1e18) is about 60 (since 2^60 is ~1.15e18). So m+1 can be up to 60, so m can be up to 59. So for the code",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can be constructed according to specific rules. The snowflake graph is built in layers, starting from a single vertex and expanding iteratively. The key challenge is to check if there exists any valid configuration of layers and branching factor `k` (where `k > 1`) that results in exactly `n` vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding `k` new vertices to each leaf node. This expansion must be done at least once. The total number of vertices after `m` expansions (with `m >= 2`) can be represented as the sum of a geometric series: $ S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m $.\n\n2. **Geometric Series Check**: For a given `n`, we need to check if there exists integers `k > 1` and `m >= 2` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`. The formula for the sum of the first `m+1` terms of a geometric series with ratio `k` is $ S = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1} $.\n\n3. **Iterative Check with Binary Search**: For each possible value of `m` (from 2 up to a maximum feasible value based on the constraints), we use binary search to determine if there exists a valid `k` such that the sum equals `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m):\n    # Compute the sum of 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n    # Using the formula (k^(m+1) - 1) // (k - 1)\n    return (pow(k, m + 1) - 1) // (k - 1)\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_m = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18, so m+1 up to 60\n    for m in range(2, max_m + 1):\n        # Check if the minimal sum for k=2 is <= n\n        min_sum = (pow(2, m + 1) - 1) // (2 - 1)\n        if min_sum > n:\n            break\n        # Binary search for k in [2, ...]\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find an upper bound for high\n        while compute_sum(high, m) < n:\n            high *= 2\n        # Now binary search between low and high\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, m)\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Geometric Series Calculation**: The function `compute_sum` calculates the sum of the geometric series using the formula derived from the properties of geometric progressions.\n3. **Binary Search for Valid `k`**: For each possible number of expansions `m`, we use binary search to check if there exists a valid `k` such that the sum of the series equals `n`.\n4. **Edge Cases Handling**: Special handling for `n = 1` is included since no valid snowflake can be formed with just one vertex.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations within the constraints, ensuring correctness and performance even for very large values of `n`.",
