The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure.\n\nThe construction rules are:\n\nStart with one vertex. Then, add k new vertices connected to it. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so the leaves) get k new vertices connected to them. And this step must be done at least once. So the process involves multiple layers of adding nodes.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The initial step is 1 node. Then, after first expansion, we have 1 + k nodes. Then, each of the k leaves (which are connected to the root) gets k new nodes. So each of those k nodes adds k children. So the total number of nodes after that would be 1 + k + k*k. But wait, the second step is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do the expansion once. Wait, the problem says that the step of adding k new vertices to each leaf must be done at least once. So the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the next step is to add k children to each of the leaves. So for example, for k=4, the minimal snowflake would be 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1+4+16=21? But the example input says that for n=6, the answer is NO. Wait, let's look at the sample input and output.\n\nIn the sample input, for example, n=6 gives output NO. Let's see why. Let's think about possible k values.\n\nLet me think about the structure. The snowflake can be built in different levels. Let's model the number of nodes as a function of the number of steps.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that the snowflake is built in m layers. The first layer is the root. Then, each step adds layers. For example:\n\n- Level 0: 1 node (root)\n- Level 1: k nodes (each connected to root)\n- Level 2: each node in level 1 adds k nodes. So total k * k nodes.\n- Level 3: each node in level 2 adds k nodes. So total k^3 nodes.\n\nBut according to the rules, the step of adding to the leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have two layers: level 0 (1), level 1 (k). But then, the step of adding to the leaves (level 1) is done once. So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k * k? Or wait, maybe the process is:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to it. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (i.e., the leaves) is connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. So the first step is adding k children to the root. Then, the second step is adding k children to each of those k leaves. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k*k. But if we do another step, then each of the k^2 leaves would get k children, adding k^3 nodes. So the total becomes 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nBut how many times can this step be done? It seems that the process can be done any number of times, as long as it's done at least once. So the snowflake can have varying numbers of layers.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the step is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do it once. So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2. For example, when k=2, that would be 1+2+4=7 nodes. But maybe there are other possibilities?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake can be built with different numbers of steps. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think about the process:\n\nThe initial step is creating the root. Then, the first expansion is adding k children to the root. Then, the next expansion is adding k children to each of the leaves (which are the nodes from the first expansion). Then, again, each leaf (from the previous step) gets k children. And so on. Each time, the expansion is applied to all leaves of the previous step.\n\nSo the number of nodes after m expansions (with m ≥ 1) is:\n\nTotal nodes = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m ?\n\nNo, because each expansion step adds k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step. Let me think:\n\n- After 0 expansions (only the root): 1 node.\n\n- After 1 expansion (adding k children to root): 1 + k nodes.\n\n- Then, the next expansion (step 1) adds k children to each of the k leaves. So adding k * k nodes. Total becomes 1 + k + k^2.\n\n- Next expansion (step 2) adds k children to each of the k^2 leaves. So adding k^3 nodes. Total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nSo for m expansions (with m ≥1), the total is sum_{i=0}^m k^i ?\n\nWait, sum from i=0 to m of k^i equals (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But the problem says that the step must be done at least once. So the first expansion is required. So the minimal number of expansions is 1. Which gives sum from i=0 to 1 of k^i = 1 +k. But that's not enough. Because according to the problem statement, the step (adding to leaves) must be done at least once. So the first expansion is adding k children to the root. Then, the second step is adding k children to each of those leaves. So the minimal is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the process. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh, so the first step is adding k children to the root. Then, the step (connecting each leaf to k new vertices) must be done at least once. So that step is done once. So after the initial step (adding k children to the root), we must perform that step once. Which would be adding k children to each of the k leaves. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k * k = 1 + k + k².\n\nSo the minimal snowflake is when m=2 (the initial step plus one expansion step). Therefore, for any valid snowflake, the number of nodes must be of the form 1 + k + k² + ... + k^m where m ≥ 2? Or maybe m ≥ 1? Let me think again.\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the step (adding k children to each leaf) is done at least once. So that step is done once. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k². So the minimal possible is 1 +k +k². However, the problem allows for doing that step more than once. For example, after adding the second layer (k² nodes), you can add another layer (each of those k² nodes gets k children, adding k³ nodes). So the total would be 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on.\n\nSo for any snowflake, the total number of nodes must be equal to 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 2 (since the expansion step must be done at least once). Wait, no. Let's think about m being the number of expansion steps. The initial step is adding k children. Then, each expansion step adds another layer. So the initial step is required, and then the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the total number of layers is 1 (initial) + m (expansion steps). So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i, but with m ≥1?\n\nWait, maybe I need to model the total number of nodes as follows:\n\nThe process starts with one node. Then, the first expansion is adding k children (so total 1 +k). Then, the expansion step is done once. So that's adding k^2 nodes (total 1 +k +k²). Then, if we do another expansion step, we add k^3 nodes (total 1 +k +k² +k³), etc.\n\nSo for the snowflake to be valid, the number of nodes n must be equal to sum_{i=0}^d k^i, where d ≥ 2. Because the expansion step is done at least once. Because the sum for d=1 is 1 +k, which would be the case where the expansion step (adding to leaves) was not done. So that's invalid. So the allowed values of d are ≥2. Therefore, n must be equal to (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) for some k>1 and d≥2.\n\nWait, but the sum from i=0 to d of k^i is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). So for example, when d=2, it's (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k² +k +1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written in the form (k^{m} -1)/(k-1), where m ≥3 (since d+1 = m, and d ≥2 → m ≥3). Because m is the exponent in the formula. For example, for m=3, it's (k^3-1)/(k-1) = k² +k +1. Which is the minimal case.\n\nBut wait, what if the expansion steps are done more than once? For example, if m=4, then the sum is (k^4 -1)/(k-1) = k^3 +k^2 +k +1. Which would correspond to adding three expansion steps. So the snowflake can be constructed in various ways depending on the number of expansion steps.\n\nSo the problem now is: for given n, does there exist integers k>1 and m ≥3 such that n = (k^m -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut wait, this seems like a very restrictive condition. Let's check the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nFor example, n=13. Output is YES. Let's see. Let's compute for m=3. So (k^3-1)/(k-1) = k² +k +1 = 13. Solving k² +k +1 =13 → k² +k -12=0. The solutions are k = [-1 ± sqrt(1 +48)]/2 → sqrt(49)=7 → ( -1 +7)/2 = 3. So k=3. So yes, 3² +3 +1 = 13. So answer is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=6. Output is NO. Let's check. For m=3, solving k² +k +1 =6 → k² +k -5=0 → discriminant 1+20=21 → sqrt(21) is irrational. So no integer solution. For m=4, (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k^2 +k +1 =6. Trying k=2: 8+4+2+1=15>6. k=1 not allowed. So no solution. So answer is NO.\n\nAnother sample input is n=255. Output is YES. Let's see. For example, 255 is 2^8 -1. So (2^8 -1)/(2-1) =255. Which corresponds to m=8. So yes, since m ≥3.\n\nAnother sample input is n=15. Output is YES. Let's see. For m=3, k^2 +k +1=15 → k² +k -14=0 → discriminant 1+56=57, not square. For m=4, k^3 +k^2 +k +1 =15. Try k=2: 8+4+2+1=15. Yes! So m=4, k=2. So answer is YES.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be expressed as (k^m -1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and m≥3.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find for a given n, whether there exists such k and m.\n\nBut how do we check this efficiently, given that n can be up to 1e18?\n\nFirst, note that for each possible m ≥3, we can check if there exists a k>1 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut since m can be up to log_2(n) (since for k=2, the minimal value for m is 3, which is 2^3-1/(2-1) = 7, but for larger m, the value grows exponentially), the number of possible m's to check is limited.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\nFor each test case n, iterate over all possible m ≥3 (up to log_2(n)), and for each m, check if there exists an integer k>1 such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nIf for any m and k, this holds, then return YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about how to find for a given m, whether there exists a k such that the equation holds.\n\nThe equation is:\n\n(k^m -1)/(k-1) =n → sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i =n.\n\nSo for each m, we can perform a binary search on k. Because for fixed m, the function f(k) = sum_{i=0}^{m-1} k^i is strictly increasing in k. So for each m, we can binary search k in the range [2, ... upper_bound], and check if the sum equals n.\n\nBut what is the upper bound for k for a given m?\n\nFor example, for a given m, the minimal possible value of the sum is when k=2: sum is 2^m-1/(2-1) = 2^m -1. Wait, no. Wait, sum_{i=0}^{m-1} 2^i = 2^m -1. So for the sum to be equal to n, we must have 2^m -1 ≤n. So for a given m, if 2^m -1 >n, then there's no possible k for that m. So for each m, the maximum possible m is such that 2^m -1 ≤n. Which for n up to 1e18, m can be up to around 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18).\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem would be:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- If n is 1, output NO (since the minimal snowflake requires m≥3, which would be 2^3-1=7, but for m=3, k=2 gives 7. But n=1 is not possible.)\n\nWait, but the problem says that the initial vertex is present. So for the snowflake to exist, the number of nodes must be at least 1 +k +k^2. But k must be >1. So for k=2, the minimal is 1+2+4=7. So for n <7, the answer is NO. But in the sample input, n=1 gives output NO, n=2 gives NO, etc.\n\nSo the first thing to check is whether n is less than 7. If yes, then output NO.\n\nOtherwise, for each possible m ≥3 (up to log_2(n)+1), check if there exists a k>1 such that sum_{i=0}^{m-1}k^i =n.\n\nBut how to find m?\n\nFor example, for n=7, m=3 and k=2: sum is 1+2+4=7. So yes.\n\nSo for each possible m starting from 3 up to log_2(n)+1 (since for k=2, the sum for m steps is 2^m -1. So for m steps, 2^m -1 ≤n → m ≤ log2(n+1)).\n\nSo for each m from 3 to up to 60 (since 2^60 is 1e18), we can check.\n\nNow, for each m, how to check if there exists a k>1 such that sum_{i=0}^{m-1}k^i =n.\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently for a given k and m?\n\nWell, the sum is (k^m -1)/(k-1). So for a given m and k, compute that and see if it equals n. However, for large m and k, this can be computationally intensive. But since m is small (up to 60), and k is up to something like n^(1/(m-1)) (since sum is k^{m-1} + ... +1 ≥k^{m-1} ), so for each m, the maximum possible k is n^(1/(m-1)).\n\nBut how to find k for a given m?\n\nWe can perform a binary search on k. For each m, the lower bound is 2, upper bound can be found as follows:\n\nSince sum_{i=0}^{m-1}k^i =n → the sum is at least k^{m-1} (since all terms are positive). So k^{m-1} ≤n → k ≤n^(1/(m-1)).\n\nSo for binary search, the upper bound can be set to n^(1/(m-1)) +1, but since n can be up to 1e18, and m can be up to 60, this is manageable.\n\nBut how to compute the sum without overflow? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's not an issue.\n\nBut for large m and k, even calculating the sum might take O(m) time, which is acceptable given that m is up to 60 and t is 1e4.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nif n < 7 → output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nfor m in 3 to max_m (where max_m is up to 60):\n\n   compute the possible k using binary search between 2 and upper_bound.\n\n   for each m, perform binary search on k in [2, ... upper_bound], and check if the sum equals n.\n\n   if found, return YES.\n\nIf none of the m's work, return NO.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and m?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m and k, compute the sum as (k^m -1)//(k-1). But for large exponents, this can be computed with pow(k, m) but in Python, pow is efficient.\n\nBut for m up to 60, even for k up to 1e18, pow(k, m) would be manageable? Well, for k=2 and m=60, it's 2^60 which is about 1e18, which is manageable.\n\nBut for m=60 and k=1e9, pow(k, m) is way too big. However, since the sum is (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n, and n is up to 1e18, we can find that for a given m, the upper bound for k is such that (k^m -1)/(k-1) ≤n. For example, for m=3, the sum is k^2 +k +1. So solving for k^2 +k +1 ≤n → k is up to sqrt(n). So for binary search, the upper bound for k can be set as n^(1/(m-1)) +1, but for m=3, it's n^(1/2), which is manageable.\n\nBut during binary search, for a given k and m, we can compute the sum and check if it's equal to n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum without overflowing? Well, in Python, it's not a problem. However, for very large m and k, the sum may be very big. But since we are checking whether it's equal to n, which is up to 1e18, we can compute the sum and compare.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and m?\n\nAn alternative approach is to compute the sum iteratively. For example, start with 1 (the term for i=0), then multiply by k and add 1 for each term. For m terms. For example, for m=3, sum is 1 +k +k^2. So:\n\nsum = 0\n\ncurrent = 1\n\nfor i in 0..m-1:\n\n   sum += current\n\n   current *=k\n\nBut this is O(m) per check. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut for m up to 60, and per test case, for each m up to 60, and binary search steps (say 60 steps per m), the total steps would be t * 60 * 60 * 60 = 1e4 * 60^3 = 1e4 * 2.16e5 = 2.16e9 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nWait, that's impossible. So we need a better way.\n\nWait, but for each m, the maximum number of possible m's is about 60. For each m, binary search on k. Let's think about the binary search steps. For each m, the binary search would take O(log (upper_bound)) steps. For example, for m=3, upper_bound is sqrt(n). For n up to 1e18, sqrt(n) is 1e9. So log2(1e9) is about 30 steps. So per m, 30 steps. For 60 m's, 60*30= 1800 steps per test case. For t=1e4, that's 1.8e7 steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut for each binary search step, computing the sum for a given k and m is O(m) steps. So per binary search step, O(m) steps. So total per test case is O(60 * 30 * 60) = 108,000 steps. For 1e4 test cases, that's 1e4 * 1e5 = 1e9 steps. Which is way too slow for Python. So this approach may not be feasible for the time constraints.\n\nAlternative idea: For each m, compute the value of k via mathematical methods, instead of binary search.\n\nFor example, for a given m, the equation is (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n → k^{m} -1 =n(k-1) → k^m -n*k + (n-1) =0.\n\nBut solving this equation for k is difficult. However, for fixed m, we can approximate k.\n\nNote that for m ≥3, the function f(k) = (k^m -1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing in k. So for each m, there can be at most one k that satisfies the equation.\n\nSo for each m, we can compute the value of k by finding the integer solution.\n\nBut how to compute this k?\n\nWe can use Newton-Raphson method or binary search.\n\nBut binary search is the way to go, but with the O(m) per check.\n\nBut maybe there's a way to compute the sum without O(m) steps. Let's think.\n\nFor example, for a given k and m, the sum is (k^m -1)/(k-1). So for a given m and k, we can compute this directly. But for large exponents, this could be expensive. However, in Python, exponentiation is optimized, and for m up to 60, even for large k, it's manageable.\n\nWait, let's think: For a given k and m, compute k^m. Then compute (k^m -1) divided by (k-1). However, division may be a problem. But since we know that the sum is an integer (because it's the sum of integers), we can compute it as (k^m -1) // (k-1).\n\nBut how to compute this in Python?\n\nYes, for example, if k is 2 and m is 3, (2^3 -1)/(2-1) =7, which is correct.\n\nSo for a given k and m, the sum can be computed as (pow(k, m) -1) // (k-1).\n\nBut how to handle cases where k=1? Well, in our problem, k>1, so k-1 is at least 1.\n\nSo for a given m, the binary search for k can proceed as follows:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = upper_bound (some value)\n\nfor each mid in low to high:\n\ncompute s = (mid^m -1) // (mid -1)\n\nif s ==n → return True\n\nif s <n → need to increase mid (since function is increasing)\n\nelse → decrease mid.\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for high?\n\nFor example, for a given m, the minimal value of the sum for k=2 is (2^m -1)/(2-1) =2^m -1. So if n < 2^m -1, then no solution for this m. So for a given m, if 2^m -1 >n → skip this m.\n\nElse, the upper bound for k can be found as follows: since for k, the sum is (k^m -1)/(k-1) ≥k^{m-1} (since the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m-1} ≥k^{m-1}).\n\nSo k^{m-1} ≤n →k ≤n^{1/(m-1)}.\n\nThus, the upper bound for k can be set as n^{1/(m-1)} +1. But how to compute this in Python?\n\nWe can compute it as int(n ** (1/(m-1))) + 2. But for large exponents, this can be done with math.pow or using binary search.\n\nBut for the purposes of binary search, perhaps we can set high to be n. Because for m ≥3, the sum for k=2 is 2^m -1. For example, if m=3, then sum is 7. For larger m, the sum increases. So if n is larger than 2^m-1, then k can be up to something. But for binary search, setting high to n is acceptable, but may be inefficient. However, considering that for m ≥3, and for k ≥2, the sum is at least 1 +2 + 2^2 + ... +2^{m-1} = 2^m -1. So if n is smaller than that, then no solution. Else, for k, the maximum possible is such that the sum is n. Since the sum is (k^m -1)/(k-1) =n. For k ≥2, the sum increases with k. For example, when k increases, the sum increases. So for a given m, the maximum possible k can be found by solving (k^m -1)/(k-1) ≤n. But since we don't know, perhaps setting high to n is safe. However, for m=3, the sum is k^2 +k +1. For this to be ≤n, k^2 ≤n → k ≤sqrt(n). So high can be set as sqrt(n) + 1. Similarly, for m=4, k^3 +k^2 +k +1 ≤n →k^3 ≤n →k ≤ cube root of n. So for each m, the upper bound can be set as n^(1/(m-1)) +1. But how to compute this in Python?\n\nWe can compute it as:\n\nupper_k = int(n ** (1.0 / (m-1))) + 2\n\nBut since in Python, exponentiating with fractional exponents can be imprecise, perhaps using binary search to find the upper bound is better. However, for the purposes of binary search, perhaps setting high to n is acceptable, even though it may be larger than necessary. Because for each m, the binary search steps are limited.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nif n < 7 → output NO.\n\nelse:\n\nfor m in 3 to max_m:\n\n   if 2^m -1 >n → skip (since for k=2, sum is already larger than n)\n\n   else:\n\n      low =2\n\n      high = ?\n\n      compute high as something like n^(1/(m-1)) + 2\n\n      perform binary search between low and high for k.\n\n      during binary search, for each mid, compute s = (mid^m -1) // (mid-1)\n\n      compare with n.\n\n      if found, return YES.\n\nSo for example, for m=3:\n\nthe sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k^2 +k +1.\n\nSo for n=13, k=3 gives 9+3+1=13.\n\nSo during binary search, for m=3, the code will find this.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute (mid^m -1) // (mid-1) efficiently.\n\nBut in Python, pow(mid, m) can be computed quickly.\n\nBut for m up to 60 and mid up to 1e9, pow(mid, m) can be a very large number. However, since n is up to 1e18, the sum (k^m -1)/(k-1) must be equal to n. So for example, if m=3 and k=1e5, the sum is 1e10 + 1e5 +1 which is way larger than 1e18. Wait, no. For m=3, sum is k^2 +k +1. So for k=1e6, sum is 1e12 + ... which is larger than 1e18 for k=1e9. So for m=3, the upper bound for k is sqrt(n). So for n=1e18, it's up to 1e9. So pow(k, m) for k=1e9 and m=3 is 1e27, which is way larger than n. However, during the binary search, when we compute (k^m -1) // (k-1), which is supposed to be equal to n, but if during the computation, the value exceeds n, then we can break early.\n\nBut how to avoid overflow? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem. However, for very large exponents, the calculation may take time. So perhaps, during the calculation of the sum, we can check whether it exceeds n and break early.\n\nBut for the purpose of checking equality, perhaps it's better to compute the sum as follows:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m):\n\n    if k == 1:\n\n        return m  # but k>1\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n\n        total += current\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nBut for m=60, this is 60 iterations. For each binary search step, it's manageable.\n\nBut for large m and k, this may be slow. However, given that m is up to 60, and per test case, the number of steps is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum using the formula (k^m -1) // (k-1). But for this, we need to compute k^m, which could be very big. However, in Python, even for k=1e9 and m=60, pow(k, m) is 1e540, which is a very big number. However, for the purposes of checking equality with n (up to 1e18), perhaps we can compute it and compare. But for cases where k is larger than necessary, the sum would be way bigger than n, which would allow us to adjust the binary search.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps using the formula is better. Let's think: for example, for m=3, (k^3 -1) // (k-1) =k^2 +k +1. So it's the same as the iterative approach.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps using the formula is faster than the loop. Let me think:\n\nIn Python, pow(k, m) is optimized, and for small exponents, it's fast. So for each mid and m, compute the formula.\n\nBut how to compute it safely?\n\nFor example:\n\ndef check(k, m, n):\n\n    if k ==1:\n\n        return m ==n\n\n    numerator = pow(k, m) -1\n\n    denominator = k-1\n\n    return numerator // denominator ==n\n\nBut this is only correct if (k^m -1) is divisible by (k-1), which it is. Because (k^m -1) = (k-1)(k^{m-1} + k^{m-2} + ... +1). So yes, the division is exact.\n\nBut for large exponents, the pow(k, m) could be very big, but in Python, it's handled.\n\nBut for cases where k is large and m is large, even pow(k, m) could be computationally expensive. However, given that m is up to 60, and per test case, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps for some cases, even the formula approach is not feasible. For example, when k is 1e9 and m is 60, pow(k, m) is 1e540, which is a very big number. However, in practice, during binary search, for such cases, the computed sum would be way larger than n, and thus the code would adjust the binary search accordingly.\n\nBut given that n is up to 1e18, for m=3 and k=1e9, the sum is 1e18 + 1e9 +1 which is way larger than n. So during binary search, once the code computes that the sum is larger than n, it would adjust the high accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute the sum without actually computing pow(k, m) which could be huge?\n\nAlternative approach: compute the sum incrementally, and stop early if it exceeds n. For example, during the iterative approach, we can compute the sum step by step and if at any point the sum exceeds n, we can return early.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, m, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return total\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total\n\nThen, during binary search, for a given mid, compute the sum and compare to n. If it returns a value greater than n, then we know that mid is too big.\n\nThis approach avoids computing very large exponents and allows for early termination. This is probably more efficient for large k and m.\n\nSo this seems better. Let's implement this.\n\nSo the code for checking is:\n\ndef is_valid(k, m, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(m):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return False\n\n        current *=k\n\n    return total ==n\n\nThis function returns True if the sum equals n, False otherwise.\n\nThis is O(m) per check, but with early termination. For example, if during the loop, the total exceeds n, it returns False immediately.\n\nThis is better than computing the full sum, especially for cases where the sum exceeds n early.\n\nNow, the code outline for each test case is:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    n = ... \n\n    if n <7:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        continue\n\n    found = False\n\n    max_m = floor( log2(n) ) + 1 \n\n    for m in 3 to max_m:\n\n        # Check if for this m, there exists a k>1 such that sum is n.\n\n        # First, check if for k=2, the sum is <=n.\n\n        # sum for k=2 is 2^m -1.\n\n        # if 2^m -1 >n → skip this m.\n\n        # else, proceed with binary search for k.\n\n        # compute 2^m -1:\n\n        # but for m up to 60, 2^m can be computed as 1 << m.\n\n        # but for m up to 60, 2^m is 1e18 when m=60.\n\n        # So for m up to 60, compute 2^m -1.\n\n        # if this is larger than n, skip.\n\n        min_sum_for_k2 = (1 << m) -1 \n\n        if min_sum_for_k2 >n:\n\n            continue\n\n        # Now, find k such that sum is n.\n\n        # Binary search for k between 2 and upper_bound.\n\n        # upper_bound can be estimated as n^(1/(",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can be constructed based on specific rules. The snowflake graph is built in layers, starting from a single vertex and expanding iteratively. The challenge is to check if there exists any valid configuration of layers and branching factors that results in exactly `n` vertices.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands iteratively. Each expansion step adds `k` new vertices to each leaf node. The total number of vertices after `m` expansions can be represented as the sum of a geometric series: $ \\frac{k^m - 1}{k - 1} $ for some integer `k > 1` and `m ≥ 3`.\n\n2. **Constraints Check**: For small values of `n` (less than 7), it's impossible to form a valid snowflake graph, so we immediately return \"NO\".\n\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Layers**: For each possible number of layers `m` (starting from 3 up to a reasonable upper bound based on logarithmic constraints), check if there exists a valid branching factor `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n4. **Binary Search for Valid `k`**: For each `m`, perform a binary search on possible values of `k` to check if the geometric series sum equals `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_valid(k, m, n):\n    total = 0\n    current = 1\n    for _ in range(m):\n        total += current\n        if total > n:\n            return False\n        current *= k\n    return total == n\n\ndef solve():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    \n    for n in cases:\n        if n < 7:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            continue\n        found = False\n        max_m = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18\n        for m in range(3, max_m + 1):\n            # Check if for k=2, the sum is <= n\n            # Compute 2^m -1\n            min_sum = (1 << m) -
