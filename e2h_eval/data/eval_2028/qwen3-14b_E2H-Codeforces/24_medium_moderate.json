She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, Luba has n tabs open, numbered 1 to n from left to right. The mouse is at position pos. She needs to close all tabs except those in [l, r]. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to do this. Each second, she can move left or right (but within the current a and b, which are the min and max of the unclosed tabs), or close tabs to the left or right of the current position.\n\nHmm. So the challenge is to figure out the optimal sequence of moves and closes to minimize time.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. The key is that closing tabs can be done in one step, but only when the cursor is at a certain position. For example, if she wants to close all tabs to the left, she needs to be at the leftmost tab (or maybe not? Wait, the description says that when she is at tab i, she can close all tabs from a to i-1. So, a is the current min of the unclosed tabs, and b is the current max. So, for example, if she's in a situation where the current active tabs are from a to b, then when she is at i, she can close all tabs left of i (i.e., from a to i-1) or all tabs right of i (i+1 to b). So closing those would change a or b accordingly.\n\nBut how does this affect the steps needed?\n\nThe problem is to find the minimal steps to reach a state where all tabs outside [l, r] are closed. So, the final state is that a = l and b = r. So, we need to get there through a series of moves and closes.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases.\n\nFirst, check if the current [l, r] is already the entire set of tabs. If l=1 and r=n, then nothing to do. So output 0. But the input constraints say that l and r can be anything between 1 and n. So that's a possible edge case.\n\nAnother case: if the initial position is already within [l, r], and all tabs outside are to be closed. But how?\n\nBut the problem is that the initial a and b are 1 and n. So, the process of closing tabs will involve moving the cursor and closing.\n\nLet me think about the steps needed. For example, in the first sample input:\n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The desired state is to have tabs 2,3,4 open. So the initial a is 1, b is 6. She needs to close tabs 1,5,6.\n\nIn the sample solution, she moves to tab 2 (from 3, which takes 1 second?), then closes all tabs to the left (which would close tab 1). Then moves to 3, then to 4, then closes all to the right (tabs 5 and 6). Let me count the steps:\n\nMove from 3 to 2: 1 sec. Then close left: 1 sec. Then move to 3 (from 2, 1 sec?), then move to 4 (another 1 sec?), then close right (1 sec). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the idea is that each move is 1 second, each close is 1 second. So the steps are a combination of moving and closing.\n\nThe problem is to find the minimal steps.\n\nSo, what's the general approach here?\n\nWe need to find the minimal steps to close all tabs outside [l, r]. Let's consider the positions that need to be closed.\n\nThere are two regions to close: left of l (if any), and right of r (if any). So, for example, if l > 1, then we need to close tabs from 1 to l-1. Similarly for r < n.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nLet me think about the two possibilities: closing the left part first, then the right, or vice versa. Or maybe some other way.\n\nBut the order may affect the steps. For example, if you need to close both left and right parts, then you need to move to the appropriate positions to perform the close operations.\n\nLet me think about the necessary steps for each part.\n\nFor the left part (tabs 1 to l-1):\n\nTo close these, we need to be at position l (since when you are at position l, the a is 1 (initially) and the close operation would close all tabs from a to i-1, which is 1 to l-1. But wait, after closing, the new a becomes l.\n\nSimilarly, for the right part (tabs r+1 to n), you need to be at position r, and close all to the right.\n\nBut how do you get to those positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe you can close the left and right parts in different orders. For example, if you need to close both left and right parts, perhaps you can do it in two steps: move to the leftmost position (l) and close left, then move to the rightmost (r) and close right. Or the other way around.\n\nBut the movement steps depend on the initial position.\n\nWait, but the initial position is pos. So, let's think about the steps required for each scenario.\n\nCase 1: No tabs to close on the left (l=1) and no tabs to close on the right (r=n). Then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: Only left tabs to close. So, need to close all tabs left of l (which is 1 to l-1). How?\n\nTo close them, you need to be at position l. Then, close all tabs to the left. So steps needed: move from pos to l, then close (one second). But how many steps to move?\n\nThe movement steps from pos to l is |pos - l|. But wait, during movement, the a and b are changing? No, because when you are moving, you haven't closed any tabs yet. Because closing is done after moving.\n\nWait, initially, the a is 1, b is n. So during movement steps, the cursor can move freely between 1 and n. So moving from pos to l takes |pos - l| steps. Then, closing takes 1 step. So total steps for left part: |pos - l| + 1.\n\nBut if you also have to close the right part, then after closing the left part, the a becomes l. Then, moving to r requires steps from l to r. Then closing right part (1 step). So total steps would be (steps to move to l) + 1 (close left) + (steps to move from l to r) + 1 (close right). But maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe you can first close the right part, then the left. For example, move to r, close right (steps |pos - r| + 1), then move to l (steps |r - l|) and close left (1 step). So total steps |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1.\n\nWhich is better depends on which order gives a smaller sum.\n\nBut perhaps there's an optimal way. Let's think about the two options:\n\nOption A: Close left first, then right.\n\nTime: (move to l) + 1 + (move from l to r) + 1.\n\nOption B: Close right first, then left.\n\nTime: (move to r) + 1 + (move from r to l) + 1.\n\nBut what's the minimal between these two options?\n\nBut maybe there's another option. For example, after closing left, the a is l, but when moving to r, you can move directly from l to r, since the a and b are now l and n (assuming that we didn't close the right part yet). Wait, but when you close the left part, the a becomes l, but the right part is still open. So the b is n. So movement is allowed between l and n. So moving from l to r is allowed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a scenario where you can close both left and right in one step. For example, if the current position is already in the [l, r] range. For instance, if you are at position l, and you can close all tabs to the left (which is everything before l), and then close all tabs to the right (if you are at r). But that would require moving to l, then to r.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, if the current position is already in the [l, r] range, and you can close left and right in some way.\n\nBut let's think about the general approach.\n\nThe problem is that we need to close all tabs outside [l, r]. So, the steps required are:\n\n- Close all tabs to the left of l (if any)\n- Close all tabs to the right of r (if any)\n\nEach of these steps requires that the cursor is at the correct position (l for closing left, r for closing right).\n\nSo, the steps needed are:\n\nIf there are tabs to close on the left (i.e., l > 1), then we need to perform a close operation on the left. Similarly for the right.\n\nNow, the question is: what's the minimal steps to reach the positions where these closes can be done, and then perform the closes.\n\nBut the order of closing left and right might affect the steps.\n\nLet me think about the different possibilities.\n\nFirst, check whether l == 1 and r == n. If so, then answer is 0.\n\nElse, check if l is 1. Then, we need to close the right part. Or if r is n, then need to close the left part. Or both.\n\nSo, let's break into four cases:\n\nCase A: l == 1 and r == n → 0 steps.\n\nCase B: l == 1, r < n → need to close the right part. So, move to r, close right. Steps: |pos - r| + 1.\n\nCase C: r == n, l > 1 → need to close left part. Steps: |pos - l| + 1.\n\nCase D: l > 1 and r < n → need to close left and right parts. So, need to find the minimal steps between two options:\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then close right.\n\nOption 2: Close right first, then close left.\n\nBut what about the steps for each option?\n\nOption 1:\n\nSteps to move to l: |pos - l|. Then close left (1 step). Then, after closing left, the a is l. Now, to move to r, which is from l to r. So steps needed is |r - l|. Then close right (1 step). Total steps: |pos - l| + 1 + |r - l| + 1 = |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nOption 2:\n\nSteps to move to r: |pos - r|. Close right (1 step). Then, move to l: from r to l, which is |r - l| steps. Close left (1 step). Total steps: |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nSo the minimal between the two options is min( |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2, |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2 ). Which is equivalent to min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + |r - l| + 2.\n\nWait, because |r - l| is same in both options. So the difference is between |pos - l| and |pos - r|. So the minimal of the two options is min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a better way. Like, maybe moving to some position in between and doing both closes in some way? Not sure. For example, suppose you can close both left and right with one move. But that's not possible. Because to close left, you need to be at l. To close right, need to be at r.\n\nSo for case D, the minimal steps are as calculated above.\n\nBut what if the current pos is already in [l, r]? For example, pos is in [l, r]. Then, moving to l or r may take steps. But perhaps there's a way to optimize.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then, for case D, the steps would be:\n\nOption 1: move to l (2) → 1 step. Close left (1). Then move to r (4) → 2 steps. Close right (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5 steps. Which matches the first sample.\n\nOption 2: move to r (4) → 1 step. Close right (1). Then move to l (2) → 2 steps. Close left (1). Total 1+1+2+1=5 steps. Same result. So the min is 5.\n\nSo the formula for case D is min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + |r - l| + 2.\n\nWait, |pos - l| is 1, |pos - r| is 1. So min is 1. |r-l| is 2. So 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Correct.\n\nSo that seems to work.\n\nAnother example: if pos is at l. Then, moving to l is 0 steps. Then move to r (steps |r - l|). So total steps 0 + |r-l| + 2.\n\nBut what if pos is already at r? Then, moving to r is 0 steps. Then moving to l is |r - l| steps. So same as before.\n\nBut what if pos is somewhere else?\n\nSo, in case D, the formula is min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) + (r - l) + 2 ?\n\nWait, because |r - l| is (r - l) since r > l.\n\nBut what if l and r are adjacent? Well, the formula still holds.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nWe need to check whether there are left and/or right parts to close.\n\nLet me think of the general approach:\n\nIf l == 1 and r == n: answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if l > 1 and r < n: need to close left and right. So calculate steps as discussed.\n\nElse if l == 1: need to close right. Steps: |pos - r| + 1.\n\nElse if r == n: need to close left. Steps: |pos - l| + 1.\n\nBut wait, what if l > 1 and r == n? Then, we need to close left. So steps are |pos - l| + 1.\n\nBut what if there are tabs to the left of l, but not to the right of r (r is n). So, after closing the left part, the a is l, and the b is n. But since r is n, we don't need to close anything else.\n\nSo the steps are as above.\n\nBut there's another possibility. What if the current position is already in the [l, r] range, and we can close both left and right parts in some way?\n\nWait, for example, if l=2 and r=4, and pos is 3. Then, to close left and right, you need to move to l (2), close left, then move to r (4), close right. Or move to r (4), close right, then move to l (2), close left. Either way.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at l? Then steps to move to l is zero. Then move to r (steps r - l). Then close right. So total steps is (r - l) + 2. So that's 2 steps for the closes, and movement steps.\n\nBut how do I account for all these possibilities in code?\n\nSo, the overall steps would be:\n\nCompute the required steps based on the following:\n\nIf l == 1 and r == n → 0.\n\nElse:\n\nleft_close_needed = (l > 1)\n\nright_close_needed = (r < n)\n\nif left_close_needed and right_close_needed:\n\n    steps = min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2\n\nelif left_close_needed:\n\n    steps = |pos - l| + 1\n\nelif right_close_needed:\n\n    steps = |pos - r| + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    # this is impossible since l <= r and l !=1 and r !=n?\n\nWait, no. Because if l ==1 and r <n, then right_close_needed is true.\n\nBut in code, perhaps the code would handle all possibilities.\n\nWait, but what if l=1 and r <n? Then, the left is already closed (since l=1). So we need to close right. So steps is |pos - r| +1.\n\nBut let me think of another example. For instance, the second sample input:\n\nInput: 6 3 1 3. Output is 1.\n\nExplanation: she needs to close tabs to the right of 3. Because l=1, r=3. So the right part is 4,5,6. So she can close them by being at position 3, then closing to the right. So steps: |3 - 3| (0) + 1 = 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input: 5 2 1 5. Output 0. Since l=1 and r=5, which is the entire range. So no steps needed.\n\nSo the code logic seems to hold.\n\nBut wait, there's another case. What if the current position is already in the position where you can close both left and right in one move? Like, if l=2, r=4, and pos is 2. Then, you can close left (if needed) and then close right. But in that case, the steps would be |pos - l| (0) + 1 (close left) + |r - l| (2 steps from 2 to 4) + 1 (close right) = 0 +1 +2 +1=4 steps. But what if the pos is already at r?\n\nBut according to the formula, the steps would be min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nIf pos is at r (say, 4), then min( |4-2|, 0 ) is 0. So steps is 0 + 2 + 2 = 4 steps. Which is same as before.\n\nBut what if the pos is already in the middle of l and r? Like, pos is 3. Then steps would be min(1,1) + 2 + 2 = 5 steps. Which is same as the first sample.\n\nSo the formula seems to work.\n\nBut what about when l is 1 and r is 3, and pos is 3. Then steps is |3 - r| (0) +1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the pos is already at l? For example, l=2, r=4, pos=2. Then steps would be min(0, |2-4|=2) + 2 + 2 → 0 + 2 + 2 = 4 steps. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the pos is at l, and we need to close both left and right? Well, the left part is already closed (since l is 2, and the left part is 1, which is closed by being at l and closing left. But wait, when l is 2, the left part is tabs 1. So to close that, you need to be at l (2), then close all to the left. So that's one step. Then, move to r (4) which is 2 steps, then close right (1 step). Total 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 steps. Which is same as the formula.\n\nSo the formula seems to capture that.\n\nNow, what about when the left and right parts are not needed? Like, if l=2 and r=3, and the current pos is 2. Then, no need to close anything. Because the initial a is 1, but the desired is to have tabs 2 and 3. So the code would check if l>1 (yes) and r <n (yes, if n is larger than 3). Wait, but if n is 3, then r=3 equals n. So in that case, no right close needed. So code would check if l>1 (yes, 2>1) and r <n (no, 3 ==n). So, only left close needed. So steps would be |pos - l| + 1 → 0 +1 =1. But wait, in that case, the left close is needed. So, when l is 2 and r is 3, and n is 3, then the left close is needed (tabs 1). So steps are |pos - l| + 1 = 0 +1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code logic seems solid.\n\nSo, putting all this into code.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n → output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nleft_needed = l > 1\n\nright_needed = r < n\n\nif left_needed and right_needed:\n\n    steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n\nelif left_needed:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_needed:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    # this is impossible, since if not left_needed and not right_needed, then l=1 and r =n. Which is handled earlier.\n\nBut wait, what if l=1 and r <n? Then, left_needed is false (since l is 1), and right_needed is true. So steps is |pos - r| +1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when l is 1 and r is n? Then, handled in the first condition.\n\nSo code seems okay.\n\nBut let's test with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput is 6 3 2 4. So l=2, r=4. n=6. So left_needed is True (2>1), right_needed is True (4 <6). So steps = min( |3-2|, |3-4| ) + (4-2) + 2 → min(1,1) is 1. 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which matches the first sample.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput 6 3 1 3. l=1, r=3. n=6. So left_needed is false, right_needed is true. So steps is |3-3| +1 = 0 +1 =1. Correct.\n\nSample 3: 5 2 1 5. l=1, r=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=5. Output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=1, r=4. So right_needed is true. Steps is |2-4| +1 = 2 +1=3.\n\nBut what's the actual steps?\n\nShe needs to close tabs 5. So she is at position 2. She can move to 4 (steps 2) then close right (1 step). So total 3 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=2, r=3. So left_needed (2>1) and right_needed (3<5). So steps is min( |5-2|=3, |5-3|=2 ) → 2. Then add (3-2)=1, plus 2 → 2 +1 +2 =5 steps.\n\nLet me see. The steps would be:\n\nOption: move to r (3) first. Steps from 5 to 3: 2 steps. Close right (tabs 4,5). Then move to l (2): steps 1. Close left (tabs 1). Total steps: 2 +1 +1 +1 = 5. Correct.\n\nAnother case where pos is in [l, r]. For example, n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4. So steps: min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1 ) → 1. Then (4-2) =2. +2 → 1+2+2=5 steps. Which matches the first sample.\n\nAnother case: n=7, pos=4, l=3, r=5. So left_needed (3>1), right_needed (5<7). So steps: min( |4-3|=1, |4-5|=1 ) → 1. Add (5-3) =2, plus 2 → 1+2+2=5 steps.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nBut wait, what if the pos is already at l or r?\n\nFor example, n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=4. So left_needed is false (since l=2>1, but the left part is 1. So left_needed is true. Wait, l=2, so left_needed is l>1 → yes. So steps is |2-2| +1 =0 +1=1. Because the left part (tabs 1) needs to be closed. So the steps are to close left (being at 2). Which takes 1 step. Then, since r=4 <5, need to close right. So steps would be |pos - r| + ... ?\n\nWait, in this example, l=2 and r=4. So both left and right needed. So the code would compute min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\npos is 2. |pos - l| is 0. |pos - r| is 2. So min is 0. (r - l) is 2. So 0 + 2 + 2 =4 steps. So steps would be 4.\n\nBut let's see: the steps would be:\n\nClose left (tabs 1) by being at l (2). Then move to r (4) (steps 2), then close right (tabs 5). So steps: 0 (move) + 1 (close left) + 2 (move) + 1 (close right) = 4 steps. Correct.\n\nSo the code would return 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nRead input: the input is given as a list of test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers n, pos, l, r. The sample input shows that the input is given as a line with four numbers. For example, the first sample input is ['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5'] — but that's for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is the only line of input. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\nWait, the sample input shows three test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single line. Oh, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that shows multiple test cases, but the actual code must read one line per test case. Wait, the problem says \"the only line of input\" — which suggests that the code must read one line of input. But the sample input shows three lines. That's confusing. But looking back:\n\nThe sample input is written as:\n\nInput:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nBut that's probably a formatting error. Because the actual input is one line per test case. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the user is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem says \"the only line of input\", which implies that there is only one test case. But the sample shows three test cases. So perhaps the original problem is from a programming competition where multiple test cases are given. However, the problem statement says that the input is a single line. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is described as:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r.\n\nThus, the code must read one line of input, with four integers. However, the sample input shows three lines. But perhaps the sample input is written in a way that represents multiple test cases. However, the code must read a single line of input. So, the code must read one line, split into four integers, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input and output show that there are three test cases. Which suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem says \"the only line of input\".\n\nThis is conflicting. But perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the user is supposed to read multiple lines. However, the original problem statement may have been translated incorrectly.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's input section:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r.\n\nSo the code must read one line of input. Therefore, the sample input provided in the problem is likely to be formatted as multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one line of input. However, the sample input and output are given as lists, which may be a formatting mistake.\n\nBut in the problem's note, the first sample input is given as '6 3 2 4' and output is 5. So the code should process one line of input.\n\nTherefore, the code must read four integers from one line of input, compute the answer, and output it.\n\nSo, the code structure is:\n\nRead a line of input, split into four integers n, pos, l, r.\n\nThen compute the answer as per the logic above.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the line as input().split(), then process.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    left_needed = l > 1\n\n    right_needed = r < n\n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n\n        steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    elif left_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # this is impossible, but just in case\n\n        steps = 0\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but what about cases where l=1 and r <n. So left_needed is false (since l=1), right_needed is true. So steps is |pos - r| +1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the pos is already at r? Then steps is 0 +1 =1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the pos is at r+1? For example, n=5, pos=4, l=1, r=3. So steps is |4-3| +1 = 1+1=2 steps. Which would be moving to 3 (1 step) and close right (1 step). Which is correct.\n\nBut let's think of another case where the pos is not in [l, r]. For example, n=5, pos=5, l=1, r=3. So steps is |5-3| +1 = 2 +1=3 steps. Which would be moving from 5 to 3 (2 steps) and close right (1 step). Total 3 steps. Correct.\n\nAnother case: l=3, r=3. So the desired segment is just tab 3. So, if n=5, then left_needed is 3>1 → yes. right_needed is 3 <5 → yes. So steps is min( |pos -3|, |pos-3| ) + (3-3) + 2 → min(...) is |pos -3|, plus 0 + 2. So steps is |pos -3| + 2.\n\nFor example, pos=1. So steps is 2 steps to move to 3 (from 1 to 3: 2 steps), then close left (1 step) and close right (1 step). But wait, the formula says |pos -3| + 0 + 2 → 2 + 0 + 2 =4 steps. But the actual steps would be:\n\nMove to 3 (2 steps), close left (tabs 1, 2) → 1 step. Then close right (tabs 4,5) → 1 step. So total steps is 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 steps. Which matches the formula.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nAnother case: l=3, r=3, pos=3. Then steps is 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 steps. Which is correct: close left (1 step), close right (1 step). So total 2 steps.\n\nBut what if the pos is already in the [l, r] range? For example, l=3, r=3, pos=3. So steps is 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 steps. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the pos is already in the [l, r] range, but the steps to close left and right are required.\n\nSo the formula seems correct.\n\nBut what if the l and r are such that the left and right parts are not needed. For example, l=2, r=3, n=3. Then, since r =n, right_needed is false. left_needed is l>1 → yes. So steps is |pos - l| +1.\n\nBut in this case, the left part is tabs 1. So steps is moving to 2, then close left (tabs 1). Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead the input line as four integers. Then process.\n\nBut what about when l=1 and r=n? For example, n=5, l=1, r=5. Output is 0.\n\nBut what if l=1 and r=5, but n=5. Then, the code returns 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    left_needed = l > 1\n\n    right_needed = r < n\n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n\n        steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    elif left_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_needed:\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        steps = 0\n\n    print(steps)\n\nBut wait, what about when l=1 and r <n. Then, left_needed is False (since l=1). So steps is |pos - r| +1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when l=1, r <n, and pos is already at r? Then steps is 0 +1 =1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=3, n=5. So left_needed is True, right_needed is True. So steps is min( |pos -2|, |pos-3| ) + (3-2) + 2 → min(...) + 1 + 2 = min(...) +3.\n\nSo if pos is 2, then steps is 0 + 3 = 3 steps. Which would be:\n\nClose left (tabs 1) → 1 step. Then move to 3 (steps 1), close right (tabs 4,5) → 1 step. Total steps: 0 +1 +1 +1 = 3 steps. Correct.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. n=6. So l !=1 and r !=6. So left_needed and right_needed. steps is min(3-2=1, 3-4=1) → 1 + (4-2=2) + 2 → 1 +2 +2=5. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput: 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. n=6. So right_needed is True. steps is |3-3| +1 → 0 +1 =1. Correct.\n\nSample 3:\n\nInput:5 2 1 5 → l=1, r=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nBut what about the case where l=1 and r is less than n, but the pos is already at r? For example, n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs except those within a specified range [l, r]. The solution involves efficiently moving the cursor and closing tabs either to the left or right of the current position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the range [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l = 1 and r = n), no action is needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Determine Required Actions**: Check if there are tabs to the left of l (left_needed) and/or to the right of r (right_needed).\n3. **Calculate Steps**:\n   - If both left and right tabs need closing, compute the minimum steps required to move to either end of the range and then close both sides.\n   - If only left tabs need closing, compute the steps to move to the left end and close them.\n   - If only right tabs need closing, compute the steps to move to the right end and close them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_needed = l > 1\n    right_needed = r < n\n    if left_needed and right_needed:\n        steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n    elif left_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    elif right_needed:\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    else:\n        steps = 0\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the range [l, r] spans the entire set of tabs, no operations are needed.\n- **Left and Right Needed**: When both sides need closing, the optimal strategy involves moving to the nearest end of the range, closing that side, then moving to the other end and closing it. This minimizes the total movement and closing steps.\n- **Single Side Needed**: If only one side needs closing, the cursor moves directly to the appropriate end and closes the tabs in one step.\n\nThis approach ensures that we minimize the number of movements and operations required, leveraging the shortest path calculations for efficient tab closure.",
