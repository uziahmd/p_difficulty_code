    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0s and 2s directly. Hmm.\n\nSo the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). So what does that mean for the order of characters?\n\nLet me think about the possible rearrangements. Since 0 can be swapped with 1, and 1 can be swapped with 2, but not 0 and 2 directly. So maybe the relative positions of 0s and 2s are constrained? Like, can a 0 move past a 2? Let's see. Suppose I have a 0 followed by a 2. Since they can't be swapped directly. But if there's a 1 in between, maybe they can be moved around. For example, 0 1 2. Then I can swap 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then swap 0 and 2? No, because that's not allowed. Wait, no. The allowed swaps are only between 0 and 1, or between 1 and 2. So 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. So in this case, maybe the 0 can't pass through the 2. So perhaps the 0s and 2s can't cross each other. Because there's no way to swap them. So maybe the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed? Or maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, suppose there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2. Let's say 0 1 2. Then, I can swap the 1 and 2 to get 0 2 1. Then, can I swap the 0 and 2? No. So the 0 can't go past the 2. But maybe if there's another 1 in between. For example, 0 1 1 2. Then I can swap the 0 with the first 1 to get 1 0 1 2. Then maybe swap the 0 with the next 1 to get 1 1 0 2. Then, the 0 is still before the 2. But how can I get the 0 after the 2? It seems impossible. Therefore, the original positions of 0s and 2s can't be swapped. So, the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed? Wait, but what if there's a 1 between them. Let me think of an example: 0 2. Can't swap. So 0 must stay before 2. But if there's a 1 between them, like 0 1 2. Then, can I move the 0 to the right of the 2? Let's see:\n\nOriginal is 0 1 2. Swap 1 and 2 to get 0 2 1. Then, can't swap 0 and 2. So 0 is still before 2. So the 0 can't move past the 2. Therefore, the relative order between 0s and 2s is fixed. So the original positions of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because any 0 can't move past a 2, and vice versa. So the 0s and 2s are in their original relative order. Only the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s. Wait, but 1s can be swapped with 0s and 2s. So for example, 0s can be moved past 1s, and 2s can be moved past 1s. But 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the relative order of 0s and 2s is fixed. So in the final string, all the 0s and 2s are in the same order as they were in the original string. But the 1s can be rearranged in between them. So how can we arrange the 1s?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose the original string is 2 0 1. Then the 0 can't move past the 2. So the 2 comes first, then the 0, then the 1. But the 1 can be moved past the 0. So the 0 can be moved to the left of the 1. So the 1 can be moved to the right. So the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order, but the 1s can be placed anywhere between them, but also can be moved between 0s and 2s. Wait, but 1s can be moved between 0s and 2s. For example, if you have a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2, you can move the 1 to the right of the 2. Let's see:\n\nOriginal: 0 1 2. Swap 1 and 2 to get 0 2 1. Then, the 1 is after the 2. So the 1 can be moved to the right of the 2. But the 0 is before the 2. So the 1 can be moved to the right of the 2. But the 0 is fixed relative to the 2. So the 1 can be moved between 0 and 2, or even past the 2. But the 0 and 2 can't be swapped.\n\nSo the idea is that the 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order. The 1s can be arranged in between them, but also can be placed in any positions between the 0s and 2s. So how do we arrange the 1s to get the lex smallest string?\n\nThe lex smallest string would have as many 0s as possible at the beginning, then 1s, then 2s. But since the 0s and 2s can't cross each other, we need to arrange the 1s in between them. Let me think of the process.\n\nLet me consider the original string. All the 0s and 2s are in their original order. Between them, we can arrange the 1s. So for example, if the original string is something like 0 2 1, then the 0 comes before the 2. The 1 can be moved to the end, so the string becomes 0 2 1. Or wait, no. Wait, in that example, the original is 0 2 1. The 1 can be moved to the right of the 2. But since the 2 is already after the 0. So the 1 can be moved to the end, making the string 0 2 1. Or perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s can be moved freely between the 0s and 2s, but the 0s and 2s are fixed. So the problem reduces to grouping the 1s in between the 0s and 2s, but how?\n\nAnother approach: think of the string as consisting of blocks of 0s, 1s, and 2s. But since the 0s and 2s can't cross, perhaps we can arrange the 1s to be as left as possible, but considering the fixed positions of 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to arrange the 1s in such a way that they are placed in the earliest possible positions, but without violating the constraints of 0s and 2s.\n\nLet me think of the following strategy. Let's collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order, and then insert the 1s in between them. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose the original string is '100210', which is given in the example. The output is '001120'. Let's see:\n\nOriginal string is 1 0 0 2 1 0.\n\nThe 0s and 2s are in positions 2,3,4 (0,0,2) and then 0 (position 6). Wait, the original string is '1','0','0','2','1','0'.\n\nSo the 0s and 2s in the original string are:\n\nLooking at the original string, the 0s and 2s are:\n\npositions 1: '1' (not 0 or 2), position 2: '0', position 3: '0', position 4: '2', position 5: '1', position 6: '0'.\n\nSo the 0s and 2s in order are 0, 0, 2, 0. So their original order is 0,0,2,0. So in the output, these must be in the same order. The 1s can be arranged in between. So the output is 0,0,1,1,2,0. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is that the 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order. The 1s can be placed in between them. So the problem reduces to inserting the 1s into the positions between the 0s and 2s. But how to arrange them optimally.\n\nBut how do we arrange the 1s in between? Well, since the 1s can be moved freely between the 0s and 2s, but the 0s and 2s can't cross. So the 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s. So the lex smallest string would be to have all the 1s as far to the left as possible, but considering that the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order.\n\nWait, but the 0s are already as small as possible. So perhaps the optimal approach is to arrange the 1s between the 0s and 2s, but in the way that allows the 1s to be placed as left as possible. Wait, but how?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can collect all the 0s and 2s in their original order. Then, we can collect all the 1s. Then, we need to insert the 1s into the positions between the 0s and 2s. However, since the 1s can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s, but the 0s and 2s are fixed. So the minimal lex string is achieved by inserting all the 1s as early as possible. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose the original 0s and 2s are in order [0, 0, 2, 0]. Then, the 1s can be inserted in between them. So the minimal string would be to have all the 1s placed before the first 0? No, because the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order. So the first 0 is in the original position. So the 1s can be placed before the first 0? Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the 0s and 2s are fixed in their original order. For example, if the original string is '100210', the 0s and 2s are in the order 0, 0, 2, 0. So the first 0 in the original string is at position 2 (original index 1?), but in the new string, the 0s and 2s must appear in that order. But the 1s can be moved to the left of the first 0? How?\n\nWait, in the original example, the input is '100210', which is '1','0','0','2','1','0'. The 0s and 2s are in the order 0,0,2,0. The 1s are in the original positions 0 and 4 (the first character and the fifth). So there are two 1s. The output is '001120', which is 0,0,1,1,2,0. So the 1s are placed between the second 0 and the 2. But why not place them before the first 0?\n\nBecause the original order of the 0s and 2s is fixed. So the first 0 in the original string is at position 2 (original index 1?), but in the output, the first two characters are 0 and 0. How can the 1s be moved before those 0s?\n\nAh, because the 1s can be moved to the left of the 0s. For example, in the original string, the first character is 1, which can be swapped with the 0 to the right. So the initial '1' can be moved to the right of the 0s. Wait, no. Wait, the first character is 1, followed by 0. Since 1 and 0 can be swapped. So we can swap them to get 0 1 ... So the 1 can be moved to the right. So the 1 can be moved to the right of the 0. But how can the 1 be moved to the left of the 0?\n\nWait, no. Because the 1 is to the left of the 0. To move it to the left, you would need to swap it with the 0. So for example, if you have '1' followed by '0', you can swap them to get '0' followed by '1'. So the 1 moves to the right. But if you have a 0 followed by a 1, you can swap them to get 1 followed by 0. So in that case, the 1 moves to the left. Wait, no. If the original is 0 followed by 1, then you can swap them to get 1 followed by 0. So that's moving the 1 to the left. Wait, but that's moving the 1 to the left of the 0. So the 1 can be moved to the left of the 0. But how does that fit with the idea that the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order?\n\nAh, because the 0s and 2s can be moved around with 1s. So the 0s and 2s are in their original order, but the 1s can be moved around. Wait, but how can the 0s and 2s be in their original order if we can move the 1s around them?\n\nLet me think of the original example. The original string is '1 0 0 2 1 0'. The 0s and 2s are in the order 0,0,2,0. So the first 0 is at position 1 (original index 1?), but in the output, the first two characters are 0s. But how? Because the first 1 can be moved to the right of the first 0. So in the original string, the 1 is before the first 0. So we can swap them to get 0 and 1. So the 1 is now after the 0. Then, the 1 can be moved further to the right. So the 1 can be moved to the end of the string. But the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So the first 0 is in the first position. Then the second 0, then the 2, then the 0.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the 0s and 2s can be arranged in their original order, but their positions can be adjusted by moving the 1s around. Wait, but how can the 0s be moved? For example, in the original string, the first character is 1 followed by 0. So the 0 can be moved to the left of the 1. So the 1 can be moved to the right of the 0. But then the 0 is in the first position. So the 0s and 2s can be reordered? No, because the 0s and 2s are in their original order. So in the original example, the 0s and 2s are in the order 0 (original index 1), 0 (original index 2), 2 (original index 3), 0 (original index 5). So in the output, the 0s and 2s are in the same order. So in the output, the first two 0s are from the original positions 1 and 2, then the 2 from original position 3, then the 0 from original position 5. So the 0s and 2s are in the same order as they appeared in the original string.\n\nBut how can the 0s be moved to the left of the 1s? Because the 1s can be moved to the right of the 0s. So the 0s can be moved to the left of the 1s. So the 0s and 2s can be arranged in their original order, but with 1s possibly in between.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Split the original string into two parts: the 0s and 2s, which are kept in their original order, and the 1s, which can be placed anywhere between the 0s and 2s.\n\nBut how to arrange the 1s to make the lex smallest string.\n\nLet me think of the 0s and 2s as fixed in their order. Let's imagine that the 0s and 2s are in a list, say, fixed_chars. Then, the 1s can be inserted between them. But how to arrange the 1s optimally.\n\nThe lex smallest string would have as many 0s as possible first, then 1s, then 2s. However, the fixed_chars may have 0s and 2s in any order. For example, if fixed_chars is [0, 2, 0], then the 1s can be placed between them. So the lex smallest arrangement would be to have all the 1s between the 0 and 2, and then between the 2 and 0. But how?\n\nWait, the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order. So the fixed_chars list is the sequence of 0s and 2s in the original order. For example, in the original example, fixed_chars is [0,0,2,0].\n\nNow, the 1s can be inserted in between the elements of fixed_chars. Also, before the first element of fixed_chars, and after the last element.\n\nBut how to distribute the 1s to get the lex smallest string.\n\nThe lex smallest string would be to have as many 1s as possible in the earliest possible positions, but considering that inserting 1s before the first 0 may be better than inserting them later. Wait, but 0 is smaller than 1. So inserting 1s after the 0s is better than putting them before. Wait, no. Wait, the lex order is determined by the first differing character. So if we have a 0 before a 1, that's better than having a 1 before a 0. So to minimize the lex order, we want as many 0s as possible as early as possible, then 1s, then 2s.\n\nSo the idea is to arrange the 1s in between the 0s and 2s, but in a way that allows the 0s to come first, then the 1s, then the 2s.\n\nBut the fixed_chars list is the original order of 0s and 2s. So for example, if the fixed_chars is [0,2,0], then the 0s and 2s are in that order. How can we arrange the 1s between them?\n\nIn this case, the lex smallest would be to have the 1s placed between the 0 and 2 (so that the 0 comes first, then 1s, then 2, then 0). Or perhaps between the 2 and 0. But that would have 0, then 2, then 1s, then 0. Which is worse than the first option.\n\nSo the optimal way is to insert all the 1s between the 0 and the 2. Because that way, the 0 comes first, then the 1s, then the 2, then the 0. But how can that be done?\n\nBut the fixed_chars are [0,2,0]. So the 1s can be inserted in between the 0 and 2, and between the 2 and 0.\n\nSo the idea is that whenever we have a position where the current fixed_char is 0 and the next is 2, inserting the 1s between them would allow the 0s to be first, then the 1s, then the 2s. Similarly, if the fixed_chars have a 2 followed by a 0, then inserting 1s between them would allow the 2 to be followed by 1s, then 0. But that would be worse than having the 1s before the 2. So perhaps the 1s should be inserted in positions where they can be placed between a 0 and a 2, but between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s would allow the 0s and 2s to be in their order, and the 1s in between.\n\nWait, but how to determine where to insert the 1s.\n\nAn alternative approach is to think of the entire string as being composed of the fixed_chars (0s and 2s) and the 1s. Since the 1s can be placed anywhere between the fixed_chars, but to minimize the lex order, we want as many 1s as possible to be placed in positions where they are after 0s and before 2s, but also to avoid placing them in positions where they are after 2s.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal way is to collect all the 1s and insert them into the positions between the fixed_chars where they can be placed in the earliest possible positions. For example, between two 0s, inserting 1s would be worse than not inserting them there. But inserting them between a 0 and a 2 would be better than inserting them between a 2 and a 0.\n\nSo the idea is to collect all the 1s, and then distribute them in the possible insertion points between the fixed_chars. The insertion points are the gaps between the elements of fixed_chars, plus before the first element and after the last element.\n\nBut how to choose where to insert the 1s to get the lex smallest string.\n\nLet me think of the insertion points. Each insertion point is a position between two consecutive elements in the fixed_chars list, plus before the first element and after the last element.\n\nFor example, if fixed_chars is [a, b, c], then the insertion points are:\n\n- Before a\n\n- Between a and b\n\n- Between b and c\n\n- After c\n\nNow, for each insertion point, we can decide how many 1s to insert there.\n\nTo make the lex smallest string, we want to insert as many 1s as possible in the earliest possible positions where it's beneficial. But since 1 is larger than 0 and smaller than 2, inserting 1s before a 0 would make the string larger (since 1 is larger than 0). So inserting 1s before the first 0 would not be good. Similarly, inserting 1s after a 2 would be worse than inserting them before the 2.\n\nSo the optimal approach is to insert the 1s in the earliest possible positions where inserting them doesn't create a larger lex order. Let's think:\n\nFor each insertion point, inserting 1s there would affect the lex order. For example, inserting 1s between two 0s would not help, since 0s are already as small as possible. Inserting 1s between a 0 and a 2 is better than inserting them between a 2 and a 0, because the 0 is before the 2, and the 1s can be placed between them. Inserting 1s between a 0 and a 2 would allow the 0s to be first, then the 1s, then the 2s, which is better than having the 1s after the 2.\n\nSo the idea is to insert the 1s into the insertion points in the order of priority. The priority is based on the insertion point's potential to improve the lex order.\n\nFor example, the insertion points can be prioritized as follows:\n\n- All insertion points where inserting the 1s would be between a 0 and a 2 (or before the first 0, or after the last 0/2). Wait, perhaps the best way is to insert all 1s in the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not cause a problem. For example, inserting 1s between 0 and 2 would be better than inserting them between 2 and 0. So we need to find all the insertion points where the previous character is 0 and the next is 2. Insert the 1s there first, then insert them elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, for each insertion point, determine whether inserting the 1s there would lead to a better lex order. For example:\n\nIf the insertion point is before the first character, then inserting 1s there would add 1s at the beginning. That would be worse than having 0s first. So we don't want to do that.\n\nIf the insertion point is between two 0s, inserting 1s there would add 1s between the 0s. But since 0 is smaller than 1, inserting 1s there would make the string larger. So we want to avoid that.\n\nIf the insertion point is between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s there would allow the 0s to be first, then 1s, then 2s. Which is better.\n\nIf the insertion point is between a 2 and a 0, inserting 1s there would add 1s between the 2 and the 0. But since 2 is larger than 1, and 0 is smaller than 1, inserting 1s here would be worse than inserting them between the 0 and the 2.\n\nIf the insertion point is after the last 0 or 2, inserting 1s there would add them to the end, which is better than adding them earlier.\n\nSo the optimal strategy is to insert all the 1s into the insertion points where the previous character is 0 and the next is 2. Because that allows the 1s to be placed between 0 and 2, which is the best possible.\n\nIf there are multiple such insertion points, then we can insert all the 1s into the earliest such insertion point. For example, if there are multiple 0-2 transitions, insert the 1s into the earliest one first.\n\nWait, but how to handle that. Let's think of the fixed_chars list as a sequence of 0s and 2s. Let's iterate through the insertion points and for each, decide how many 1s to insert there.\n\nBut how to prioritize the insertion points. For example, between 0 and 2, inserting 1s is better than inserting between 0 and 0. So the priority is to insert 1s into insertion points that are between a 0 and a 2 first. Then, insert them into insertion points between 0 and 0, but that would be worse. Or perhaps between 2 and 0, but inserting 1s between 2 and 0 would be better than inserting after the 2.\n\nWait, inserting between 2 and 0 would allow the 1s to be between the 2 and the 0. But since 2 is larger than 1, and 0 is smaller than 1, inserting 1s there would be better than inserting them after the 2. Because inserting them between 2 and 0 would result in 2 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is better than 2 followed by 0 followed by 1s. But the 2 is followed by 0, which is worse than 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Because the 2 is followed by 0, which is worse than 2 followed by 1s. Wait, no. Let's compare two options:\n\nOption 1: 2 followed by 0. The lex order is worse than 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Because 2 is followed by 1 (which is better than 0). So inserting 1s between 2 and 0 would be better than not inserting them there. So in this case, inserting the 1s between 2 and 0 would be better than leaving them there.\n\nSo the general idea is that we want to insert the 1s into the insertion points where inserting them would allow the 1s to be placed in the earliest possible positions where they are after 0s and before 2s, or between 2 and 0, but that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the optimal way is to insert all the 1s into the insertion points between 0 and 2, and if there are no such insertion points, then insert them into the insertion points between 0 and 0, or between 2 and 0, or after the last element.\n\nBut how to find the insertion points where inserting 1s will be best.\n\nAnother approach: since 1 is larger than 0 and smaller than 2, inserting the 1s as far left as possible between 0 and 2 would be best. So the algorithm could be:\n\nCollect all the 1s into a list.\n\nThen, create the fixed_chars list (all 0s and 2s in original order).\n\nNow, we need to insert the 1s into the fixed_chars. The way to do this is to iterate through the fixed_chars and whenever there is a transition from 0 to 2, insert all the 1s there. Otherwise, insert them in the earliest possible positions.\n\nWait, but how to find the best positions.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- All 1s can be inserted into the fixed_chars in between the 0s and 2s. The best way is to insert all the 1s between the 0 and the next 2, if such a transition exists. If there are multiple 0-2 transitions, insert them into the earliest one. If there are no 0-2 transitions, then insert them into the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not increase the lex order.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the fixed_chars as a sequence. We can split the fixed_chars into groups where each group is a sequence of 0s and 2s. For example, the fixed_chars could be like [0,0,2,0,2,2,0], etc.\n\nThe 1s can be inserted into the gaps between the fixed_chars. To minimize the lex order, the 1s should be inserted into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not create a higher lex order.\n\nBut how to determine that. Let's consider each gap between two consecutive elements in the fixed_chars. For example, between element i and element i+1.\n\nThe gap between element i and i+1 can be considered as a position to insert the 1s. The decision is whether inserting 1s here would be better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nFor example, if the current gap is between a 0 and a 2, inserting the 1s here is optimal. Because the 0 is followed by 2, and inserting 1s between them gives 0...1...2, which is better than other possibilities.\n\nIf the gap is between a 0 and a 0, inserting the 1s here would give 0...1...0, which is worse than inserting them earlier (but since 0 is already the smallest, inserting 1s between them would make the string larger. So better to insert them elsewhere.)\n\nSimilarly, if the gap is between a 2 and a 0, inserting 1s here would give 2...1...0. Which is better than inserting them after the 2 (which would be 2 followed by 0 and then 1s). But inserting 1s here would be better than inserting them after the 2.\n\nSo, the priority of the gaps is:\n\n1. Gaps between 0 and 2 (insert all 1s here first)\n\n2. Gaps between 2 and 0 (insert 1s here next)\n\n3. Gaps between 0 and 0 (insert 1s here next)\n\n4. Gaps between 2 and 2 (insert 1s here next)\n\n5. Before the first element (insert 1s here last)\n\n6. After the last element (insert 1s here last)\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think. The idea is to process the gaps in the order of priority. For each gap, decide how many 1s to insert. Once the 1s are inserted into the highest priority gaps, the rest can be inserted into lower priority ones.\n\nSo for example, first, check all gaps between 0 and 2. Insert all 1s into the earliest such gap. If there are multiple such gaps, insert all the 1s into the first one. Because inserting them earlier is better.\n\nWait, but why insert them into the earliest one? Because inserting them earlier in the string would allow more 0s to come first. For example, inserting 1s between the first 0 and 2 would allow the 0s to be first, then the 1s, then the 2s, which is better than inserting them later in the 0-2 transitions.\n\nSo the algorithm steps could be:\n\n1. Split the original string into fixed_chars (all 0s and 2s in order) and collect the 1s into a list.\n\n2. Generate a list of gaps (insertion points) between the fixed_chars elements. For example, if fixed_chars has length n, there are n+1 gaps.\n\n3. For each gap, determine its priority. The priority is based on the type of transition between the previous and next element (if any). For example:\n\n   - For the first gap (before the first element), the previous element is None, and the next element is fixed_chars[0].\n\n   - For the last gap (after the last element), the next element is None, and the previous is fixed_chars[-1].\n\n   - For the gaps between elements i and i+1, the previous element is fixed_chars[i], next is fixed_chars[i+1].\n\n4. Sort the gaps in the order of priority. The priority order is:\n\n   a. Gaps between 0 and 2 (highest priority)\n\n   b. Gaps between 2 and 0 (next priority)\n\n   c. Gaps between 0 and 0 (next)\n\n   d. Gaps between 2 and 2 (next)\n\n   e. Gaps before the first element (lowest priority except for after last)\n\n   f. Gaps after the last element (lowest priority)\n\nWait, but what about gaps before the first element. If the first element is 0, inserting 1s before it would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So we want to avoid inserting 1s there unless there are no other options.\n\nSimilarly, inserting 1s after the last element would be better than inserting them in some other positions.\n\nSo the priority list for the gaps is:\n\nFor a gap, the priority is determined as follows:\n\n- If the gap is between 0 and 2: highest priority (e.g., 0)\n\n- If the gap is between 2 and 0: next priority (e.g., 1)\n\n- If the gap is between 0 and 0: priority 2\n\n- If the gap is between 2 and 2: priority 3\n\n- If the gap is before the first element: priority 4\n\n- If the gap is after the last element: priority 5\n\nBut how to sort the gaps in the order of priority. For example, all gaps of priority 0 (between 0 and 2) come first, then priority 1 (between 2 and 0), then priority 2, etc.\n\nOnce the gaps are sorted by priority, we can iterate through them in order and insert as many 1s as possible into each gap.\n\nBut how to insert the 1s into the gaps. For example, if the gap has priority 0 (between 0 and 2), we insert all the 1s into this gap. Because inserting them here is the best possible.\n\nBut wait, there may be multiple gaps with priority 0. For example, if the fixed_chars is [0, 2, 0, 2]. Then there are two gaps between 0 and 2 (between 0 and 2, and between 0 and 2 again). Which one to choose?\n\nIn that case, inserting the 1s into the earliest such gap would be better. Because inserting them earlier would allow more 0s to be at the front.\n\nSo for the gaps with the same priority, we process them in order from left to right.\n\nOnce we have the sorted list of gaps, we can process them in order and insert as many 1s as possible into each gap.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- For each gap, compute its priority.\n\n- Sort the gaps in the order of priority (highest first), and within same priority, order by their position (left to right).\n\n- Iterate over the sorted gaps, and for each, insert as many 1s as possible (i.e., all remaining 1s) into the gap.\n\nBut how to compute the priority for each gap.\n\nLet's think of the code structure.\n\nFirst, collect fixed_chars and ones:\n\nfixed_chars = [c for c in s if c in {'0', '2'}]\n\nones = [c for c in s if c == '1']\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing allowed swaps on adjacent characters. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. The key insight is that '0's and '2's cannot be directly swapped, so their relative order must remain unchanged. However, '1's can be freely moved between '0's and '2's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Separate Characters**: Split the input string into two parts: one containing all '0's and '2's (keeping their original order) and another containing all '1's.\n2. **Identify Insertion Points**: Determine the positions where '1's can be inserted between the '0's and '2's. These positions are prioritized based on their potential to minimize the lexicographical order.\n3. **Insert '1's Strategically**: Insert the collected '1's into the identified positions in a way that minimizes the lexicographical order. Prioritize inserting '1's between '0' and '2' transitions first, followed by other valid transitions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef minimum_ternary_string(s):\n    fixed_chars = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '1':\n            ones.append(c)\n        else:\n            fixed_chars.append(c)\n    \n    # Generate the list of gaps with their priority\n    gaps = []\n    n = len(fixed_chars)\n    for i in range(n + 1):\n        if i == 0:\n            prev = None\n            next_char = fixed_chars[0] if n > 0 else None\n        elif i == n:\n            prev = fixed_chars[-1] if n > 0 else None\n            next_char = None\n        else:\n            prev = fixed_chars[i-1]\n            next_char = fixed_chars[i]\n        \n        # Determine the priority for this gap\n        if prev is not None and next_char is not None:\n            if prev == '0' and next_char == '2':\n                priority = 0\n            elif prev == '2' and next_char == '0':\n                priority = 1\n            elif prev == '0' and next_char == '0':\n                priority = 2\n            elif prev == '2' and next_char == '2':\n                priority = 3\n            else:\n                priority = 4  # This shouldn't happen since we only have 0 and 2 in fixed_chars\n        elif i == 0:\n            # Before the first element\n            priority = 4\n        else:\n            # After the last element\n            priority = 5\n        \n        gaps.append((priority, i))\n    \n    # Sort the gaps by priority and then by position\n    gaps.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))\n    \n    result = []\n    ones_index = 0\n    for priority, pos in gaps:\n        if ones_index >= len(ones):\n            break\n        if pos == 0:\n            # Insert before the first element\n            result.extend(ones[ones_index:])\n            ones_index = len(ones)\n        elif pos == n:\n            # Insert after the last element\n            result.extend(ones[ones_index:])\n            ones_index = len(ones)\n        else:\n            # Insert between fixed_chars[pos-1] and fixed_chars[pos]\n            # Check if the current gap is between 0 and 2, etc.\n            # But since we sorted by priority, we can just insert all remaining ones here\n            if priority == 0:\n                # Insert all remaining ones here\n                result.extend(ones[ones_index:])\n                ones_index = len(ones)\n            else:\n                # For other priorities, insert as much as possible\n                # However, since we sorted by priority, we should have already handled higher priorities\n                pass\n    \n    # Now build the result by inserting the ones into the fixed_chars\n    # We need to re-calculate the insertion points correctly\n    # Let's re-approach this part properly\n    result = []\n    ones_index = 0\n    for i in range(len(fixed_chars) + 1):\n        if i == 0:\n            # before first\n            if priority == 4:\n                result.extend(ones[ones_index:])\n                ones_index = len(ones)\n        elif i == len(fixed_chars):\n            # after last\n            result.extend(ones[ones_index:])\n            ones_index = len(ones)\n        else:\n            # between fixed_chars[i-1] and fixed_chars[i]\n            # check if this is a high priority gap\n            # but since we have sorted the gaps, we need to process them in order\n            # but the previous approach was flawed, so let's try again\n            # we need to loop through the gaps in the sorted order and insert the ones\n            # perhaps the initial approach to generate the gaps and sort them was not used correctly\n            # better to re-implement the insertion step correctly\n    # Alternative approach:\n    # Create a list of insertion points with their priority, then insert the ones in order\n    # Reconstruct the result by iterating through the fixed_chars and inserting the ones in the optimal gaps\n    result = []\n    ones_index = 0\n    # Iterate through the fixed_chars and check for the optimal gaps\n    # First, insert all ones into the earliest 0->2 transition\n    inserted = False\n    for i in range(len(fixed_chars)):\n        if fixed_chars[i] == '0' and i < len(fixed_chars) -
