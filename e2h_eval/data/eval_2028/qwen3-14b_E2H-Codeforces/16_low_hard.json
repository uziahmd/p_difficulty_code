Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, moving through adjacent blocks. The adjacency here is defined by sharing a common border of non-zero length. So, the problem is essentially about finding the shortest path between two regions divided by lines.\n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacencies. But how can I represent each block? Since there are infinite regions, it's impossible to list them all. However, the key insight here is that the movement between blocks depends on crossing roads. Each time you cross a road, you move to a neighboring block. So, perhaps we can model the problem using BFS where each state represents the set of roads that we have crossed an even or odd number of times. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think about each block as being determined by the position relative to each road. For each road, a point is either on one side or the other. Since the roads are infinite lines, each block can be represented by a sign vector: for each road, whether the point is on the positive or negative side of the line. However, since the roads are not necessarily in general position, two different sign vectors could represent the same block if they are connected through some arrangement. But maybe for the purposes of this problem, we can model each block by the signs of the inequalities for each road.\n\nBut with n up to 300, that's 2^300 possible states, which is impossible. So that approach is not feasible. Therefore, there must be another way.\n\nWait, but the problem is to find the minimal steps between two points. So perhaps the key is that moving from one block to another requires crossing exactly one road. Because each step is moving across a road. So, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed to get from the home to the university. However, this might not be correct because sometimes crossing two roads could lead you directly. But how do I model this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a region (block), and edges exist between regions that share a common border. Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path between the home's region and the university's region. But again, how to represent the regions?\n\nBut given that the home and university are not on any road, they are in some region. Let's think about the parity of crossings. For example, if two points are in the same region, then they can reach each other without crossing any road. If they are in adjacent regions, they can cross one road. But how to model the regions?\n\nAnother idea: Each time you cross a road, you change the sign of that road's equation. So, the parity of the number of times you cross a road determines which side of that road you're on. But since roads can be crossed multiple times, but the actual position depends on the cumulative parity. Wait, perhaps not. For example, if you cross a road once, you are on the other side. Crossing it again brings you back. So, the parity of the number of crossings for each road determines which side you are on. Therefore, the state can be represented by a vector of parities (0 or 1) for each road. However, with 300 roads, this is 2^300 possible states, which is way too big.\n\nBut wait, the home and university are fixed points. So, the initial state (home's region) can be determined by checking for each road whether the home is on the positive or negative side. Similarly for the university. The problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads to cross to transform the home's parity vector into the university's parity vector, where each step changes exactly one parity (crossing a road). Because each step involves moving across a road, which flips the parity of that road's sign.\n\nBut how does that work? Because when you cross a road, you flip the parity for that road. So, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads whose parities differ between the home and university, but with some constraints. Wait, no. Because each step can flip one parity. So, the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two parity vectors. But that's only if you can flip each differing bit individually. However, that's not necessarily the case. Because flipping a road's parity might require crossing that road. But if the home and university differ in k roads, then the minimal steps is k if they can be achieved by crossing each of those roads once. However, this might not be possible if there are dependencies. Wait, but in reality, each step can cross any road, so the minimal steps would be the number of differing roads, but only if they can be crossed in some order. But since each crossing is allowed, regardless of the others, then the minimal steps is the number of differing roads",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving across a road to an adjacent block.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The key insight is that each block can be represented by a parity vector indicating whether a point is on the positive or negative side of each road. Moving from one block to another involves crossing a road, which flips the parity for that road.\n2. **Parity Vector Calculation**: For both the home and university positions, calculate their parity vectors relative to each road. This vector indicates whether the point lies on the positive or negative side of each road.\n3. **Hamming Distance**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the Hamming distance between these two parity vectors. This distance represents the number of roads where the parity differs, as each differing road must be crossed once to transition between blocks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n            idx += 1\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n\n    def get_sign(x, y, a, b, c):\n        return a * x + b * y + c\n\n    home_signs = []\n    univ_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        sign_home = get_sign(x1, y1, a, b, c)\n        sign_univ = get_sign(x2, y2, a, b, c)\n        home_signs.append(1 if sign_home > 0 else -1)\n        univ_signs.append(1 if sign_univ > 0 else -1)\n\n    diff = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, univ_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            diff += 1\n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home, university, and the list of roads.\n2. **Sign Calculation**: For each road, we determine whether the home and university points lie on the positive or negative side of the road. This is done using the equation of the line.\n3. **Parity Comparison**: The parity vectors for the home and university positions are compared. The number of differing parities (Hamming distance) gives the minimum number of roads that need to be crossed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result by leveraging the properties of linear equations and parity checks, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
