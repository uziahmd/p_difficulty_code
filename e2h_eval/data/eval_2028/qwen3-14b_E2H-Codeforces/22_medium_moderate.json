After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark, and then check which students have that mark. Each such student is considered successful. But since a student can be successful in multiple subjects, we need to count each student once even if they are best in multiple subjects.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject (column in the gradebook), determine the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if they have at least one subject where their mark equals the maximum for that subject.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, input handling. The input is n and m, followed by n lines each with m characters. Each line represents a student's marks for m subjects.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is:\n\n3 3\n223\n232\n112\n\nThen the gradebook is:\n\nStudent 1: [2, 2, 3]\nStudent 2: [2, 3, 2]\nStudent 3: [1, 1, 2]\n\nFor each subject (columns 0, 1, 2):\n\nSubject 0: max is 2 (students 1 and 2 have 2)\nSubject 1: max is 3 (student 2)\nSubject 2: max is 3 (student 1)\n\nSo successful students are student 1 (subject 2), student 2 (subject 1), and student 1 again (subject 0). But since we need to count unique students, the total is 2.\n\nSo the output is 2.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the input into a 2D array (list of lists) where each row is a student's marks.\n- For each column (subject), find the maximum value.\n- Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns equals the maximum for that column. If yes, mark them as successful.\n- Finally, count how many students are marked as successful.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n and m. Then read n lines, each line being a string of m digits. Convert each line into a list of integers.\n\nFor example, for the first input line, after reading n=3, m=3, the next lines are '223', '232', '112'. So the data structure would be:\n\nmarks = [\n    [2,2,3],\n    [2,3,2],\n    [1,1,2]\n]\n\nThen, for each subject (column index j from 0 to m-1), compute the maximum value in that column.\n\nSo for column 0, the values are 2, 2, 1 → max is 2.\n\nOnce we have the max for each column, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns equals the max for that column.\n\nSo for each student i, iterate through their marks in each column j. If any of their marks equals the max for that column, then they are successful.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\n1. Read the input into the marks matrix.\n\n2. Compute for each column j, the maximum value.\n\n   How to do that? For each column j, iterate over all rows i, collect the marks[i][j], then take the max.\n\n   For example, for j in range(m):\n\n       max_col[j] = max( marks[i][j] for i in range(n) )\n\n3. Once we have max_col, then for each student, check if any of their marks in any column equals the max_col for that column.\n\n   For example, for student i, check if any of the marks[i][j] == max_col[j] for any j.\n\n   If yes, then count them.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. Convert each string into a list of integers.\n\nCompute max_col for each column.\n\nInitialize a counter to 0.\n\nFor each student in the marks list:\n\n   for each column j:\n\n       if marks[i][j] == max_col[j]:\n\n           mark this student as successful, break out of the loop.\n\nSo, for each student, check all columns until you find one where they have the max.\n\nOnce found, increment the counter.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead the input. The first line is n and m.\n\nThen read n lines. For example:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nmarks = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    marks.append(row)\n\nThen compute max_col as a list of m elements.\n\nmax_col = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if marks[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = marks[i][j]\n    max_col.append(max_val)\n\nAlternatively, using list comprehensions:\n\nmax_col = [max( marks[i][j] for i in range(n) ) for j in range(m) ]\n\nBut for each column j, that's the way.\n\nOnce we have max_col, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to max_col[j].\n\nSo, for each student in marks:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if marks[i][j] == max_col[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nWait, but how to check for each student if they have at least one such occurrence.\n\nSo, for each student, we can check if any of their marks in any column is equal to the max_col for that column.\n\nSo, for student i, check if any of the marks[i][j] == max_col[j] for j in 0..m-1.\n\nSo, for each student, loop through their marks, and check for any j where this is true.\n\nOnce found, we can break and count them.\n\nSo, code:\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if marks[i][j] == max_col[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nWait, but in Python, for each student, the code checks each j. Once a j is found where the condition holds, the student is counted once, and the inner loop breaks.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nmarks is:\n\n[[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_col for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 2, 2, 1 → max 2\n\ncolumn 1: 2,3,1 → max 3\n\ncolumn 2: 3, 2, 2 → max 3\n\nmax_col is [2,3,3]\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0: [2,2,3]\n\ncheck j=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: [2,3,2]. j=0: 2 == 2 → yes. So count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,2]. check j=0: 1 < 2. j=1: 1 <3. j=2: 2 <3. No. So not counted.\n\nTotal count is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nSo the marks are:\n\nstudent 0: [9,1,7,2,8]\n\nstudent 1: [1,1,8,2,8]\n\nstudent 2: [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nmax_col for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 9,1,1 → max 9.\n\ncolumn 1: 1,1,1 → max 1.\n\ncolumn 2: 7,8,1 → max 8.\n\ncolumn 3: 2,2,1 → max 2.\n\ncolumn 4: 8,8,1 → max 8.\n\nmax_col = [9,1,8,2,8]\n\nNow for each student:\n\nstudent 0: has 9 in column 0 (max), so yes.\n\nstudent 1: in column 2, he has 8 which is max. Also column 4 has 8 (max). So yes.\n\nstudent 2: check each column. column 0: 1 <9. column 1: 1 equals max. So yes. So he is counted.\n\nThus, all three students are counted. Output is 3. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nWhat if all students have same marks in all subjects? Like n=2, m=2, all 5. Then each student is best in all subjects. But each student is counted once. So the answer is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1. Then the student is best in all subjects. So answer is 1.\n\nAnother case: m=1. So for each student, check if their mark is the max. Since it's the only subject. So for example, n=3, m=1, marks 1, 2, 3. Then only the third student is successful.\n\nSo code should handle these.\n\nNow, code.\n\nNow, in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead n lines, each line as a string, convert to list of integers.\n\nCompute max_col as for each column j, the max value.\n\nThen for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to max_col[j].\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\nmarks = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    marks.append(row)\n\nmax_col = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if marks[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = marks[i][j]\n    max_col.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if marks[i][j] == max_col[j]:\n            count +=1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but in Python, for the first part, when reading the input, for each line, we can process it as a string. For example, for the line '223', the code converts it into [2,2,3], which is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nNow, for the first sample input, the code would generate the correct output.\n\nAnother test case: when all students have the same marks. For example, n=2, m=2, input:\n\n2 2\n\n11\n\n11\n\nmax_col is [1,1]. Each student has 1 in both columns. So for each student, they have at least one (in fact, both) columns where they are best. So count is 2.\n\nAnother case: n=1, m=1. Input is 1 1 and 5. Then output is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=1. Input is 2 1, then 3 and 4. So max_col is 4. Only the second student is successful. Output is 1.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input given in the problem.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n223\n\n232\n\n112\n\nThe code processes this as:\n\nmarks = [[2,2,3], [2,3,2], [1,1,2]]\n\nmax_col for each column:\n\ncolumn 0: 2, 2, 1 → max 2.\n\ncolumn 1: 2,3,1 → max 3.\n\ncolumn 2: 3,2,2 → max 3.\n\nThen for each student:\n\nstudent 0: check column 0 (2 == 2 → yes. count +=1.\n\nstudent 1: column 0 (2 == 2 → yes. count +=1.\n\nstudent 2: none of the columns have max. So not counted. Total is 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n3 5\n\n91728\n\n11828\n\n11111\n\nmax_col is [9,1,8,2,8].\n\nstudent 0: has 9 in column 0 → yes.\n\nstudent 1: column 2 has 8 (max), so yes.\n\nstudent 2: column 1 has 1 (max is 1). So yes.\n\nThus count is 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nTherefore, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their performance in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best student in a subject is defined as having the highest mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook which is represented as a matrix of integers.\n2. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column in the matrix), compute the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n3. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have achieved the maximum mark in any subject. If they have, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nmarks = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    row = [int(c) for c in line]\n    marks.append(row)\n\nmax_col = []\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if marks[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = marks[i][j]\n    max_col.append(max_val)\n\ncount = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if marks[i][j] == max_col[j]:\n            count += 1\n            break\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored as a list of lists where each inner list represents a student's marks in different subjects.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject (column), iterate through all students to find the highest mark. This helps in identifying the best students for each subject.\n3. **Checking Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the highest mark in any subject. If they do, they are counted as successful. This is done by comparing each student's marks against the precomputed maximum marks for their respective subjects.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the successful students by leveraging precomputed maximum values for each subject, leading to an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n*m), which is efficient given the constraints (n, m ≤ 100).",
