Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Homer and Marge are playing a game with a number A of 2n digits. They take turns picking the leftmost digit, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. The output should be the sequence of moves (H for Homer, M for Marge) that achieves this maximum sum. And if there are multiple solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm, so the challenge is to decide, at each step, whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit, such that the total sum is maximized. But since each player has to take exactly n digits, the choice isn't just greedy. Because choosing a digit now affects the future choices.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Let's think about the problem as a dynamic programming problem. Because for each state (i.e., current position in the number A, and how many moves each player has made so far), we can make a decision and track the maximum possible sum.\n\nLet me think. The state would be determined by the current position in the string (let's say, after k digits have been taken, so the remaining digits are from position k onwards), and the counts of moves made by Homer and Marge. Wait, but since each player must take exactly n moves, the total number of moves is 2n. So for a given state, if Homer has taken h moves and Marge has taken m moves, then h + m = current number of moves taken. Since each move takes one digit, the current position in A is at index (h + m). So maybe the state can be represented by how many moves Homer has made (h) and Marge (m), which implies that the current position is h + m. But since h + m can't exceed 2n, and h and m are such that h + m = k (for some k from 0 to 2n). Also, since each player must make exactly n moves, the total steps are 2n steps. So during the process, at any step, the number of moves made by Homer is h, and by Marge is m, with h + m = k, and the next step will be either h+1 or m+1, depending on who takes the next digit.\n\nBut for the DP approach, the state can be represented by h and m. However, since h + m = k, and since h can range from 0 to n, and m can range from 0 to n, but with h + m = k. But perhaps we can represent the state as (h, m) where h is the number of moves Homer has made so far, and m is the number of moves Marge has made. Then, for each state, we can decide whether to take the next digit for Homer or Marge, provided that the counts don't exceed n.\n\nThe key is that for each state (h, m), we can calculate the maximum sum possible from that state onward. Then, for each state, we can choose to take the next digit for Homer (if h < n) or for Marge (if m < n), and pick the option that gives the maximum total sum.\n\nBut how do we compute the sum? Well, the sum depends on the digits that are chosen. For example, when Homer takes a digit, it contributes to his number S1, which is built by appending digits. Similarly for Marge. But since the sum is S1 + S2, which is the sum of all digits chosen by Homer multiplied by their respective place values plus same for Marge. Wait, but the actual value of S1 and S2 depends on the order in which digits are taken. For example, if Homer takes digits in positions 0 and 1, then S1 would be digit0 * 10^1 + digit1 * 10^0. However, the problem says that each time a player takes the leftmost digit, which is then removed. So the order in which the digits are taken determines the digits' positions in S1 and S2.\n\nBut calculating the exact value of S1 and S2 for each possible path would be computationally expensive. However, the problem requires maximizing the sum of S1 and S2. Let's think: the sum S1 + S2 can be considered as the sum of all digits multiplied by their respective place values in their respective numbers. However, since each digit is added to either S1 or S2, and the place value depends on when the digit is taken. For example, if a digit is taken as the first move by Homer, it's the first digit of S1 (so multiplied by 10^{n-1} if there are n digits in total), but if it's taken later, it's multiplied by lower powers.\n\nWait, but the length of S1 and S2 is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that the total prize they receive is maximized. The game involves taking turns to pick digits from a number A of length 2n, with each player making exactly n moves.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a recursive approach with memoization to explore all possible sequences of moves efficiently. The state of our DP function will be determined by the number of moves each player has made so far.\n2. **State Representation**: The state is represented by the number of moves Homer (h) and Marge (m) have made. The current position in the number A can be derived from h + m.\n3. **Recursive Decision Making**: At each state, we decide whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit based on which choice leads to a higher total prize. This decision is made recursively, considering the remaining digits and the number of moves left for each player.\n4. **Memoization**: To avoid redundant calculations, we cache results of subproblems using memoization.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    \n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h == n and m == n:\n            return (0, \"\")\n        current_pos = h + m\n        digit = int(A[current_pos])\n        max_total = -1\n        best_move = ''\n        \n        # Homer's turn if he hasn't taken n moves yet\n        if h < n:\n            total, move_seq = dp(h + 1, m)\n            total += digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - h))\n            if total > max_total:\n                max_total = total\n                best_move = 'H' + move_seq\n        # Marge's turn if she hasn't taken n moves yet\n        if m < n:\n            total, move_seq = dp(h, m + 1)\n            total += digit * (10 ** (n - 1 - m))\n            if total > max_total:\n                max_total = total\n                best_move = 'M' + move_seq\n        return (max_total, best_move)\n    \n    _, result = dp(0, 0)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function is defined to take the number of moves made by Homer (`h`) and Marge (`m`). It returns the maximum total prize and the corresponding sequence of moves.\n- **Base Case**: When both players have made exactly `n` moves, the function returns a total of 0 and an empty string.\n- **Recursive Case**: For each state, we check if Homer or Marge can make the next move. We recursively compute the total prize for each possible move and choose the one that maximizes the total prize.\n- **Digit Contribution Calculation**: The contribution of each digit to the total prize is calculated based on its position in the respective player's number. This is done using powers of 10, adjusted for the number of digits each player will have.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible move sequences efficiently using memoization, leading to an optimal solution for maximizing the total prize.",
