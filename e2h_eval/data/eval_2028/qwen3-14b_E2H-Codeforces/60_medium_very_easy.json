Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where after each addition to the string S, I have to calculate the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code. The tricky part is figuring out which substrings are valid Morse code representations and then counting all possible sequences.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem again. The Morse code representations for letters are strings of 1 to 4 characters, made up of 0s and 1s. However, four specific strings are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So any substring of S that is a valid Morse code (i.e., length 1-4, not in the forbidden list) contributes to the count. But how do we count all possible sequences of letters?\n\nWait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So each such sequence corresponds to a way of splitting a substring of S into parts where each part is a valid Morse code letter. For example, if the substring is \"11\", it could be split as one letter (11) or two letters (1 and 1). Each split gives a different sequence. So the total count is the sum over all possible substrings of S (of length between 1 and 4) of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse code letters.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently for each step as the string S grows?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Let's consider that for each position in the string S, I can track the number of valid sequences that end at that position. Because when a new character is added to S, we can look back at the previous positions and see if the new suffix forms a valid Morse code, and add accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, for each step, after appending a new character, we can look at all possible substrings ending at the current position. For each such substring, check if it's a valid Morse code (i.e., not forbidden and length between 1 and 4), and then compute the number of ways to split that substring into valid codes. Then, sum all those possibilities across all possible substrings.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. Let's say that for the current string S (after i steps), we can compute for each position j (from 1 to i) the number of valid sequences that can be formed by considering the substring S[0..j] (or maybe S[...], depends on indexing). Wait, perhaps the key is to use dynamic programming where dp[i] represents the number of valid sequences that can be formed using the first i characters of S.\n\nWait, here's a classic problem similar to this. For example, the problem where you count the number of ways to decode a string into letters, where each letter is 1 or 2 digits. That uses DP. So perhaps here, we can model it similarly.\n\nBut in our case, the problem isn't exactly the same. We need to count all possible sequences of letters that can be formed by splitting any substring of S into valid Morse codes. However, since the question is about all substrings, not just the entire string, this complicates things.\n\nWait, but perhaps the answer is the sum over all possible substrings T of S (each T being a substring of S) of the number of ways to split T into valid Morse code letters. Because each such split represents a unique sequence of letters.\n\nFor example, if T is \"11\", then there are two ways: split into \"1\" + \"1\" (two letters) or \"11\" (one letter). So for each substring T, compute the number of ways to split it into valid codes, then sum all those numbers across all possible substrings T of S.\n\nSo the challenge is to compute this sum after each addition to S.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute this sum efficiently. For m up to 3000, and each step adding a character, the total possible substrings after m steps is O(m^2). For each substring, checking validity and computing the number of splits could be O(1) if we precompute some data structures.\n\nBut even with m=3000, m^2 is around 9 million, which might be manageable with an efficient approach.\n\nBut let's think about the steps. For each step, after adding a new character, we need to process all possible substrings ending at this new position. For example, when the string is of length k, the new character is at position k. The substrings ending at k are of lengths 1 to 4 (but not longer than k). For each length l (1 to 4), we check if the substring of length l ending at k is valid. For each such valid substring, we can compute the number of ways to split it into valid codes, and add that to the total sum.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the number of ways to split a substring into valid codes? For that, we can use dynamic programming. For example, for a given substring T (say, of length n), the number of ways to split it into valid codes is equal to the number of ways to split the first i characters, for each i.\n\nSo for each substring T, the number of splits is f(len(T)), where f(n) is the number of ways to split the first n characters of T into valid codes.\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible substrings?\n\nAlternatively, for each position i in the current string S, we can keep track of the number of ways to split the substring ending at i. Let me think.\n\nLet me consider that for the current string S, which is built incrementally, we can maintain a dp array where dp[i] represents the number of ways to split the first i characters of S into valid Morse code letters. Then, the total number of sequences would be the sum of dp[1], dp[2], ..., dp[k], where k is the current length of S. Because each dp[i] counts the number of ways to split the first i characters into valid letters (which is equivalent to the number of sequences for the substring S[0..i-1]).\n\nWait, but that's only considering the entire string up to i. However, the problem requires considering all possible substrings of S, not just the entire string. For example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings are \"1\", \"1\", \"1\", \"11\", \"11\", \"111\". Each of these substrings contributes their own number of splits. So the total answer is the sum over all possible substrings T of S of the number of splits for T.\n\nBut how can we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose we have a dynamic programming approach for each position i in the string S. For each i, we can compute the number of ways to split the substring ending at i. Let me define a variable dp[i], which represents the number of ways to split the substring S[0..i-1] (the first i characters) into valid Morse code letters. Then, the total answer would be the sum of dp[1], dp[2], ..., dp[n], where n is the current length of S. However, this only accounts for the entire substrings from the start to each position. It doesn't account for all possible substrings. For example, the substring starting at position 1 and ending at position 2.\n\nSo this approach is not sufficient. Therefore, I need another idea.\n\nAlternative approach: For each position i in the string S, and for each possible length l (1 to 4), check if the substring ending at i of length l is valid. For each such valid substring, add the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse codes. Then, the total answer is the sum over all such valid substrings and their corresponding counts.\n\nBut how to compute the number of ways to split a substring into valid Morse codes? For example, take the substring T = S[j..k]. How do we compute the number of splits for T?\n\nThis seems like a standard problem. For each substring, the number of splits is similar to the decoding problem. For example, for the substring T, the number of ways is f(len(T)), where f(n) is the number of ways to split the first n characters of T into valid codes. To compute this, we can use dynamic programming for each substring. However, doing this for every possible substring would be too slow for m=3000.\n\nBut perhaps we can find a way to reuse previous computations.\n\nLet me think again. Let's consider that for the current string S, after adding a new character, we can process all possible substrings ending at this new position. For each possible length l (1 to 4), we check if the last l characters form a valid Morse code. If they do, then the number of ways to split the substring ending at this position is equal to the number of ways to split the previous part plus 1 (if the substring itself is valid).\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's define for each position i in S, a value dp[i], which is the number of ways to split the substring ending at i (i.e., the substring S[0..i]?) No, perhaps not. Let me think again. Suppose that for the current string S of length n, we want to compute for each position i (from 1 to n) the number of ways to split the substring S[0..i-1] into valid codes. Then, the total number of sequences would be the sum of all dp[i] for i from 1 to n. But this counts the number of ways to split the entire string up to i, but not all possible substrings.\n\nWait, no. Because for example, the substring S[1..2] would be considered as part of the dp for i=2, but only if the entire string up to i=2 is considered. But that's not the case. So this approach would not capture all possible substrings.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need a different approach. Let me think of the problem as follows: every time a new character is added, the new possible substrings are those that end at this new position. For example, when adding the i-th character (so the string is now length i), the new substrings that end at position i are of lengths 1, 2, 3, 4 (but not longer than i). For each such length l (1 ≤ l ≤ 4), we can check if the substring of length l ending at i is valid. For each valid such substring, we can compute the number of ways to split that substring into valid codes. Then, for each such valid substring, we add that number to the total answer.\n\nBut how do we compute the number of ways to split the substring of length l ending at i?\n\nLet me denote the substring as T = S[i - l + 1 ... i]. For example, if l=2, then T is the last two characters.\n\nThe number of ways to split T into valid Morse codes can be computed with dynamic programming. Let's call this value ways_T. For example, for T of length 1, ways_T is 1 if it's valid. For T of length 2, it's 1 if T is valid, plus the number of ways to split into two single characters (if each is valid). But this seems complex to compute for each T.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute for each position i, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i. Let me think of a dynamic programming array, say, dp[i], which represents the number of ways to split the substring S[0..i-1] (the first i characters) into valid Morse codes. Then, for each new character added, we can compute dp[i] based on previous values.\n\nFor example, dp[i] = sum of dp[i - l] for all l where the substring ending at i of length l is valid. Also, if the substring of length l itself is valid, then add 1 (since that's a way to split the entire substring as a single letter).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Let me think. For the substring up to i, the number of ways to split it is equal to the sum of:\n\nfor each possible l (1 to 4), if the last l characters form a valid code, then add dp[i - l] (the number of ways to split the first i - l characters) multiplied by 1 (since we add this l-length code as the last part). Also, if l is 1, then dp[i - l] would be dp[i-1], and so on.\n\nWait, but what if the entire substring is considered? For example, if the last l characters form a valid code, then the total ways would be the ways to split the first i-l characters, and then append this l-length code. So, yes, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{l=1 to 4} (if the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then dp[i - l] )\n\nBut also, for each l, we need to check if the substring of length l is valid. And note that for l=1, the substring is the last character. So for each i, dp[i] is the sum of dp[i - l] for all l where the substring ending at i of length l is valid. And for l=1, if the substring is valid, then dp[i] += dp[i - 1]. Also, for l=1, even if dp[i - 1] is zero, adding 1? No, because dp[i - l] is dp[i - 1], which represents the number of ways to split the first i - 1 characters. If we take the substring of length 1 (valid), then the total ways would be dp[i - 1] (ways to split the first i-1) + 1 (if the first i-1 is empty? Wait, no. For example, when i=1 (the first character), dp[1] = 1 if the substring is valid. So in that case, dp[1] = 1, because the only way is to take the single character.\n\nBut according to the recurrence, dp[i] = sum_{l} (if valid, dp[i - l]). For i=1, l can be 1. Then, dp[1] = dp[0]. What is dp[0]? It should be 1, representing the empty string (which has one way to split: nothing). So for i=1, dp[1] = dp[0] = 1. Which is correct.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the base case is dp[0] = 1 (empty string has one way to split, which is nothing). Then for each i ≥ 1, dp[i] is the sum of dp[i - l] for all l in 1..4 where the substring of length l ending at i is valid.\n\nSo, if we can compute dp[i] for each i, then the total number of sequences for the entire string up to i is dp[i]. But wait, the problem requires us to count all possible substrings of S, not just the entire string. So how does this help?\n\nAh, here's the key insight. For each i, the dp[i] counts the number of ways to split the entire first i characters into valid Morse code letters. However, the problem requires us to count all possible substrings of S. Each substring T of S can be considered as a string of length k (1 ≤ k ≤ len(S)), and the number of ways to split T into valid codes is equal to the dp[k] for the substring T. But how to track this for all possible substrings?\n\nWait, no. Because the dp array for the entire string S is built based on the entire string. However, each substring T is a different string. So the dp approach for the entire string S won't directly help with the substrings.\n\nSo this approach may not be sufficient. Hmm.\n\nAlternative idea: For each position i in S, and for each possible length l (1 to 4), check if the substring ending at i with length l is valid. Then, the number of sequences contributed by this substring is equal to the number of ways to split this substring. But how to compute this number of ways?\n\nLet me think. For a substring of length l, the number of ways to split it into valid codes is equal to the number of ways to split the substring into parts. This is similar to the dp approach but applied to the substring itself. However, recomputing this for every substring would be too slow.\n\nBut perhaps, for each position i, and for each possible length l (1 to 4), we can compute the number of ways to split the substring ending at i of length l. Let's denote this as ways[i][l], where ways[i][l] is the number of ways to split the substring S[i - l + 1 ... i] into valid codes.\n\nThen, for each new character added to S, we can update ways[i][l] for l=1 to 4. But how?\n\nFor example, for the current position i (after adding the new character), for l=1, the substring is S[i]. So ways[i][1] is 1 if S[i] is valid (i.e., not in forbidden list). For l=2, the substring is S[i-1] and S[i]. We need to check if it's valid, and then ways[i][2] = ways[i-1][1] (if the first character is valid, then split into first 1 and then the next 1) plus 1 if the entire substring is valid (but wait, no. The number of ways to split the substring of length 2 is either:\n\n- split into first 1 and then the next 1 (if both are valid) → which contributes ways[i-1][1] ?\n\nWait, perhaps the way to compute ways[i][l] is similar to the dp approach. For a substring of length l, the number of ways to split it is equal to the sum of the ways to split the first part (of length l') and then the remaining part (of length l - l').\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, for each l (1 to 4), the number of ways to split the substring ending at i with length l can be computed recursively based on previous values.\n\nLet me think. For the substring ending at i with length l, the number of ways is:\n\nIf the substring itself is valid, then we can add 1 (the case where the entire substring is taken as a single letter). Additionally, for each possible split into a prefix of length k (where 1 ≤ k < l), if the prefix is valid, then add the number of ways to split the remaining l - k characters. However, since the remaining l -k characters must also be a valid substring. Wait, but how do I know that?\n\nActually, the number of ways to split the substring of length l is equal to the sum over all possible k (1 ≤ k ≤ l) where the first k characters form a valid code, multiplied by the number of ways to split the remaining l -k characters. But the remaining l -k characters must themselves be a valid code, but that's not necessarily true. Wait, no. The remaining l -k characters can be split into multiple codes. So the recurrence is:\n\nways(l) = sum_{k=1}^l [ if the first k characters are valid, then ways(l -k) ]\n\nBut for the entire substring of length l, the ways(l) is the number of ways to split it into valid codes. So for the substring of length l, the recurrence is:\n\nways(l) = sum_{k=1}^l (if the first k characters are valid, then ways(l -k)) \n\nwith the base case that ways(0) = 1 (empty string has one way to split).\n\nBut for our problem, the substring is fixed, and we need to compute this for each possible substring. However, for each new character added, we can compute this for all possible substrings ending at this new position.\n\nLet me think of how to compute this for each new character. Let's suppose that we have the string S up to length i. For each possible l in 1..4, we need to compute the number of ways to split the substring ending at i with length l. Let's denote this as cnt[i][l].\n\nFor l=1, the substring is just the last character. So cnt[i][1] = 1 if the substring is valid (i.e., not in forbidden list). For l=2, the substring is the last two characters. We need to check if it's valid. If it is, then cnt[i][2] = cnt[i-1][1] + (if the entire substring is valid, then 1? Or not?)\n\nWait, no. For the substring of length 2, the number of ways is:\n\nif the first 1 character is valid, then add the number of ways to split the remaining 1 character (which is cnt[i-1][1] ?). Also, if the entire 2 characters are valid, then add 1. But how?\n\nActually, the recurrence is:\n\ncnt[i][l] = sum_{k=1}^{l} (if the first k characters of the substring are valid, then cnt[i - (l -k)][l -k] ?)\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me think of an example. Suppose the substring is of length l = 2. The possible splits are:\n\n- Take the first 1 character (if valid) and then split the remaining 1 character (which is the second character). The number of ways is cnt_prev_1 (the number of ways to split the remaining 1 character, which is 1 if valid).\n\n- Take the entire 2 characters (if valid), which adds 1.\n\nSo for l=2, cnt[i][2] = (if first 1 is valid, then cnt[i-1][1] ) + (if entire 2 is valid, then 1).\n\nBut how do I get cnt[i-1][1]? Because that's the number of ways to split the substring of length 1 (the first character of the current 2-length substring). Wait, but the current substring is of length 2. For example, if the current substring is S[i-1] and S[i], then the first k=1 is S[i-1], and the remaining is S[i], which is length 1. So the number of ways for that split is cnt_prev_1, where prev is the number of ways for the remaining 1 character.\n\nBut how to track this? It seems that for each possible l, we need to know the number of ways to split the substring of length l ending at i, which depends on previous values of shorter substrings.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be handled with dynamic programming. Let's think about maintaining for each position i, and for each possible l (1 to 4), the number of ways to split the substring of length l ending at i. Let's call this array ways[i][l], where l ranges from 1 to 4.\n\nThen, for each i, when adding the new character, we can compute ways[i][1], ways[i][2], ways[i][3], ways[i][4] based on previous values.\n\nLet's formalize this:\n\nFor each i (current length of S), and for each l in 1..4:\n\nif the substring ending at i of length l is valid, then:\n\nways[i][l] = sum_{k=1 to l} (if the first k characters of this substring are valid, then ways[i - l + k][l -k] ? )\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again. For the substring of length l ending at i, the number of ways is equal to the sum over all possible k (1 ≤ k ≤ l) where the first k characters of this substring form a valid code. For each such k, the number of ways is the number of ways to split the remaining l -k characters. But the remaining l -k characters are the substring of length l -k ending at i -k + l = i -k + l? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the substring of length l ending at i is S[i-l+1 ... i]. For this substring, the number of ways to split it is:\n\nsum_{k=1}^l (if the first k characters are valid, then ways_substring_of_length l -k )\n\nBut the 'ways_substring_of_length l -k' refers to the substring S[i-l+1 +k ... i], which is of length l -k. However, how do we track this?\n\nThis seems recursive. However, for l up to 4, this can be manageable. For example, when l=2:\n\nways[i][2] = (if first 1 char is valid, then ways[i-1][1] ) + (if entire 2 chars are valid, then 1 )\n\nBut wait, the first 1 char is the substring ending at i-1 (since the current substring is of length 2 ending at i, and the first 1 char is S[i-1]. Then, the remaining 1 char is S[i], which is of length 1. So the number of ways for that split is ways[i-1][1] (the ways to split the first 1 char) multiplied by ways[... ]? No, because the first 1 char is split into 1 way (assuming valid), and the remaining 1 char is split into 1 way (if valid). So for that split, the total is 1 * 1 = 1. But how do we get that from previous values?\n\nAlternatively, for the current substring of length l, the number of ways is the sum of:\n\nfor each k where the first k characters of the substring are valid, the number of ways to split the remaining (l -k) characters. So, for example, when l=2, and k=1, the remaining length is 1. The number of ways for the remaining is ways[i - (l -k)] ?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think of it differently. For the substring T of length l, the number of ways is:\n\nways_T = sum_{k=1}^l ( if T[0..k-1] is valid, then ways_T' ), where T' is the substring T[k..l-1].\n\nBut T' is a substring of length l -k. However, how do I compute ways_T'?\n\nThis suggests that for each possible l, we need to recursively compute ways for smaller lengths. However, for l up to 4, this is manageable. For example, for l=4, we can check for k=1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nBut how to compute this for each substring?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each new character added to the string S, we can compute for each possible l (1 to 4) whether the substring of length l ending at current position is valid. For each such valid substring, we can compute the number of ways to split it as follows:\n\nIf l=1: ways is 1 if valid.\n\nIf l=2: ways is (ways for l=1 of the first character) + (1 if the entire 2 is valid).\n\nWait, but the first character's ways is 1 if it is valid. So for l=2, if the first character is valid and the second is valid, then the ways is 1 (split into two) + 1 (split into one if the whole is valid). But how do we know if the whole is valid?\n\nAlternatively, for the l-length substring, the number of ways is the sum for each possible split into a valid first part and then the rest. For example:\n\nways[l] = sum_{k=1}^l (if the first k is valid, then ways[l -k] )\n\nBut ways[l -k] is the number of ways to split the remaining part of length l -k. However, for the current substring, the remaining part is of length l -k, which is the substring starting at position k in the current substring. But how to get this value?\n\nAh, but for the current substring, we can compute the ways for smaller lengths by looking back at previous computed values. For example, when we are processing the current i-th character, and considering the substring of length l ending at i, the ways for the current substring depends on the ways of smaller substrings that end at earlier positions.\n\nWait, this seems complex. However, since l is small (up to 4), we can precompute for each possible l and current i.\n\nLet me try to model this for l up to 4.\n\nFor example, when l=1: the substring is the last character. So ways is 1 if it's valid.\n\nFor l=2: the substring is last two characters. Check if it's valid. Then, ways is:\n\nif the first 1 character is valid, then ways_1 (the number of ways to split the first 1 characters of this substring) multiplied by the ways for the remaining 1 characters (which is ways_1 for the substring of length 1, which is 1 if valid). But since the first character is valid, and the second character is valid, the total ways would be 1 (split into two) plus 1 (split into one if the entire 2 is valid). Wait, but how to compute this?\n\nActually, the number of ways for the substring of length 2 is:\n\nnumber of ways = (ways for the first 1 character) * (ways for the remaining 1 character) + (if the entire 2 is valid, 1).\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n\nThe number of ways for the substring of length 2 is:\n\nways = 0\n\nif the first 1 character is valid, then add the number of ways to split the remaining 1 character (which is 1 if valid).\n\nAlso, if the entire 2 characters are valid, then add 1 (the way to take the entire as one code).\n\nSo for example, if the entire 2 is valid and the first 1 is also valid, then the total ways is 1 (split into two) + 1 (split into one) = 2.\n\nBut how do I compute the number of ways for the remaining 1 character? Well, that's the ways for the substring of length 1 ending at i-1 + 1 (since the remaining 1 character is the second character, which is the current character. Wait, no. The remaining 1 character is the second character, which is the current character. So the ways for that is ways[i][1], but that's the same as the current l=1.\n\nWait, this is getting very tangled. Let me think of a concrete example.\n\nSuppose the substring is \"11\" (valid). Then:\n\nways = 1 (split into two 1s) + 1 (split into one 11) = 2.\n\nBut how do I compute this from previous data?\n\nFor the first 1 character, which is \"1\", it's valid. The number of ways for that is 1. Then, the remaining 1 character is \"1\", which is also valid. So the ways for that split is 1 * 1 = 1. Then, if the entire is valid, add 1. Total is 2.\n\nSo the formula for l=2 is:\n\nways = (if first 1 is valid, then ways_1 (ways for first 1) * ways_1 (ways for remaining 1)) + (if entire 2 is valid, then 1).\n\nBut how do I get the ways for the remaining 1?\n\nIn this case, the remaining 1 is the substring of length 1 ending at i (the current position). Wait, no. The remaining 1 is the substring of length 1 ending at i-1 + 1 (since the first k=1 is the first character of the current 2-length substring). Wait, the current substring is of length 2 ending at i. The first k=1 character is the first character of this substring, which is at position i-1. The remaining part is the second character, which is at position i. So the ways for the remaining part is ways[i][1], which is 1 if valid.\n\nBut how do I get that? For the current i, when calculating ways[i][2], I can refer to ways[i][1] for the remaining part. However, this seems to require knowing the ways for the same i, which is not yet computed.\n\nThis suggests that for each l, the calculation of ways[i][l] depends on ways[i][l-k], which is not available yet. So this seems like a dead end.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the maximum l is 4, perhaps for each new character, we can compute the ways for l=1 to 4 by checking all possible splits. For example:\n\nFor the current i, and l=1:\n\nCheck if the substring is valid. If yes, ways[i][1] = 1.\n\nFor l=2:\n\nCheck if the substring is valid. If yes, then ways[i][2] = (ways[i-1][1] if the first 1 character is valid) + (1 if the entire 2 is valid). Wait, but how do I know if the first 1 character is valid? Well, the first 1 character is the substring ending at i-1 of length 1. So if ways[i-1][1] is 1, then that means the first character is valid. But ways[i-1][1] is 1 only if that substring is valid. So, the number of ways for splitting the first 1 character is 1 if it is valid. So for the split into 1 and 1, the number of ways is 1 * 1 = 1. Then, if the entire 2 is valid, add 1. So total ways[i][2] = 1 (if first 1 is valid) + 1 (if entire 2 is valid).\n\nBut how to compute if the first 1 is valid? Well, the first 1 character is the substring ending at i-1 of length 1. So if that substring is valid, then ways[i-1][1] is 1. So, the contribution from splitting into first 1 and then the second 1 is ways[i-1][1] * 1 (since the remaining 1 is valid, which is ways[i][1] = 1 if valid).\n\nWait, but the remaining 1 is the current character. So, for the current i, when we're calculating ways[i][2], the remaining 1 character is the current character. So its validity is determined by whether the substring of length 1 ending at i is valid. Which is ways[i][1] = 1 if valid.\n\nSo for the split into first 1 and then the second 1, the number of ways is ways[i-1][1] (number of ways to split the first 1) multiplied by ways[i][1] (number of ways to split the second 1)? No, because the second 1 is a single character. So if the first 1 is valid, and the second is valid, then there's one way to split into two parts. So the contribution is 1 (ways[i-1][1]) * 1 (ways for the remaining 1) = 1. But if the first 1 is not valid, then this contribution is zero.\n\nBut how to determine if the first 1 is valid? Well, the first 1 is the substring ending at i-1 of length 1. So if ways[i-1][1] is 1, then it's valid.\n\nSo, for l=2, the number of ways is:\n\ncontrib = 0\n\nif the first 1 is valid (ways[i-1][1] == 1), then contrib += 1 * 1 (ways for the remaining 1 is 1 if valid).\n\nif the entire 2 is valid, contrib += 1.\n\nThus, ways[i][2] = contrib.\n\nBut how to determine if the entire 2 is valid? Well, we have to check if the substring of length 2 is in the allowed set.\n\nSimilarly, for l=3, the ways[i][3] is calculated by checking for splits into:\n\nk=1: first 1 valid → ways[i-1][1] * ways[i][2] ?\n\nWait, no. The remaining length is 3 - 1 = 2. So the remaining substring is the substring of length 2 ending at i-1 + 1 = i-1 + 1 = i? No. The current substring is of length 3 ending at i. Splitting into first 1 and then remaining 2 characters. The remaining 2 characters are the substring from i-1 to i. Which is the same as the substring ending at i of length 2. So ways[i][2].\n\nWait, no. The remaining 2 characters are the substring starting at position i-1 (since the first k=1 is from i-2 to i-2 (assuming the current substring is i-2, i-1, i). So the remaining is i-1, i, which is length 2. But how to get the ways for that substring? It's ways[i][2], which is what we're trying to calculate. So this seems like a circular dependency.\n\nThis suggests that for larger l, the calculation depends on ways for the same i, which makes it impossible to compute in a straightforward way.\n\nHmm. This seems really challenging. Let me think of another approach.\n\nSince the maximum length of the substring is 4, and we need to consider all possible substrings ending at the current position, perhaps for each new character added, we can generate all possible valid substrings ending at this position, and for each of them, calculate the number of ways to split them using a helper function that checks all possible splits for that particular substring.\n\nFor example, for a substring T of length l, the number of ways to split it is:\n\ndef count_ways(T):\n    if T is in forbidden: return 0\n    if len(T) == 0: return 1\n    total = 0\n    for k in 1 to len(T):\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a string S in Morse code after each modification.
