The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The problem says that we have a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair of districts. We need to remove k districts such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And then output the k districts to remove in increasing order.\n\nHmm. So the key is to select n - k districts that form a connected subtree, and maximize the sum. Since each district's value is 2^i, which increases exponentially with i, we want to keep as many higher-numbered districts as possible. But the challenge is ensuring that they form a connected component.\n\nWait, because the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible numbers. So perhaps the optimal approach is to keep the largest (n - k) districts, but ensure they are connected. But how?\n\nBut maybe the problem is similar to finding a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. However, since the tree is connected, perhaps we need to find a subtree that includes the highest possible nodes, possibly starting from the highest node and then adding necessary nodes to keep it connected.\n\nAlternatively, think about this: since 2^i increases rapidly, the best strategy is to keep the highest possible nodes. So the optimal solution would be to include the largest (n - k) nodes, but make sure they form a connected subtree. If they are connected, then that's the best. Otherwise, we need to find the largest possible subset of nodes that are connected and have as many high numbers as possible.\n\nBut how do we find that?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that the maximum sum is achieved by keeping the largest (n -k) districts. However, if those districts are not connected, we need to remove some of them and include lower-numbered ones to connect them. But how to find which ones?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the districts that are removed can't be part of the connected component. So the remaining districts must form a connected subtree. So the problem reduces to selecting a subtree of size (n -k) with maximum possible sum of 2^i. Since 2^i is strictly increasing with i, the maximum sum is achieved by including the largest possible nodes. But the question is whether those nodes are connected.\n\nSo here's an idea: the optimal set is the largest (n -k) nodes, but if they are connected, then that's the answer. If not, then we need to find a way to include as many of the largest nodes as possible while keeping the subtree connected.\n\nBut how to check if the largest (n -k) nodes are connected? Well, maybe we can model this as a tree and find the minimal subtree that contains all the largest nodes. However, that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, think about this: since the nodes are numbered from 1 to n, and their values increase with their number, we want to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to keep the nodes with numbers from (some value) up to n, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the approach is to start from the largest node (node n), and then greedily add the largest possible nodes that are connected to the existing subtree. But how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as choosing which nodes to exclude. Since we need to remove k nodes, and the ones we remove should be the ones that are not in the optimal subtree. So the optimal subtree is the one that includes the largest possible nodes. So perhaps we can model this as building a subtree that includes the largest (n -k) nodes, and then checking if they form a connected component. If not, then we need to find which nodes to keep and which to remove.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAnother approach: since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible nodes, perhaps the optimal subtree is formed by selecting the largest (n -k) nodes, and then making sure that they are connected. However, if they are not connected, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to connect them. But how?\n\nWait, but maybe the largest (n -k) nodes form a connected subtree. For example, if the tree is a straight line from 1 to n, and we need to remove k nodes, then the largest (n -k) nodes are the ones from (k+1) to n, which are connected if the tree is a chain. But in general trees, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: the optimal set of nodes is the largest (n -k) nodes, but we need to check if they form a connected subtree. If they do, then we can remove the others. If not, then we need to find which nodes to remove from the largest ones to make them connected, but that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal subtree is formed by taking the largest (n -k) nodes, and then pruning the tree to include them. Wait, but how to do that?\n\nAnother thought: since the tree is connected, any subtree that includes the largest node (n) must be connected through some path. So perhaps the optimal way is to include node n, and then include as many of the larger nodes as possible, ensuring that they are connected.\n\nBut how to find the minimal set of nodes to remove?\n\nLet me think of an example. Take the first sample input:\n\nn=6, k=3. So we need to keep 3 nodes. The largest 3 nodes are 4,5,6. Are they connected? Let's see the tree structure:\n\nThe input is:\n\nEdges:\n\n2-1\n\n2-6\n\n4-2\n\n5-6\n\n2-3.\n\nSo the tree looks like:\n\nNode 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. Node 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo nodes 4,5,6: node 4 is connected to 2, node 6 is connected to 2 and 5. So 4 and 6 are connected through node 2. So 4,6,5 are connected. So yes, the three largest nodes (4,5,6) are connected. Then why is the sample output removing 1,3,4? Wait, the sample output says that the answer is to remove 1,3,4. That leaves 2,5,6. Which sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 +32 +64 = 100. But if we kept 4,5,6, then the sum would be 16 + 32 +64 = 112. Which is larger. But according to the sample explanation, the answer is 100. Wait, this suggests that I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, what's the sample input? The first input is:\n\n6 3\n\nEdges:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3.\n\nSo the tree is:\n\nLet me draw the tree:\n\nNode 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. Node 6 is connected to 5. So the tree has node 2 as a central hub.\n\nIf we remove 1,3,4, then the remaining districts are 2,5,6. Which are connected via 2-6-5 and 2 is connected to 5 via 6. So that's connected. The sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 4 +32 +64= 100.\n\nBut if we remove 1,3,5, then the remaining are 2,4,6. Which are connected through node 2. Sum is 4 + 16 + 64 = 84, which is less than 100. But what about if we remove 1, 3, 5? No, the sample output says that the correct answer is removing 1,3,4. But why can't we remove 1,3,5 and keep 2,4,6?\n\nWait, but the sample explanation says that the maximum sum is 100. But why can't we get higher?\n\nWait, what if we remove 1, 2, 3? Then the remaining are 4,5,6. Are they connected? Let's see: node 4 is connected to 2 (which is removed), so no. So the remaining nodes would be 4,5,6. But 4 is not connected to 5 or 6. So that's not a connected component. Hence, that's invalid.\n\nSo the problem is that even though 4,5,6 are the three largest nodes, they are not connected. Because node 4 is connected to node 2, which is removed. So the only way to have 4,5,6 connected is to have node 2 included. But if we need to keep 3 nodes, and including 4,5,6 requires including node 2, which would make the total nodes 4 (2,4,5,6), but we can only keep 3. So that's not possible. Hence, we have to choose between keeping some of the higher nodes and including the necessary nodes to connect them.\n\nSo in this case, the optimal choice is to keep 2,5,6. Which are connected. Their sum is 4+32+64=100. Alternatively, if we could keep 2,4,6, sum is 4+16+64=84. Or 2,5,6 is better.\n\nSo the problem is that the largest (n -k) nodes may not be connected. Thus, we need to find the subset of (n -k) nodes that are connected and have the maximum sum. Since the sum depends on the node numbers, the optimal approach is to include as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nSo how do we find such a subset?\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to perform a greedy selection starting from the highest-numbered nodes. Let's think of it as building a subtree that includes the largest possible nodes, and ensuring connectivity.\n\nOne possible method is to consider the nodes in order from highest to lowest. We want to include as many as possible, but ensure that they are connected. So we can model this as a problem where we start with the largest node, and then add nodes that are connected to the existing subtree.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as selecting a subtree that includes the largest (n -k) nodes. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the optimal subtree must contain the node with the highest number (n), because otherwise, we could replace any node in the subtree with n, which has a higher value. So the optimal subtree must include node n. Similarly, once we include node n, the next highest nodes that are connected to it or to the existing subtree.\n\nThis suggests that we can build the subtree by starting with node n, then adding the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree. This way, we can ensure that the subtree remains connected and includes as many high-value nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThis sounds like a BFS or DFS approach, but with a priority on selecting higher-numbered nodes. However, since we need to select exactly (n -k) nodes, perhaps we can use a priority queue approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees. We can think of the problem as building a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, starting from node n. We can use a priority queue (max-heap) to select the next node to add, which is the highest-numbered node adjacent to the current subtree. However, since the tree is connected, this approach may work.\n\nBut how to manage the selection of nodes. Let me think.\n\nStart with node n. We need to collect (n -k) nodes. Initially, we have 1 node. We need to collect (n -k -1) more. For each step, we can look for the highest-numbered node not yet in the subtree, which is adjacent to the current subtree. Add that node to the subtree. Repeat until we have collected enough nodes.\n\nThis way, we will always add the highest possible nodes that are connected to the existing subtree.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nWe can model this as follows:\n\n- We have a priority queue (max-heap) that holds the nodes adjacent to the current subtree, which are not yet included. Initially, we add all neighbors of node n into the heap.\n\n- We also maintain a visited set to track which nodes are already in the subtree.\n\n- We start with node n as part of the subtree. Then, for each step, we take the highest-numbered node from the heap. If it's not in the subtree, we add it to the subtree, and then add all its neighbors (not in the subtree) to the heap.\n\nBut wait, this is similar to a BFS where we always select the next highest node. However, since the tree is connected, this process will collect the highest possible nodes, ensuring that the subtree is connected.\n\nOnce we have selected (n -k) nodes, the rest are to be removed. The nodes that are not selected are the ones to be removed. But we need to output the k nodes to remove, sorted in increasing order.\n\nBut how does this approach ensure that the maximum sum is achieved?\n\nBecause in each step, we are adding the highest possible node that can be connected to the existing subtree. This way, the sum is maximized by including as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nLet me test this approach on the first sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=6, k=3. So we need to select 3 nodes.\n\nStart with node 6. It's added to the subtree. Now, we need to add 2 more nodes.\n\nThe neighbors of 6 are 2 and 5. So the priority queue has 5 and 2. The highest is 5. Add 5 to the subtree. Now, the subtree has nodes 6 and 5. Now, we need to add one more node. The neighbors of 5 are 6 (already in the subtree). The neighbors of 5's neighbors are 6, which is already in the subtree. Also, the neighbors of 6 are 2 and 5. So the next candidates are 2. So the priority queue now has 2. We add 2 to the subtree. Now the subtree has 6,5,2. Now we have selected 3 nodes. So the nodes to keep are 2,5,6. Which matches the sample's answer. So the nodes to remove are 1,3,4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose n=4, k=1. So we need to keep 3 nodes. The maximum sum is 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 = 28. But if the tree is 1-2-3-4, then the subtree is connected. So the nodes to remove are 1.\n\nBut according to the algorithm, start with 4. Add its neighbor 3. Then add 2. Then the subtree is 4,3,2. So the nodes to remove are 1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=4, k=2. Need to keep 2 nodes. Start with 4. Then pick the highest neighbor. Suppose the tree is 1-2-3-4. Then neighbors of 4 is 3. Add 3. Now we have 2 nodes. So the nodes to keep are 3 and 4. Sum is 2^3 + 2^4 = 24. Which is better than keeping 4 and 2 (sum 2^2 + 2^4= 20) or 4 and 1 (sum 2^1 + 2^4= 18).\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nThus, the plan is:\n\n- Build the tree as an adjacency list.\n\n- Use a max-heap (priority queue) to select the next node to add to the subtree. The initial node is n.\n\n- Keep track of visited nodes (those in the subtree).\n\n- While the size of the subtree is less than (n -k), extract the max node from the heap. If it's not visited, add it to the subtree, mark it as visited, and add all its neighbors to the heap.\n\nWait, but this approach may not work correctly. Because when you add a node to the heap, you may have multiple entries for the same node. However, since we check if the node is already visited, we can avoid processing it again.\n\nBut the problem is that the priority queue may have multiple entries for the same node, but once it's processed (i.e., added to the subtree), the other entries can be ignored.\n\nThis is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, where we can have multiple entries in the priority queue for the same node, but once it's processed, we ignore the rest.\n\nSo the steps for the algorithm are:\n\n1. Read the tree and build an adjacency list.\n\n2. Initialize a max-heap (priority queue). Since Python's heapq is a min-heap, we can insert negative numbers to simulate a max-heap.\n\n3. Start with node n. Add it to the heap, and mark it as visited.\n\n4. While the size of the subtree (visited nodes) is less than (n -k):\n\n   a. Pop the node with the maximum value from the heap.\n\n   b. If it's already visited, skip.\n\n   c. Mark it as visited.\n\n   d. Add all its neighbors to the heap (if not already visited).\n\n5. Once the subtree is built, collect all the nodes not in the visited set. These are the ones to remove.\n\n6. Sort them in increasing order and output.\n\nBut wait, how do we ensure that the heap is properly filled with the neighbors?\n\nLet me think again. For example, in the first sample, when we start with node 6. The heap has 6. We pop 6, mark it as visited. Then add its neighbors (2 and 5) to the heap. The heap now contains 5 and 2. Next, we pop 5, add it to the subtree, then add its neighbors (6, which is already visited, and nothing else). Then the heap has 2. Then we pop 2, add to the subtree. Now the subtree has 3 nodes (6,5,2). So done.\n\nYes. So this approach works.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this efficiently in Python, given that n can be up to 1e6.\n\nBut using a priority queue with O(n log n) time is acceptable, since for n=1e6, log n is about 20, so 1e6 * 20 is 2e7 operations, which is manageable.\n\nBut in Python, using a heap for this may be feasible.\n\nBut for large n, the heap can be very big. However, the algorithm is O(m log n), where m is the number of edges. Since the tree has n-1 edges, m is O(n). So overall, the time complexity is O(n log n), which is acceptable for n up to 1e6.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, read n and k. Then read n-1 edges. Then build the adjacency list.\n\nThen, perform the above steps.\n\nImplementing the priority queue as a max-heap. Since Python's heapq is a min-heap, we can push negative numbers.\n\nBut for the initial step, we push -n into the heap. Then, when popping, we get the smallest negative (i.e., the largest node).\n\nBut in the code, we need to track which nodes are visited. So:\n\nInitialize a visited array (or set) of size n+1 (since nodes are 1-based).\n\nThen:\n\nimport heapq\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nadj = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n\nfor _ in range(n-1):\n\n    a, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n    adj[a].append(b)\n\n    adj[b].append(a)\n\nvisited = [False] * (n+1)\n\nheap = []\n\n# Start with node n\n\nheapq.heappush(heap, -n)\n\nvisited[n] = True\n\ncount = 1\n\nwhile count < (n -k):\n\n    current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n    if visited[current]:\n\n        continue\n\n    visited[current] = True\n\n    count +=1\n\n    for neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n        if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n            heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\nOnce this loop is done, the visited array marks the nodes that are kept. The nodes not visited are the ones to be removed.\n\nThen collect all nodes not in visited, sort them, and print.\n\nWait, but the code may have a problem. Because when we push the neighbors into the heap, they may be pushed multiple times. For example, if a node is pushed into the heap multiple times, but once it's visited, the other entries in the heap are ignored.\n\nBut that's okay, because the first time the node is popped from the heap, it's marked as visited, and subsequent pops of the same node will be skipped.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=6, k=3. So n -k = 3.\n\nStart with node 6. Push -6 into heap. visited[6] = True. count is 1.\n\nLoop until count reaches 3.\n\ncount is 1 < 3:\n\npop -6 → current =6. It is already visited. So continue.\n\nThen, push its neighbors: 2 and 5. So heap has -2 and -5. Wait, no. Wait, the code pushes the neighbors into the heap. For node 6, the neighbors are 2 and 5 (assuming the adjacency list is built correctly). So when current is 6, after being processed (but already visited), the code loops through its neighbors. But in the code, the current is 6, which is already visited. So the code skips processing it. Wait, no. Wait, the code in the loop is:\n\ncurrent = -heapq.heappop(heap). So first, the heap has -6. Pop it, current is 6. Then, check if visited[current] is True. Yes. So skip. Then, the code proceeds to the next iteration.\n\nWait, but the code in the loop is:\n\ncurrent = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\nif visited[current] is True → continue.\n\nElse, mark as visited, count +=1, etc.\n\nBut initially, the node n (6) is marked as visited. So when we pop it from the heap, we check if it's visited. It is, so we skip. Then, the code proceeds to the next iteration. But then, how do we add the neighbors?\n\nAh, here's a mistake in the code logic. The code adds the neighbors of current to the heap only if the current node is not visited. But in the first iteration, the current node (6) is already visited, so the code skips adding the neighbors. So the code is wrong.\n\nWait, no. Let me re-examine the code.\n\nThe code is:\n\ncurrent = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\nif visited[current] is True → continue.\n\nElse:\n\nmark as visited, count +=1, then add neighbors to the heap.\n\nBut in the first iteration, the heap has -6. We pop it. current is 6. visited is True. So we skip. Then, the code proceeds to the next iteration. But the neighbors of 6 are not added to the heap. So the heap is empty. Then, the loop will exit. But count is 1, which is less than 3. So this is wrong.\n\nAh! So the code is incorrect. Because the initial node is added to the heap, but when we pop it, we check if it's visited. It is, so we skip. But we need to add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nWait, the code is missing the step of adding the neighbors of the current node to the heap. Because in the first iteration, the current node is 6, which is already visited. So the code skips adding its neighbors. But how do we get the neighbors of 6 into the heap?\n\nAh, the code is wrong. The code adds the neighbors of current only when current is not visited. But in the first iteration, the current is already visited, so the code doesn't add the neighbors. Thus, the heap becomes empty, and the loop terminates early.\n\nThis is a critical error.\n\nWhat's the correct approach?\n\nThe code needs to add the neighbors of the current node to the heap regardless of whether the current node is visited. But wait, no. Because the current node is popped from the heap. The code is supposed to process the current node. But in the initial setup, the current node (n) is already marked as visited. So when we pop it from the heap, we need to add its neighbors to the heap. Because even though the current node is already visited, its neighbors may not be.\n\nSo the code should add the neighbors to the heap regardless of whether the current node is visited. Wait, no. Because the current node is popped from the heap. If it's already visited, we skip processing it. But we still need to add its neighbors to the heap?\n\nNo. Because the current node is already processed. Its neighbors may or may not be processed. However, the code is designed to add the neighbors of the current node to the heap only when the current node is processed (i.e., when it is added to the subtree). But in this case, the current node is already in the subtree, so we need to add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe original code's logic was:\n\nWhen you process a node (i.e., when you pop it from the heap and it's not visited), you add it to the subtree and then add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nBut in the initial step, the node is added to the heap. But when popped, it's already visited. So the code skips adding its neighbors to the heap. Thus, the code is wrong.\n\nAh, the problem is that the initial node (n) is added to the heap, but when popped, it's already visited. But we need to add its neighbors to the heap. Because the code is designed to add the neighbors of the current node to the heap only when the current node is added to the subtree. But in this case, the current node is already in the subtree. So how to handle that?\n\nThe correct approach is: whenever a node is popped from the heap, regardless of whether it's visited or not, we need to add its neighbors to the heap. Wait, no. Because the heap is used to track candidate nodes to be added to the subtree. So when a node is popped from the heap, if it's not visited, we add it to the subtree, and then add its neighbors to the heap. But if it's already visited, we do nothing except possibly add its neighbors again. Wait, no. Because the node is already in the subtree. Adding its neighbors again is redundant, but harmless.\n\nBut how to ensure that the neighbors are added to the heap?\n\nThe mistake in the code is that the code adds the neighbors of the current node to the heap only when the current node is not visited. But in the initial case, the current node is visited, but we need to add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nSo the code needs to be modified to add the neighbors to the heap even when the current node is already visited.\n\nBut that's not correct. Because the current node is already in the subtree, and adding its neighbors to the heap would allow them to be considered for addition to the subtree.\n\nBut the code currently does not do that. Let me think again.\n\nLet me re-express the algorithm:\n\nInitially, the heap contains the starting node (n). The visited array is marked for n. Then, in the loop:\n\nWhile the count is less than required:\n\n   Pop the node with the maximum value from the heap.\n\n   If it's not visited:\n\n       add it to the subtree (mark as visited, increment count)\n\n       add all its neighbors to the heap.\n\n   else:\n\n       do nothing.\n\nBut in the initial case, when we pop the node (n), which is already visited, we do nothing. Thus, the neighbors of n are never added to the heap. Hence, the code fails.\n\nThus, the code needs to be adjusted so that when we pop a node from the heap (whether visited or not), we add its neighbors to the heap. But that's not correct, because adding the neighbors to the heap when the node is already visited would be redundant.\n\nWait, no. Because the neighbors may not have been added to the heap before. For example, in the initial case, the node n is popped, and its neighbors are not in the heap. So even though the node is already visited, we need to add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternative approach: whenever a node is popped from the heap, regardless of whether it's visited or not, we check if it's not visited. If not, we add it to the subtree and add its neighbors to the heap. Otherwise, do nothing.\n\nBut in this case, the code would not add the neighbors of the initial node to the heap. Because the initial node is popped and is already visited.\n\nSo how to fix this? The problem is that the initial node is in the heap, but when popped, its neighbors are not added to the heap.\n\nThus, the code needs to add the neighbors of the current node to the heap, but only when the current node is added to the subtree.\n\nBut in the initial case, the current node is already added to the subtree. So, when we pop it from the heap, we need to add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nBut how to do that? Because the code currently only adds the neighbors when the current node is not visited.\n\nAh! Here's the mistake. The code should add the neighbors of the current node to the heap regardless of whether the current node is visited. Because the current node is part of the subtree, and its neighbors may be candidates for inclusion.\n\nWait, but in the code, the current node is popped from the heap. If it's not visited, we add it to the subtree and add its neighbors. If it's already visited, we don't do anything. But in the initial case, the current node (n) is already visited. So we need to add its neighbors to the heap, but the code doesn't do that.\n\nSo the code should add the neighbors of the current node to the heap, regardless of whether the current node is visited. But that would cause unnecessary additions to the heap. However, since the code checks for visited status when popping, it's safe.\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nWhenever a node is popped from the heap, regardless of whether it's visited or not, we add its neighbors to the heap. But only if the current node is not visited, we add it to the subtree and increment the count.\n\nWait, but adding the neighbors of the current node to the heap is needed only if the current node is part of the subtree. Because the current node is part of the subtree, its neighbors are potential candidates for inclusion.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\ncurrent = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\nif not visited[current]:\n\n   mark as visited\n\n   count +=1\n\n   for neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n       if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n           heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\nBut this way, when the current node is popped from the heap, and it's not visited, we add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nBut in the initial case, the current node is n, which is already visited. So the code skips adding its neighbors.\n\nSo the problem is that the initial node (n) is added to the heap, but when it's popped, it's already visited. Thus, its neighbors are not added to the heap. Hence, the heap is empty, and the code can't proceed.\n\nTo fix this, the initial node should be added to the heap, and when it's popped, even though it's already visited, we need to add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nBut how?\n\nAh, here's the correct approach:\n\nThe code should add the neighbors of the current node to the heap regardless of whether the current node is visited. Because the current node is part of the subtree (either already visited or not). But this is not correct. Because the current node may not be part of the subtree. For example, if the current node is not visited, then it's being added to the subtree, and its neighbors are added to the heap. If the current node is already visited, it's part of the subtree, and its neighbors are added to the heap.\n\nWait, but in the initial case, the node n is added to the heap. When it's popped, it's already visited. So we need to add its neighbors to the heap. But the code currently does not do that.\n\nThus, the code should add the neighbors of the current node to the heap in both cases (whether it's visited or not). But that's not correct, because if the current node is not visited, then we have just added it to the subtree, and we need to add its neighbors to the heap. If the current node is already visited, we have already added its neighbors to the heap earlier.\n\nBut in the initial case, the current node (n) is added to the heap. When popped, it's already visited. So we need to add its neighbors to the heap. But how?\n\nThe solution is to modify the code: after popping the current node, regardless of whether it's visited, add its neighbors to the heap if they are not visited. But this would be redundant in some cases.\n\nAlternatively, the code should add the neighbors to the heap whenever the current node is processed, whether it's added to the subtree or not. But how to ensure that?\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to always add the neighbors of the current node to the heap, regardless of whether the current node is visited. But that would lead to multiple entries in the heap for the same node, which is handled by the visited array.\n\nLet me adjust the code:\n\ncurrent = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\nif not visited[current]:\n\n   mark as visited\n\n   count +=1\n\nfor neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n   if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n       heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\nThis way, even if the current node is already visited, we still process its neighbors. But this is not correct. Because the current node is popped from the heap, and even if it's already visited, we process its neighbors. For example, in the initial case, the current node is n (already visited). We process its neighbors and add them to the heap. But in this code, the 'if not visited[current]' block is skipped, but the code still processes the neighbors.\n\nWait, no. In this revised code, after popping the current node, regardless of whether it is visited or not, the code processes the neighbors. But in this case, the code is:\n\ncurrent = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\nif not visited[current]:\n\n   mark as visited\n\n   count +=1\n\nthen, for neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n   if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n       heappush(...)\n\nSo, in the initial case, current is 6, which is visited. The code skips marking it as visited and incrementing count. Then, for each neighbor, if not visited, add to heap.\n\nYes! So in this case, the code would add the neighbors of 6 to the heap. Even though current is already visited.\n\nThis is the correct approach.\n\nSo the code should be modified to:\n\nAfter popping the current node, regardless of whether it's visited, we check if it's not visited. If it's not, we add it to the subtree and increment count. Then, we add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nWait, no. The code should add the neighbors to the heap regardless of whether the current node is visited. Because the current node is part of the subtree (if it is visited) or being considered for addition (if it is not visited). So, in either case, the neighbors should be added to the heap if they are not already visited.\n\nWait, but how? For example, if the current node is not visited, we add it to the subtree. Then, we add its neighbors to the heap. But if the current node is already visited, we do not add it to the subtree, but we still add its neighbors to the heap.\n\nBut in this case, the code would add the neighbors to the heap even if the current node is already visited. However, this may be redundant, but it's safe.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\ncurrent = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n\nif not visited[current]:\n\n   visited[current] = True\n\n   count +=1\n\nfor neighbor in adj[current]:\n\n   if not visited[neighbor]:\n\n       heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n\nThis way, even if the current node is already visited, we process its neighbors and add them to the heap if they are not visited.\n\nLet me test this code on the first sample.\n\nInitial state:\n\nheap has -6. visited[6] = True (initially set? Or no?)\n\nWait, the code starts by pushing -n into the heap. Then, visited[n] is set to True?\n\nNo. Initially, the code is:\n\nheap = []\n\nheapq.heappush(heap, -n)\n\nvisited[n] = True ?\n\nNo. The initial code is:\n\nheapq.heappush(heap, -n)\n\nvisited[n] = True ?\n\nIn the previous code, the initial code was:\n\nvisited = [False] * (n+1)\n\nheap = []\n\nheapq.heappush(heap, -n)\n\nvisited[n] = True\n\ncount = 1\n\nBut that's not correct. Because when you push -n into the heap, you have to mark it as visited only when you pop it from the heap and process it. Because otherwise, if you mark it as visited before pushing into the heap, it's possible that the code will not process it properly.\n\nWait, this is a critical point. Initially, the code starts with node n, which is added to the heap. But in the code, the visited array is initialized to False. So, when the code starts, the node n is not marked as visited. Only when it is popped from the heap and processed (i.e., if not visited) is it marked as visited.\n\nBut initially, the code is:\n\nheapq.heappush(heap, -n)\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts' contestants should be removed such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. The key insight is to prioritize keeping the districts with the highest numbers since each district's fan count is exponentially increasing with its number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximize Fan Count**: Since the fan count for a district `i` is `2^i`, we aim to keep the highest-numbered districts possible.\n3. **Greedy Selection with Priority Queue**: Start from the highest-numbered district (n) and use a max-heap (priority queue) to always select the next highest-numbered district that can be connected to the current subtree. This ensures that we maintain a connected component while maximizing the sum of fans.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        adj[a].append(b)\n        adj[b].append(a)\n    \n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    heap = []\n    # Start with node n\n    heapq.heappush(heap, -n)\n    count = 0\n    \n    while count < (n - k):\n        current = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if not visited[current]:\n            visited[current] = True\n            count += 1\n        # Add all neighbors to the heap if not visited\n        for neighbor in adj[current]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n    \n    # Collect the districts to remove\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if not visited[i]:\n            result.append(i)\n    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(result))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of districts `n`, the number of contestants to remove `k`, and the adjacency list representing the tree.\n2. **Priority Queue Initialization**: A max-heap (simulated using a min-heap with negative values) is initialized with the highest-numbered district `n`.\n3. **Greedy Selection**: Using a while loop, we repeatedly extract the highest-numbered district from the heap. If it hasn't been visited yet, it is marked as visited and added to our connected component. Its neighbors are then pushed into the heap for future consideration.\n4. **Result Collection**: After selecting the required number of districts to keep, the remaining districts (those not marked as visited) are collected, sorted, and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the sum of fans by always prioritizing higher-numbered districts while maintaining connectivity through the greedy selection process.",
