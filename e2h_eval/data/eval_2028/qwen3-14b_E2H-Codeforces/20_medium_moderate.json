    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So, the task is to compute the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of length 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what conditions the c_s values must satisfy so that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. Let me think about the constraints on the c_s values and how they relate to the maximum possible size of the multiset.\n\nA beautiful multiset is a collection of binary strings of length exactly n, such that for every prefix s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix doesn't exceed c_s. The maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f, and we need to count the number of c configurations that make this happen.\n\nHmm. So for each configuration of c_s, we need to determine what's the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset. Then, we want to count those configurations where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model the maximum possible size? It seems like this is related to some kind of constraint satisfaction problem. Let's think about the constraints.\n\nFor the multiset to be beautiful, for each prefix s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s. But since each string in the multiset has length exactly n, each string contributes to all its prefixes. For example, a string of length n contributes to its prefixes of lengths 1 to n.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to building a trie where each node (prefix) has a capacity c_s, and the total number of strings in the multiset is the sum over all leaves (strings of length n) such that their inclusion doesn't violate the capacities along their paths.\n\nWait, but how does the maximum possible size relate to the capacities?\n\nThis feels similar to a problem where you have to find the maximum number of elements that can be placed in a trie without exceeding capacities on the nodes. The maximum size would then be determined by the minimum capacities along certain paths, but perhaps there's a way to model it with dynamic programming or some tree-based approach.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each node (prefix) s, the number of strings that can pass through it is limited by c_s. However, each string that passes through s also contributes to its children. So the maximum number of strings that can be placed under s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the capacities of its children.\n\nWait, that sounds familiar. Like the problem of finding the maximum number of nodes you can select in a trie such that no node exceeds its capacity, which is similar to the problem of finding the maximum flow in a tree where each node has a capacity and each path from root to leaf contributes 1 unit.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each string in the multiset corresponds to a path from the root (empty string?) to a leaf (length n). Wait, but the prefixes are all the prefixes of the strings in the multiset. So for each node (prefix), the count of strings passing through it is the number of strings in the multiset that have that prefix. This must be ≤ c_s.\n\nThe maximum number of strings in the multiset is then determined by the constraints on the prefixes. How can we model this?\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of strings that can be placed under the constraints. For each node, the number of strings that can be placed under it is limited by the minimum of c_s and the sum of the capacities of its children. Wait, but maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have a node s of length l. The number of strings that pass through s is the sum of the counts of all strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix. Each such string contributes to s and all its prefixes. So, for the maximum possible size, the constraints must be satisfied for all prefixes. How can we model the maximum possible number of strings in the multiset given the c_s values?\n\nThis feels like a problem where the maximum possible size is the minimum over all possible constraints. For example, if we have a node s, then the number of strings passing through s cannot exceed c_s. But each string that passes through s must also pass through its prefixes. So the maximum number of strings is determined by the minimal constraints along the paths.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size is the sum over all leaves (strings of length n) of 1, but constrained by the c_s values. But how to compute that?\n\nAn alternative approach: For the maximum possible size, each string in the multiset contributes 1 to all of its prefixes. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to choosing a set of strings (each of length n) such that for every prefix s, the number of strings in the set that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. The maximum possible size of such a set is the maximum number of strings we can choose under these constraints.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a trie structure, where each node has a capacity c_s. The maximum number of strings is determined by the capacities of the nodes. How can we compute this maximum?\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of paths from the root to the leaves (each path represents a string) such that for each node, the number of paths passing through it does not exceed its capacity. The maximum number of such paths is determined by the minimum capacities along the paths. But how?\n\nLet me think of it as a tree. Each node is a prefix. The root is the empty string (but in our case, the problem considers prefixes of length from 1 to n, so maybe the root is not considered here). Wait, the problem says that for all strings s of length from 1 to n. So the root is not part of the problem. The nodes are all prefixes of length 1 to n. The tree is a binary tree of depth n, where each node has two children (appending a 0 or 1).\n\nNow, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the maximum number of paths from the root to the leaves (depth n) such that for each node, the number of paths passing through it is ≤ c_s. But how to compute this?\n\nThis is a classic problem. The maximum number of such paths is equal to the sum over all leaves of the minimum capacity along the path from the root to that leaf. Wait, no. That's not correct. Because the capacities are constraints on all nodes along the path. For example, if a node has a capacity of 1, then at most one path can pass through it, which implies that all paths that go through it can't exceed that.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using dynamic programming on the trie. For each node, the maximum number of paths that can be allowed under it is the minimum between the capacity of the node and the sum of the maximum paths allowed by its children. Because, each path that goes through the node must go through one of its children. So, for a node s, the maximum number of paths that can pass through s is min(c_s, left_child_max + right_child_max).\n\nWait, this seems promising. Let's think recursively. For a leaf node (length n), the maximum number of paths passing through it is 1 (since each path ends here). But since the node is a leaf, it's not a parent of any other nodes. However, for a node of depth l < n, the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is min(c_s, max_paths_left + max_paths_right). Because each path that goes through this node must go through either the left or right child. So the maximum number of paths that can pass through this node is the minimum between its capacity and the sum of the capacities of the children's maximum paths.\n\nIf this is correct, then the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is equal to the maximum number of paths that can be selected through the trie, computed recursively as above. Therefore, for each node, the value is min(c_s, left_val + right_val), where left_val and right_val are the values of the children nodes.\n\nSo, the maximum size of the multiset is equal to the value computed at the root (the empty string?), but wait, in our problem, the root isn't part of the nodes considered. Wait, the nodes are all prefixes of length 1 to n. So the root (empty string) isn't part of the problem. However, the root's children are the prefixes of length 1. So, the maximum number of paths is the sum of the maximum paths for the root's children, but constrained by the root's capacity. But since the problem doesn't consider the root's capacity (as per the input description, the c_s are for strings of length from 1 to n), perhaps the root isn't considered here. Wait, the problem says that for every string s of length from 1 to n, the count of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s. So, the root (empty string) isn't considered here. Therefore, the root's capacity is not part of the problem. So, the maximum number of paths is determined by the capacities of the nodes starting from the prefixes of length 1.\n\nBut how do we compute the maximum number of paths given the capacities? Well, according to the earlier idea, the maximum number of paths is the value computed for the root's children (i.e., the nodes of length 1). For each node of length 1, the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is min(c_s, left + right), where left and right are the maximum paths for its children (nodes of length 2). And this continues recursively down to the leaves (nodes of length n, which have no children and thus their maximum is 1, but their capacity may limit it).\n\nWait, but for a node of length l < n, the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is min(c_s, sum of the maximum paths of its children). However, the children are of length l+1. So, for each node, we can compute this value recursively. Then, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the sum of the maximum paths for the root's children (i.e., the two nodes of length 1). But wait, no. Because the root's children are the prefixes of length 1. The maximum number of paths is the sum of the maximum paths for each of the root's children, but since each path starts with one of them. However, the root's capacity isn't part of the constraints. Therefore, the maximum number of paths is the sum of the maximum paths for each of the root's children (which are the nodes of length 1). However, since the root's capacity is not part of the problem (as per the problem statement), we don't have any constraints on the total number of paths. Therefore, the maximum number of paths is the sum of the maximum paths for each of the root's children.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting. Let me think again. Each path is a string of length n. Each path starts at the root (empty string) and goes down to a leaf. But the constraints apply to all prefixes of length 1 to n. So, for example, the root's children (prefixes of length 1) are constrained by their c_s. So, the maximum number of paths that can pass through a node of length 1 is min(c_s, ... ), and the total number of paths is the sum of the maximum paths for each of the root's children. But the root's own capacity isn't considered here, because the problem's constraints don't include it.\n\nSo, the overall maximum number of paths is the sum of the maximum values for each of the root's children (the two prefixes of length 1). However, the root's children's maximum values are computed based on their own capacities and their children.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to computing, for each possible configuration of c_s, the value of the maximum number of paths (which is the sum of the max values for the two root children) and then counting the number of configurations where this value equals exactly f.\n\nSo, the key insight is that the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the capacities of the nodes in the trie, and this can be computed recursively as min(c_s, left + right), where left and right are the computed values for the children.\n\nTherefore, our task is to count the number of ways to assign c_s values (each between 0 and k) for all binary strings s of length 1 to n, such that when we compute the maximum number of paths as described, it is exactly f.\n\nNow, how can we model this? Since n is up to 15, the total number of nodes is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, that's 2^16-2= 65534 nodes. However, for each node, we need to compute some value based on its children. This suggests that we need to find a dynamic programming approach, perhaps memoizing the possible values for each node based on its children.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 15, and each node has two children, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming in a bottom-up way.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the problem. Each node can be identified by its depth and its binary value. However, for the purpose of DP, perhaps we can model it recursively. For a node at depth l (where 1 ≤ l ≤ n), the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is m = min(c_s, left + right), where left and right are the values computed for the children (depth l+1). However, for leaves (l = n), the left and right children don't exist, so the maximum number of paths through them is 1 if c_s ≥ 1, otherwise 0? Wait, no. For a leaf node (depth l = n), there are no children. Therefore, the maximum number of paths passing through it is 1 (since each path that ends at this node contributes exactly once to it). But this is constrained by the capacity c_s. Therefore, the value for a leaf node is min(c_s, 1). Because even if c_s is larger than 1, you can't have more than one path passing through this node (since it's a leaf). Wait, no. Because the node is a leaf, but the path that ends here is counted once. So, for a leaf node, the maximum number of paths passing through it is min(c_s, 1). Because the node can't have more than one path passing through it (since each path ends here). Therefore, for a leaf node, the value is min(c_s, 1). But wait, this is only if the node is a leaf. So, for a node of depth l < n, the value is min(c_s, left + right), where left and right are the values of the children. For a node of depth l = n, the value is min(c_s, 1).\n\nBut this seems to suggest that the maximum number of paths that can pass through a node is determined by its own capacity and the sum of the capacities of its children. Therefore, the problem becomes a matter of assigning c_s values to each node, and for each node, the value depends on its children's values.\n\nBut how can we model the total maximum number of paths (which is the sum of the values of the root's children) being exactly f?\n\nThe challenge is to count the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that the computed total is exactly f.\n\nBut considering that each node's value depends on its children's values, and the dependencies form a tree structure, this seems complex. However, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, considering the nodes in a bottom-up manner.\n\nLet me think about the nodes in order of increasing depth. For example, for depth n (the leaves), their value is min(c_s, 1). For depth n-1, their value is min(c_s, left + right), where left and right are the values of their children (depth n). Then, for depth n-2, their value is min(c_s, left + right), where left and right are the values of their children (depth n-1), and so on.\n\nSo, for each node, the value depends on the choices of c_s and the values of its children. However, since the children's values depend on their own c_s and their children, this seems like a recursive structure.\n\nBut how can we compute the number of assignments of c_s such that the total maximum is f?\n\nThis seems very challenging. Let's think of the problem as a tree of nodes, and for each node, we can compute the number of possible (value, ...) combinations based on the children.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this using dynamic programming, where for each node, we track the number of ways to assign c_s values to that subtree such that the value of the node (the maximum number of paths passing through it) is a certain value. Then, combining these for the parent nodes.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's consider a subtree rooted at a node of depth l. For each possible value v (the maximum number of paths passing through this node), we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s for this subtree (including all descendants) such that the value of the node is v.\n\nBut since the value of the node depends on the children's values, we can model this recursively. For example:\n\n- If the node is a leaf (depth n), then the value is min(c_s, 1). The possible values for v are 0 or 1. For each possible choice of c_s (from 0 to k), we can determine which v it contributes to.\n\n- For non-leaf nodes (depth l < n), the value v is min(c_s, left_val + right_val), where left_val and right_val are the values of the left and right children. So, for each possible pair (a, b) of values from the left and right children, the sum a + b can be anything, and then the node's value is min(c_s, a + b). The choice of c_s must be ≥ this value (since the value is min(c_s, ...)), but actually, the value is determined by c_s and the sum of children's values. Wait, no. The value is min(c_s, a + b). So, for the node's value to be v, we have that v = min(c_s, a + b). Therefore, c_s must be ≥ v, and a + b ≥ v. But since v is the min of the two, either a + b ≥ c_s (so v = c_s) or c_s ≥ a + b (so v = a + b). Therefore, for each possible pair (a, b) of children values, the possible v for the current node depends on the choice of c_s.\n\nBut how can we model this? For a given node, given that its children have certain possible distributions of values, we can compute for each possible (a, b) pair, the possible contributions to the current node's value.\n\nBut since the node's value depends on the children's values and the choice of c_s, this seems quite involved. However, perhaps we can model this with DP states for each node, where for each possible value v of the node, we track the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's values such that the node's value is v.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a node. For the leaves, the DP is straightforward. For non-leaves, we can combine the DPs of their left and right children.\n\nLet me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. For each node, process it in order of increasing depth (from leaves up to root).\n\n2. For each node, compute a DP table where dp[node][v] is the number of ways to assign c_s values to this node and its descendants such that the value of this node is v.\n\n3. For a leaf node (depth n), the value is min(c_s, 1). So for each possible c_s (from 0 to k), the value is 0 if c_s is 0, 1 if c_s ≥ 1. Therefore, the number of ways for v=0 is the number of c_s values that are 0 (which is 1 if k ≥ 0, but since c_s can be from 0 to k, and k ≥ 1?), and for v=1, it's (k - 0) if k ≥ 1, but wait, no. Wait, the c_s can be chosen between 0 and k. So for a leaf node, the value is:\n\nif c_s >= 1 → value is 1.\n\nelse → value is 0.\n\nSo, the number of ways for v=1 is (number of c_s in [1, k]) = k - 0 (since 0 is included in the range). Wait, c_s can be 0 to k. So the number of c_s that allow value 1 is (k) if k ≥ 1, because c_s can be 1, 2, ..., k. But if k is 0, then it's zero. However, since k is given as ≥1 in the input? No, the input allows k to be 1 or higher. Wait, the input constraints say that k can be as low as 1. Wait, looking back: the input constraints for k and f are 1 ≤ k, f ≤ 2e5. So k is at least 1. Therefore, for a leaf node, the number of ways for value 1 is k (since c_s can be 1 to k, inclusive) and for value 0 is 1 (only when c_s is 0). Wait, no. Because the value is min(c_s, 1). So:\n\nif c_s is 0 → min(0, 1) = 0.\n\nif c_s is 1 → min(1, 1) = 1.\n\nif c_s is 2 → min(2, 1) = 1.\n\nSo for any c_s ≥ 1, the value is 1. Therefore, the number of ways to get value 1 is (k) (since c_s can be 1 to k), and the number of ways to get value 0 is 1 (when c_s is 0). Wait, but the range of c_s is 0 to k. So for a leaf node, the possible values are 0 or 1, and the number of ways for each is:\n\nways[0] = 1 (c_s = 0)\n\nways[1] = (k) (since c_s can be 1, 2, ..., k → total of k options)\n\nSo for a leaf node, the DP is {0: 1, 1: k} ?\n\nWait, but if k is 0, then the c_s can't be 1. But the problem says that k is at least 1. So that's okay.\n\nNow, for a non-leaf node (say, depth l < n), it has two children. Let's call them left and right. For each possible value of the left child (a), and right child (b), the sum a + b is S. The value of the current node is min(c_s, S). So, for the current node, the value v can be either S (if c_s ≥ S) or c_s (if c_s < S).\n\nBut how do we compute the number of ways for this node to have value v, considering all possibilities for c_s and the children's values?\n\nLet me think: For each possible pair (a, b) from the left and right children, we can compute S = a + b. Then, for this S, the current node's value can be any v such that v ≤ min(c_s, S). But since the value is min(c_s, S), and we need to count the number of ways for the current node to have value v, we need to consider all possible c_s values that would result in v being min(c_s, S).\n\nFor example, suppose S = 5. Then:\n\n- If c_s ≥ 5, then the value is 5. So for this case, the number of possible c_s is (k - 4) (since c_s can be 5, 6, ..., k).\n\n- If c_s < 5, then the value is c_s. So for each possible value of v (from 0 to 4), the number of c_s is 1 (since c_s = v).\n\nBut how does this fit into the DP?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\nFor the current node, iterate over all possible a (values from left child's DP) and b (values from right child's DP). For each such a and b, compute S = a + b. Then, for this S, the current node's value can be any v that is either:\n\n- v = c_s (if c_s < S), and v can be from 0 to S-1.\n\nOR\n\n- v = S (if c_s ≥ S), and c_s can be from S to k.\n\nBut since the current node's value is determined by the choice of c_s and the sum S, we need to aggregate all possibilities.\n\nHowever, since the current node's value is v, and we need to count the number of ways for this node to have value v, we can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each pair (a, b), compute S = a + b. Then, for this S, the number of ways that contribute to the current node's value v is:\n\n- If v < S: then c_s must be exactly v. So the contribution is (ways_left[a] * ways_right[b]) * 1 (since c_s can be chosen as v, which is allowed if 0 ≤ v ≤ k). However, if v exceeds k, then this is not allowed. But since v is less than S, and S can be up to ... ?\n\nWait, for example, if the left child's value is a and right is b, then S = a + b. Since each a and b are the values computed for their subtrees, which are non-negative integers. But how large can they be?\n\nWell, for the root's children (depth 1), the maximum value is the maximum number of paths, which is up to 2^n (since each path is a unique string of length n, and the constraints may allow all of them). However, since the problem requires that the maximum is exactly f, and f can be up to 2e5, perhaps we need to model the DP up to that value.\n\nBut given that n is up to 15, the maximum possible value for a node is 2^15 = 32768. For example, if all capacities are sufficiently large (≥ 2^15), then the maximum number of paths is 2^15 (all possible strings). However, if f can be up to 2e5, which is larger than 32768 (for n=15, 2^15 is 32768, which is less than 2e5), then for cases where f exceeds this, the answer would be zero. But in the problem statement, the sample input includes a case where n=6, f=23699. For n=6, the maximum possible is 2^6=64. So if f is 23699, which is larger than 64, the answer is zero. Hence, in the code, we need to check if f is larger than the maximum possible value (which is 2^n) and return zero in that case.\n\nBut first, let's proceed with the DP approach.\n\nSo, for each node, after processing its children, we compute for each possible value v, the number of ways that this node can have value v. The way to compute this is:\n\nFor each possible pair (a, b) from the left and right children, compute S = a + b. Then, for this S, the current node's value can be any v such that:\n\n- v = min(c_s, S).\n\nThe number of ways for this (a, b) pair to contribute to the current node's value is:\n\nsum over all possible c_s choices that make the node's value v, multiplied by the number of ways to have a and b.\n\nBut how to aggregate this across all possible (a, b) pairs and possible c_s choices.\n\nAlternatively, for a given S, the contribution to the current node's value v is:\n\nif v ≤ S: the number of c_s that are exactly v (if v < S) or ≥ S (if v = S).\n\nWait, no. Because:\n\nIf the current node's value is v, then:\n\nv = min(c_s, S).\n\nWhich implies that:\n\nEither:\n\nCase 1: c_s ≥ S → v = S. In this case, c_s can be any value between S and k, inclusive.\n\nCase 2: c_s < S → v = c_s. In this case, c_s can be any value between 0 and S-1, inclusive. However, for each such v, the number of c_s is 1 (since c_s is exactly v).\n\nBut how do we count the number of ways for the current node to have value v, given S?\n\nFor example, if we want the current node to have value v, then:\n\nIf v = S: the number of c_s choices is (k - S + 1) if S ≤ k, else zero.\n\nIf v < S: the number of c_s choices is 1 (if v ≤ k), else zero.\n\nBut for each (a, b) pair leading to S, the contribution to the current node's value v is:\n\nways_left[a] * ways_right[b] * (number of c_s choices that make min(c_s, S) = v).\n\nSo, for each (a, b), we can compute S, and for each possible v, accumulate the contribution from this (a, b) pair.\n\nBut since for each (a, b) pair, the S is fixed, we can precompute for that S the contributions to all possible v.\n\nSo, for the current node's DP, we can initialize it as a dictionary (or array) of zeros, and for each (a, b) pair, compute S, and then for each possible v, add the contribution.\n\nBut since for each (a, b) pair, the contribution is:\n\nways_left[a] * ways_right[b] * (number of c_s choices for this S and v).\n\nSo, the question is, for each S, how many ways are there to choose c_s such that min(c_s, S) = v.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nFor a given S and v, the number of c_s choices is:\n\nif v == S: then c_s must be ≥ S. The number of such c_s is max(0, k - S + 1) if S ≤ k. Else zero.\n\nif v < S: then c_s must be exactly v. The number of such c_s is 1 if 0 ≤ v ≤ k, else zero.\n\nBut since v can be up to S, and S can be up to ... ?\n\nBut in our DP, for each node, the possible v can be up to the maximum possible value for that node. For example, for a node at depth l, the maximum value is 2^{n - l} (since each level down halves the possibilities). However, this might not be necessary to track, but for the DP, we can track up to the maximum possible value for the entire tree, which is 2^n.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 15, 2^15 is 32768, which is manageable for DP arrays.\n\nSo, for the DP of a node, we can represent it as an array of size up to 2^15 + 1, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, for each node, during the DP computation, we can generate an array where dp[v] is the number of ways for this node to have value v, considering all possible c_s choices and the children's DPs.\n\nNow, putting this together, the plan is:\n\n- Preprocess all nodes in order of increasing depth (starting from leaves up to the root).\n\n- For each node, compute its DP based on its children's DPs.\n\nOnce we have the DP for the root's children (the two nodes at depth 1), the total maximum number of paths is the sum of their values. However, the problem requires that the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is exactly f. Wait, no. Wait, the maximum possible size is the sum of the values of the root's children. Because each path is counted once in the root's children (each path starts with one of the two prefixes of length 1). Therefore, the total maximum number of paths is the sum of the values of the two children of the root (depth 1 nodes).\n\nBut how do we compute the number of ways that the sum of the two children's values is exactly f?\n\nAh, here's another layer: after computing the DP for each node, the root's children (depth 1 nodes) each have their own DP tables. The total maximum number of paths is the sum of their values. So, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways where the sum of the two values (from the two root children) is exactly f.\n\nTherefore, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the DP for each node, as described.\n\n2. For the two root children (depth 1), take their DP tables. Let's call them dp1 and dp2. The total number of ways is the sum over all a and b such that a + b = f of (dp1[a] * dp2[b]).\n\nBut wait, the maximum possible size is the sum of the two root children's values. Therefore, the answer is the number of configurations where the sum of the two root children's values is exactly f.\n\nSo, the problem now becomes:\n\nCompute the DP for each node, and then compute the convolution of the two root children's DPs, and take the coefficient for f.\n\nBut how to handle the root children's DP?\n\nNow, considering that for each node, the DP is computed as described, and the root has two children (depth 1 nodes), each of which has their own DP tables. Then, the answer is the sum over all a and b where a + b = f of (ways for left child to have a) * (ways for right child to have b).\n\nBut since the left and right children are symmetric (both are depth 1 nodes, and their DPs are computed in the same way), the DP for each is the same. So, the number of ways for the left and right children to have a and b is (ways[a] * ways[b]).\n\nBut since the left and right children are separate nodes (they are different binary strings), their c_s values are independent. Therefore, the total number of ways is the product of their individual ways.\n\nTherefore, once we have the DP for a single depth 1 node (let's call it dp_single), then the answer is the sum over a and b where a + b = f of (dp_single[a] * dp_single[b]).\n\nBut wait, the left and right children are two distinct nodes. Each has their own c_s value. So, the DP for each is computed independently, and the total ways for the left child to have value a is dp_single[a], and similarly for the right. Thus, the total number of ways is indeed sum_{a + b = f} dp_single[a] * dp_single[b].\n\nTherefore, the overall approach is:\n\n- Compute the DP for a single node at depth 1 (but how? Because the node's DP depends on its children, which are depth 2 nodes, etc.)\n\nBut the root's children are depth 1 nodes, and their DP is computed based on their children (depth 2 nodes), which in turn depend on their children, etc. So, the entire process is to compute the DP for each node, starting from the leaves and moving up.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this DP approach efficiently.\n\nBut given that n is up to 15, and for each node, the maximum possible value is up to 2^15 = 32768, which is manageable.\n\nLet me think about how to represent the nodes. Since each node is uniquely identified by its depth and its binary value (like, for depth l, there are 2^l nodes). However, for the DP, the actual binary value doesn't matter; what matters is the depth and the structure of the tree. However, since each node has two children, and the DP for a node depends only on the DPs of its children, the structure is the same for all nodes at the same depth. Therefore, for nodes at the same depth, their DP tables are the same. Because all nodes at depth l have the same structure of children (each has two children at depth l+1, etc.), and their DP depends only on the depth and the children's DPs.\n\nWait, this is a crucial insight. All nodes at the same depth l have the same DP structure. Therefore, for a node at depth l, the DP table depends only on l and the value of k. Therefore, we can compute for each depth l, the DP table for a node at that depth, and reuse it for all nodes at that depth.\n\nThis is a huge optimization. Because instead of handling each node individually, we can compute for each depth l, the DP table for a single node at that depth, and multiply by the number of nodes at that depth (but for our problem, the root's children are two nodes at depth 1, and their DP is the same, so we can compute it once and square it in the convolution step).\n\nWait, but for the problem, the root's children are two nodes at depth 1. Each of these nodes has their own DP tables, but since they are structurally identical (same depth, same children structure), their DP tables are the same. Therefore, the DP for a node at depth l is the same for all nodes at that depth. So, for each depth l, we can compute a single DP table, which represents the number of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values for each binary string prefix such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. This involves dynamic programming (DP) on a binary trie structure and careful handling of constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: Each binary string of length up to `n` can be viewed as a node in a binary trie. The root has two children (prefixes of length 1), each of which has two children (prefixes of length 2), and so on until depth `n`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: For each depth level from `n` down to 1, compute the number of ways to assign values to prefixes such that the maximum number of paths through that node is constrained by its capacity.\n\n3. **Leaf Nodes**: For nodes at depth `n` (leaves), the value is determined by whether the capacity allows at least one path through it.\n\n4. **Non-leaf Nodes**: For non-leaf nodes, the value is determined by the minimum of its capacity and the sum of the values of its children.\n\n5. **Combining Results**: After computing DP tables for all depths, combine results for the root's children (depth 1) to find the total number of valid configurations where the sum of their values equals `f`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport itertools\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        f = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        max_val = 1 << n  # 2^n\n        if f > max_val:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        \n        # dp_table[l][v] = number of ways for a node at depth l to have value v\n        # We'll compute for each depth l, from n down to 1\n        dp = [{} for _ in range(n+2)]  # dp[depth] will hold the current dp for that depth\n        \n        # Initialize leaves (depth n)\n        depth = n\n        dp[depth] = {}\n        # For a leaf node, value is min(c_s, 1)\n        # So possible values are 0 or 1\n        # Number of ways for 0: 1 (c_s=0)\n        # Number of ways for 1: k (c_s from 1 to k)\n        dp[depth][0] = 1\n        dp[depth][1] = k\n        \n        # Process from depth n-1 down to 1\n        for depth in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            curr_dp = {}\n            # For each possible a (left child value) and b (right child value)\n            # Get the previous depth's dp (children are depth+1)\n            child_dp = dp[depth + 1]\n            # Iterate all possible a and b\n            # To optimize, collect all possible keys in child_dp\n            keys = list(child_dp.keys())\n            for a in keys:\n                for b in keys:\n                    s = a + b\n                    # Now, for this s, calculate how many c_s choices lead to each possible v\n                    # For each possible v, accumulate the count\n                    # For current node, the number of ways is (ways_left[a] * ways_right[b]) * cnt\n                    ways_left = child_dp[a]\n                    ways_right = child_dp[b]\n                    total_ways = ways_left * ways_right\n                    # Now, for this s, calculate contributions to curr_dp[v]\n                    # Case 1: v = s\n                    if s <= k:\n                        cnt = (k -
