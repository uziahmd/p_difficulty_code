For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem statement is a bit complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to calculate the number of ways to choose c_s values for all binary strings s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to do this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a beautiful multiset is. For each binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of strings of exactly length n. So, the beautiful multiset's size is the total number of strings in it, and we want the maximum possible size of such a multiset to be exactly f.\n\nThe question is about counting the number of valid assignments of c_s values that make this maximum exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nLet me think about the constraints on the c_s values. For the maximum size of the beautiful multiset to be exactly f, there must be at least one way to choose a multiset of size f that meets all the constraints, and also, no way to choose a multiset larger than f that meets the constraints.\n\nBut how do the c_s values affect this maximum?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of the constraints that the c_s must satisfy for the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset to be exactly f.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that when we choose the c_s values, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. So, the way to compute this is to find all possible assignments of c_s values such that:\n\n- The maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is at least f (so there exists a multiset of size f).\n\n- But also, it's not possible to have a multiset larger than f. So the maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this? Maybe we can think of the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset as being determined by the constraints on the c_s values.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset. How is this determined?\n\nThis seems similar to some kind of flow problem or tree structure. Because each string in the multiset contributes to all its prefixes. For example, if a string of length n is in the multiset, then all of its prefixes (from length 1 up to n) have their count incremented by 1.\n\nTherefore, the constraints are that for each prefix s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. The maximum size of the multiset is the maximum number of strings you can select such that all these constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum? It seems like a problem where we have to find the maximum number of elements (strings of length n) such that for every prefix s, the count of elements with s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis sounds like a problem where the constraints form a hierarchy. For example, the count for a longer prefix is constrained by the counts of its shorter prefixes. Because if you have a string that starts with '0', then adding that string increases the count of '0' (length 1) by 1, and also increases the count of its longer prefixes.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum possible size of the multiset is determined by the minimum of certain values across all prefixes. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a tree where each node represents a binary string. The root is the empty string (but perhaps not considered here). Each node has two children: appending 0 and 1. For each node (string s), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is the number of strings in the multiset that are in the subtree rooted at s. Wait, no. Because a string of length n that has s as a prefix would be in the subtree of s. So the count for s is the number of such strings.\n\nBut the constraints are that for each node s, the count (number of strings in the multiset with s as a prefix) is ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, to maximize the number of strings in the multiset, we need to assign as many as possible, respecting all constraints.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the maximum number of nodes (strings of length n) such that for every node s (prefix), the number of selected nodes in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how do we model this maximum?\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled using the inclusion-exclusion of constraints. For example, the maximum number of strings is the minimum of the sum of capacities along certain paths. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each string of length n contributes to all its prefixes. For example, a string s of length n contributes +1 to each of its prefixes. So the constraints are that for each prefix, the total number of strings in the multiset that pass through it is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis looks like a problem of finding the maximum number of elements (each element is a path from root to a leaf of depth n) such that for each node, the number of paths passing through it is ≤ c_s. The maximum possible number of such paths is the minimal value of the sum of capacities along some constraints. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a flow problem. Each node has a capacity c_s, which limits the number of paths that can pass through it. The problem is to find the maximum number of paths (each of length n) that can be chosen such that for each node, the number of paths passing through it does not exceed its capacity.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum? This seems like a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming. Let's think recursively. For each node, the number of paths that can pass through it is limited by c_s. However, the paths that pass through a node must also pass through its parent. Therefore, the capacity of a node must be at least the sum of the capacities of its children. Or maybe not. Wait, no. For example, if a node has two children, each can have their own capacities. But the total number of paths that pass through the parent is the sum of the paths that pass through each child. So, the capacity of the parent must be ≥ the sum of the capacities of its children. Otherwise, the parent's capacity would be exceeded.\n\nAh! This seems familiar. This is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of paths in a tree, where each node has a capacity, and the number of paths passing through a node cannot exceed its capacity. The maximum number of paths is determined by the minimum of the capacities of all nodes along the paths. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for each node, the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is limited by c_s. However, the number of paths that can pass through a node is equal to the sum of the paths that pass through its children. Therefore, for each node, the sum of the capacities of its children must be ≤ c_s. Otherwise, the capacity of the node would be exceeded.\n\nWait, but the capacity of a node is the maximum number of paths that can pass through it. Suppose a node has two children. Let's say the capacities of the children are x and y. Then, the number of paths passing through the node is x + y. Therefore, to not exceed the capacity of the node, we must have x + y ≤ c_node. Similarly, for each node, the sum of the capacities of its children must be ≤ c_node. But this seems recursive.\n\nIf that's the case, then the maximum number of paths (the maximum size of the beautiful multiset) is determined by the constraints that for every node, the sum of the capacities of its children is ≤ c_node. And the leaves (nodes of depth n) have no children. Their capacities can be anything, but since they are leaves, their sum of children is zero, which is always ≤ their c_s.\n\nBut how does this relate to the maximum number of paths? Well, the maximum number of paths would be the sum of the capacities of the children of the root node. Because the root node's capacity must be ≥ that sum. But then the root node's capacity is the upper bound. However, the actual maximum number of paths is the minimal value of the capacities of the nodes along the paths, considering their constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of paths is determined by the minimum of the capacities of all nodes, but adjusted according to their position in the tree. Alternatively, the maximum number of paths is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)} }, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For each node, the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is min(c_s, sum of the capacities of its children). But this seems unclear.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of paths is determined by the following: for each node s, the maximum number of paths that can pass through s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the capacities of its children. But how?\n\nAlternatively, consider that the maximum number of paths is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)} )? No, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a trie. Each node represents a binary string. The root is the empty string, and each level corresponds to the length of the string. The leaves are the strings of length n.\n\nTo find the maximum number of paths (strings of length n) that can be selected, such that for each node s, the number of paths passing through s is ≤ c_s.\n\nLet me think of this as a problem where each path contributes +1 to all nodes along its path. The constraints are that for each node s, the sum of all paths that pass through s is ≤ c_s.\n\nThe maximum number of such paths is determined by the constraints. How?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with the following approach: For each node, the number of paths passing through it is the sum of the number of paths passing through its children. Because each path that passes through a child also passes through the parent.\n\nTherefore, for each node s, the sum of the number of paths in the subtrees of its children must be ≤ c_s.\n\nLet me denote for each node s, the maximum number of paths that can be in its subtree. Let's call this value m_s. Then, for a node s, m_s is the sum of m_{s0} and m_{s1}, where s0 and s1 are the children of s (appending 0 and 1). However, this sum must be ≤ c_s. Therefore, m_s = min( c_s, m_{s0} + m_{s1} } )\n\nWait, but for leaves (nodes of length n), they have no children. So their m_s is 0? No, because the paths end at the leaves. Wait, perhaps m_s represents the number of paths that pass through s. For the leaves, since they are the end of the paths, each path that ends at a leaf contributes +1 to the count of paths passing through that leaf. But the m_s for a leaf would be the number of paths that end at that leaf. But for a node s of length less than n, m_s is the sum of the m values of its children. Because each path that goes through a child of s must pass through s.\n\nBut then, for a node s, m_s can't exceed c_s. So m_s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the m values of its children.\n\nBut how do we compute this for all nodes?\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming approach. Starting from the leaves and moving up to the root. For each node, the m value is min(c_s, sum of children's m values).\n\nBut the maximum number of paths (the maximum size of the beautiful multiset) is the m value of the root node. Because the root's m value is the sum of the m values of its children (if allowed by c_root).\n\nSo, given the c_s values for all nodes, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by this DP approach.\n\nBut our problem is to count the number of c_s assignments such that the maximum size (as computed by this DP) is exactly f.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nThe key observation is that for each node s, the value of c_s must be at least the sum of the m values of its children. Because m_s = min(c_s, sum_children_m). If c_s is less than sum_children_m, then m_s would be c_s, which would limit the total number of paths. However, if c_s is larger than sum_children_m, then m_s is sum_children_m, which depends on the children.\n\nBut since the problem allows us to choose the c_s values, perhaps we need to find for each node s, the constraints that c_s must be ≥ the sum of the m values of its children. Wait, but m_s is min(c_s, sum_children_m). So, if we want to maximize the total number of paths (i.e., the m_root), then the optimal choice for each c_s is to set it to at least the sum_children_m. Because otherwise, the m_s would be limited by c_s, which would reduce the total number of paths.\n\nBut since we are trying to compute the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset, given the c_s values, the maximum is achieved when for each node, c_s is at least the sum of the m values of its children. Thus, the maximum is the sum_children_m of the root node, which is determined by the c_s values of the nodes.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is equal to the sum of the m values of the root's children, but constrained by the root's c_s. So, the maximum is determined by the minimal value along the paths from the root to the leaves.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that for each node s, the value of c_s is chosen to be at least the sum of the m values of its children. Then, m_s is equal to the sum of the children's m values. Thus, the maximum size is the sum of the root's children's m values, which is m_root.\n\nBut if for some node s, the c_s is less than the sum of the children's m values, then m_s is c_s, which would reduce the maximum size.\n\nTherefore, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the minimal value of the c_s values along certain paths. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum size is determined by the following: for each node s, the maximum number of paths that can pass through it is the minimum of c_s and the sum of the children's max paths. Therefore, the overall maximum is the value of the root's m, which is the minimum of c_root and the sum of the children's m values.\n\nBut how do we compute this for all possible c_s assignments?\n\nThe problem requires us to count the number of c_s assignments (each c_s is between 0 and k, inclusive) such that when you compute the maximum size using this DP approach, the result is exactly f.\n\nSo, the challenge is to find all possible assignments of c_s (each 0 ≤ c_s ≤k) such that the maximum size is exactly f.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently given that n can be up to 15, which implies that the number of nodes is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^{n+1} - 2. For n=15, this is 2^16 - 2 = 65534, which is manageable for some dynamic programming approaches, but perhaps not for brute force.\n\nBut since n is up to 15, the number of nodes is 2^1 + ... + 2^15 = 2^16 - 2 = 65534. For each node, c_s can be up to k (up to 2e5). So, even if we could find a way to model the constraints, the state space might be too large.\n\nAlternative approach: For the maximum size to be exactly f, the constraints must be such that:\n\n- The maximum possible size is at least f. So, there exists at least one way to choose the multiset of size f.\n\n- The maximum possible size is not more than f. So, no way to choose a multiset of size f+1.\n\nBut how to model this with the c_s values?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum size is determined by the DP approach. Let's denote that for each node, the value of the maximum number of paths that can be in the subtree rooted at s is m_s, computed as min(c_s, sum of m_children). The overall maximum is m_root.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s (each 0 ≤ c_s ≤k) such that m_root equals exactly f.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think recursively. For each node, the value of m_s depends on the c_s and the m values of its children.\n\nBut since the nodes form a tree (a binary trie), perhaps we can process them in a bottom-up manner.\n\nLet me think of the nodes ordered by their length. For example, nodes of length n (the leaves) have no children. Then nodes of length n-1, etc., up to the root (length 0, but perhaps not considered here).\n\nFor each node, the m_s depends on the c_s and the m values of its children.\n\nBut for the leaves (nodes of length n), they have no children. So their m_s is 0, since there are no paths passing through them beyond themselves. Wait, no. Because the paths end at the leaves. So for a leaf node s (of length n), the number of paths passing through s is the number of paths that end at s. But since the multiset is made of exactly those paths (each is a string of length n), the m_s for a leaf is the number of paths in the multiset that end at s. However, since the m_s for a node s is the sum of the m values of its children. But for leaves, there are no children, so the sum is 0. But this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps my previous understanding was incorrect. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nEach path in the multiset is a string of length n. For a node s of length l (l ≤n), the number of paths in the multiset that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of paths in the multiset that are in the subtree rooted at s. For example, for the root node (empty string), the number of paths is the total number of paths in the multiset. For a leaf node (length n), the number of paths that have it as a prefix is exactly the number of paths that are equal to it (since the path is of length n).\n\nBut how does the m_s value relate to this? Let me think of m_s as the maximum number of paths that can be in the subtree rooted at s, given the constraints of the c values. Then, for the leaves, the maximum number of paths in their subtree is the number of paths that can be added, but since the subtree of a leaf is just the leaf itself. So the maximum number of paths in the subtree is 1 per path, but constrained by c_s.\n\nWait, no. For a leaf node s (length n), the maximum number of paths in its subtree is the number of times s can be included in the multiset. But since each path is a unique string of length n, each leaf can be included at most once. However, the c_s for s must be ≥ the number of paths that have s as a prefix. Since each path that is s has s as a prefix. So, the count for s is the number of times s is included in the multiset. Therefore, the maximum number of paths in the subtree of s is min(c_s, 1). But that seems wrong. Wait, no. The subtree of s is just the single node s. So the number of paths in the subtree is the number of times s is included in the multiset. But since each path is a unique string, the maximum number of times s can be included is 1. But the constraint for s is that the count of paths with s as a prefix (which is the number of times s is included) must be ≤ c_s. Therefore, the maximum number of paths in the subtree of s is min(c_s, 1). But this seems to imply that for leaves, m_s = min(c_s, 1).\n\nBut then for nodes of length l < n, their m_s is min(c_s, sum of m_children). Where m_children is the sum of m values of their children (each of which is a node of length l+1).\n\nBut this makes sense. Because the number of paths in the subtree of s is the sum of the number of paths in the subtrees of its children. But each of those paths must have s as a prefix. So, the total number of paths in the subtree of s is the sum of the paths in the children's subtrees. However, this total must be ≤ c_s. Therefore, m_s is min(c_s, sum_children_m).\n\nSo for the leaves (l = n), m_s is min(c_s, 1). For nodes of l < n, m_s is min(c_s, m_left_child + m_right_child).\n\nThus, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is m_root, where m_root is min(c_root, m_left_child + m_right_child). And the root's left and right children are the nodes of length 1 (0 and 1).\n\nSo, the problem now becomes: count the number of assignments of c_s (for each node s, 0 ≤ c_s ≤k) such that m_root = f.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute this efficiently.\n\nGiven that n can be up to 15, the number of nodes is O(2^n), which is acceptable for a dynamic programming approach, provided that each node's state can be represented in a manageable way.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think recursively. For each node, the value of m_s depends on the c_s and the m values of its children. For leaves (l = n), m_s = min(c_s, 1). For non-leaves, m_s = min(c_s, m_left + m_right).\n\nThe challenge is to compute for all possible combinations of c_s values, the value of m_root and count those where it is exactly f.\n\nBut since n is small (up to 15), and the number of nodes is 2^(n+1) - 2, which for n=15 is 65534, perhaps we can model this with memoization and dynamic programming.\n\nHowever, the problem is that for each node, the value of m_s depends on the choices of c_s and the m values of its children. Since the children are processed first, we can process the nodes in order of increasing depth (from leaves up to the root).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Generate all nodes in order from leaves up to the root.\n\n2. For each node, compute the possible values of m_s based on the choices of c_s and the m values of its children.\n\nBut how do we represent this in code?\n\nFor each node, we can model the possible range of m_s values. However, since the c_s can vary between 0 and k, and the m_s depends on the children's m values, this seems complex.\n\nBut perhaps for each node, we can precompute the number of ways to choose c_s and the children's configurations such that the m_s for this node is a certain value.\n\nThis sounds like a dynamic programming problem where each node's DP state is the possible value of m_s, and the number of ways to achieve it.\n\nLet me elaborate. For each node, we can compute a function dp[s][x], which represents the number of ways to assign c_s and the children's configurations such that the m_s for this node is x.\n\nFor leaves (nodes of length n), their children are none. So for a leaf node s, m_s is min(c_s, 1). So, for each possible c_s (from 0 to k), the m_s can be either 0 or 1. Specifically:\n\n- If c_s >= 1, then m_s is 1.\n\n- Else, m_s is 0.\n\nSo, the number of ways to have m_s = 1 for a leaf is (k - 0) if k >=1, else 0. Wait, no. For a leaf, the number of c_s values that lead to m_s = 1 is the number of c_s >= 1. Which is max(0, k - 0) if k >=1. Wait, the c_s can be between 0 and k. So, the number of c_s for which min(c_s, 1) = 1 is (k >= 1 ? k - 0 : 0) ?\n\nWait, if k is 0, then c_s can only be 0. So min(0,1) is 0. So for a leaf node, the number of ways to get m_s = 1 is (k >= 1 ? k - 0 : 0) ?\n\nNo. For example, if k is 5, then c_s can be 1, 2, ..., 5. That's 5 options. So the count is max(0, k - 0) if 1 is allowed. Wait, no. The count is the number of c_s values between 0 and k where min(c_s, 1) = 1. Which is equivalent to c_s >= 1. So the count is (k >= 1 ? k - 0 : 0) ?\n\nWait, the number of c_s values where c_s >= 1 is (k >= 1 ? k - 0 : 0) ?\n\nNo. Because c_s can be 0, 1, ..., k. So the number of c_s >=1 is (k >= 1 ? k - 0 : 0) ?\n\nWait, for example, if k is 2, then the possible c_s values are 0,1,2. The ones >=1 are 1 and 2 → 2 values. Which is k - 0 (since 0 is the lower bound) but only if 1 is within the range. Wait, the count is max(0, k - 0) if 1 <=k. But that's not correct. The count is max(0, k - 0) if 1 is in the range. Wait, no. The count is (k >= 1) ? (k - 0) - 0 : 0 ?\n\nNo. The number of integers from 0 to k inclusive that are ≥1 is (k - 0) - 0 if k ≥1, but subtract the count of 0. So, it's (k + 1) - 1 = k. Because the total numbers is k+1, and subtract 1 (the 0). So for k ≥1, the count is k. For example, k=2, numbers are 0,1,2. Count of >=1 is 2 → which is k=2. So yes.\n\nSo for a leaf node, the number of ways to have m_s = 1 is k if k >=1, else 0. The number of ways to have m_s = 0 is 1 (when c_s is 0).\n\nSo for each leaf node, the possible m_s is 0 or 1, and the count for each is:\n\nways_0 = 1 if c_s is 0.\n\nways_1 = k if k >=1, else 0.\n\nBut since the c_s can be chosen independently for each node, but for the leaf nodes, each has their own c_s.\n\nBut for the DP approach, for each node, we need to track the possible values of m_s and the number of ways to achieve them, considering the choices of c_s and the children's possibilities.\n\nSo for non-leaf nodes, the m_s depends on the sum of the children's m values. Let's take a non-leaf node s. Its children are left and right. For each possible combination of m_left and m_right, the sum is s_total = m_left + m_right. Then, the m_s is min(c_s, s_total). The c_s can be chosen between 0 and k. So for each possible value of s_total, the number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, s_total) is x is:\n\nIf x is the desired m_s, then:\n\nif x <= s_total: then c_s can be any value between x and k (because choosing c_s ≥x will give min(c_s, s_total) = x if x ≤ s_total. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nFor a given s_total, the value of m_s is min(c_s, s_total). So, for a fixed s_total, the possible values of m_s are between 0 and s_total. To get m_s = x, we need to choose c_s such that:\n\nif x < s_total: then c_s must be ≥x and < s_total. Wait, no. Because min(c_s, s_total) = x. So:\n\nCase 1: x = min(c_s, s_total). This can happen in two ways:\n\nEither c_s ≤ s_total and x = c_s.\n\nOr c_s ≥ s_total and x = s_total.\n\nSo, for x to be the value of m_s, we have:\n\nif x < s_total: then c_s must be exactly x. Because if c_s is larger than x but less than s_total, then min(c_s, s_total) is c_s, which would be larger than x. So, to have min(c_s, s_total) = x, x must be ≤ s_total. And for that, c_s must be exactly x if x < s_total. Or if x = s_total, then c_s can be any value ≥ x.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose s_total is fixed. For example, s_total = 5. What values of c_s would make min(c_s, 5) = x?\n\nFor x = 3: min(c_s, 5) =3. That implies that c_s must be ≥3 and ≤5? No. Because if c_s is 3, then min is 3. If c_s is 4, min is 4. So that's not possible. Wait, no. For x to be 3, the min must be exactly 3. So, that can happen if c_s is 3 and s_total ≥3. Or if s_total is 3 and c_s ≥3. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe min(c_s, s_total) = x. So:\n\nEither:\n\nx = c_s and c_s ≤ s_total → which implies x ≤ s_total.\n\nOR\n\nx = s_total and c_s ≥ s_total.\n\nSo, for a given x and s_total:\n\nIf x < s_total: then x must be equal to c_s, and c_s must be ≤ s_total. So the number of c_s values is 1 (only x) if x is in [0, k]. Otherwise, 0.\n\nIf x = s_total: then c_s must be ≥x. The number of such c_s values is max(0, k - x + 1) (since c_s ranges from x to k).\n\nSo, for a non-leaf node, given the sum of the children's m values (s_total), the number of ways to choose c_s to get m_s = x is:\n\nif x < s_total:\n\n   if x is between 0 and k → 1 way.\n\nelse 0.\n\nif x == s_total:\n\n   the number of c_s ≥ x and ≤k → max(0, k - x + 1).\n\nBut note that x can't exceed s_total. So, for x > s_total, it's impossible.\n\nThus, for a non-leaf node, given that the sum of the children's m values is s_total, the number of ways to choose c_s such that m_s = x is:\n\nif x <= s_total:\n\n   if x < s_total: ways = 1 if 0 ≤x ≤k, else 0.\n\n   else (x == s_total): ways = max(0, k - x + 1).\n\nelse: 0.\n\nSo, combining this, for a non-leaf node, given that the children's sum is s_total, the number of ways to choose c_s to get m_s = x is:\n\nif x <= s_total:\n\n   if x < s_total:\n\n      if x is between 0 and k → 1.\n\n      else 0.\n\n   else:\n\n      if x is between 0 and k → (k - x + 1) if x is s_total.\n\n      else 0.\n\nelse 0.\n\nBut how do we use this in the DP?\n\nFor each node, we need to compute for all possible x (possible m_s values), the number of ways to choose c_s and the children's configurations such that m_s = x.\n\nFor the leaves, as discussed earlier, their x can be 0 or 1.\n\nFor non-leaf nodes, we can compute their possible x values based on the possible combinations of their children's x values.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\n- Process the nodes in order of increasing depth (from leaves up to root).\n\n- For each node, compute a dictionary (or array) that maps possible m_s values to the number of ways to achieve them, considering the choices of c_s and the children's possibilities.\n\nFor example, for a node with two children, left and right, we can iterate over all possible m_left and m_right values, compute their sum s_total = m_left + m_right, and then for each possible x, compute the number of ways based on the above logic.\n\nBut since the number of possible x values can be up to the sum of the children's possible x values, which for a node of depth l (length l) can be up to 2^{n - l} * something. However, since n is up to 15, and each node's m_s can be up to f (which is up to 2e5), but for the DP, we need to track all possible x values up to the maximum possible m_s.\n\nBut since f is up to 2e5, and for each node, the m_s can be up to f, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming tables that track up to f.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think for the entire problem. The final answer is the number of assignments where m_root equals exactly f. So during the DP processing, for the root node, we need to collect the number of ways that m_root equals f.\n\nSo, the steps for the code would be:\n\n1. Generate all nodes in the trie, ordered from leaves up to the root.\n\n2. For each node, compute the DP table for possible m_s values.\n\nFor leaves, the DP table is:\n\ndp_leaf[x] = number of ways to choose c_s such that m_s = x.\n\nWhich for x=0 is 1 (if c_s=0), and for x=1 is k if k >=1, else 0.\n\nFor non-leaf nodes:\n\nFor each possible combination of left and right m values, compute their sum s_total. Then, for each possible x, compute the contribution to the current node's dp[x].\n\nBut how to combine the left and right possibilities?\n\nFor each node, the left and right children are processed before the node itself. So, for each node, we can iterate through all possible m_left and m_right values, multiply the number of ways for left and right (ways_left * ways_right), compute s_total = m_left + m_right, and then for each x, add to the current node's dp[x] the number of ways to choose c_s that would make m_s =x given s_total.\n\nBut since the possible m_left and m_right can be up to some maximum value, and for each node, the possible x can be up to that maximum, this seems feasible.\n\nBut with n up to 15, the number of nodes is 2^1 + ... + 2^15 = 2^16 - 2 = 65534. For each node, the possible x values can be up to f (since we need the final answer for the root to be f). However, for intermediate nodes, their x can be up to higher values than f, but since the root's x must be exactly f, perhaps we can cap the x values up to f.\n\nWait, but for a node higher up in the tree, the sum of its children's m values could be larger than f, but then the node's m_s is min(c_s, sum_children). So, if sum_children is larger than f, but the c_s is chosen to be f, then the node's m_s would be f. So, during the DP processing, we need to track all possible x values up to the maximum possible, which could be up to f (since the root's x is exactly f). However, for nodes higher up, their m_s can be up to higher values, but if the root's m_s is f, then during the processing, the higher nodes may have m_s values larger than f, but then their parent nodes would have to choose c_s to cap it down to f.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nThe problem is that for each node, the possible x values can be up to the maximum possible m_s for that node. However, given that the root's m_s must be exactly f, perhaps during the DP processing, we can cap the x values up to f, because any higher value would not contribute to the root's m_s being exactly f. But this is not necessarily true. For example, a node higher up could have m_s larger than f, but its parent node's c_s is chosen to cap it down to f. Therefore, during the DP processing, we need to track all possible x values up to the maximum possible sum for each node.\n\nBut given that f can be up to 2e5, and n up to 1",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values for each binary string such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. This involves dynamic programming (DP) on a binary trie structure and careful handling of constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Binary Trie Structure**: Represent all binary strings of lengths from 1 to `n` as nodes in a binary trie. Each node corresponds to a binary string.\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use DP to compute the number of valid configurations for each node. The DP state tracks the number of ways to achieve a certain maximum count of paths through each node.\n3. **Bottom-Up Processing**: Process nodes starting from the leaves (strings of length `n`) up to the root (empty string). For each node, compute the number of valid configurations based on its children's DP states.\n4. **Constraints Handling**: For each node, determine how the choice of `c_s` affects the maximum count of paths through that node, considering both its children and its own constraints.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        f = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        # Precompute all nodes in order from leaves to root\n        # Each node is represented by its depth and its value (as a binary string)\n        # But since we don't need the actual string, just the depth, we can generate them\n        # We can represent nodes by their depth and position in the tree (left/right)\n        # However, for processing, we can generate all nodes in BFS order from leaves up\n\n        # We need to process nodes level by level, from depth n down to 0\n        # For each depth l from n down to 1, process all nodes at that depth\n        # Each node at depth l has two children at depth l+1 (except for leaves)\n\n        # Generate all nodes in order from leaves (depth n) to root (depth 0)\n        # For each depth l, there are 2^l nodes\n        # We can process depth from n down to 1\n\n        # We'll use a list of dictionaries, where for each node, we have a dictionary of possible m values and their counts\n        # Since the nodes are processed bottom-up, we can use a list of dictionaries for each depth\n\n        # For each node, we'll store the dp table as a dictionary or array\n\n        # Initialize a list of lists to hold the dp tables for each node\n        # We can represent nodes in a way that for depth l, we have 2^l nodes\n        # But for processing, we can generate them in BFS order\n\n        # Let's build a list of nodes, each represented by their depth and their position (for children)\n        # But since the exact structure isn't needed, we can generate for each depth l, the number of nodes is 2^l\n        # For each node, we can process it based on its children\n\n        # We'll use a memoization approach where for each depth l, we process all nodes at that depth\n        # Starting from l = n down to l = 1\n\n        max_depth = n\n        # dp_table is a list of lists, where dp_table[l][i] is the dp for the i-th node at depth l\n        # Each dp is a dictionary or list mapping possible m values to counts\n        # But for efficiency, we can use lists of size up to f + something\n\n        # Let's precompute for each depth l, the number of nodes is 2^l\n        # For each node at depth l, we can compute its dp based on its children (at depth l+1)\n\n        # We need to track for each node at depth l, the number of ways to get m = x\n\n        # Initialize a list of lists of dictionaries\n        # For each depth l, from n down to 1\n        # For each node in depth l, we have a dictionary of {x: count}\n\n        # We can use a list of lists, where each element is a dictionary\n        # But given that n can be up to 15, and for each node, the x can be up to f (or higher)\n        # However, since the final answer requires the root's m to be exactly f, we can cap the x values up to f + something\n\n        # Let's proceed step by step\n\n        # First, for leaves (depth n), each node's dp is:\n        # m can be 0 or 1\n        # For m=0: count is 1 (c_s=0)\n        # For m=1: count is k if k >=1 else 0\n\n        # So for each leaf node, the dp is [ways_0, ways_1]\n\n        # Then for nodes at depth l < n, we need to combine their children's dp\n\n        # We can represent for each node, a list where dp[x] is the number of ways to achieve m=x\n\n        # Let's create a list of lists of dictionaries.
