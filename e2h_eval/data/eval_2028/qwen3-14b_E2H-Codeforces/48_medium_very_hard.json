He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives me a and b (or R), and then a number c in base a. My job is to convert c to base b, handling Roman numerals when needed.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps. The process should be:\n\n1. Parse the input: read a and b (with possible R for b), then read the number c as a string in base a.\n2. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer (since that's easier to handle).\n3. Then convert that decimal integer to base b, which could be another base or Roman numerals.\n\nLet me think about each step.\n\nStep 1: Parsing the input. The first line has two values, a and b. But b can be 'R'. For example, in the sample input, there's '16 R\\n5' which means converting 5 (base 16) to Roman numerals. Wait no, wait: the input is a and b, then the next line is c in base a. So for the first sample input, the first case is a=10, b=2, and c is '1' in base 10. So converting 1 (base 10) to base 2 is 1. That's the output.\n\nBut for the second sample input, a=16, b=R. The c is 5 in base 16, which is 5 in decimal. Then convert that to Roman numerals, which is 'V'.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Convert c (base a) to decimal (integer).\n- Then convert that integer to base b (if b is not R) or to Roman numerals (if b is R).\n\nSo the main challenges are:\n\n- Converting the input string c (in base a) to a decimal integer. But since a can be up to 25, and c can have digits up to a-1. Also, note that for bases larger than 10, letters are used (like A for 10, B for 11, etc.) but the problem says that when converting to base b, if it's not R, then we use letters for digits above 9. However, in the input, the c is given in base a. So for example, if a is 12, then the digits of c can be 0-11, represented as 0-9, A, B, etc. Wait, but the problem says that the input for c may contain leading zeros, but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. Also, the note says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is <= 3000 in decimal and not zero. Otherwise, it's up to 1e15.\n\nSo first, how to convert the input string c into a decimal integer. Let's think about that.\n\nFor example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, that's 10 in decimal. So for each character in the string, we need to map it to its value. For digits 0-9, they are straightforward. For letters, like A, B, etc., they represent 10, 11, etc. So for example, the function to convert the string to decimal would be similar to how you parse numbers in arbitrary bases.\n\nBut how do I handle the case where the input c has letters? Like, if the input is 'A' in base 12, then it's 10. So for each character in the string, we need to find its value. So for example, for a given character, if it's a digit, it's its integer value. If it's a letter, then it's 10 + (letter - 'A').\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input c is in base a, which can be up to 25. So the digits in c can be from 0 to a-1. So for example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-15, represented as 0-9, A-F. So the input c may contain letters, but only uppercase letters? Well, the problem says that the input is given as a string. But the problem says that in the input, the c may contain leading zeros. But the input is given as a string. So I need to process the input string as a base-a number, with digits possibly including letters for values >=10.\n\nSo the first step is to parse the input string into a decimal integer. Let's think about writing a helper function for that.\n\nSo for example, for a given string s and base a, convert it to a decimal integer. Let's think about how to do that.\n\nFor each character in s:\n\n- If the character is a digit, its value is int(c).\n- Else, it's a letter (uppercase?), and its value is 10 + (ord(c) - ord('A')).\n\nWait, but what if the input uses lowercase letters? The problem says that the input is given as a string. But looking at the sample input, for example, the third case is '5 R\\n4' — the input c is '4' in base 5. So perhaps the input c is in uppercase letters for letters. But the problem statement says that the input may contain letters, but perhaps the code can assume that the letters are uppercase? Or maybe the input is case-insensitive? Well, the problem says that in the input, the c is given as a string. But the problem says that in the input, the c may contain leading zeros. But for the code, perhaps the input is given with uppercase letters. For example, in the sample input, the fifth case is '12 13\\nA' — which is 'A' in base 12. So that's 10 in decimal. Then converting to base 13, which is 'A' again, since 10 is less than 13. So the output is 'A'.\n\nSo the code must process the input c as a string where each character represents a digit in base a. So, for example, if the input is 'A', then in base a (say, 12), it's 10.\n\nSo, the helper function to convert the input string to decimal is necessary.\n\nNow, once we have the decimal value, we need to convert it to base b, which can be another base (2-25) or Roman numerals.\n\nSo, the second part is converting the decimal number to base b (if not R) or to Roman numerals (if R).\n\nLet's think about each case.\n\nCase 1: b is not R. Then, convert the decimal number to base b. The output must be in base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A, B, etc. for digits >=10. Also, leading zeros must be omitted.\n\nFor example, if the decimal number is 10 and base is 16, output is 'A'.\n\nCase 2: b is R. Then, convert the decimal number to Roman numerals. But the problem says that if Roman numerals are included, the number is <= 3000 in decimal and not zero. So we can safely assume that the decimal number is between 1 and 3000 inclusive.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle both cases.\n\nNow, let's outline the steps again:\n\nRead a and b (where b can be 'R'), then read c.\n\nConvert c (base a) to decimal (integer).\n\nThen, if b is 'R', convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert the decimal integer to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters for higher digits.\n\nNow, the first challenge is converting the input string to decimal. Let's write that function.\n\nFunction to convert string s in base a to decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, a):\n\n    decimal = 0\n\n    for c in s:\n\n        digit_value = ?\n\n        decimal = decimal * a + digit_value\n\n    return decimal\n\nBut how to get digit_value from the character?\n\nFor example, for 'A' in base 12, the digit is 10.\n\nSo for each character in s:\n\nif it's a digit, then digit_value = int(c)\n\nelse, digit_value = 10 + (ord(c) - ord('A'))\n\nBut what if the input has lowercase letters? Well, the problem says that the input is given as per the problem's description. Looking at the examples, the input c is given with uppercase letters. For example, the fifth input is 'A' in base 12. So the code can assume that the input c is in uppercase letters. So we can process accordingly.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each character in s:\n\ndigit = c\n\nif digit.isdigit():\n\n    val = int(digit)\n\nelse:\n\n    val = 10 + (ord(digit) - ord('A'))\n\nBut we need to make sure that the val is less than a. Because the input is valid, according to the problem statement. So we don't need to handle invalid inputs.\n\nOnce that is done, the code can proceed.\n\nNow, the next step is converting the decimal number to base b, or to Roman numerals.\n\nLet's think about converting to base b (when b is not R).\n\nThe standard approach is to take the number, divide by the base, and collect remainders. But for numbers up to 1e15, this is manageable.\n\nBut for the case where the decimal number is zero? The problem says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But for other cases, the input c can be zero? Let's check the problem statement.\n\nIn the input description: \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\"\n\nSo, for cases where the output is not Roman numerals, the input can be zero. For example, if the input is a=2, b=2, c=0. Then the output is 0.\n\nBut the problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros. So the input c can be zero (like '0' in base 10). So when converting to base b (non-R), we need to handle zero.\n\nSo, for converting decimal to base b (non-R):\n\nif the number is zero, output '0'.\n\nElse, process the number by dividing by base and collecting digits.\n\nBut how to handle digits above 9. For example, if the base is 16, and the remainder is 10, then it's represented as 'A'.\n\nSo, for each remainder, we need to convert it to the corresponding character.\n\nSo, for example, for a digit value d:\n\nif d < 10: str(d)\n\nelse: chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\nSo, the code for converting decimal to base b:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        remainder = n % base\n\n        digits.append(remainder)\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    # digits are reversed, since we collected them in reverse order\n\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n\n    # now convert each digit to the appropriate character\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for d in digits:\n\n        if d < 10:\n\n            res += str(d)\n\n        else:\n\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n    return res\n\nWait, but the digits are in the order from highest to lowest. For example, if the digits list is [1, 0, 1], then the number is 101 in base 2, which is 5 in decimal. So the code is correct.\n\nBut for the case when the number is zero, we return '0'.\n\nBut in the problem statement, when converting to base b, the output must omit leading zeros. However, in the case of zero, the output is '0' (as per the problem's note). For example, in the sample input, the first case is '10 2\\n1' which outputs '1'. If the input was 0 in base 10, converted to base 2, the output is '0'.\n\nSo the code for decimal_to_base seems okay.\n\nNow, the other part is converting to Roman numerals.\n\nThe Roman numeral conversion requires a function that takes an integer (from 1 to 3000) and returns the corresponding Roman numeral string.\n\nThe standard way to do this is to create a list of pairs of values and their corresponding symbols, ordered from largest to smallest. Then, subtract the largest possible value each time and append the corresponding symbol.\n\nFor example, the standard list is:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value in the list, while the number is >= value, append the symbol and subtract the value.\n\nSo, the code for converting to Roman numerals would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n\n    return res\n\nBut the problem says that the input for Roman conversion is guaranteed to be non-zero and up to 3000. So this function can be used safely.\n\nNow, putting all these together.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead the input lines. Wait, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, the sample input shows that the first line is a list of inputs. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement's sample input, the input is given as:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nBut that's probably not the actual input format. Wait, the user probably pasted the sample input as a list of test cases. But the actual input for the problem is per test case. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103.\n\nSo, each test case is two lines. So, the code needs to read multiple test cases? Or is it one test case?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first line shows a list of inputs, but that's probably the way the user presented the sample input. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nOutput:\n\n1\n\nSecond input:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nOutput: V\n\nThird input:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\nOutput: IV\n\nFourth input:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001\n\nOutput: 1111001\n\nFifth input:\n\n12 13\n\nA\n\nOutput: A\n\nSo the actual input is multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says that the input is given as two lines per test case. But how many test cases are there? The problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nWait, but looking at the sample input and output, the sample input is a list of five test cases, each with two lines, and the sample output is five lines. So the code must process multiple test cases, each with two lines.\n\nBut how to read the input? Because in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into pairs of lines, and process each pair.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, the code may read all lines, then process them in pairs. For example, for each test case, read the first line (a and b), then the second line (c).\n\nBut how does the input come? For example, in the sample input, the user provided the input as a list of strings. But in reality, the input is given as per the problem statement. So the code must read from standard input, which may have multiple test cases. However, the problem statement isn't clear on whether there is one test case or multiple. Looking back at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c...\n\nSo it's one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem is that the user provided multiple test cases for the sample, but the actual problem expects to process one test case. However, looking at the sample input and output, the outputs are given as a list of outputs for each input. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. But the problem statement is ambiguous here.\n\nWait, the original problem's sample input shows that the input is given as a list of test cases, but the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, then the next line contains c. Which suggests that each test case is two lines. So the code must read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, the first line of the sample input is ['10 2\\n1', ...], which seems to indicate that the input is given as multiple lines. But in reality, perhaps the code should read from standard input, and the input consists of multiple test cases, each with two lines.\n\nBut how to know? Well, looking at the problem's sample input and output, the sample input is given as multiple lines. For example, the first test case is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nAnd so on. So the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how to read them? Because in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, and process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to determine when the input ends? Well, perhaps the code should read until EOF.\n\nSo the code will read all lines from stdin, split them into pairs (each pair being a test case). For example, if there are N lines, then N must be even, since each test case is two lines.\n\nBut how to handle that in code?\n\nSo, in Python, the code can read all lines, then loop through them two at a time.\n\nBut for the purpose of the problem, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, looking at the sample input and output, the sample shows multiple test cases. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says \"the first line contains two integers...\", which suggests that it's a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nThis seems to indicate that each test case is two lines. For example, the first test case is:\n\nLine 1: '10 2'\n\nLine 2: '1'\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\nLine 1: '16 R'\n\nLine 2: '5'\n\nSo the code should process multiple test cases. But how does the input look in reality? For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says nothing about that. But given the sample input and output, the code must handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b...\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c...\n\nWhich implies that there is only one test case. However, the sample shows multiple test cases. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases. So the code must read all lines from stdin, process them in pairs, each pair being a test case.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines, split them into pairs, and process each pair.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nfor i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n\n    a_b_line = lines[i]\n\n    c_line = lines[i+1]\n\n    process this test case.\n\nBut how to handle the case when the number of lines is odd? Probably, the problem ensures that the input is correct.\n\nNow, moving forward with that assumption.\n\nNow, for each test case, process as follows:\n\nParse a and b from the first line. The first line can be split into two parts. For example, '10 2' → a=10, b=2. Or '16 R' → a=16, b='R'.\n\nThen, parse the c_line as the string in base a.\n\nOnce that is parsed, convert to decimal.\n\nThen, based on b, convert to base b or Roman numerals.\n\nNow, the code for the first part: parsing a and b.\n\nFor the first line, split into two parts. For example, split on whitespace. So:\n\nparts = a_b_line.split()\n\na = int(parts[0])\n\nb = parts[1]\n\nBut if parts[1] is 'R', then it's the Roman case.\n\nNow, the code for converting c_line (the string) to decimal.\n\nBut the code must handle letters in the string. For example, 'A' in base 12 is 10.\n\nNow, the code for converting the string to decimal:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n\n    num = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        if ch.isdigit():\n\n            digit = int(ch)\n\n        else:\n\n            digit = 10 + (ord(ch) - ord('A'))\n\n        num = num * base + digit\n\n    return num\n\nBut what if the input is empty? According to the problem statement, the input c is a non-negative integer, so it can be zero (like '0').\n\nNow, once the decimal number is obtained, then:\n\nif b is 'R':\n\n    convert to roman numerals.\n\nelse:\n\n    convert to base b, as a string, with digits 0-9 and letters for higher digits.\n\nNow, for the case when the decimal number is zero and b is not R: the output is '0'.\n\nBut for example, if the input is '0' in base 10, converted to base 2, the output is '0'.\n\nSo, the code for the conversion to base b is as discussed earlier.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nTest case 1:\n\na=10, b=2, c is '1' → decimal is 1 → converted to base 2 is '1'.\n\nSample Output: '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\na=16, b=R, c is '5' in base 16 → decimal is 5 → Roman is 'V'.\n\nSample Output: 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\na=5, b=R, c is '4' in base 5 → decimal is 4 → Roman is 'IV'.\n\nSample Output: 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\na=2, b=2, c is '1111001' in base 2. Let's compute that:\n\nbinary 1111001 is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Converting to base 2 again is 1111001. So output is same as input. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\na=12, b=13, c is 'A' in base 12 → decimal is 10. Convert to base 13: 10 is less than 13, so output is 'A'.\n\nSample Output: 'A'.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, some edge cases to consider.\n\nEdge Case 1: c is zero. For example, a=10, b=10, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nEdge Case 2: converting to base 1? No, according to the input constraints, a and b are between 2 and 25. So no.\n\nEdge Case 3: converting to Roman numerals with 3000 → 'MMM'.\n\nAnother Edge Case: converting to base 25, which would have digits up to 24. So, for example, 24 in base 25 is 'O' (since 24 - 10 = 14 → 'O' is 14th letter after A? Wait, 10 is A, 11 B, 12 C, 13 D, 14 E, 15 F, 16 G, 17 H, 18 I, 19 J, 20 K, 21 L, 22 M, 23 N, 24 O. So yes.\n\nNow, code for converting decimal to base b (non-R):\n\nBut when the decimal number is zero, return '0'.\n\nElse, process as before.\n\nNow, code for the decimal_to_base function.\n\nNow, code for the Roman conversion.\n\nNow, putting all together in Python.\n\nBut also, note that the input c can be up to 10^3 characters long. For example, if the input is a base 2 number with 1000 digits, converting it to decimal can be a very large number. However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large. So no problem.\n\nBut when converting to decimal, for very long strings, the code may take some time, but for the problem's constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the functions.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = 10 + (ord(ch) - ord('A'))\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_b_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        # parse a and b\n        parts = a_b_line.split()\n        a = int(parts[0])\n        b = parts[1]\n        # parse c_line\n        c_str = c_line\n        # convert c_str to decimal\n        decimal_val = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        # process based on b\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, the sample input includes the case where the output is 'A' (like the fifth test case). Let's see:\n\nFor example, in the fifth test case, the input is a=12, b=13, c is 'A' (which is 10 in decimal). Converting to base 13, which is 10. Since 10 is less than 13, the converted value is 'A'.\n\nThe code for decimal_to_base would generate 'A' correctly.\n\nAnother test case: when the decimal is zero. For example, input is a=10, b=2, c is '0' → output '0'.\n\nAnother test case: when converting to base 10, the code returns the correct digits.\n\nBut what about leading zeros? For example, if the input is '001' in base 2. Then, the decimal is 1. Converting to base 2 would be '1'.\n\nThe code for decimal_to_base returns '1', which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the input is zero, but the code returns '0'?\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1 → decimal is 1 → converted to base 2 is '1'.\n\nSample Output is '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5 → decimal is 5 → Roman 'V'.\n\nSample Output is 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4 → decimal is 4 → Roman 'IV'.\n\nSample Output is 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001 → decimal is 121 → converted to base 2 is 1111001.\n\nSample Output is '1111001'.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nSample Output is 'A'.\n\nAll sample cases pass.\n\nNow, check for some other cases.\n\nTest case where c is '0' in base 10, converted to base 10: output is '0'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=16, c is '255' → decimal is 255 → hex is 'FF'.\n\ndecimal_to_base(255, 16) → digits are 255 / 16 = 15, remainder 15 → digits list is [15, 15]. Reversed → [15, 15]. Then converted to 'FF'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=10, c is '000' → decimal is 0 → output is '0'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=10, c is '123' → output '123'.\n\nAnother test case: converting to Roman numerals for 4 → 'IV'.\n\nAnother test case: 1994 → MCMXCIV.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, what about when the input is '0' in base a, and b is R? According to the problem statement, the input for Roman numerals is guaranteed not to be zero. So the code can safely assume that if b is R, the decimal_val is not zero.\n\nBut in the code, if for some reason, the decimal_val is zero and b is R, the code would call decimal_to_roman(0), which would return an empty string. However, the problem says that this case is not present in the input. So the code is safe.\n\nNow, what about leading zeros in the output? For example, if the decimal is 5, and converting to base 10, the output is '5' (no leading zeros). The code's decimal_to_base function returns the correct string without leading zeros, except for the case when the number is zero.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code is written. Now, need to make sure that all functions are included and that the code is properly formatted.\n\nBut in the code above, the main function reads lines from stdin, splits into pairs, and processes each pair.\n\nBut what about cases where the input is empty? Well, the problem says that the input is correct.\n\nNow, the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base or to Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from its original base to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this decimal integer to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in a specific base (a). We first convert this number to a decimal integer.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base or Roman Numerals**:\n   - If the target base (b) is not 'R', convert the decimal integer to the specified base using standard base conversion techniques.\n   - If the target base is 'R', convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals using a predefined mapping of values to Roman numeral symbols.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = 10 + (ord(ch) - ord('A'))\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 2):\n        a_b_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        parts = a_b_line.split()\n        a = int(parts[0])\n        b = parts[1]\n        c_str = c_line\n        decimal_val = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_val)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_val, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, and each pair of lines represents a test case where the first line contains the bases (a and b) and the second line contains the number in base a.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` converts the input number from base a to a decimal integer by iterating through each character of the input string and computing its value.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts a decimal integer to the specified base. It handles digits greater than 9 by using letters (A, B, etc.).\n4. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts a decimal integer to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, iterating from the highest to the lowest value to construct the Roman numeral string.\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases are handled efficiently, including leading zeros and the special case of Roman numerals.",
