He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a. The output depends on whether b is R or another base.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Read a and b (but b could be 'R').\n2. Read the number c as a string in base a.\n3. Convert c from base a to a decimal integer.\n4. Then, if b is 'R', convert that decimal integer to Roman numerals.\n5. Else, convert the decimal integer to base b, using letters for digits >=10 (like A for 10, B for 11, etc.)\n\nBut first, how to handle the conversion from base a to decimal? The input c can be up to 10^3 characters long. But since a can be up to 25, and each digit can be up to a-1, but the problem says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is <= 3000 in decimal. Otherwise, it's up to 1e15. So for the conversion, we need to process the string c as a base-a number.\n\nWait, but how do we parse the digits of c? For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase?), but the input c is given as a string. However, the problem says that for the case when converting to Roman, the input c is non-zero and less than or equal to 3000. But for other cases, the input c may be up to 1e15. So for the conversion from base a to decimal, we need to process each character in the string c as a digit in base a.\n\nBut what about the digits? For example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A (for 10), B (for 11). Wait, but the problem says that when converting to base b (non-R), the output uses letters for digits >=10. So perhaps the input c's digits are in the same way? Wait, the input c is given as a string in base a. How are the digits represented? For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9, A-F. But the problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros, but its length doesn't exceed 10^3.\n\nBut the problem statement says that \"the number won't be greater than 1e15\" except when Roman is involved. So, for the input c, the digits are represented in base a, but how? For example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9 and A, B (assuming that's how they are represented). But the input c is given as a string. So, for example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, that represents 10 in decimal.\n\nSo the first step is to convert the input string c (in base a) into a decimal integer. To do this, we need to process each character in the string as a digit in base a. The digits can be 0-9, and letters A-Z (uppercase?), but only up to a-1.\n\nWait, the problem says that when converting to base b (non-R), the output uses letters for digits >=10. So for example, if the input c is in base 12, then the digits in the input could be 0-9, A (10), B (11). So during the conversion from base a to decimal, each character in the input string must be mapped to its corresponding value.\n\nSo, the first thing is to process the input string c into a decimal number. For example, for each character in c, we need to find its value. For example, if the character is 'A', it's 10, 'B' is 11, etc. But how to handle lowercase letters? The problem says that the input may have letters, but the examples show that in the input, for example, the third example is '5 R\\n4' which outputs 'IV', which is correct. The input for c is given as a string that may contain letters. But the problem says that in the input, the c is written in base a. So for example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A (10), B (11). So the input string may contain letters, but the problem says that the input is valid. So, the code needs to parse each character of the string into its corresponding value.\n\nSo, the code for converting c from base a to decimal would be:\n\nInitialize a variable",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, where `b` could be Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from base `a` to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this decimal integer to the target base `b` or Roman numerals as required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input String to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a` as a string. This string may contain digits and letters (for bases greater than 10). We convert this string to a decimal integer.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: If the target base `b` is not 'R', convert the decimal integer to base `b`, using letters for digits greater than 9 (e.g., A for 10, B for 11, etc.).\n3. **Convert Decimal to Roman Numerals**: If the target base `b` is 'R', convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals using the standard Roman numeral rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef from_decimal(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, symbol) in val:\n        while num >= v:\n            res += symbol\n            num -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    inputs = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in inputs:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        parts = line.split()\n        a_part = parts[0]\n        b_part = parts[1]\n        c_str = ' '.join(parts[2:])\n        a = int(a_part)\n        b = b_part\n        c = c_str\n        \n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n        \n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            result = from_decimal(decimal_value, base)\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **to_decimal Function**: Converts a string representation of a number in base `a` to a decimal integer. Each character in the string is converted to its corresponding numeric value, considering both digits and letters for bases greater than 10.\n2. **from_decimal Function**: Converts a decimal integer to a string representation in the specified base `b`. For bases greater than 10, letters are used for digits 10 and above.\n3. **decimal_to_roman Function**: Converts a decimal integer to Roman numerals using subtractive notation where applicable (e.g., IV for 4, IX for 9).\n4. **main Function**: Reads input lines, processes each line to extract the bases and the number, converts the number to decimal, and then converts it to the target base or Roman numerals as required, ensuring no leading zeros are present in the output.",
