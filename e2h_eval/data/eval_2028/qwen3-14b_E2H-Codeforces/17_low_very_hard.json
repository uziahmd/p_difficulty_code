He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to determine for each of the given 2n-2 strings whether they are a prefix or a suffix of the original string s. The challenge is that we don't know s, but we have to find a valid assignment of P and S such that there exists at least one s that matches the given prefixes and suffixes.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. Let's think about the properties of prefixes and suffixes. For example, the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be the original string minus the last character. Similarly, the longest suffix (of length n-1) is the original string minus the first character. But since we don't know which of the given strings are prefixes or suffixes, we need to find a way to determine which ones they are.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input contains all the improper prefixes and suffixes. So for the original string s, each of the prefixes of length 1 to n-1 and each of the suffixes of length 1 to n-1 are present in the input. And each of these occurs exactly twice, except for the cases where a prefix is also a suffix. For example, if the entire string is made of the same character, like \"aaa\", then the prefix of length 1 is \"a\", the suffix of length 1 is also \"a\", and they are the same string. So in the input, there would be two entries of \"a\" for length 1.\n\nBut the problem says that the input has exactly two strings for each length from 1 to n-1. So even if a prefix and suffix are the same, they are present twice. So the input could have duplicates.\n\nNow, the key is to find a way to determine for each input string whether it's a prefix or a suffix. But how?\n\nLet me think: The original string s must have exactly one prefix of each length from 1 to n-1, and exactly one suffix of each length from 1 to n-1. However, some of these may be the same. So for each possible candidate string s, we can generate all its prefixes and suffixes, and check if the input matches. But since we don't know s, how do we find it?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the possible candidates for s. For example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must be such that when combined, they form the original string. Wait, no. Because the longest prefix (of length n-1) is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix (of length n-1) is s[1..n-1]. So the original string s must be the combination of the longest prefix plus the last character, or the combination of the first character plus the longest suffix. But since we don't know which of the input strings are the longest prefix or suffix, we need to try possibilities.\n\nSo here's an idea: for each possible pair of strings in the input of length n-1, one as a prefix (longest prefix) and one as a suffix (longest suffix), check if they can form a valid s. Then, once s is determined, check if all the other input strings are prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nBut how to find which of the input strings are the longest prefix and longest suffix?\n\nLet me think. The original s has a prefix of length n-1 and a suffix of length n-1. These two strings must overlap in such a way that the first n-1 characters of s is the prefix, and the last n-1 characters is the suffix. Therefore, the original s must be equal to the prefix plus one character (the last character of s) or the suffix plus one character (the first character of s). But how to find this?\n\nFor example, suppose the longest prefix is P and the longest suffix is S. Then, the original s must be P + c, where c is the last character. Also, s must be c' + S, where c' is the first character. Therefore, the first n-1 characters of s (P) and the last n-1 characters of s (S) must overlap. So, the first n-2 characters of P must be the same as the last n-2 characters of S. Because:\n\ns = P + c\ns = c' + S\n\nTherefore, the first n-1 characters of s (P) and the last n-1 characters of s (S) must satisfy that P[0..n-2] is the same as S[1..n-1], since the first n-1 characters of s is P, and the last n-1 characters is S. So the first n-2 characters of P must be the same as the last n-2 characters of S. Because the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying potential candidates for the original string `s` based on the given prefixes and suffixes, and then validating these candidates against all input strings.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest proper prefix and suffix of `s` (each of length `n-1`) must be such that they overlap correctly. This helps in reconstructing the original string `s`.\n2. **Generate Candidates**: For each pair of strings of length `n-1` from the input, consider one as a prefix and the other as a suffix. Check if they can form a valid string `s` by ensuring their overlapping parts match.\n3. **Validate Candidates**: Once a candidate string `s` is generated, check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`. If valid, assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Preprocess: group the strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    len_to_strings = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        len_to_strings[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Find possible candidates for s\n    possible_s = set()\n    \n    # Get all possible candidates of length n-1\n    candidates_len = n - 1\n    if candidates_len not in len_to_strings:\n        return  # should not happen as per problem statement\n    \n    for prefix_candidate in len_to_strings[candidates_len]:\n        for suffix_candidate in len_to_strings[candidates_len]:\n            # Check if they can form a valid s\n            # s must be prefix_candidate + last_char, and also first_char + suffix_candidate\n            # So the first n-2 chars of prefix_candidate must match the last n-2 chars of suffix_candidate\n            if prefix_candidate[:-1] == suffix_candidate[1:]:\n                s1 = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n                s2 = prefix_candidate[0] + suffix_candidate\n                if s1 == s2:\n                    possible_s.add(s1)\n    \n    # Now for each possible s, check if all input strings are its prefixes or suffixes\n    for s in possible_s:\n        # Check all input strings\n        assignments = []\n        for s_input in strings:\n            is_prefix = True\n            is_suffix = True\n            for l in range(1, len(s_input)+1):\n                if s[:l] != s_input:\n                    is_prefix = False\n                if s[-l:] != s_input:\n                    is_suffix = False\n            if not is_prefix and not is_suffix:\n                break\n            else:\n                # We need to decide whether it's a prefix or suffix\n                # But how?

The first line gives the length `n` of the unknown string `s`, and the subsequent lines are the prefixes and suffixes.\n2. **Grouping by Length**: Strings are grouped by their lengths to facilitate checking for the longest prefixes and suffixes.\n3. **Generating Candidates**: Possible candidates for the original string `s` are generated by considering pairs of strings of length `n-1` and checking if they can overlap correctly.\n4. **Validation**: For each candidate string `s`, we check if all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`. If valid, we generate the required output string of 'P' and 'S' characters based on the checks.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes while adhering to the constraints provided.",
