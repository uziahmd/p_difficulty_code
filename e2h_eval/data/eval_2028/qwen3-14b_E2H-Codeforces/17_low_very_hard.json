He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one string s that matches the assignments.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. There might be multiple valid answers, but we can output any one.\n\nSo how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to find a way to determine which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes. But since the input is a mix of both, I need to find a way to reconstruct the original string s, or at least find a possible candidate for s, then check which of the input strings are prefixes and suffixes of it.\n\nBut how can I find s? Well, the original string s must have all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes. So for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) must be a prefix of s. Similarly, the longest suffix (length n-1) must be a suffix of s. Wait, but in the input, there are two strings of length n-1. One of them is a prefix, the other a suffix. So if I can find which of these two is the prefix and which is the suffix, then I can combine them to get the original string s.\n\nWait, for example, suppose the original string is s. Then the prefix of length n-1 is s[0...n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1]. So combining these two, the first n-1 characters of s and the last n-1 characters of s. The only way they can overlap is if the original string is such that the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 share a common part.\n\nBut how can I find s? Let's think: the original string s must have exactly one prefix of each length (from 1 to n-1) and one suffix of each length. So the correct assignment would be such that for each input string, if it's marked as a prefix, then it must be a prefix of s, and similarly for suffixes.\n\nBut how to find s? One approach is to consider that the correct s must be such that:\n\n- The prefix of length n-1 (which is one of the input strings) must be a prefix of s. Similarly, the suffix of length n-1 must be a suffix of s. Also, the original s must be formed by combining the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1. For example, the prefix of length n-1 is P, the suffix of length n-1 is S. Then s must be P + (last character of S), but since the last character of S is the last character of s, and the first character of P is the first character of s. But wait, the suffix S is of length n-1, so the last character of S is the last character of s. The prefix P is of length n-1, so its last character is s[n-2], and the first character of the suffix S is s[1].\n\nSo combining the prefix of length n-1 (P) and the suffix of length n-1 (S), the original s must be P[0...n-2] and S[1...n-1], but the overlapping part must match. So the first n-1 characters of s are P, and the last n-1 characters are S. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of P must be the same as the last n-2 characters of S. Because the first n-1 characters of s is P, and the last n-1 is S. So the s is of length n, so the first n-1 characters are P, and the last n-1 are S. So the first n-2 characters of P must equal the last n-2 characters of S. Therefore, the concatenation of P and S's last character must form s. So for example, if P is \"abc\" (length 3, n-1=3 implies n=4), and S is \"bcd\", then s would be \"abcd\" (since P is the first 3 letters, and S is the last 3 letters, overlapping in the middle).\n\nSo for the case of the two strings of length n-1, one must be the prefix and the other the suffix. So for each",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct assignment of 'P' (prefix) and 'S' (suffix) for each input string such that there exists at least one valid string `s` that matches the assignments.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest prefix and suffix (each of length `n-1`) must be part of the string `s`. By checking all possible combinations of these two strings, we can reconstruct a candidate string `s`.\n2. **Validate the Candidate String**: For each candidate string `s`, check if all other input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n3. **Determine Assignments**: Once a valid candidate string `s` is found, determine which input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of `s`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n\n    # Find all strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all possible pairs of the two candidates for the longest prefix and suffix\n    for i in range(2):\n        for j in range(2):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n            suffix_candidate = candidates[j]\n            # Reconstruct possible s\n            # The prefix_candidate is length n-1, so the full s should be prefix_candidate + last_char of suffix_candidate\n            # But the suffix_candidate is length n-1, so the first character of the suffix_candidate is s[1], and the last is s[n-1]\n            # Therefore, the full s must be prefix_candidate + [last character of suffix_candidate]\n            # However, the first n-1 characters of s must be prefix_candidate, and the last n-1 must be suffix_candidate\n            # So the s must be prefix_candidate[0...n-2] + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Check if the overlapping part matches\n            # The first n-2 characters of prefix_candidate must match the last n-2 characters of suffix_candidate\n            if prefix_candidate[:-1] == suffix_candidate[1:]:\n                s_candidate = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n                # Now check all other strings to see if they are prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate\n                # Create a list of (string, index) to track positions\n                assignments = [''] * (2 * n - 2)\n                valid = True\n                for idx, st in enumerate(strings):\n                    if len(st) == len_n_minus_1:\n                        # Already handled by prefix_candidate and suffix_candidate\n                        if st == prefix_candidate:\n                            assignments[idx] = 'P'\n                        else:\n                            assignments[idx] = 'S'\n                    else:\n                        is_prefix = s_candidate.startswith(st)\n                        is_suffix = s_candidate.endswith(st)\n                        if not is_prefix and not is_suffix:\n                            valid = False\n                            break\n                        elif is_prefix and is_suffix:\n                            # Need to decide which one to assign, but since the problem allows any valid answer\n                            # We can choose arbitrarily, but need to ensure that the counts are correct\n                            # However, since we have already fixed the longest prefix and suffix, the rest should be uniquely determined\n                            # Wait, no.
