He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count of 5s determines the trailing zeros. So the formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that give exactly m zeros. For example, in the sample input m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Because 5! has one zero, and each subsequent number up to 9! adds more factors but the count remains the same until 10! which adds another 5 (from 10=2*5).\n\nWait, but why does 5! to 9! all have exactly 1 trailing zero? Let me check:\n\n5! = 120 → 1 zero.\n6! = 720 → 1.\n7! = 5040 → 1.\n8! = 40320 → 1.\n9! = 362880 → 1.\nYes. Then 10! is 3628800 → two zeros. So for m=1, the possible n's are 5-9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the key is to find the range of n's that produce exactly m zeros. But how?\n\nThe approach I think is to first find the minimal n such that the trailing zeros count is m, and then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count. But how do I find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, there might be zero, one, or multiple n's. But how to find them?\n\nLet me think about the function f(n) which counts the number of trailing zeros. This function is non-decreasing. For example, as n increases, f(n) either stays the same or increases. So for each m, the possible n's that satisfy f(n) = m would form a contiguous range. But how long is that range?\n\nFor example, when m=1, the range is 5-9. So the length is 5. But for some m's, maybe there's no n. Like if m=5, maybe there's no n? Or wait, let's think. For example, let's see for m=5. Let's compute f(24) = 24//5 + 24//25 = 4 + 0 = 4. f(25) is 25//5 + 25//25 = 5 + 1 = 6. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n where f(n) is 5. Therefore, for m=5, the answer is zero.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given m, whether there exists any n such that f(n) = m. If yes, then find the range of n's.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the minimal n where f(n) = m. Then check if there's a range of numbers where f(n) remains m. But how?\n\nBut how to find if there exists any n with f(n) = m. Because for some m, there's no solution.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n- First, check if there exists any n such that f(n) = m. If not, output 0.\n\n- If there is, find the lower and upper bounds of n's that satisfy this.\n\nBut how to find the lower and upper bounds?\n\nLet me think. Since f(n) is non-decreasing, for a given m, there's a range of n's where f(n) = m. However, the problem is that for some m, there's no n. For example, m=5 as discussed earlier.\n\nSo the approach is to find the minimal n where f(n) = m, and then check if the next number (n+1) also gives the same m. If not, then there's only one n. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the number of n's that satisfy f(n) = m is equal to the number of times the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Since the function f(n) increases by 1 or more when n increases by",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nThe number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This can be computed using the formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{count\\_trailing\\_zeros}(n) = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{5} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{25} \\right\\rfloor + \\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{125} \\right\\rfloor + \\dots\n$$\n\nThis function is **non-decreasing**, which means that for any given $ m $, the set of $ n $ values that produce exactly $ m $ trailing zeros (if any) will form a contiguous range.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy\n\n1. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to find the smallest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros is at least $ m $.\n2. **Validation**: Once the lower bound is found, check if the count of trailing zeros for that $ n $ is exactly $ m $. If not, there are no such $ n $ values.\n3. **Range Determination**: If a valid $ n $ is found, continue checking consecutive numbers until the count increases beyond $ m $. All numbers between the lower bound and this upper bound (exclusive) are valid solutions.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details\n\n- The `count_trailing_zeros` function computes the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $.\n- Binary search is used to find the smallest $ n $ where the count is at least $ m $.\n- If the count at this $ n $ is not equal to $ m $, output `0`.\n- Otherwise, iterate forward from that $ n $ to find the range of valid $ n $ values.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_n_values(m):\n    # Binary search to find the minimal n with trailing zeros >= m\n    low, high = 0, 5 * m\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_trailing_zeros(mid) < m:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    # Check if the count is exactly m\n    if count_trailing_zeros(low) != m:\n        return [0]\n    \n    # Find the upper bound\n    upper = low\n    while count_trailing_zeros(upper) == m:\n        upper += 1\n    \n    # The valid n's are from low to upper - 1\n    result = list(range(low, upper))\n    return [len(result)] + result\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        m = int(line.strip())\n        result = find_n_values(m)\n        print(result[0])\n        if len(result) > 1:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, result[1:])))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example\n\n**Input:**\n```\n1\n5\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n5\n5 6 7 8 9\n0\n```\n\nThis code correctly identifies the number of $ n $ values that produce exactly $ m $ trailing zeros in their factorial and prints them in increasing order.
