При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an error. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, and the overlapping part has at least one character but less than the length of s. Also, the case where the two messages are completely overlapping (so t is exactly s) or just concatenated normally (like s + s) should not be considered as errors. So, for example, if t is \"abcd\", it's considered as no error. Similarly, \"abcabc\" is considered as no error because it's just two s's concatenated without overlapping.\n\nOur task is to check if such a scenario is possible. If yes, output YES and a possible s. Otherwise, output NO.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key idea is that the merged string t must be formed by two copies of s overlapping by some k characters, where 0 < k < len(s). So, the total length of t would be len(s) + len(s) - k = 2*len(s) - k. But since k can vary, we need to find possible values of k and s.\n\nBut since the original two messages are the same, the overlapping part must match. For example, if the first message ends with some substring, and the second starts with the same substring. So, when overlapping, the merged string is s[0... len(s)-k-1] + s. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nSuppose s is a string of length L. When two copies are merged with an overlap of k characters. That means that the last k characters of the first s are the same as the first k characters of the second s. Then the merged string would be s concatenated with s, but with the overlapping part merged. So the merged string would have length L + L - k = 2L -k. So the length of t must be equal to 2L -k. Since k is between 1 and L-1, then the length of t must be between L+1 (when k=L-1) and 2L-1 (when k=1). \n\nSo for t to be a result of such an error, its length must be between L+1 and 2L-1, where L is the length of s. But since we don't know L, perhaps we can try possible values of L.\n\nBut how do we find L? Well, since the merged string t has length 2L -k, and k is between 1 and L-1. Let's rearrange this equation. Let me denote len(t) as n. So n = 2L -k. Since k is between 1 and L-1, substituting gives:\n\nFor k = 1: n = 2L -1 → L = (n +1)/2\n\nFor k = L-1: n = 2L - (L-1) = L +1 → L = n -1.\n\nSo L must be in the range (n - (L-1) ?) Wait, perhaps another way. For possible L, the possible values are such that L must be greater than n/2, because n = 2L -k, and k is at least 1. So 2L -k = n → k = 2L -n. Since k must be ≥1 and ≤ L-1, then:\n\n1 ≤ 2L -n ≤ L-1.\n\nLet me solve these inequalities.\n\nFirst, 2L -n ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ n +1 → L ≥ (n+1)/2.\n\nSecond, 2L -n ≤ L-1 → 2L -n ≤ L -1 → L ≤ n -1.\n\nSo combining these two, L must be between ceil((n+1)/2) and n-1, inclusive. Wait, but L can't be larger than n-1 because if L is n-1, then k = 2L -n = 2(n-1) -n = 2n -2 -n = n-2. Which is ≤ L-1 = (n-1) -1 = n-2. So yes, that's valid.\n\nSo for possible L values, they must satisfy (n+1)/2 ≤ L ≤ n-1. But since L must be integer, we can iterate over possible L values in this range.\n\nFor each possible L in that range, we can check if there exists a k (which is 2L -n) such that the first L -k characters of t (the part that is from the first s) and the last L characters (the second s) overlap properly. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nIf the merged string is formed by two s's overlapping by k characters, then the merged string t must be equal to s concatenated with s, but with the overlapping part removed. So, the first s's part is s[0 ... L -k -1], then the overlapping part (s[L -k ... L -1] which equals s[0 ... k-1]), and then the rest of the second s. But the entire t is s concatenated with s, but overlapping. So the entire t is s + s[k:]. So the length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k, which matches.\n\nSo, for a given L, the length of t must be 2L -k, but since k is determined as 2L -n (from earlier), we can compute k for each possible L. Because n is fixed.\n\nWait, for each L in the range [ceil((n+1)/2), n-1], we can compute k as 2L -n. Then, since k must be between 1 and L-1, we can check that.\n\nOnce we have L and k, we need to check whether the first s (of length L) and the second s (of length L) can overlap. How?\n\nThe first s is the first L characters of t. The second s is the last L characters of t. However, the overlapping part must be such that the last k characters of the first s equal the first k characters of the second s. Because when they are merged, those k characters are overlapping.\n\nSo for example, if t is the merged string, then the first L characters (s_candidate) and the last L characters (another s_candidate) must have their last k characters equal to the first k characters of the other.\n\nSo for each L in the possible range, we can:\n\n- Check if the length of t is 2L -k, where k = 2L -n. Wait, since n is the length of t, and k is 2L -n. But since n = 2L -k, that's correct. So for each possible L, we compute k = 2L -n. Then check if k is between 1 and L-1. If that's true, then proceed.\n\nOnce that's done, we check if the first L characters (s_candidate) has its last k characters equal to the first k characters of the last L characters of t. Because that's the overlapping part.\n\nIf that is true, then the merged string is possible. Then, the original s is the first L characters of t. But wait, because when you merge two s's, the merged string is s + s[k:], so the entire t is s concatenated with s[k:]. Therefore, the entire t must be equal to s + s[k:]. But since the s_candidate is the first L characters, and the second part is s[k:] (which is of length L -k). So the total length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n, which matches.\n\nSo for example, let's take the sample input 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is the first example. The output is 'abrakadabra' which is length 11. Let's see. The length of t is len('abrakadabrabrakadabra') which is 19? Let me count. 'abrakadabra' is 11 letters. Then the merged string is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 11 + 11 - 1 = 21? Or maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the first example input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which is 19 letters. Let me check. Let's count:\n\nabrakadabra is 11 letters. Then the merged string in the example is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which would be 11 + 11 - 1 = 21? But the input is 19. Maybe I need to check the actual example.\n\nWait the first example input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 19 letters. The output is 'abrakadabra' which is 11 letters. Let's compute for that case:\n\nn = 19. For L to be in the range (n+1)/2 = (19+1)/2 = 10, so L must be between 10 and 18 (since n-1 is 18). For each L in 10 to 18, compute k = 2L -n. Let's take L=11. Then k = 2*11 -19 = 22-19=3. So k=3. Now, check if k is between 1 and L-1 (10). 3 is between 1 and 10. So valid.\n\nThen, the first L=11 characters of t is 'abrakadabra' (assuming that the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'). Let me check:\n\nThe input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra'. Let me split it into parts. The first 11 letters are 'abrakadabra' (correct). The last 11 letters are 'brakadabra'? Wait, the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 19 letters. Let's see:\n\nOriginal string: a b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a ?\n\nWait perhaps I should get the exact length. Let me count:\n\nLet me write the input as 'abrakadabrabrakadabra':\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nabrakadabra (11 letters) followed by brakadabra (but that would be 11 letters? Let me check:\n\nThe first part is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). Then the next part is 'abrakadabra' again. But if they are merged with overlap of 1 character, the merged string would be 11 + 11 -1 = 21 letters. But the input here is 19 letters. So perhaps in the first example, the input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' which is 19 letters. Let me check:\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\na b r a k a d a b r a b r a k a d a b r a → that's 21 letters. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the example. Anyway, perhaps I should focus on the algorithm.\n\nSo, for each possible L in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1], compute k = 2L -n. Then check if k is between 1 and L-1. If so, check if the first L characters (s_candidate) has its last k characters equal to the first k characters of the last L characters of t.\n\nIf that is true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nSo, the steps for the code would be:\n\n1. Get the input string t, compute n = len(t).\n\n2. Iterate possible L values from ceil((n+1)/2) to n-1.\n\n   For example, for n=5, (n+1)/2 is 3, so L ranges from 3 to 4.\n\n   For each L in this range:\n\n   a. Compute k = 2L -n.\n\n   b. Check if 1 <= k <= L-1. If not, skip this L.\n\n   c. Now, check if the first L characters (s_candidate) and the last L characters of t have overlapping parts. Specifically, check if the last k characters of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate[-k:]) are equal to the first k characters of the last L characters (i.e., t[-L:][:k]).\n\n   If this is true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\n3. If none of the L values work, output NO.\n\nBut how to compute the possible L values?\n\nLet me think about the possible L values. For example, for n=5, possible L values are 3 and 4.\n\nFor L=3, k=2*3 -5=1. Which is between 1 and 2 (L-1=2). So valid.\n\nFor L=4, k=8-5=3. Which is between 1 and 3 (L-1=3). Valid.\n\nSo for each L in that range, we check.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor L in range( (n+1)//2 , n ):\n\n   because for example, if (n+1)/2 is not integer, then we take the ceiling. Wait, in Python, (n+1)//2 is integer division. For example, if n is even, say n=4, (n+1)/2 is 2.5, so integer division (4+1)//2 is 2. But for n=5, (5+1)//2 is 3, which is correct.\n\nWait, the lower bound for L is ceil( (n+1)/2 ). But since (n+1)/2 may not be integer, how to compute that?\n\nIn Python, for integers, (n+1 +1)//2 ?\n\nWait, for example:\n\nceil( (n+1)/2 ) can be written as (n+1 +1)//2 ?\n\nLet me think:\n\nFor example, if (n+1) is even, say n+1 = 4 → 4/2=2. ceil(2) is 2. (n+1 +1)//2 is (4+1)//2 = 5//2=2. So that's correct.\n\nIf (n+1) is odd, say n+1=5 → 5/2=2.5 → ceil is 3. (n+1 +1)//2 = (5+1)//2 = 6//2=3. Correct.\n\nYes. So the lower bound for L is (n+1 +1)//2 ? Wait, no. Wait, the lower bound is ceil( (n+1)/2 ), which is equal to (n + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, let's compute for n:\n\nceil( (n+1)/2 ) equals (n+1 +1)//2 ?\n\nNo. Let me think:\n\nFor example, n=5. (n+1)/2 is 3. So ceil(3) is 3. (n+1 +1)//2 is (5+1+1)/2 =7//2=3.5 → but integer division would be 3. So yes.\n\nAnother example: n=4. (n+1)/2 is 2.5. Ceil is 3. (n+1 +1)//2 = (4+1 +1)/2=6/2=3. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3. (n+1)/2 = 2. So ceil is 2. (n+1 +1)//2 = (3+1+1)/2 = 5//2=2. Correct.\n\nSo yes, the lower bound for L is (n + 2) // 2. Because (n+1 +1)//2 = (n+2)//2.\n\nSo in code, the possible L values are in the range from (n+2)//2 to n-1, inclusive.\n\nSo, for each L in that range, we can check.\n\nOnce we find such an L and k, then check the overlapping part.\n\nNow, how to check that the last k characters of the first L characters (s_candidate) equals the first k characters of the last L characters of t.\n\nSo:\n\ns_candidate = t[0:L]\n\noverlap_part_in_s_candidate = s_candidate[-k:]\n\noverlap_part_in_last_L = t[-L:][:k]\n\nif overlap_part_in_s_candidate == overlap_part_in_last_L, then it's valid.\n\nIf so, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nOnce such a case is found, we can return immediately.\n\nNow, what about multiple possibilities? The problem says that any possible s is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code can check all possible L in the range, and for each, check the condition. Once found, output YES and the s_candidate.\n\nIf none found, output NO.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nTake the second example input: 'acacacaca' → output is 'YES\\nacaca'.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn = len('acacacaca') = 9.\n\nPossible L values are (9+2)//2 = 11//2=5.5 → integer division is 5. So L ranges from 5 to 8 (n-1 is 8).\n\nFor each L in 5,6,7,8:\n\nLet's check L=5.\n\nk = 2*5 -9 = 10-9=1. Check 1<=1 <=4 → yes.\n\nCheck s_candidate is t[0:5] → 'acaca'.\n\nThe last L=5 characters of t is t[-5:] → 'cacaca'? Wait, original t is 'acacacaca' (length 9). Let me write it as indexes 0-8.\n\nt[-5:] is positions 4-8: 'acaca' (positions 4 is 'a', 5 is 'c', 6 is 'a', 7 is 'c', 8 is 'a' → 'acaca').\n\nSo the last L characters is 'acaca'.\n\nNow, check the last k=1 characters of s_candidate (which is 'a') and the first k=1 characters of the last L characters (which is 'a'). So they match. So this is valid. So the answer is 'acaca'.\n\nWhich is the sample output. So yes.\n\nAnother possible L is 6. Let's check.\n\nk = 2*6 -9 = 12-9=3. Check 1<=3 <=5 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:6] → 'acacac'.\n\nThe last L=6 characters of t is t[-6:] → positions 3-8: 'cacaca'.\n\nCheck the last 3 characters of s_candidate: 'cac' (positions 3-5 of s_candidate: 'acacac' → indexes 0-5. Last 3 are indexes 3-5: 'cac'.\n\nThe first 3 characters of the last L=6 characters (t[-6:] is 'cacaca') → first 3 is 'cac'. So they match. So this would also be a valid case, and s_candidate is 'acacac'. However, the sample output is 'acaca' (length 5). But according to the note, 'acacaca' is also a possible answer. So in this case, the code would return the first valid L it finds. For example, if the code checks L=5 first, then returns that. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to iterate through L in order, and return the first valid one.\n\nNow, what about the third example input 'abcabc' → output is 'NO'.\n\nn=6. Possible L values are (6+2)//2 = 4 → L ranges from 4 to 5.\n\nFor L=4:\n\nk= 2*4 -6 = 8-6=2. Check 1<=2 <=3 → yes.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:4] → 'abca'.\n\nCheck the last 2 characters of 'abca' → 'ca'.\n\nThe last L=4 characters of t is t[-4:] → 'bcabc'? Wait, original t is 'abcabc' (length 6). t[-4:] is positions 2-5: 'cabc'.\n\nThe first k=2 characters of that is 'ca'.\n\nSo 'ca' vs 'ca' → match. So why is the output NO?\n\nWait, this seems conflicting with the sample. Wait the sample input 'abcabc' outputs 'NO'.\n\nWait why?\n\nBecause according to the problem statement, the error is when two messages are merged. But the case where the two messages are concatenated normally (without overlapping) is not considered an error. So, for example, if the original two messages were 'abc' and 'abc', then the merged string is 'abcabc', which is considered as no error.\n\nBut according to our code's logic, for L=3, which is not in the possible L range. Let me check for the case of 'abcabc' (n=6). Let me check the code's possible L values.\n\nn=6. The possible L is (6+2)//2 = 4. So L ranges from 4 to 5.\n\nSo for L=4, the code would check if the first 4 characters and last 4 characters have overlapping parts. For the example above, the code would find that the last 2 characters of the first 4 characters (s_candidate = 'abca') is 'ca', and the first 2 characters of the last 4 characters (t[-4:] is 'cabc') is 'ca'. So they match. Then according to the code, this would be a valid case, and output YES and 'abca'.\n\nBut according to the sample input, the output is NO. So there's a contradiction here. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Wait, because the code's logic is not considering that the merged string is formed by two s's. But in this case, if the code returns s_candidate as 'abca', then the original two messages would be 'abca' and 'abca', merged with an overlap of k=2. So the merged string would be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] → 'abca' + 'ca' → 'abca' + 'ca' → 'abca ca' → 'abca ca' → which is 'abca ca' → length 4 + 2 = 6. Which is the input string 'abcabc'.\n\nWait, but the input is 'abcabc', which is 'abcabc'. But according to this scenario, the merged string would be 'abca' + 'ca' → 'abca ca' → 'abca ca' → which is 'abca ca' → which is 'abca ca' → which is 'abca' followed by 'ca' → 'abca' + 'ca' = 'abca ca' → 'abca ca' is 'abca ca' which is 'abca' (4 letters) plus 'ca' (2 letters) → total 6 letters. But the input is 'abcabc' (letters a b c a b c). So the merged string would be 'abca' + 'ca' → 'abca ca' → which is a b c a c a → which is 'abacaca'? No, that doesn't match. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.\n\nLet me re-examine. The s_candidate is 'abca' (L=4). The k is 2. So the merged string is s_candidate (abca) concatenated with s_candidate[k:] (s_candidate[2:] is 'ca'). So the merged string is abca + ca → 'abca' + 'ca' → 'abca ca' → 'abca ca' is 'abca' followed by 'ca' → which is a b c a c a → 'abacaca' (length 6). But the input is 'abcabc' which is a b c a b c. So these are different. So why does the code think that it's valid?\n\nBecause the code checks that the first L characters (s_candidate) and the last L characters of the input have the overlapping part. But that's not sufficient. Because the entire input must be equal to s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo the code's current logic is incorrect. It checks that the overlapping part is correct, but not that the entire string is formed by the two s's.\n\nSo the code's current approach is incomplete.\n\nThis is a critical mistake. Let me think again.\n\nThe code checks that the last k characters of s_candidate (the first part) match the first k characters of the last L characters of t. But that's only part of the condition. Because the entire t must be formed by the first s_candidate and the second s_candidate overlapped by k characters.\n\nSo, for example, in the case where the code thinks that the condition is met, but the entire string is not formed by the two s_candidates.\n\nSo, how to ensure that the entire string t is formed by s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]?\n\nIn this case, the entire string t must be equal to s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how can we check that?\n\nWell, the merged string is formed by taking the first s_candidate (length L), and then appending the part of the second s_candidate starting from position k. So the merged string would be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nThe length of this merged string is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n, which is correct.\n\nBut in our example where L=4, k=2, and s_candidate is 'abca', the merged string would be 'abca' + 'ca' = 'abca ca' → 'abacaca' (length 6). But the input is 'abcabc' (length 6). So the code's check that the overlapping parts match is not sufficient. Hence, the code would incorrectly accept this case.\n\nSo, what's wrong with the previous logic?\n\nThe previous logic checked that the last k characters of s_candidate match the first k characters of the last L characters of t. But the last L characters of t is supposed to be the second s_candidate. So, the second s_candidate is the last L characters of t. So, if the first s_candidate is s, then the second s_candidate must be s. Therefore, the last L characters of t must be equal to s. But how can we check that?\n\nAh! Because the second s_candidate is the last L characters of t. So, the entire t must be s_candidate (the first L characters) concatenated with s_candidate[k:] (since the second s_candidate is s_candidate, and the overlapping part is k characters). But the last L characters of t must be equal to s_candidate. Therefore, the entire t must be equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how can we check that?\n\nWell, the entire t must be equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. So, for example, in the case of the input being 'abcabc' and L=4, s_candidate is 'abca', and s_candidate[k:] is 'ca'. So the merged string would be 'abca' + 'ca' = 'abacaca', which is not equal to the input 'abcabc'. Therefore, the code's previous check was insufficient.\n\nSo the code needs to check that the entire string is equal to s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how can we do that?\n\nWell, the entire string t must be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]. So, for example, for the input 'abcabc', the code would generate s_candidate as 'abca', then check if the merged string is 'abca' + 'ca' = 'abacaca', which is not equal to the input. Therefore, this case would not be valid.\n\nSo, the previous approach is missing this check. Therefore, the code needs to check both:\n\n1. The overlapping part (last k of s_candidate equals first k of the last L characters of t).\n\n2. The entire t equals s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how to check the second condition?\n\nWell, the merged string is s_candidate concatenated with s_candidate[k:]. So, the entire string should be equal to that. So, in code:\n\nmerged = s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]\n\nif merged == t → then it is valid.\n\nSo, in the previous example where L=4, k=2, and s_candidate is 'abca', merged is 'abca' + 'ca' → 'abacaca', which is not equal to 'abcabc' → thus invalid.\n\nBut how can we check this?\n\nSo, the code needs to:\n\nFor each L in the possible range:\n\n   compute k = 2L -n.\n\n   if k is between 1 and L-1:\n\n      s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\n      check if the last k characters of s_candidate == first k characters of t[-L:] (i.e., the last L characters of t)\n\n      and also check if s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] == t.\n\nIf both conditions are true, then return YES and s_candidate.\n\nBut why do we need to check both?\n\nBecause even if the overlapping part matches, the entire string may not be formed by merging the two s_candidates.\n\nSo, in the previous example, the overlapping part matched, but the entire string didn't match.\n\nSo, the code needs to check both.\n\nBut how can we check that the last L characters of t are equal to s_candidate?\n\nBecause the second s_candidate is supposed to be the same as the first. So the last L characters of t should be equal to s_candidate.\n\nBut how?\n\nWell, the second s_candidate is the same as the first. So the last L characters of t should be equal to s_candidate. So, the code can check that t[-L:] == s_candidate. If that is true, then the overlapping part is already ensured (since the first k of the second s_candidate is the same as the last k of the first s_candidate). But perhaps that's redundant with the previous check.\n\nWait, if the last L characters of t is s_candidate, then the first k characters of that is s_candidate[:k]. And the last k characters of the first s_candidate is s_candidate[-k:]. So checking that they are equal is equivalent to checking that s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k].\n\nSo, if the last L characters of t is s_candidate, then the overlapping part is checked by comparing s_candidate[-k:] and s_candidate[:k].\n\nSo, perhaps the code can check:\n\nif t[-L:] == s_candidate, and s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k].\n\nBut then, the merged string would be s_candidate + s_candidate[k:] → which is s_candidate concatenated with the part after the first k characters. Which would be the same as the first s_candidate followed by the second s_candidate with the overlapping part removed.\n\nBut since the entire t is supposed to be formed by this, then t must be equal to that merged string.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nAlternatively, if the last L characters of t is s_candidate, and the first L characters is s_candidate, then the entire t is formed by merging them with overlap k. So the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut since the entire t is of length n, which is 2L -k, and the merged string is of the same length, then the entire t must be equal to that.\n\nBut how to verify this?\n\nWell, the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], which is of length L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n. So the entire t must be equal to this.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nIn code, we can check if t == s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nSo, in the case of the example where L=4, k=2, and s_candidate is 'abca', the merged string is 'abca' + 'ca' = 'abacaca', which is not equal to the input 'abcabc'.\n\nSo, the code would not accept this case.\n\nThus, the code needs to check both that the last L characters of t are s_candidate, and that the merged string is equal to t.\n\nAlternatively, checking whether the entire t is equal to the merged string would automatically ensure that the last L characters are s_candidate, since the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], and the entire t is equal to that. Then the last L characters of t would be s_candidate[k:] + ... ?\n\nNo, the merged string is s_candidate (length L) + s_candidate[k:] (length L -k). The total length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k = n. The last L characters of the merged string would be the last L characters of s_candidate + s_candidate[k:].\n\nBut since the merged string is s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], the last L characters would be s_candidate[k:] + ... ?\n\nNot sure. Let me take an example.\n\nIf s_candidate is 'abca' (L=4), k=2. Then merged string is 'abca' + 'ca' → 'abca ca' → 'abacaca' (length 6). The last L=4 characters of this merged string are 'acaca'? No, the merged string is length 6. The last 4 characters are positions 2-5: 'acac'.\n\nBut the s_candidate is 'abca', which is not equal to 'acac'.\n\nSo, the merged string is not the same as the last L characters of t. Thus, the code's previous logic of checking that the last L characters of t equals s_candidate is not correct. Therefore, the code must check that the entire t equals the merged string.\n\nBut how can we compute that?\n\nIn code, for a given L and k, once we have s_candidate = t[0:L], we can generate the merged string as s_candidate + s_candidate[k:], and check if it equals t.\n\nIf it does, then it is a valid case.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\nfor each possible L:\n\n   compute k = 2L -n.\n\n   if k is between 1 and L-1:\n\n      s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\n      merged = s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]\n\n      if merged == t:\n\n          return YES and s_candidate\n\nSo, this approach ensures that the entire string is formed by merging two s_candidates with overlap k.\n\nLet's recheck the previous example where the input is 'abcabc' (n=6), L=4, k=2:\n\ns_candidate = 'abca'\n\nmerged = 'abca' + 'ca' → 'abacaca' (length 6). The input is 'abcabc' → not equal. So this case is rejected.\n\nWhat about L=5 for the same input?\n\nn=6, L=5. k = 2*5 -6 = 4. Check if 1 <=4 <=4 (L-1=5-1=4). Yes.\n\ns_candidate is t[0:5] = 'abcab'.\n\nmerged is 'abcab' + 'ab'[4:] → wait, k=4. s_candidate[k:] is s_candidate[4:] → 'b'.\n\nSo merged is 'abcab' + 'b' → 'abcabb' → which is not equal to 'abcabc'. So no.\n\nThus, for this input, no valid L is found. Hence output is NO, which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the code must check whether the merged string equals t.\n\nThis is the correct approach.\n\nSo, the revised steps are:\n\nFor each possible L in the range [(n+2)//2, n-1]:\n\n   compute k = 2L -n.\n\n   if k is between 1 and L-1:\n\n      s_candidate = t[0:L]\n\n      merged = s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]\n\n      if merged == t:\n\n          return YES and s_candidate.\n\nIf none found, return NO.\n\nThis approach ensures that the entire t is formed by merging two s_candidate strings with overlap k.\n\nNow, let's test this for the sample input 'acacacaca' (n=9).\n\nFor L=5, k=1:\n\ns_candidate is t[0:5] = 'acaca'.\n\nmerged = 'acaca' + s_candidate[1:] → 'acaca' + 'caca' → 'acacacaca' → which is the input. So yes.\n\nThus, this is a valid case.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (assuming the correct input and output).\n\nBut regardless, the code will now correctly check whether the merged string equals t.\n\nNow, the code can be written accordingly.\n\nNow, let's think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input string t.\n\nn = len(t)\n\nfor L in range( (n+2)//2, n ):\n\n   k = 2*L -n\n\n   if 1 <= k <= L-1:\n\n      s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n      merged = s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]\n\n      if merged == t:\n\n          print(\"YES\")\n\n          print(s_candidate)\n\n          exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the range is exclusive on the upper end. So for example, range(a, b) includes a, a+1, ..., b-1. So, for L in the range from (n+2)//2 up to n-1 inclusive, the code should use range( (n+2)//2, n ). Because for example, if n=9, the upper limit is n-1=8. So the range is from (n+2)//2 (which is (9+2)//2 = 5.5 → 5 in integer division?) Wait, in Python, (n+2)//2 for n=9 is (9+2)//2 = 11//2 = 5. So the range is from 5 to n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an error. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that the end of the first message overlaps with the start of the second, and the overlapping part has at least one character but less than the length of `s`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Overlap Requirements**: For a string `t` of length `n`, the possible length `L` of the original message `s` must be such that `L` is between `(n + 2) // 2` and `n - 1`. This range ensures that the overlap `k` (calculated as `2L - n`) is valid (i.e., between 1 and `L - 1`).\n\n2. **Check Valid Overlaps**: For each possible length `L` in the derived range, compute the potential overlap `k`. Check if the overlap is valid and if the resulting merged string from the candidate message `s` matches the input string `t`.\n\n3. **Construct and Validate Merged String**: For each valid candidate message `s`, construct the merged string by combining `s` with its substring starting from the overlap index `k`. If this merged string matches the input string `t`, then `s` is a valid solution.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nn = len(t)\n\nfor L in range((n + 2) // 2, n):\n    k = 2 * L - n\n    if 1 <= k <= L - 1:\n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n        merged = s_candidate + s_candidate[k:]\n        if merged == t:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            print(s_candidate)\n            exit()\n\nprint(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input string `t` is read and its length `n` is determined.\n2. **Iterating Over Possible Lengths**: The loop iterates over possible lengths `L` for the original message `s`, starting from `(n + 2) // 2` up to `n - 1`.\n3. **Calculating Overlap**: For each length `L`, the potential overlap `k` is calculated. If `k` is within the valid range (1 to `L - 1`), the candidate message `s` is extracted from the beginning of `t`.\n4. **Constructing Merged String**: The merged string is constructed by combining the candidate message `s` with the part of `s` starting from index `k`. If this merged string matches the input string `t`, the solution is printed and the program exits.\n5. **Output Result**: If no valid candidate message is found after all iterations, \"NO\" is printed.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid overlaps and ensures the correctness of the solution by validating the entire merged string against the input.",
