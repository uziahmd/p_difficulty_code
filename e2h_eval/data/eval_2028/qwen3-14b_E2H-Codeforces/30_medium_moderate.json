Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Homer and Marge are playing a game with a number A of 2n digits. They take turns picking the leftmost digit, and each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their numbers S1 and S2. And I have to output the sequence of H and M moves that achieves this maximum.\n\nHmm. So the main challenge is to find the optimal sequence of choices between Homer and Marge such that their total is maximized. Since each choice affects the remaining digits and the future choices, this feels like a dynamic programming problem. But considering that n can be up to 18, which makes the total length 36 digits. Let me think about the possible states and transitions.\n\nLet me think: For each state, the key parameters would be how many digits each player has taken so far. Because each player must take exactly n moves, the state can be represented by (h, m), where h is the number of digits Homer has taken, and m is the number Marge has taken. Since the total moves is 2n, h + m = current number of moves made. So, for example, when h + m is k, then there are 2n -k digits left. But since each move takes one digit, the state can be represented by h and m, but since h + m can be derived from the steps taken, maybe we can track h and m as separate variables.\n\nWait, but since the total number of moves is fixed, h can range from 0 to n, and m can range from 0 to n, but h + m can't exceed 2n. However, since each player must take exactly n steps, the state transitions would be such that at any point, the number of steps taken by Homer and Marge can't exceed n. So, the state can be represented by (h, m), where h is the number of times Homer has taken a digit, and m is the number of times Marge has taken a digit. The total steps taken is h + m, and the number of digits left is 2n - (h + m). \n\nAt each state, the next move can be either Homer or Marge, depending on how many steps they have already taken. But the problem is that the choice of who takes the next step depends on the current state. For example, if h < n, then Homer can take the next step. Similarly for Marge. But since each player must take exactly n steps, the next move must be chosen such that after taking it, neither exceeds n steps. So, for the state (h, m), the next possible moves are:\n\nIf h < n: Homer can take the next move (so the new state is (h+1, m)).\n\nIf m < n: Marge can take the next move (new state (h, m+1)).\n\nBut how do we decide which choice leads to the maximum total sum?\n\nThe key here is that the decision at each step depends on the current digits available and the choices made so far. However, since the digits are being taken from the front of the string, the current state also depends on how many digits have been taken. For example, if we have taken k digits (where k = h + m), then the current A is the original string with the first k digits removed. Wait, but the original string is fixed. So, the digits available at any step depend on the number of digits taken so far. For example, the first move takes the first digit of the original string. Then, the next move takes the first digit of the remaining string, which is the second digit of the original, etc. So, for a given state (h, m), the number of digits taken is k = h + m. Therefore, the current digit to take is the (k)th digit in the original string (assuming zero-based or one-based? Well, let's think: if we have taken k digits, then the next digit to take is the (k)th index in the original string. Let's say the original string is stored as a list, and for k digits taken, the next digit is at position k.\n\nSo, the problem can be modeled with a DP state that includes h and m, and the current position in the string (which is h + m). Wait, but the position is determined by h and m. Because for a state (h, m), the number of digits taken is h + m, so the next digit is the (h + m)th digit of the original string. Therefore, the state can be represented as (h, m), and the next digit is known.\n\nSo, the DP approach would be to memoize the maximum total sum achievable from state (h, m), and also track the choices made (H or M) to reconstruct the path.\n\nBut for n up to 18, the number of possible states is (n+1) * (n+1) = 19*19 = 361 when n=18. That's manageable. Because for each state, we have to consider two possibilities (if possible) and choose the one that gives the maximum total.\n\nBut wait, what's the value of the DP? For each state (h, m), the maximum total sum that can be achieved from this state onwards. Let's think recursively.\n\nWhen we are in state (h, m), the next digit is the (h + m)th digit of the original string. Let's call this digit d. Now, the current player can be Homer or Marge, depending on which choice is allowed. For example, if h < n, then Homer can take this digit. If m < n, Marge can take it.\n\nBut how do we model the choice of who takes the next step? Because the decision to take Homer or Marge will affect the sum. For instance, if Homer takes the digit, then he adds d * 10^{n - h - 1} to his number. Wait, no. Wait, the digits are added to their numbers in the order they are taken. For example, if Homer takes the first digit, then the next digit he takes is added to the right of his number. So the value of S1 is the digits taken in the order of the moves. So, for example, if Homer takes digits 1 and 2, his number is 12, which is 1*10^1 + 2*10^0. However, when building the sum, the value of the digits depends on the order in which they are taken. So, the position of the digit in the player's number depends on when it was taken. For example, the first digit Homer takes is the most significant digit of his number. The second is the next, etc.\n\nThis complicates things because the value contributed by a digit depends on when it's taken. So, when considering the DP state, we need to track not only the current state (h, m) but also the positions of the digits taken by each player. However, that seems impossible for n=18, since the state space would be too large.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can model the contribution of the digits as we take them. For example, when Homer takes a digit, the value of that digit in his number is multiplied by 10^{n - h - 1}, since he has already taken h digits, and he will take n digits in total. So, the first digit he takes contributes digit * 10^{n-1}, the second contributes digit * 10^{n-2}, etc. Similarly for Marge.\n\nAh! So for each digit that Homer takes, its contribution to the total sum is digit * 10^{(n - h - 1)}, where h is the number of digits he has already taken before this move. Similarly for Marge's digits. Therefore, during the DP, when considering the next move, we can calculate the immediate contribution of choosing Homer or Marge, and then proceed recursively.\n\nTherefore, the DP function can be defined as follows:\n\ndp(h, m) = maximum total sum achievable from state (h, m), considering the remaining digits.\n\nThe base case is when h == n and m == n, which returns 0.\n\nFor the recursive case, the next digit is d = A[k], where k = h + m. Then, if Homer can take the next move (h < n), then the contribution is d * 10^{n - h - 1} plus dp(h+1, m). Similarly, if Marge can take the next move, the contribution is d * 10^{n - m - 1} plus dp(h, m+1). We need to choose the option that gives the maximum total sum.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the exponent? For example, when Homer takes the next digit, he has already taken h digits. After taking this digit, he has taken h+1 digits. The position of this digit in his number is the (h+1)th digit. Wait, no. Wait, for example, if he takes the first digit, it's the first digit of his number, which is multiplied by 10^{n-1} (since he has n digits in total). When he takes the second digit, it's the second digit, multiplied by 10^{n-2}, etc. So for the current move, when Homer takes the digit, he has already taken h digits, and this is his (h+1)th digit. Therefore, the exponent is (n - (h + 1) + 1 - 1) ? Or maybe n - (h + 1) ?\n\nWait, the number of digits Homer has in his number after taking this digit is h + 1. The first digit is the most significant, so the value is digit * 10^{n - 1} if it's the first digit. For the second digit, it's 10^{n - 2}, etc. So, for the (h+1)th digit he takes, the exponent is (n - (h + 1)) ?\n\nNo. Let's think for n=2. Suppose Homer takes his first digit. It's the first digit of his number. Since his number has 2 digits, the first digit is multiplied by 10^(2-1) = 10^1. The second digit is multiplied by 10^0. So, for the (k)th digit that Homer takes, the exponent is (n - k). Because when he takes the first digit (k=1), exponent is n-1. When he takes the second (k=2), exponent is n-2. So yes, the exponent is (n - k) where k is the count of digits he has taken so far after this move. Wait, but when he takes the digit now, he will have h+1 digits. So k is h+1. Therefore, the exponent is (n - (h+1))? No, wait, the exponent is (n - (h+1)) ? For example, if h is 0, then after taking the first digit, the exponent is n - 1. Which would be (n - (h+1)) = n - 1. Yes. So the contribution of the current digit to the total sum is d * 10^{n - (h + 1)} ?\n\nWait, but the current digit is the (h+1)th digit in Homer's number. So the exponent is (n - (h+1)) ?\n\nYes. So, for Homer taking the digit, the contribution is d * 10^{(n - (h + 1))} ?\n\nWait, no. Because for example, if Homer has already taken h digits, and now takes another digit, making it h+1 digits. The new digit is the (h+1)th digit in his number. The value of that digit is multiplied by 10^{n - (h+1)}. So yes.\n\nSimilarly for Marge: if she takes the digit, then her current count is m, and after taking this digit, it's m+1. The contribution is d * 10^{n - (m+1)}.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the total prize is S1 + S2. So the sum of the numbers of both players. So when Homer takes a digit, that contributes to S1, and when Marge takes a digit, that contributes to S2. So the DP function needs to compute the total sum of S1 and S2 for the rest of the game.\n\nSo, the DP approach would be:\n\nAt each state (h, m), the next digit is d. The options are:\n\nOption 1: Homer takes the digit (if h < n). The contribution to the total sum is d * 10^{n - (h + 1)} + dp(h+1, m).\n\nOption 2: Marge takes the digit (if m < n). The contribution is d * 10^{n - (m + 1)} + dp(h, m+1).\n\nWe need to choose the maximum between these options (if both are possible) or the only possible option.\n\nSo the DP function would return the maximum possible sum from that state onwards.\n\nOnce we compute the DP table, we can then reconstruct the path by choosing at each step which option (H or M) gives the maximum value.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute this efficiently. For n=18, the maximum number of digits is 36. The DP states are (h, m) where h ranges from 0 to n and m ranges from 0 to n. For each state, we can compute the value based on the next possible steps.\n\nBut the problem is that for each state, the calculation involves exponents of 10. For example, 10^{n - h - 1} can be very large. However, since n can be up to 18, 10^18 is a very big number. But in Python, integers can handle arbitrary sizes. However, for n=18, the maximum possible sum is (for all digits 9) 9 * (10^18 + ... + 10^0) * 2. Which is a very big number, but Python can handle it.\n\nBut the problem is that for memoization, the DP function may have overlapping subproblems. So memoization is needed. However, with n up to 18, the number of states is (19)^2 = 361, which is manageable.\n\nBut how to compute the exponents quickly. Let's precompute the powers of 10 for each possible exponent. For example, for each possible (h, m) in the DP, when Homer takes a digit, the exponent is (n - h - 1). Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nWhen Homer takes the digit, he has already taken h digits. This is the (h+1)th digit he takes. So the exponent is (n - (h+1)) ?\n\nWait, for example, n=2. Homer takes his first digit. The exponent is 2 - 1 = 1. Which is correct. Then, when he takes his second digit, the exponent is 2 - 2 = 0. Correct. So yes, the exponent is (n - (h + 1)) ?\n\nWait, no. For the first digit, h is 0. So exponent is n - (h + 1) = 2 - 1 = 1. Correct. So yes.\n\nSo, for Homer's contribution when taking the digit, the value is digit * 10^{n - h - 1} ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the exponent is (n - (h + 1))? Because the digit is the (h+1)th digit of his number. So the exponent is (n - (h + 1))? For example, n=2, h=0: exponent is 2 - 0 - 1 = 1. Which is correct. So the formula is 10^{n - h - 1} ?\n\nYes. So for Homer's contribution, the value is d * (10 ** (n - h - 1)).\n\nSimilarly for Marge's contribution, it's d * (10 ** (n - m - 1)).\n\nSo, the DP can be implemented with memoization, and for each state, we calculate the maximum of the possible options.\n\nNow, the next thing is to implement this DP with memoization and track the path.\n\nBut how to track the path. For that, during the DP computation, we can also track which choice (H or M) was taken at each state to reach the maximum value. So, for each state (h, m), we can store not only the maximum value but also the choice (H or M) that was made.\n\nAlternatively, once the DP table is filled, we can reconstruct the path by checking for each state which choice (H or M) gives the maximum value.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Precompute the powers of 10 up to 10^18, since n can be up to 18. For example, for exponents from 0 to 18.\n\nBut wait, for n=18, the maximum exponent for Homer's contribution is when h is 0. Then, the exponent is 18 - 0 - 1 = 17. So 10^17. Similarly for Marge. So precomputing 10^i for i from 0 to 18 is sufficient.\n\nBut in Python, 10**18 is manageable.\n\nSo, for each state (h, m), the current digit is A[k], where k = h + m. The digit is A[k], which is a character, so we need to convert it to an integer.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\n- Read n and A.\n\n- Precompute the power of 10 for exponents from 0 to n.\n\nWait, but for each possible (h, m), the exponents can be up to n - 0 - 1 = n - 1. So for exponents up to 18-1=17. So precompute pow10[i] = 10^i for i from 0 to 18.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can compute it on the fly, but precomputing is better for speed.\n\nBut for n up to 18, even computing 10^something each time is acceptable.\n\nNow, implement the DP with memoization. Since Python has a limit on recursion depth, but for n=18, the maximum recursion depth would be 2n = 36 steps, which is manageable. However, for memoization, it's better to use memoization via a dictionary or a memo table.\n\nAlternatively, implement memoization with memoization via lru_cache. However, since n is small, and the parameters h and m are small, using memoization with functools.lru_cache should be feasible.\n\nBut for Python, the maximum recursion depth for 36 steps is okay.\n\nBut let's think about the DP function. Let's define a function that takes h and m, and returns the maximum total sum from that state. Also, we need to track the path, which requires knowing for each state whether the best choice is H or M.\n\nSo, perhaps we can write a memoization-based DP function that returns the maximum value, and then a separate function to reconstruct the path.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP computation, we can also track the choices made.\n\nLet me outline the code structure:\n\nRead n and A as input. For example, n is given as an integer, and A is a string of 2n digits.\n\nThen, precompute the pow10 array. For exponents up to n.\n\nBut for each state, the current digit is A[k], where k = h + m. For example, when h=0 and m=0, k=0, which is the first digit.\n\nNow, the DP function:\n\ndef dp(h, m):\n\n    if h + m == 2n: return 0\n\n    if memo contains (h, m): return memo[(h, m)]\n\n    k = h + m\n\n    current_digit = int(A[k])\n\n    max_val = -infinity\n\n    choices = []\n\n    if h < n:\n\n        # Homer takes the digit\n\n        contribution = current_digit * pow(10, n - h - 1)\n\n        val = contribution + dp(h+1, m)\n\n        if val > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val\n\n            choices.append('H')\n\n    if m < n:\n\n        # Marge takes the digit\n\n        contribution = current_digit * pow(10, n - m - 1)\n\n        val = contribution + dp(h, m+1)\n\n        if val > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val\n\n            choices.append('M')\n\n    # Now, choose the best option (if multiple, pick any, but according to the problem statement, any is acceptable)\n\n    # But how to track which choice was made?\n\n    memo[(h, m)] = max_val\n\n    return max_val\n\nWait, but this approach would not track which choice (H or M) was made. So, to reconstruct the path, we need to track, for each (h, m), which choice (H or M) leads to the maximum value.\n\nSo, perhaps we can have another memoization table that stores for each (h, m) the choice to make.\n\nAlternatively, during the DP, when computing the maximum value, we can also record the choice.\n\nSo, perhaps, the DP function can return both the maximum value and the choice (H or M) that should be taken.\n\nBut for memoization, perhaps it's easier to split into two functions: one that computes the maximum value, and another that reconstructs the path based on the decisions made.\n\nBut for the purposes of code, perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\nImplement a memoization table for the maximum value, and then during the reconstruction phase, for each state (h, m), check which choice (H or M) gives the maximum value, and proceed accordingly.\n\nBut for that, during the DP computation, we need to have stored the maximum value for each (h, m).\n\nSo, the code would proceed as follows:\n\n- Compute the DP table for all (h, m) states.\n\n- Once the DP table is filled, start from (0, 0) and for each step, decide whether to choose H or M based on which option gives the maximum value.\n\nBut how to compute the DP table? Let's think of memoizing the maximum value for each (h, m) state.\n\nImplementing this with memoization using recursion and memoization via lru_cache.\n\nBut for Python, with n up to 18, the maximum number of states is 19*19 = 361, which is manageable.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nUse memoization with lru_cache for the dp function, which returns the maximum total sum from state (h, m).\n\nOnce that is computed, then we can reconstruct the path by starting at (0, 0), and for each state, check whether taking H or M gives the maximum value, and choose accordingly.\n\nBut how to compare the two options? For example, in state (h, m), if both options are possible, we need to check which one gives a higher value. If they are equal, we can choose either (the problem says to output any of them).\n\nSo, during the reconstruction phase:\n\nInitialize h = 0, m = 0, and result string as empty.\n\nWhile h + m < 2n:\n\n    k = h + m\n\n    current_digit = A[k]\n\n    if h < n and m < n:\n\n        val_h = current_digit * 10^{n - h - 1} + dp(h+1, m)\n\n        val_m = current_digit * 10^{n - m - 1} + dp(h, m+1)\n\n        if val_h >= val_m:\n\n            append 'H' to result, h += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            append 'M' to result, m += 1\n\n    elif h < n:\n\n        append 'H', h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        append 'M', m += 1\n\nBut this approach requires that during the reconstruction phase, we can compute the value of each option, which requires calling the dp function again. However, since the dp function is memoized, this is acceptable.\n\nBut how to compute the 10^exponents quickly? Well, we can precompute them as a list, or compute them on the fly.\n\nBut for code, perhaps it's better to precompute a list of powers of 10 up to 18, since n can be up to 18.\n\nSo, for example, pow10 = [10**i for i in range(0, 19)].\n\nThen, for Homer's contribution, when taking the current digit, it's digit * pow10[n - h - 1].\n\nBut wait, n - h - 1 can be negative? No, because when h < n. For example, when h is n-1, then n - h - 1 = 0. So exponents are from 0 to n-1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n, A.\n\nCompute pow10 as [10**i for i in range(0, n)] ?\n\nWait, for n up to 18, the maximum exponent needed is n - 0 - 1 = 17. So pow10 needs to have up to 10^17. So, pow10 = [10**i for i in range(0, 18)] ?\n\nYes. So for exponents from 0 to 17, which is 18 elements.\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can compute it as pow10 = [10**i for i in range(0, n)] ?\n\nNo, because for n=18, the maximum exponent is 17. So pow10 needs to have up to 17. So, pow10 = [10**i for i in range(0, n)] ?\n\nNo, because for i in 0 to n-1, which would be 0 to 17 for n=18. So yes.\n\nSo, pow10 = [10**i for i in range(0, n)] ?\n\nBut wait, when n is 18, the pow10 list has 18 elements, indexes 0 to 17. Which is correct.\n\nBut in code, when we need to compute 10^{n - h - 1}, for example, if h is 0, then n - h - 1 = n -1. Which is 17 when n=18. So the pow10 list needs to have index up to 17. Which is covered.\n\nSo, the code can precompute pow10 as [10**i for i in range(0, n)].\n\nWait, but if n is 1, then pow10 has 1 element (10^0 = 1). For example, when h is 0, n - h - 1 = 1 - 0 -1 = 0. So pow10[0] is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the DP function.\n\nBut in Python, for memoization, using lru_cache with h and m as parameters.\n\nBut the problem is that the A string is part of the input. However, the DP function is dependent on the current A. So, the DP function must be inside a scope where A is accessible.\n\nBut in Python, if we use a function inside another function, then the inner function can access the variables of the outer function.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n and A.\n\nprecompute pow10.\n\nImplement a memoized DP function.\n\nBut in Python, for memoization, using lru_cache requires that the parameters of the function are hashable. So, h and m are integers, which are hashable.\n\nSo, code outline:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nA = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\npow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]  # Wait, but when n is 18, the exponents go up to 17, which is 10^17. So pow10 has 18 elements (indices 0-17).\n\nWait, the code for pow10 is [10**i for i in range(n)]? For example, for n=2, pow10 is [1, 10]. But when n is 2, the maximum exponent is 2-0-1 = 1. So pow10[1] is 10. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, the exponents for Homer's contribution is n - h - 1. So for example, when h is 0, the exponent is n - 1. So pow10 needs to have index up to (n-1). Which is exactly the case when pow10 is [10^i for i in 0..n-1].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code for pow10 is correct.\n\nNow, the DP function:\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n\ndef dp(h, m):\n\n    if h + m == 2 * n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    k = h + m\n\n    current_digit = int(A[k])\n\n    max_val = -1\n\n    # check if Homer can take the next step\n\n    if h < n:\n\n        # Homer takes it\n\n        exponent = n - h - 1\n\n        contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n\n        val = contribution + dp(h+1, m)\n\n        if val > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val\n\n    if m < n:\n\n        # Marge takes it\n\n        exponent = n - m - 1\n\n        contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n\n        val = contribution + dp(h, m+1)\n\n        if val > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val\n\n    return max_val\n\nWait, but in the code above, if both options are possible, then the code checks both and returns the maximum. However, the code as written may not work correctly because the initial max_val is set to -1, but for some cases, the contributions could be negative? No, since the digits are 0-9, and pow10 is positive. So the contributions are non-negative. So initializing max_val to -1 is safe.\n\nBut what if both options are possible and the maximum is between the two?\n\nBut the code above would check both options and take the maximum.\n\nBut in the code, when both options are possible, the code first checks Homer's option, then Marge's option, and updates the max_val accordingly.\n\nBut in the code, the initial max_val is -1, and for each possible option, it checks if val is larger than max_val and updates accordingly.\n\nBut this code would work, but the problem is that when both options are possible, but the code may not capture the correct maximum. For example, if the Homer option gives a value of 5, and Marge gives 10, then the code would first set max_val to 5, then check Marge's option and set it to 10.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the code, the 'max_val' is initialized to -1. However, when both options are possible, but the maximum is zero? Well, in that case, the code would have a problem. But since the digits are non-negative, and the contribution is non-negative, the max_val can't be negative. So initializing to -1 is okay.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to initialize max_val to -infinity, but in Python, that's possible.\n\nBut in the code above, the code is written as:\n\nmax_val = -1\n\nBut for example, if the current digit is zero, and all the rest of the digits are zero, then the maximum value would be zero. So initializing to -1 would work, but perhaps it's safer to use float('-inf').\n\nSo, perhaps changing the code to:\n\nmax_val = -float('inf')\n\nBut then, for each option, compute the val and compare.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\n@lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n\ndef dp(h, m):\n\n    if h + m == 2 * n:\n\n        return 0\n\n    k = h + m\n\n    current_digit = int(A[k])\n\n    max_val = -float('inf')\n\n    # check Homer's option\n\n    if h < n:\n\n        exponent = n - h - 1\n\n        contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n\n        val = contribution + dp(h+1, m)\n\n        if val > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val\n\n    # check Marge's option\n\n    if m < n:\n\n        exponent = n - m - 1\n\n        contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n\n        val = contribution + dp(h, m+1)\n\n        if val > max_val:\n\n            max_val = val\n\n    return max_val\n\nBut this code would work. However, in Python, the recursion depth is okay for n=18.\n\nOnce the DP table is computed, the next step is to reconstruct the path.\n\nTo reconstruct the path, we can start with h=0, m=0, and for each step, decide whether to choose H or M based on which option gives the maximum value.\n\nBut how to compare the two options during reconstruction?\n\nAt each step, for current h and m, we can check:\n\ncurrent_digit = int(A[k]), where k = h + m.\n\nIf both Homer and Marge can take the next step, then:\n\nval_h = current_digit * pow10[exponent_h] + dp(h+1, m)\n\nval_m = current_digit * pow10[exponent_m] + dp(h, m+1)\n\nIf val_h >= val_m, choose H, else choose M.\n\nBut during reconstruction, we need to compute these values again, which is possible since the dp function is memoized.\n\nSo, the code for reconstruction:\n\nresult = []\n\nh, m = 0, 0\n\nwhile h + m < 2 * n:\n\n    k = h + m\n\n    current_digit = int(A[k])\n\n    if h < n and m < n:\n\n        # both options possible\n\n        exponent_h = n - h - 1\n\n        contribution_h = current_digit * pow10[exponent_h]\n\n        val_h = contribution_h + dp(h+1, m)\n\n        exponent_m = n - m - 1\n\n        contribution_m = current_digit * pow10[exponent_m]\n\n        val_m = contribution_m + dp(h, m+1)\n\n        if val_h >= val_m:\n\n            result.append('H')\n\n            h += 1\n\n        else:\n\n            result.append('M')\n\n            m += 1\n\n    elif h < n:\n\n        result.append('H')\n\n        h += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        result.append('M')\n\n        m += 1\n\nOnce the loop is done, the result list contains the sequence of moves.\n\nBut wait, the code for the reconstruction uses the dp function again. However, since the dp function is memoized, this is acceptable.\n\nBut in the code, during the reconstruction phase, the dp function is called again for (h+1, m) and (h, m+1), which were already computed during the initial DP phase. So, this is okay.\n\nBut in Python, the code for the dp function must be called with the same parameters. So this approach should work.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n2\n\n1234\n\nSample Output: HHMM.\n\nLet's see.\n\nn=2, A is '1234'.\n\npow10 is [1, 10] (since for n=2, range(2) is 0,1).\n\nThe DP function:\n\nAt state (0, 0), the current digit is 1 (index 0).\n\nHomer can take it, contributing 1 * 10^(2 - 0 - 1) = 1 * 10^1 = 10. Then, the next state is (1, 0).\n\nOr Marge can take it, contributing 1 * 10^(2 - 0 - 1) = same as Homer's contribution? Wait, no. For Marge, the exponent is n - m - 1. At m=0, it's 2-0-1=1. So contribution is 1 * 10^1 = 10. So both options contribute 10. But which one is better?\n\nSo, the code would choose between them based on which gives higher value.\n\nSo, for the first step, the code would compare the value of choosing H or M.\n\nBut let's see what the dp returns for (0,0).\n\nLet me think recursively.\n\nBut perhaps it's easier to run through the code.\n\nBut in any case, the sample output for this input is 'HHMM', which implies that Homer takes the first two digits, then Marge takes the next two.\n\nBut let's think about the total sum.\n\nS1 would be 12, S2 would be 34. Total is 12 + 34 = 46.\n\nAnother possibility is HMHM: Homer takes 1, then Marge takes 2, then Homer takes 3, then Marge takes 4. S1 is 13, S2 is 24. Sum is 37, which is less than 46. So the maximum is indeed 46, which is achieved by HHMM.\n\nSo the code should generate 'HHMM'.\n\nNow, during the reconstruction phase, when the code is at (0,0), the code would compare val_h and val_m. Both are 10 plus the value of their respective next steps.\n\nBut what is the value of dp(1,0) and dp(0,1)?\n\nLet me try to compute them.\n\nBut this might take time, but perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps the code would work correctly.\n\nNow, the code for the reconstruction is correct, but there is a problem with the pow10 array. Wait,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that their total prize money is maximized. The game involves taking turns to pick digits from a given number, with each player making exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the sum of their respective numbers formed by the digits they pick.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a DP approach to explore all possible sequences of moves and determine the maximum total prize money. The state of our DP function is defined by the number of moves each player has made so far (h for Homer and m for Marge).\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: Since the value of each digit picked by a player depends on its position in their number, we precompute powers of 10 up to the maximum needed value (10^18) to efficiently calculate the contribution of each digit.\n3. **Reconstruct the Path**: After computing the DP table, we reconstruct the sequence of moves by comparing the values obtained from choosing Homer or Marge at each step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    pow10 = [10**i for i in range(n)]  # Precompute powers of 10 up to 10^(n-1)\n\n    @lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        if h + m == 2 * n:\n            return 0\n        k = h + m\n        current_digit = int(A[k])\n        max_val = -float('inf')\n        # Check Homer's move\n        if h < n:\n            exponent = n - h - 1\n            contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n            val = contribution + dp(h + 1, m)\n            if val > max_val:\n                max_val = val\n        # Check Marge's move\n        if m < n:\n            exponent = n - m - 1\n            contribution = current_digit * pow10[exponent]\n            val = contribution + dp(h, m + 1)\n            if val > max_val:\n                max_val = val\n        return max_val\n\n    # Reconstruct the path\n    result = []\n    h, m = 0, 0\n    while h + m < 2 * n:\n        k = h + m\n        current_digit = int(A[k])\n        if h < n and m < n:\n            # Both options are possible\n            exponent_h = n - h - 1\n            contribution_h = current_digit * pow10[exponent_h]\n            val_h = contribution_h + dp(h + 1, m)\n            exponent_m = n - m - 1\n            contribution_m = current_digit * pow10[exponent_m]\n            val_m = contribution_m + dp(h, m + 1)\n            if val_h >= val_m:\n                result.append('H')\n                h += 1\n            else:\n                result.append('M')\n                m += 1\n        elif h < n:\n            result.append('H')\n            h += 1\n        else:\n            result.append('M')\n            m += 1\n\n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of an integer `n` and a string `A` of length `2n`.\n2. **Precompute Powers of 10**: This helps in quickly calculating the contribution of each digit based on its position in the players' numbers.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Function**: The `dp` function recursively calculates the maximum total prize money from the current state `(h, m)`, considering both possible moves (Homer or Marge).\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: After computing the DP table, we reconstruct the optimal sequence of moves by comparing the potential values of each move at each step, ensuring we always choose the move that maximizes the total prize money.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently explore all possible move sequences using memoization to avoid redundant calculations, leading to an optimal solution.",
