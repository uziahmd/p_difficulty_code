    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about counting the number of arrays of sets that can be rearranged such that each set in the sequence is a child of the next one. Let me break down the requirements.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"child\" set means. The definition says that for each element x in set A, there must be an element x+1 in set B. So, for example, if A has {1}, then B must have 2. If A has {1,2}, then B must have 2 and 3. Oh right, but B can have more elements than required. So the child relationship is about the presence of x+1 in B for every x in A.\n\nThe task is to find the number of arrays of N sets where each set contains integers from 1 to K, and there exists some permutation of the array such that each S'_i is a child of S'_{i+1}.\n\nSo the key here is that the array can be reordered into a sequence where each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition. How do I model this?\n\nLet me think about the constraints on the sets. For any valid permutation, each set in the sequence must be a child of the next. That suggests that in the permutation, the sets must form a chain where each step satisfies the child condition.\n\nBut how can I model this for all possible permutations? It seems complicated. Maybe there's a way to model the structure of the sets such that they can be ordered in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to model the problem by considering the dependencies between the sets. Let me think: for a set S, if it's placed before another set T in the permutation, then S must be a child of T. But since the permutation can be any order, maybe the actual arrangement depends on some hierarchy of the sets.\n\nWait, but the problem allows any permutation. So perhaps the sets must form a DAG where there's a topological order. However, since we can arrange them in any order, maybe the sets must be such that they can be ordered in a way that each set is a child of the next. But how to model that?\n\nAnother angle: Let's think about the entire array of sets. For there to exist a permutation where each S_i is a child of S_{i+1}, the sets must be arranged in a way that their dependencies can be ordered. But perhaps the problem reduces to the sets being able to be ordered in a sequence where each set is a \"parent\" of the next. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of each set as a node in a graph. There's an edge from A to B if A is a child of B. Then, the problem requires that the array of sets can be arranged into a path of length N-1, where each step follows an edge. But since the array can be rearranged, the question becomes whether the sets can be ordered in such a way.\n\nBut considering all possible permutations, maybe the problem is equivalent to the sets forming a collection that can be ordered in a chain where each consecutive pair satisfies the child condition. But how to count all such arrays?\n\nThis feels too abstract. Let me think of the problem in terms of the properties that each set must satisfy with respect to others. For example, suppose that in the array, after rearrangement, the sets are ordered S_1', S_2', ..., S_N'. Then, each S_i' must be a child of S_{i+1}'. Which implies that for every x in S_i', there's x+1 in S_{i+1}'.\n\nBut since the permutation can be any order, perhaps the sets must be such that for any two sets A and B in the array, either A is a child of B or B is a child of A. Because otherwise, you can't arrange them in a sequence where each is a child of the next. Wait, but that's not necessarily true. Suppose you have three sets A, B, C where A is a child of B and B is a child of C. Then you can arrange them as A, B, C. But if you have two sets A and B where neither is a child of the other, then you can't arrange them in any order. So for the array to be valid, all the sets in the array must be comparable in this child relationship. That is, for any two sets in the array, one must be a child of the other. Because otherwise, you can't arrange them in a sequence where each is a child of the next.\n\nWait, that's a crucial point. Because if there are two sets A and B in the array such that neither is a child of the other, then in any permutation, they would be adjacent, and thus violate the condition. Therefore, the entire array of sets must form a totally ordered set under the child relationship. So the array must consist of sets that",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of arrays of sets that can be rearranged such that each set in the sequence is a child of the next one. The key insight here is that for any valid array, all sets must be comparable under the \"child\" relationship, forming a total order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Child Relationship**: A set A is a child of set B if every element x in A has an element x+1 in B. This implies a dependency where elements in A are \"lower\" than those in B.\n2. **Total Order Requirement**: For the array to be rearranged into a valid sequence, all sets must be comparable. This means for any two sets in the array, one must be a child of the other.\n3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use dynamic programming to count valid configurations. Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of ways to form a sequence of `i` sets using integers up to `j`. The transition involves considering whether to include `j` in the sets or not.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    N = int(data[0])\n    K = int(data[1])\n    \n    # dp[i][j]: number of ways to have i sets with max value j\n    # We can optimize space by using two 1D arrays\n    # Since K can be up to 2e5, we need O(K) space\n    # Initialize dp_prev as the previous row\n    \n    # dp_prev[j] represents the number of ways for i-1 sets with max value j\n    # dp_curr[j] represents the number of ways for i sets with max value j\n    \n    # Initial state: for i=1, each set can be any subset of {1..j}\n    # But we need to consider the total number of subsets for each j\n    # However, our DP approach needs to track how the sets can be ordered\n    \n    # The key idea is that for each level i, the number of valid sequences of i sets\n    # is the sum over all possible max values j of dp[i][j], where dp[i][j] is calculated based on transitions\n    \n    # Let's think of dp[i][j] as the number of ways to arrange i sets such that their max value is exactly j\n    # Then, the total answer is the sum over all j from 1 to K of dp[N][j]\n    \n    # However, the recurrence is tricky.

For S to be a child of T, every element x in S must have x+1 in T. Since x can be m, then m+1 must be in T. But T's max element is m, which is impossible. Hence, the maxima must be strictly increasing.\n    \n    # Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of sequences of N sets where the maximum element of each set is strictly increasing. Each set's maximum element can be any value, but the sequence of maxima must be strictly increasing.\n    \n    # Now, the number of such sequences is the sum over all possible strictly increasing sequences of length N of the product of the number of sets with that maximum element.\n    \n    # Letâ€™s denote for each value m (from 1 to K), the number of sets with maximum element m is 2^{m-1}. Because to have a maximum of m, the set must contain m and any subset of {1, ..., m-1}.\n    \n    # So for each position in the sequence, the choice of maximum element must be strictly increasing. The total number of such sequences is the sum over all strictly increasing sequences (a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N) of the product (2^{a_1 - 1} * 2^{a_2 - 1} * ... * 2^{a_N - 1}).\n    \n    # This can be rewritten as the sum over all sequences of a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N of 2^{(a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_N) - N}.\n    \n    # However, calculating this directly is infeasible for large K and N.\n    \n    # To compute this efficiently, we can use dynamic programming.

Then, any set T that is a parent of S must have maximum element >= m+1.\n    \n    # Thus, the problem reduces to counting the number of sequences of N sets where each set's maximum element is strictly increasing when ordered in the sequence.\n    \n    # Because if the maximum elements are strictly increasing, then each set is a child of the next. Because for a set with max element m, the next set has max element at least m+1. So for any x in the first set, x <= m, and x+1 <= m+1, which is present in the next set.\n    \n    # Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of sequences of N sets where each set has a maximum element, and these maxima form a non-decreasing sequence. Wait, no. It must be strictly increasing because if the next set has the same max, then it's not guaranteed that the current set is a child of the next.\n    \n    # For example, if a set S has max element m, and the next set T has max element m. For S to be a child of T, every element x in S must have x+1 in T. Since x can be m, then m+1 must be in T. But T's max element is m, which is impossible. Hence, the maxima must be strictly increasing.\n    \n    # Therefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of sequences of N sets where the maximum element of each set is strictly increasing. Each set's maximum element can be any value, but the sequence of maxima must be strictly increasing.\n    \n    # Now, the number of such sequences is the sum over all possible strictly increasing sequences of length N of the product of the number of sets with that maximum element.\n    \n    # Letâ€™s denote for each value m (from 1 to K), the number of sets with maximum element m is 2^{m-1}. Because to have a maximum of m, the set must contain m and any subset of {1, ..., m-1}.\n    \n    # So for each position in the sequence, the choice of maximum element must be strictly increasing. The total number of such sequences is the sum over all strictly increasing sequences (a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N) of the product (2^{a_1 - 1} * 2^{a_2 - 1} * ... * 2^{a_N - 1}).\n    \n    # This can be rewritten as the sum over all sequences of a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_N of 2^{(a_1 + a_2 + ... + a_N) - N}.\n    \n    # However, calculating this directly is infeasible for large K and N.\n    \n    # To compute this efficiently, we can use dynamic programming. Let dp[i][j] be the number of ways to choose i elements with maximum value j. Then, the recurrence is:\n    # dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j-1] * 2^{j-1}\n    \n    # Here, dp[i][j] represents the number of sequences of length i with maximum value exactly j. The first term accounts for sequences where the maximum value is less than j, and the second term adds sequences where the maximum value is j by appending j to sequences of length i-1 with maximum value less than j.\n    \n    # The final answer is the sum of dp[N][j] for all j from 1 to K.\n    \n    # Implementing this with a 1D DP array to save space:\n    \n    # Initialize dp_prev as the previous row (for i-1)\n    # For each i from 1 to N:\n    #   Initialize dp_curr as a new array\n    #   For j from 1 to K:\n    #       dp_curr[j] = dp_prev[j] + dp_prev[j-1] * pow(2, j-1, MOD)\n    #       (but we need to handle the initial conditions properly)\n    \n    # However, the initial condition for i=1 is dp[1][j] = 2^{j-1} for each j.\n    \n    # So let's proceed with the code.\n    \n    # Precompute powers of 2 up to K\n    max_k = K\n    pow2 = [1] * (max_k + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_k + 1):\n        pow2[i] = (pow2[i-1] * 2) % MOD\n    \n    # Initialize dp_prev as for i=1\n    dp_prev = [0] * (max_k + 1)\n    for j in range(1, max_k + 1):\n        dp_prev[j] = pow2[j-1]\n    \n    for i in range(2, N+1):\n        dp_curr = [0] * (max_k + 1)\n        for j in range(1, max_k + 1):\n            dp_curr[j] = (dp_prev[j] + dp_prev[j-1] * pow2[j-1]) % MOD\n        dp_prev = dp_curr\n    \n    # Sum all dp_prev[j] for j from 1 to K\n    result = sum(dp_prev[1:]) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
