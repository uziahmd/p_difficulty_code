    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe instability is defined as the maximum element minus the minimum in the array after removing one element. So, my goal is to find which element to remove such that this difference is minimized.\n\nFirst, let's think about the brute force approach. For each element in the array, if I remove it, compute the max and min of the remaining elements and calculate the difference. Then pick the minimum among all those differences. But with n up to 1e5, this approach would be O(n^2), which is definitely not feasible. So I need a smarter way.\n\nWait, but what's the maximum and minimum of the array when we remove one element? Let's think about the original array. Suppose the array is sorted. Because if the array is sorted, then the max and min are at the ends. So maybe sorting the array can help here.\n\nLet me think. If the array is sorted, then for each position i, when we remove the element at i, the new max and min would be:\n\nIf the array is sorted as a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]. If I remove a[i], then the new max is max(a[0], ..., a[i-1], a[i+1], ..., a[n-1]) which is the same as the original max except when i is the first or last element. Wait, no. If the array is sorted, then the original max is a[-1], min is a[0]. If I remove an element that's not the first or last, then the max and min remain the same. But if I remove the first element (a[0]), then the new min is a[1], and the max is a[-1]. Similarly, if I remove the last element, the new max is a[-2], min is a[0].\n\nSo for the sorted array, the instability after removing element i would be:\n\nIf i is not the first or last element, then the instability is a[-1] - a[0], same as original. But that's only if we remove an element from the middle. However, if we remove the first element, then the instability is a[-1] - a[1]. If we remove the last element, it's a[-2] - a[0]. \n\nWait, but the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. So when you remove an element from the middle, the instability remains the same. So the minimal instability would be the minimum between (a[-1] - a[1]) and (a[-2] - a[0]). Because those are the two possibilities when you remove either the first or last element. But wait, what if there are multiple elements with the same value?\n\nFor example, in the first sample input: [1,3,3,7]. When sorted, it's [1,3,3,7]. The original instability is 7-1=6. If you remove the 7 (last element), the new array is [1,3,3], instability is 3-1=2. If you remove the first element (1), the instability is 7-3=4. If you remove any of the middle elements (the 3s), then the instability is 7-1=6. So the best is to remove the last element. So the answer is 2.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]). \n\nBut what if the array is longer? Like for example, n=5. Then, when you remove the first element, the instability is a[-1] - a[1]. When you remove the last element, it's a[-2] - a[0]. But what if you remove some other element? For example, if the array is [1,2,3,4,5]. If you remove the 3, the instability is 5-1=4. Which is same as original. So the minimal instability would be min between (a[-1]-a[1], a[-2]-a[0]). Which in this case is min(5-2=3, 4-1=3) → 3. Which is better than removing the middle element.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]). Because when you remove the first element, the new min is a[1], and the max is a[-1]. When you remove the last element, the new max is a[-2], and the min is a[0]. But what about when you remove elements in between? For example, if the array is sorted, and you remove an element that's not first or last. Then the max and min are still the same as original. So the instability is a[-1] - a[0], which is larger than the two options above. Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between the two options: removing the first element or the last element. \n\nWait, but what if there are multiple elements that are same as the first or last? For example, if the array is [1,1,1,1]. Then removing any element would give instability 0. So the answer is 0. Which is covered by the above approach.\n\nAnother example: if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. The original instability is 5. If you remove the first element, the instability is 6-2=4. If you remove the last element, it's 5-1=4. So the answer is 4. But if you remove the second element, the instability is 6-1=5. So indeed, the minimal is achieved by removing first or last.\n\nSo this suggests that the optimal choice is to remove either the first element or the last element. Therefore, the answer is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nWait, but what if the array is [1,3,4,5,7]. Suppose we remove the 3. Then the array is [1,4,5,7]. The instability is 7-1=6. Which is same as original. But if we remove the 7, the instability is 5-1=4. Which is better. So the minimal is achieved by removing the last element. Which is considered in the above approach.\n\nBut what if the array is [1, 2, 4, 5, 7]. Then, the original instability is 7-1=6. If I remove the 2, the instability is 7-1=6. If I remove the 4, the instability is 7-1=6. If I remove the 5, same. But if I remove the 1, the instability is 7-2=5. If I remove the 7, the instability is 5-1=4. So again, the minimum is between the two options.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal instability is min( (a[-2] - a[0]), (a[-1] - a[1]) ). Therefore, the approach would be:\n\nSort the array. Then compute these two values and take the minimum.\n\nWait, but what if n is 2? For example, the second example given is input 2 with elements 1 and 100000. When sorted, it's [1, 100000]. Then, removing the first element gives instability 0 (since the array has one element, the max and min are same). Same for removing the second element. So the answer is 0. Which is correct. So in this case, the code would compute a[-2] - a[0] → a[0] - a[0] = 0, and a[-1] - a[1] → a[1] - a[1] = 0. So min(0,0) is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to handle all cases. So the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- Compute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nWait, but what if n is 3? For example, array [1, 2, 3]. If we remove the first element, the array is [2,3], instability 1. If we remove the last element, array [1,2], instability 1. If we remove the middle element, array [1,3], instability 2. So the answer is 1. Which is min( a[-2] - a[0] = 2 - 1 = 1, a[-1] - a[1] = 3 - 2 = 1). So yes, the approach works.\n\nAnother example: array [1, 3, 4, 5]. Original instability is 5-1=4. If we remove 1, the instability is 5-3=2. If we remove 5, instability is 4-1=3. So the answer is 2, which is min(4-1=3 (a[-2] - a[0] is 4-1=3?), wait wait. Wait, the array is sorted as [1,3,4,5]. So a[-2] is 4, a[0] is 1. So a[-2] - a[0] is 3. a[-1] is 5, a[1] is 3. So 5-3=2. So min(3,2) is 2. Which is correct. So the approach works.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array, then compute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements that are same? Like array [1, 1, 1, 1]. Then the answer is 0, which is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nSort the array. Then compute the two possibilities and take the minimum.\n\nBut wait, what about if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The answer is min( (4-1)=3, (5-2)=3) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it. Then compute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut wait, what if n is 2? Then a[-2] is a[0], so a[-2] - a[0] is zero. Similarly for the other term. So the answer is 0, which is correct.\n\nSo this approach handles all cases. Therefore, the solution is to sort the array, then compute these two values and take the minimum.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead the array as list of integers.\n\nSort the array.\n\nIf n == 2:\n\n   print 0\n\nElse:\n\n   compute option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n   compute option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n   print min(option1, option2)\n\nWait, but for n=3, the code would compute option1 as a[-2] - a[0], which is a[1] - a[0], and option2 is a[-1] - a[1], which is a[2] - a[1]. Then the minimum between those two. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So that's the approach.\n\nSo let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input: 4 elements [1,3,3,7]. After sorting, [1,3,3,7]. option1 is a[-2] - a[0] → 3 - 1 = 2. option2 is a[-1] - a[1] →7-3=4. min(2,4) is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: n=2, [1, 100000]. Output is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1,2,3]. option1 is 2-1=1, option2 is 3-2=1. min is 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, [1,2,3,4,5]. option1 is 4-1=3, option2 is 5-2=3. min is 3.\n\nAnother case: [1, 3, 4, 5, 7]. option1 is 5-1=4, option2 is 7-3=4. min is 4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: [1, 2, 4, 5, 7]. option1 is 5-1=4, option2 is 7-2=5. min is 4.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead list.\n\nSort list.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nBut wait, what if n is 3? Let's say the array is [1, 1, 1]. Then the options are a[-2] - a[0] = 1-1=0 and a[-1] - a[1] = 1-1=0. So min is 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, [1, 2, 5]. option1 is 2-1=1, option2 is 5-2=3. So min is 1. Which is correct, because removing the 5 gives instability 2-1=1.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nTherefore, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, handling the input. Let's see the input format.\n\nThe first line is n. The second line is n integers.\n\nIn Python, we can read the input as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen sort a.\n\nBut need to make sure that for n=2, the code returns 0.\n\nBut for n=2, the code will compute option1 as a[-2] - a[0], which is a[0] - a[0] = 0, and option2 is a[-1] - a[1] which is a[1] - a[1] = 0. So min(0,0) is 0. So even if n=2, the code can be handled by the same logic. So perhaps the code can be written without checking for n==2.\n\nWait, for n=2, the code:\n\nsorted array is [a, b]. Then option1 is a[-2] - a[0] → a[0] - a[0] = 0. option2 is a[-1] - a[1] → a[1] - a[1] = 0. So min is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nsort the array.\n\ncompute option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\noption2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\nprint min(option1, option2)\n\nBut for n=2, a[-2] is a[0], and a[-1] is a[1]. So yes.\n\nThus, the code can be written without checking for n=2. So the code can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nWait, but for n=2, the code can be handled by the else part. Let me see.\n\nFor example, n=2, after sorting, a has two elements. Then option1 is a[-2] - a[0] → a[0] - a[0] = 0. option2 is a[-1] - a[1] → a[1] - a[1] = 0. So min is 0. So the code can be written without checking for n==2. So the code can be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nprint(min(a[-2] - a[0], a[-1] - a[1]))\n\nBut wait, for n=2, the code would compute a[-2] which is a[0], and a[-1] is a[1]. So yes.\n\nBut what about for n=3? Let's see.\n\nBut for n=3, the code is correct. So this code would work for all n >= 2.\n\nWait, but for n=2, the code would compute a[-2] which is a[0], and a[-1] is a[1]. So the code would compute min( a[0] - a[0], a[1] - a[1] ) → min(0,0) → 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code can be written without the if statement. So the code can be:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nprint(min(a[-2] - a[0], a[-1] - a[1]))\n\nBut wait, what if n is 2? Then a[-2] is a[0], and a[-1] is a[1]. So yes.\n\nBut for n=2, the code would compute a[-2] - a[0] = a[0] - a[0] = 0. a[-1] - a[1] = a[1] - a[1] = 0. So min(0,0) is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code can be written as such, without any if conditions. So this is a very concise solution.\n\nBut wait, let's test for n=2. Let's take the second example input:\n\nInput is 2, 1 100000. After sorting, [1, 100000]. a[-2] is 1, a[0] is 1. So 1-1=0. a[-1] is 100000, a[1] is 100000. 100000 - 100000 = 0. min(0,0) → 0. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, [1, 2, 3]. min( a[-2] - a[0] = 2-1=1, a[-1] - a[1] =3-2=1 → 1. Correct.\n\nSo the code is correct. So the code can be written as such.\n\nSo this is the solution. Now, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, what about when n is 1? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 2. So no need to handle that.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n",
