He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives me a and b (or R), and then a number c in base a. My job is to convert c to base b, handling Roman numerals when needed.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps. The process should be:\n\n1. Convert the input number c (which is in base a) to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n2. Then convert that decimal integer to base b. But if b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals instead.\n\nSo the main steps are converting from base a to decimal, then converting from decimal to base b or Roman.\n\nLet's think about each part.\n\nFirst part: converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have leading zeros, but that's okay. For example, if a is 10 and c is '001', it's 1 in decimal. So I need to process each digit of c, multiply by a^position, etc. But since the length can be up to 10^3, we need to handle large numbers. However, the note says that if Roman is involved, the number is <= 3000 in decimal. Otherwise, it's up to 1e15. So for the first part, converting from base a to decimal, we need to handle very large numbers. But in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so that's manageable.\n\nSo for the first step, how to convert c (a string) in base a to decimal. Let's think: for each character in the string, we take its value (digits 0-9, letters A-Z for bases >10?), but wait, the problem says that in the input, the number c is written in base a. So for example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase?), but the input may have letters? Wait, the problem says that the input for c is a non-negative integer in base a. So for bases larger than 10, the digits would be represented with letters. For example, in base 12, the digits go up to B (for 11). But the problem says that when converting to base b, if b is greater than 10, we use letters A, B, etc. So for the input c, which is in base a, how are the digits represented?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input c may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. But how are the digits represented? For example, if a is 16, then the digits in c can be 0-9 and A-F? Or maybe the problem uses lowercase letters? But the sample input includes 'A' in one case. Let's look at the sample input.\n\nSample Input 5 R 4: the output is 'IV'. So for the input, the c is '4' in base 5. Converting to decimal is 4. Then converted to Roman is IV. So that's straightforward.\n\nAnother sample input is '12 13\\nA' which outputs 'A'. So the input c is 'A' in base 12. Which is 10 in decimal. Then converting to base 13 is 'A' again. So that's correct.\n\nSo the input c's digits are represented as 0-9, and for bases larger than 10, letters A-Z (probably uppercase) for digits 10 and above. So when converting from base a to decimal, each character in c must be parsed as a digit in base a. So for example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, that's 10 in decimal.\n\nSo the first step is to parse the input c as a base-a number. How to do that in Python?\n\nWell, for each character in the string, we can convert it to its numerical value. For example, '0' is 0, '1' is 1, ..., '9' is 9, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So, for each character in c, we can get its value. Then, the number is sum( digit_value * (a ** (position)) ), where position starts from 0 for the rightmost digit.\n\nBut since the input can be up to 10^3 digits long, and a can be up to 25, this could be a very big number. However, in Python, integers can handle arbitrary sizes, so that's okay.\n\nSo, for example, for the input c being '1111001' in base 2 (from the sample input), converting to decimal is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Then converting to base 2 again gives 1111001, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the first step is to write a function that converts a string (c) in base a to a decimal integer.\n\nNow, the second part: converting the decimal integer to base b, or to Roman numerals if b is 'R'.\n\nSo, for the case where b is not 'R', we need to convert the decimal number to base b. For bases greater than 10, letters A, B, etc. are used for digits >=10.\n\nFor example, if the decimal number is 10 and base is 13, then the representation is 'A'.\n\nIf the decimal number is 0, then the output is '0', but according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number isn't zero. Also, the input c is non-negative. However, the note says that if Roman is included, the number is not zero. So for other cases, when converting to base b (non-R), the number can be zero?\n\nBut according to the input description: the input c is a non-negative integer. So when converting to decimal, it can be zero. However, the output for base b (non-R) must omit leading zeros. So if the decimal number is zero, the output is '0'.\n\nBut the problem says that in the case of Roman numerals, the number is not zero. So for the case when converting to Roman, the input is guaranteed to be non-zero.\n\nSo, for the second part, the steps are:\n\nIf b is 'R', then convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nElse, convert the decimal number to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z as needed, and omit leading zeros.\n\nSo, first, let's think about converting decimal to base b.\n\nHow to do that? Well, the standard method is to repeatedly divide the number by the base and collect the remainders. However, since the number can be up to 1e15, but even that is manageable in Python.\n\nBut what about when the number is zero? Then the output is '0'.\n\nSo, for example, if the decimal number is 0, then the output is '0'.\n\nElse, we process the number as follows:\n\n- While the number is greater than zero, take the remainder modulo base, then divide the number by base. Collect the digits in reverse order.\n\nBut the digits need to be converted to their corresponding characters. For example, 10 becomes 'A', 11 'B', etc.\n\nSo for each remainder, if it is less than 10, we use the digit as a string. Else, we use the corresponding letter. For example, 10 is 'A', 11 'B', up to 35 (if base is 36, but in our case, the maximum base is 25, so the maximum digit is 24, which is 'Y').\n\nWait, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So when converting to base b, the digits can be up to 24, which is represented as 'Y'.\n\nSo for converting a decimal number to base b (non-R), here's the code:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    # Now reverse the digits and convert to characters\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\nWait, but for example, if the remainder is 10, then we add 'A' (since 10 - 10 = 0, so ord('A') + 0 = 65, which is 'A'). Correct.\n\nBut what if the number is zero? We return '0'.\n\nBut in the problem statement, for the case where the output is base b (non-R), the input c may be zero. For example, if the input is a=10, b=2, and c is 0, then output is 0. But according to the problem statement, the input c may be zero, but when Roman is involved, the number is not zero.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nNow, the other part is converting decimal to Roman numerals. How to do that?\n\nThe Roman numerals have specific rules. The standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For each value, subtract as many times as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nFor example, the standard list is:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each pair, we check how many times the value fits into the number, append the symbol that many times, and subtract the value.\n\nFor example, 4 is IV. 5 is V. 1994 is MCMXCIV.\n\nSo the code for converting a decimal number to Roman numerals would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input for Roman conversion is guaranteed to be non-zero and <= 3000. So this function will work.\n\nSo putting it all together, the steps are:\n\nRead a and b (where b could be R). Then read c (the string in base a).\n\nConvert c from base a to decimal (n). Then, if b is R, convert n to Roman. Else, convert n to base b.\n\nBut first, the conversion from c (base a) to decimal.\n\nHow to convert the string c (in base a) to decimal? Let's think about that.\n\nEach character in c represents a digit in base a. For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9, A-F. But the input c may have letters? For example, in the sample input, 'A' is present in the input.\n\nSo, the code for converting the string to decimal would be:\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n    n = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        n = n * a + digit\n    return n\n\nWait, but this is assuming that the input c is in the correct format. For example, for base a=12, the digits can be 0-11. So for a digit in the string, it can be 0-9, A (for 10), B (for 11). But the problem says that the input is a valid number in base a. So the code can process each character as a digit.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the input is 'A' in base 12? The code above would process 'A' as 10, which is correct.\n\nBut in the code, the function base_a_to_decimal is processing each character. For example, for the string '1111001' in base 2, each character is 1 or 0. So for each character, the code multiplies the current n by a and adds the digit.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nBut what about the case where the input is '0'? For example, a=10, c='0', then the code returns 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code for converting the input string to decimal is as follows.\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nRead the first line as a and b. But the first line can have two elements, where the second is either an integer or 'R'.\n\nWait, the input is given as two lines. First line contains two integers a and b, but b can be replaced by R. So for example, the first line could be '10 R' or '16 2'.\n\nSo in Python, the first line is split into two parts. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '16 R\\n5' — wait, no, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of inputs, but for the actual problem, the input is read as two lines. For example, the first line is a and b, then the next line is c.\n\nSo for each test case, the first line is two elements: a and b (with b possibly R), and the second line is the string c.\n\nSo in Python, for each test case, read the first line as two parts. For example:\n\nline1 = input().split()\na = int(line1[0])\nb = line1[1]\n\nThen read line2 = input().strip()\n\nThen process line2 as the number in base a.\n\nOnce we have the decimal value n, then:\n\nif b == 'R':\n    convert to roman\nelse:\n    convert to base b.\n\nBut what about the case when the input is zero? For example, if c is '0' in base a. Then, when converting to base b, the output is '0'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So for the Roman case, n is non-zero.\n\nNow, let's test some examples.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nConvert c (1 in base 10) to decimal is 1. Then convert to base 2: 1. Output is '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nConvert c (5 in base 16) is 5 in decimal. Convert to Roman: V. Output is 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\nConvert 4 in base 5 to decimal: 4. Convert to Roman: IV. Output is 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001\n\nConvert to decimal: 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 +32+16+8+1= 121. Then converting to base 2: 121 in binary is 1111001. Output is same as input.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA\n\nConvert c (A in base 12) is 10 in decimal. Convert to base 13: 10 is 'A' in base 13. So output is 'A'.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement functions for:\n\n- base_a_to_decimal(s, a)\n\n- decimal_to_base(n, base)\n\n- decimal_to_roman(n)\n\nBut in code, how to handle leading zeros? For example, when converting to base b, the output should omit leading zeros. However, in the code for decimal_to_base, when the number is zero, return '0'. Otherwise, the code collects the digits and reverses them. So for example, if the number is zero, returns '0', else, leading zeros are omitted because the code processes the number by dividing by base until it's zero. For example, if the number is 0, returns '0'. If the number is 10 in base 10, then the code returns 'A' when converting to base 13.\n\nWait, the code for decimal_to_base:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\nYes. For example, n=0 returns '0'. For n=5, base=2, returns '101'.\n\nNow, what about when the number is zero and the base is R? Well, according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So the code can safely assume that when converting to Roman, n is non-zero.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut first, read the input. However, the problem says that the input is given as two lines. For example, the first line is a and b (with b possibly R), the second line is the string c.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of test cases. However, the actual problem says that the program must read from stdin. So for each test case, the code reads two lines: first line is a and b, second is c.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is given as per the sample input. However, the user probably provides multiple test cases? Or is it one test case per run?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains two integers a and b. The second line contains the number c.\n\nSo the code needs to read two lines. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2', the second line is '1'.\n\nBut in the sample input provided in the problem, there are multiple test cases, but that's probably for the purpose of showing examples. However, the actual problem expects that the code reads one test case per run. Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... \n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo the input is two lines. So the code should read two lines. But in the sample input, there are multiple test cases. However, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code must process one test case per run. For example, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nWait, the sample input is given as a list of input lines, but the actual problem says that the code must read from stdin. For example, in the sample input, the first line is ['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', ...], but that's probably for the purpose of showing multiple test cases in the problem statement. However, the actual code should read from stdin, which for each run, has two lines: first line a and b, second line c.\n\nSo the code should read two lines. But in the sample input, the outputs are given as a list of outputs. So the code is supposed to process a single test case per run. Therefore, the code should read two lines from stdin.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input is given as a list of test cases. But in practice, the code is supposed to handle one test case. So the code should read two lines.\n\nThus, the code structure is:\n\nRead first line: split into a and b.\n\nRead second line: c_str.\n\nThen process.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n\nBut for that, for each character in the string, we need to get its value.\n\nFor example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So in code:\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n    n = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        n = n * a + digit\n    return n\n\nBut what about if the input is invalid? The problem says that the input is valid, so we don't need to handle that.\n\nNow, code for converting decimal to base b.\n\nBut in code, for the case when b is not R:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\nThen, the Roman function:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nRead c_str.\n\nConvert c_str from base a to decimal: n = base_a_to_decimal(c_str, a).\n\nIf b is 'R', then output decimal_to_roman(n).\n\nElse, output decimal_to_base(n, int(b)).\n\nBut need to handle the case when the decimal number is zero. For example, if c_str is '0' in base a, then n is zero. Then, converting to base b (non-R) returns '0'.\n\nNow, testing for the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nn is 1. Convert to base 2: 1. Output '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nn is 5. Convert to Roman: V.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\nn is 4. Convert to Roman: IV.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001 → decimal is 121. Convert to base 2: 1111001 → same as input.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA → decimal is 10. Convert to base 13: 10 is A.\n\nSo all samples are handled.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat if the input is zero? For example, a=10, b=10, c=0. Output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=10, c=0. Output '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=R, c=0 → but according to problem statement, this is not allowed. The problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is not zero.\n\nAnother case: when the decimal number is zero, and converting to base b (non-R), output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base b, which is 1? But according to the input constraints, b is between 2 and 25. So no.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, for reading input, the first line is split into two parts. For example:\n\nline1 = input().split()\n\nBut if the first line is '16 R', then line1 is ['16', 'R'].\n\nThen, a is int(line1[0]), and b is line1[1].\n\nThen, c_str = input().strip()\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code must read from stdin. So the code would be:\n\nRead first line as a and b.\n\nRead second line as c_str.\n\nThen process.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut how to handle the case when the input is '0' in base a. For example, a=10, c_str is '0', then n is 0. Then, if b is 2, output is '0'.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the code, the functions must be written.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input.\n\nBut in code, the code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\nRead line1 = input().split()\n\na = int(line1[0])\n\nb = line1[1]\n\nc_str = input().strip()\n\nThen, compute n = base_a_to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\nThen, if b is 'R', then output decimal_to_roman(n). Else, output decimal_to_base(n, int(b)).\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the functions.\n\nBut in code, the functions can be written inline.\n\nBut in code, the code must not have any print statements except for the output.\n\nNow, the code:\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n    n = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        n = n * a + digit\n    return n\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nThen, the main code:\n\nline1 = input().split()\na = int(line1[0])\nb = line1[1]\nc_str = input().strip()\n\nn = base_a_to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\nif b == 'R':\n    print(decimal_to_roman(n))\nelse:\n    base = int(b)\n    print(decimal_to_base(n, base))\n\nBut wait, what if the input is '0'? For example, when converting to base 2, the code returns '0'.\n\nBut what about when the input is '0' and the base is R? According to the problem statement, this case is not present.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nn is 1. decimal_to_base(1, 2) returns '1'.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nn is 5 → 'V'.\n\nSample 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4 → n is 4 → 'IV'.\n\nSample 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001 → n is 121 → converted to base 2 is 1111001.\n\nSample 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA → n is 10 → converted to base 13 is 'A'.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=10, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=16, c=255 → decimal is 255 → in hex is 'FF'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=16, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=16, c=10 → output 'A'.\n\nNow, possible errors?\n\nWhat about when the input c is '0' and the base is R? According to the problem statement, it's guaranteed that when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So the code does not need to handle that.\n\nAnother possible error: leading zeros in the output. For example, when converting to base 2, the code returns the correct digits without leading zeros. Because the code for decimal_to_base returns '0' when n is zero, and otherwise, the digits are generated by dividing by base until n is zero, so leading zeros are not present.\n\nFor example, if the decimal number is 0, returns '0'.\n\nIf the decimal number is 5, base 10, returns '5'.\n\nIf the decimal number is 5, base 16, returns '5'.\n\nIf the decimal number is 10, base 16 → 'A'.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut in Python, when the input is 'A' in base 12, the code correctly converts to 10.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, the function base_a_to_decimal is written as follows. Let's check for 'A' in base 12:\n\ns = 'A', a=12.\n\nLoop:\n\nch is 'A', not a digit. digit = ord('A') - ord('A') + 10 → 0 + 10 → 10.\n\nn starts as 0. n = 0 * 12 + 10 = 10. So returns 10. Correct.\n\nAnother example: '10' in base 2 is 2 in decimal.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: '10' in base 16 is 16 in decimal.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in the code, the function base_a_to_decimal is called with s and a. The code is correct.\n\nNow, code for the problem.\n\nBut what about the case where the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, the input c is a non-negative integer, so it's not empty. The problem says that the input c may have leading zeros, but its length doesn't exceed 10^3. So the code can process any c with length >=1.\n\nNow, code is ready.\n\nBut in the code, the functions are defined inside the code, and then called.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut the code must be written as a single script. So here's the full code:\n\nRead the input lines, process, and output.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n    n = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        n = n * a + digit\n    return n\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nline1 = input().split()\na = int(line1[0])\nb = line1[1]\nc_str = input().strip()\n\nn = base_a_to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\nif b == 'R':\n    print(decimal_to_roman(n))\nelse:\n    base = int(b)\n    print(decimal_to_base(n, base))\n\nBut wait, what about when the input is '0' and the base is something else? For example, a=10, c_str is '0', then n is 0. Then, if base is 2, output is '0'.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the input is '0' and the base is R? According to the problem statement, this case is not present.\n\nNow, testing the code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1 → output '1'.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5 → output 'V'.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4 → output 'IV'.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001 → output '1111001'.\n\nSample Input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA → output 'A'.\n\nAll correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=16, c_str is '255' → decimal is 255 → converted to base 16 is 'FF'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=10, c_str is '0' → output '0'.\n\nAnother test case: a=2, c_str is '0' → output '0'.\n\nAnother test case: a=10, b=10, c_str is '000' → output '0'.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about when the decimal number is zero and the base is 1? But the problem says that the base is between 2 and 25. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, code is written.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base or to Roman numerals. The input consists of two lines: the first line contains the source base and the target base (which could be Roman numerals), and the second line contains the number in the source base.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert from Source Base to Decimal**: The given number in the source base is converted to a decimal (base 10) integer. This involves processing each digit of the number, considering both numeric digits and alphabetic characters for bases greater than 10.\n2. **Convert from Decimal to Target Base or Roman Numerals**:\n   - If the target base is Roman numerals, convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a standard mapping of values to symbols.\n   - If the target base is another numeric base, convert the decimal number to the specified base, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for bases greater than 10.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef base_a_to_decimal(s, a):\n    n = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        n = n * a + digit\n    return n\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        digits.append(rem)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nline1 = input().split()\na = int(line1[0])\nb = line1[1]\nc_str = input().strip()\n\nn = base_a_to_decimal(c_str, a)\n\nif b == 'R':\n    print(decimal_to_roman(n))\nelse:\n    base = int(b)\n    print(decimal_to_base(n, base))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input. The first line contains the source base and the target base (or 'R' for Roman numerals). The second line contains the number in the source base.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `base_a_to_decimal` converts the input number from the source base to a decimal integer by iterating over each digit and computing its value.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal number to the specified target base, handling both numeric digits and alphabetic characters for bases greater than 10.\n4. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs, ensuring the correct representation according to Roman numeral rules.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion between different bases and Roman numerals, ensuring correctness and optimal performance for large numbers.",
