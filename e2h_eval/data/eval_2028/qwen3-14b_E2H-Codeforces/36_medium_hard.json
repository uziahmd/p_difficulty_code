The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer â€” the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The problem is about calculating the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what conditions the tower placements must satisfy for such a configuration to be possible. Let's think about the constraints:\n\nFor each town i (from 1 to n), exactly one tower's signal covers it. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower.\n\nLet me think about how the towers can be arranged. Suppose there are some towers placed. How can we assign their signal powers?\n\nEach tower's signal power p must be such that it covers some range. For example, a tower at position i with power p covers from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. Wait, the problem says that |c - i| < p. So the range is i - p + 1 to i + p - 1? Because if |c -i| < p, then c can be from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). So the length of coverage is 2(p-1) + 1 = 2p-1. But the exact coverage depends on the power.\n\nBut for the problem's constraints, each town must be covered exactly once. So the way the towers are placed must allow partitioning of the towns 1..n into ranges where each is covered by exactly one tower.\n\nThis seems similar to some kind of tiling or interval covering problem. Maybe the towers must be arranged in a way that allows them to cover non-overlapping regions, but with certain conditions.\n\nWait, but the signal can overlap as long as each town is covered exactly once. However, since the signal ranges can be adjusted, perhaps the key is to find a way to assign the towers such that their coverage regions form a partition of the towns 1..n, and also ensure that towns 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nLet me think of the necessary conditions for the tower placements. For example, in the first sample input where n=2, the valid case is when both towns 1 and 2 have towers. Then, each can be set to power 1. That covers town 1 (only from tower 1) and town 2 (only from tower 2). Also, town 0 is not covered by tower 1's power 1 (since |0-1|=1 which is not less than 1). Similarly for town 3 (n+1=3) and tower 2's power 1.\n\nAnother example: when n=3. The note says that two cases contribute. One is when all three towns have towers, and they are set to power 1. Another is when only town 2 has a tower, set to power 2. So the total probability is (1/8 + 1/8) = 1/4.\n\nSo, what's the pattern here? It seems that the valid tower configurations must be such that there's a way to pair up the towers so that each tower's coverage area is exactly the towns between two consecutive towers, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem reduces to ensuring that the towers are placed in such a way that there's a way to assign each tower a range that exactly covers a segment of towns, with no overlaps and covering all towns.\n\nThis reminds me of the problem of domino tiling or similar dynamic programming problems. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me consider f(n) as the number of valid tower configurations for a given n. Then the total number of possible configurations is 2^n. The answer would be f(n)/2^n, which needs to be computed modulo 998244353.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding f(n), then compute f(n) * inv(2^n) mod MOD.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find f(n).\n\nHow to model f(n)? Let's think about the structure of valid tower placements.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. For each town i (1<=i<=n), exactly one tower's signal covers it. Also, town 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nSuppose that the towers are placed in positions S. Then, for the coverage to be possible, the following must hold:\n\n- Each tower must cover some towns, but no overlapping coverage. However, since the signal power can be adjusted, perhaps the way to arrange the coverage is that the towers are placed in such a way that each tower is responsible for a certain interval, and these intervals are non-overlapping and cover all towns 1..n.\n\nBut how can that be achieved? Let's think of the towers as being arranged such that between any two consecutive towers, there's a certain distance that allows their coverage to be assigned properly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the towers must form a structure where each tower is either alone (covering a certain range) or part of a pair.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples. For n=2, the valid configuration is towers at 1 and 2. Each can cover their own town. For n=3, the valid configurations are:\n\nCase 1: towers at 1,2,3. Each set to power 1. So each covers their own town.\n\nCase 2: tower at 2, set to power 2. Then, it covers towns 1, 2, 3. Wait, but that would mean that all three towns are covered by one tower. However, the problem requires that each town is covered exactly once. So in this case, that's allowed because all three are covered by exactly one tower (the one in 2). But how does that work? Because the tower's power is 2, so |c - 2| < 2. So c can be 1, 2, or 3? Because |1-2|=1 < 2, |3-2|=1 < 2. So yes. So that's allowed.\n\nSo the key is that the towers must be arranged in such a way that there exists a way to assign their power so that their coverage areas form a partition of the towns 1..n, and do not cover 0 or n+1.\n\nSo how can we model this?\n\nLet me think about the possible valid configurations. Perhaps each valid configuration corresponds to a set of towers where the positions are such that there is a way to split the towns 1..n into intervals, each assigned to a single tower, and the tower's position is in the middle of the interval. For example, in the case of a single tower covering [1..k], the tower must be at position i where the interval is [i - p + 1, i + p - 1], but p is chosen so that this interval is exactly [a, b]. For example, if the tower is at position i and covers [a, b], then the power p must be such that a = i - p + 1 and b = i + p - 1. Therefore, the length of the interval is 2p - 1. So for an interval of length l, p = (l + 1)/2. Which implies that l must be odd. But wait, if the interval is [a, b], then the length is b - a + 1. So for the tower at i, the maximum coverage is such that the interval [i - p + 1, i + p - 1] must be exactly [a, b]. Therefore, the length of the interval is 2p - 1. Thus, the length must be odd, and the tower is located at the center of the interval.\n\nBut for the problem, the intervals must be such that they are non-overlapping, cover all towns 1..n, and the tower is located in the center of each interval. Also, the tower's coverage must not reach beyond the towns 0 or n+1.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the number of subsets of towns (positions) that can be partitioned into intervals where each interval has a tower at its center. And each such subset must have the property that the intervals cover exactly towns 1..n, and the tower is placed in the center of each interval.\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of \"valid\" placements where the towers are arranged in such a way that they can be grouped into intervals with centers.\n\nThis suggests a dynamic programming approach. Let's define dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (positions 1..i). Then, we can think about how to build dp[i] based on previous values.\n\nFor example, for dp[0], it's 1 (base case, no towns). For dp[1], the only possibility is that there is a tower at position 1. Because then, the power can be set to 1, which covers town 1. Also, town 0 is not covered (since |0 - 1| = 1 is not less than 1). Town 2 (n+1 if n=1) is not covered. So for dp[1], the count is 1. However, the total possible configurations for n=1 is 2^1=2. So the answer would be 1/2.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the answer for n=1 would be 1/2. Let me check. If n=1, the towns are 0, 1, 2. The towers are built in town 1 with probability 1/2. If there is a tower, then set its power to 1. Then town 1 is covered, and towns 0 and 2 are not. So that's valid. If there is no tower, then town 1 isn't covered. So the valid case is when the tower is present. So the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut according to the approach above, for dp[1], the number of valid configurations is 1 (the case where the tower is present). So the answer is 1 / 2^1 = 1/2, which is correct.\n\nNow, for dp[i], how can we compute it?\n\nLet's think: for the i-th town, there are two possibilities. Either there is a tower here, or not. But if there is a tower here, then it must be the center of an interval. So, for example, suppose that the tower is at position i. Then, the interval it covers could be from position i - k to i + k, but this depends on the length of the interval. Wait, but the interval must end at i. Because the next tower (if any) would be after that.\n\nAlternatively, think about the last tower in the configuration. Suppose that the last tower is at position i. Then, it must cover some interval ending at i. For example, the tower at i could cover a single town (i), which would require that there is no tower to the right of i (but since i is the last town, that's okay). Or, the tower could cover a longer interval. For example, if there is a tower at i, and also a tower at i-1, but that would complicate things. Wait, no. Because the intervals must not overlap. So if there's a tower at i, then the interval that it covers must be such that it ends at i, and the previous interval ends at i-1. Or maybe the tower at i is part of a larger interval.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the tower at position i is the center of an interval. For example, the interval could be of length 1 (so the tower is the only one in that interval), or length 3 (so the tower is at the center of positions i-1, i, i+1), etc. But since the entire coverage must be up to i, the tower at i could be the center of a segment that starts at some j and ends at i.\n\nSo for the DP approach, for dp[i], we can consider that the last tower is placed at position i, and that it covers a certain number of towns to the left. Let's think recursively.\n\nIf the tower is placed at i, then the interval that it covers must end at i. Let's say that the interval starts at position i - k. Then, the length of the interval is k + 1 (from i -k to i). Since the tower is at the center, the length must be odd. Let me see. For example, if the interval is of length l, then l must be 2m + 1, and the tower is at position i - m. Wait, no. For example, if the interval is from a to b, and the tower is at position i. Then, the length is b - a + 1. Since the tower is at the center, then a = i - m and b = i + m, so the length is 2m + 1. So the interval must be symmetric around the tower's position. Therefore, the tower's position is the midpoint of the interval.\n\nTherefore, if the tower is at position i, then the interval it covers must be of length 2m + 1, and the interval is [i - m, i + m]. But since the entire coverage must be up to town i (assuming that this is the last tower), then i + m cannot exceed n. Wait, but the problem requires that the coverage of the tower does not reach town n+1. So, for the tower at position i, the maximum power p is such that i + p - 1 <= n. So p can be at most n - i + 1. But since the tower's coverage must not reach n+1, the power p must be such that i + p - 1 < n + 1 â†’ p â‰¤ n - i + 1.\n\nBut in our scenario, the tower is the center of an interval. So for the interval [i - m, i + m], the length is 2m + 1, and the maximum m is such that i + m â‰¤ n. So m can be up to n - i. Therefore, the interval could be of length 1 (m=0), 3 (m=1), etc.\n\nBut for the DP approach, when considering dp[i], the idea is that the tower at position i is the end of an interval. So, for example, the tower could be the only one in its interval (m=0), which would mean that the previous part of the configuration is up to i-1. Or, the tower is part of a longer interval. For example, if the tower is at position i, and the interval is from i-1 to i+1 (m=1), but then i+1 must be <=n. However, in this case, the previous part of the configuration must end at i-2. Because the interval from i-1 to i+1 is covered by the tower at i, and the previous part must end before i-1.\n\nWait, but how does that fit into the DP recurrence?\n\nLet me think of the recurrence. Suppose that dp[i] represents the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (positions 1 to i). Then, for each possible way to end the configuration with a tower at position i, we can look back to some j < i and add the possibilities.\n\nFor example, if the tower at i is the center of an interval of length 1 (covers only i), then the previous part must be a valid configuration for positions 1 to i-1. So dp[i] += dp[i-1] * 1 (if there is a tower at i). But how does that factor into the DP?\n\nAlternatively, the DP[i] can be calculated as follows: the number of valid configurations for the first i towns is equal to the sum over all possible ways that the last interval ends at i. For each possible m (where the interval is of length 2m + 1, centered at i), the previous part must be a valid configuration for the first i - m - 1 towns (since the interval covers from i - m to i, so up to i - m - 1 is before that interval).\n\nWait, maybe. For example, if the tower is at i, and the interval it covers is [i - m, i + m], but since we're considering the first i towns, then i + m must be <= i â†’ m = 0. Wait, that can't be. Oh, no, because the tower is at position i, and the interval [i - m, i + m] must be within the towns 1..n. But for the DP[i], the current i is the last town considered. Therefore, the interval can't extend beyond i. So for the tower at position i, the maximum m is such that i - m >= 1 (so m can be up to i-1) and i + m <= n. Wait, but for the DP[i], we are considering the first i towns. So the interval can't go beyond i. Hence, the maximum m is 0. Because i + m <= i â†’ m=0. So the interval is just [i, i], and the tower is at position i. Therefore, the previous part is up to i-1. But that would imply that the only way to have a tower at i is to add it to the configurations of the first i-1 towns. But that seems to ignore the possibility of the tower at i covering a larger interval that ends at i, but starts before i.\n\nWait, this seems conflicting with earlier examples. For instance, in the case of n=3 and the tower at position 2, which covers [1, 3]. So in that case, the interval is from 1 to 3 (length 3, m=1). So for i=3, the tower is at position 2. But in the DP[i] for i=3, how would that be accounted for?\n\nAh, perhaps my initial approach is incorrect. Because the DP[i] represents the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. So in this case, the tower at position 2 (which is part of the first 3 towns) is considered. However, the interval [1,3] is covered by the tower at 2. Then, the previous part is up to 0 (since the interval starts at 1). Therefore, the DP[i] would have a term dp[0] * 1 (the number of ways to have the configuration up to 0, multiplied by the possibility of having the tower at 2, which covers the interval 1-3). So for i=3, dp[3] would include dp[0] * something.\n\nSo the general idea is that for each position i, the number of valid configurations can be found by considering all possible intervals that end at i. For each such interval, which is centered at some position k, and spans from a to i. Then, the number of ways is dp[a-1] multiplied by the number of ways to choose the towers in that interval. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, the interval [a, i] must be covered by a tower at position k (the center). So for the interval [a, i], the length is i - a + 1. This must be equal to 2m + 1, where m is the radius. So the center is at k = a + m = (a + i)/2. So for this to be possible, a + i must be even. Therefore, i - a must be even. So a = i - 2m, and the center is at i - m.\n\nSo for the interval [a, i], the center is at position k = a + m = (a + i)/2. But since the interval must be covered by a tower at k, that tower must be present. Also, the other towns in the interval must not have towers that would interfere with the coverage. Wait, no. Because the problem allows any tower configuration as long as there exists a way to assign the signal powers. So the presence of towers in the interval [a, i] is not necessarily required except for the one at the center. Because the other towns in the interval may have towers, but they must not be covered by any other tower's signal.\n\nWait, but that complicates things. Because the presence of towers in the interval [a, i] may affect whether the configuration is valid. However, according to the problem, the tower placements are arbitrary, but we need to find those placements where there exists a way to assign the signal powers. Therefore, the DP approach must account for the fact that the tower placements must allow such a configuration.\n\nBut perhaps the way to model this is that the tower placements must form a structure where the towns can be partitioned into intervals, each of which has exactly one tower (the center of the interval), and no other towers in that interval. Because if there are other towers in the interval, then their presence would make it impossible to assign the signal powers such that each town is covered exactly once. For example, if there are two towers in the same interval, then their signals would have to be set such that they don't cover each other's towns. But that might not be possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the valid configurations are exactly those where the towers form a set of positions such that every tower is the center of an interval, and no two intervals overlap. This would imply that the tower positions are such that each tower is the center of an interval, and the intervals are non-overlapping and cover all towns.\n\nIn this case, the problem reduces to counting the number of subsets of the towns that can be partitioned into such intervals. Each interval has exactly one tower (at its center), and the intervals are non-overlapping and cover all towns.\n\nThis seems similar to tiling the line with tiles of various lengths (each tile is an interval of odd length, centered at a tower). For example, a tile of length 1 (just a single tower), length 3 (centered at the middle), etc.\n\nIn this case, the DP recurrence can be defined as follows: dp[i] = sum_{k} dp[i - (k + 1)] * 1, where k is the length of the tile minus 1, but I need to think more carefully.\n\nLet me think again. For the DP[i], the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. To form such a configuration, the last tile (interval) must end at i. The tile can be of length 1 (covers just i), in which case the previous part is dp[i-1]. Or the tile can be of length 3, covering i-1, i, i+1? No, because i is the end. Wait, for the tile to end at i, the tile must be of length 2m + 1, where the center is at position i - m. The tile starts at position i - m - m = i - 2m. Wait, no. The tile starts at i - m, and ends at i + m. But since the tile must end at i, then i + m = i â†’ m=0. So that's only possible for a tile of length 1. But that contradicts the earlier example where a tile of length 3 (covering 1-3) ends at i=3. How is that handled?\n\nAh, because the tile ends at i=3, but the center is at position 2. So the tile starts at position 1 (i - m = 3 - 1 = 2? No, wait. Let me re-calculate. The length of the tile is 2m + 1. The center is at position k. The tile starts at k - m, ends at k + m. For the tile to end at i, then k + m = i. So m = i - k. Also, the start of the tile is k - m = k - (i - k) = 2k - i. But since the start of the tile must be â‰¥ 1, we have 2k - i â‰¥ 1 â†’ 2k â‰¥ i + 1 â†’ k â‰¥ (i + 1)/2. Also, since the tile starts at 2k - i and ends at i, the entire tile is within the first i towns.\n\nBut for the DP approach, the idea is that the last tile is a tile that ends at i. So the center of that tile is some k, and the tile starts at 2k - i. Therefore, the previous part of the configuration is up to (2k - i - 1). Therefore, the recurrence for dp[i] would be:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k} dp[2k - i - 1] * 1, where k ranges over possible centers such that the tile [start, i] is valid.\n\nBut how do we find all possible k for which this is possible?\n\nLet me think for each possible tile that ends at i. The tile must have a length of 2m + 1, and end at i. So the center is at position k = i - m. The start of the tile is k - m = (i - m) - m = i - 2m. Since the tile must start at â‰¥1, i - 2m â‰¥ 1 â†’ m â‰¤ (i -1)/2. Also, since the tile starts at i - 2m and ends at i, the length is 2m + 1. The center is k = i - m. But since the center k must be between 1 and i.\n\nSo for each possible m (from 0 to floor((i-1)/2)), the tile starts at s = i - 2m. The center is k = i - m. For this tile to be valid, the center must be present (i.e., there is a tower at k), and there must be no other towers in the tile (because otherwise, their presence would interfere with the coverage). Wait, but how do we ensure that? Because the DP counts the number of valid configurations, which includes the tower placements. So in this model, the DP counts the number of subsets of towers that can be partitioned into such tiles. Therefore, for each tile, the center must be present (tower exists), and all other positions in the tile must not have towers. Because if there were another tower in the tile, then that would create a conflict, as the coverage would have to be assigned in a way that each town is covered exactly once.\n\nAh! So this is crucial. The valid configurations are those where the towers are placed such that each tower is the center of a tile (interval) of odd length, and no two tiles overlap. Moreover, in each tile, there are no other towers except the center. Because if there were another tower in the tile, then it would be part of another tile, which would overlap with this one. Therefore, the entire configuration is a partition of the towns into such tiles, each with exactly one tower (the center) and no others.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to counting the number of ways to partition the towns 1..n into such tiles, where each tile is an interval of odd length, centered at a tower, and no two tiles overlap. And for each such tile, the center is present (has a tower), and all other positions in the tile do not have towers.\n\nSo the DP recurrence can be written as follows:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{m} dp[i - (2m + 1)] * 1, where m ranges from 0 to floor((i-1)/2). Wait, but why?\n\nBecause for each possible tile of length 2m+1 ending at position i, the previous part of the configuration is up to position i - (2m + 1) (since the tile starts at i - 2m and ends at i). Wait, the tile starts at s = i - 2m and ends at i. The length is 2m + 1. So the previous part is up to s-1 = i - 2m - 1. So dp[i] = sum_{possible m} dp[i - 2m - 1] * 1.\n\nBut for each such tile, the center is at position i - m. Since the tile is from s = i - 2m to i, the center is at s + m = i - 2m + m = i - m. So the center is at position i - m. For this to be valid, the center must be present (so that there is a tower there), and all other positions in the tile must not have towers. However, the DP counts the number of configurations where the entire first i towns are partitioned into such tiles. Therefore, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{m} dp[i - (2m + 1)] * 1, where m ranges such that the tile is valid (i.e., s >= 1).\n\nBut why is the multiplication by 1? Because for each such tile, the center must be present (so 1 way to choose that tower), and the rest of the positions in the tile must not have towers (so 1 way, since they are not chosen). Therefore, for each choice of m, the number of ways is dp[i - (2m + 1)] multiplied by 1 (the choice of the current tile).\n\nWait, but the DP[i] is counting the number of valid configurations. For each valid configuration, the first i towns are partitioned into tiles. So for the recurrence, when adding a new tile ending at i, the number of ways is the number of ways to partition up to s-1 (where s is the start of the tile) multiplied by 1 (the way to choose the current tile).\n\nBut how do we account for the fact that the current tile requires that the center has a tower, and others don't? Well, since the DP[i] is counting all valid configurations, the recurrence automatically ensures that. Because when you add a tile of length 2m+1 ending at i, you are assuming that the center is present and others are not. But how does that get counted in the DP?\n\nAh, the DP is not counting the number of subsets, but the number of ways to partition into tiles. Each tile contributes exactly one tower (the center), and the rest of the positions are not part of any tower. Therefore, the DP[i] is the number of ways to partition the first i towns into such tiles. Each such partition corresponds to exactly one subset of towers (the centers of the tiles). Therefore, the total number of valid configurations is dp[n].\n\nFor example, for n=1:\n\ndp[1] = sum for m=0: dp[1 - 1] = dp[0] = 1. So dp[1] = 1. Which matches the earlier example.\n\nFor n=2:\n\ndp[2] = sum for m=0 (tile length 1) and m=0.5? No, m must be integer. Wait, m ranges from 0 to floor((i-1)/2). For i=2, floor((2-1)/2) = 0. So m can be 0. So tile length 1. So dp[2] = dp[2-1] = dp[1] = 1. But according to the first example, when n=2, the valid configurations are when both towns 1 and 2 are present. But according to this DP approach, dp[2] is 1. Which would correspond to the configuration where the first town is covered by a tile of length 1 (town 1), and the second town is covered by a tile of length 1 (town 2). But that would require that both towns have towers. Which is one configuration. But according to the first example, the valid case is when both are present. So the total number of valid configurations is 1, and the total possible is 2^2=4. So the probability is 1/4, which matches the first example. So this seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where there's a tile of length 3 for n=3? Let's compute dp[3].\n\nFor i=3:\n\nPossible m's are 0 and 1?\n\nWait, floor((3-1)/2) = 1. So m can be 0 or 1.\n\nFor m=0: tile length is 1. The previous part is dp[3-1] = dp[2] = 1.\n\nFor m=1: tile length is 2*1+1 = 3. The previous part is dp[3 - 3] = dp[0] = 1.\n\nSo dp[3] = 1 + 1 = 2. Which would correspond to two configurations:\n\n- Two tiles of length 1 (towns 1, 2, 3) â†’ requires towers at 1, 2, 3.\n\n- One tile of length 3 (towns 1-3) â†’ requires a tower at 2.\n\nWhich matches the example in the problem statement where for n=3, there are two valid configurations. Thus, dp[3] = 2. The total possible is 8, so the probability is 2/8 = 1/4, which matches the note.\n\nSo this seems to be working. Therefore, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[0] = 1\n\ndp[i] = sum_{m=0}^{floor( (i-1)/2 )} dp[i - (2m + 1)]\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently for large n (up to 2e5)?\n\nThe straightforward approach would be O(n^2), which is not feasible for n=2e5.\n\nWe need to find a way to compute this recurrence efficiently.\n\nLet's analyze the recurrence:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k=1,3,...} dp[i -k], where k is the length of the tile (must be odd, and k <= i).\n\nBut since k can be any odd number up to i, and for each i, the sum is over all possible k (odd) such that k â‰¤ i.\n\nBut note that for each i, the sum is over all possible odd numbers k such that k â‰¤ i, and then dp[i -k].\n\nLet me think of this as:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j=0}^{i-1} dp[j], where j = i -k, and k is odd. So k = i -j must be odd. Which implies that (i-j) is odd â†’ i and j have different parity.\n\nThus, dp[i] is equal to the sum of dp[j] for all j < i where j and i have different parity.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For each i, the sum is over all possible j = i -k, where k is odd. Since k is the length of the tile, which is 2m + 1. So for each possible tile length k (odd), j = i -k. So j can be from i - 1 (k=1) down to i - (i) = 0 (if i is odd). But for each j, the value of k is i-j. So for the sum, we have:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j} dp[j], where j ranges over all integers such that i -j is odd and j < i.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j < i} dp[j] * (if (i-j) is odd then 1 else 0).\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the parity. Let's split the sum into two parts: for even and odd i.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor even i:\n\nsum_{j < i} dp[j] * (i-j is odd) â†’ which is equivalent to sum_{j < i} dp[j] where j is odd (since i is even, i-j is odd iff j is odd).\n\nSimilarly, for odd i:\n\nsum_{j < i} dp[j] where j is even.\n\nSo, dp[i] equals the sum of dp[j] for j < i with j of opposite parity to i.\n\nThis suggests that we can maintain two variables: sum_even and sum_odd, which are the sums of dp[j] for j up to i-1 where j is even or odd, respectively.\n\nThen, for each i:\n\nif i is even:\n\ndp[i] = sum_odd_prev (sum of dp[j] for j < i and j odd)\n\nif i is odd:\n\ndp[i] = sum_even_prev (sum of dp[j] for j < i and j even)\n\nSo, for example:\n\nInitially, dp[0] = 1. For i=0, which is even, sum_even_prev is 1, sum_odd_prev is 0.\n\nFor i=1 (odd):\n\ndp[1] = sum_even_prev (sum of even j < 1, which is 0 (since j can be 0, which is even. So sum_even_prev is dp[0] = 1). So dp[1] = 1.\n\nFor i=2 (even):\n\ndp[2] = sum_odd_prev (sum of j < 2 and odd. j can be 1. sum_odd_prev is dp[1] = 1. So dp[2] = 1.\n\nFor i=3 (odd):\n\ndp[3] = sum_even_prev (sum of even j < 3: j=0, 2. sum_even_prev is dp[0] + dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2. So dp[3] = 2. Which matches the earlier example.\n\nFor i=4 (even):\n\nsum_odd_prev is sum of dp[j] for j <4 and odd (j=1,3). dp[1] + dp[3] = 1 + 2 = 3. So dp[4] = 3.\n\nThis seems promising. So the recurrence can be computed in O(1) per step with the help of maintaining the sum_even and sum_odd.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize dp[0] = 1.\n\nsum_even = dp[0] (since 0 is even).\n\nsum_odd = 0.\n\nFor i from 1 to n:\n\nif i is odd:\n\ndp[i] = sum_even_prev (sum of even j < i)\n\nelse:\n\ndp[i] = sum_odd_prev (sum of odd j < i)\n\nthen, update sum_even and sum_odd accordingly.\n\nWait, but how do we track sum_even_prev and sum_odd_prev?\n\nLet me think:\n\nAt each step,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly building towers in towns from 1 to n (each with a 1/2 chance), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Define `dp[i]` as the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns. The recurrence relation is derived based on the parity (even or odd) of the current index `i`.\n2. **Sum Tracking**: Maintain two sums, `sum_even` and `sum_odd`, which track the cumulative values of `dp` for even and odd indices respectively. This allows efficient calculation of the DP values in constant time per step.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, all operations are performed under this modulus to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    if n == 0:\n        print(1)\n        return\n    \n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    sum_even = 1  # dp[0] is even index\n    sum_odd = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 1:\n            # i is odd, dp[i] = sum_even_prev\n            dp[i] = sum_even\n        else:\n            # i is even, dp[i] = sum_odd_prev\n            dp[i] = sum_odd\n        \n        # Update sum_even and sum_odd\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            sum_even = (sum_even + dp[i]) % MOD\n        else:\n            sum_odd = (sum_odd + dp[i]) % MOD\n    \n    # The answer is dp[n] / 2^n mod MOD\n    numerator = dp[n]\n    denominator = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    \n    # Compute modular inverse of denominator\n    inv_denominator = pow(denominator, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    result = (numerator * inv_denominator) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Initialization**: We initialize `dp[0]` to 1 because there's exactly one way to have no towns (an empty configuration).\n2. **Sum Tracking**: As we iterate through each town index from 1 to n, we use `sum_even` and `sum_odd` to keep track of cumulative values of `dp` for even and odd indices respectively. This allows us to compute `dp[i]` efficiently based on the parity of `i`.\n3. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: After computing the number of valid configurations (`dp[n]`), we calculate the probability by dividing this value by `2^n` using modular arithmetic. The modular inverse of the denominator is computed using Fermat's Little Theorem, which states that `a^(MOD-2) % MOD` is the modular inverse of `a` under modulo `MOD`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required probability using dynamic programming and modular arithmetic, making it feasible even for large values of `n` up to 200,000.",
