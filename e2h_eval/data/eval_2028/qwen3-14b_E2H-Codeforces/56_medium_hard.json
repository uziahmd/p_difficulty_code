Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about determining if there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that the line segments connecting each pair don't intersect. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the constraints. The key point here is that any two line segments (from a spaceship to its assigned base) must not cross each other. So, the challenge is to find a way to pair each spaceship with a base such that all those lines are non-intersecting.\n\nHmm. How do I check if two line segments intersect? Oh right, there's a computational geometry method for that. But since the number of possible pairings is limited (since R and B are up to 10), maybe we can generate all possible perfect matchings and check each one for intersections.\n\nWait, but R and B are equal here because the problem says that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one base. So the first thing is that R must equal B. Wait, looking back at the input description: the first line has R and B. But the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching, which requires that R equals B. So if R != B, the answer is automatically No. But the input constraints say that R and B are between 1 and 10, but the problem says that it's guaranteed that no two points coincide and no three are colinear. But the input may have R != B. Wait, but the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching. So in the input, if R != B, then it's impossible. So first, check if R != B. If so, output No. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nSo first step: check if R != B. If so, output No. Otherwise, proceed to check possible matchings.\n\nNow, for the case where R = B. We need to generate all possible permutations of assigning spaceships to bases, and for each permutation, check whether all the line segments between the pairs do not intersect each other.\n\nBut how many permutations are there? For R = B = n, there are n! possibilities. Since n is up to 10, 10! is 3,628,800. That's manageable for small n. But for n=10, that's 3.6 million possibilities. For each possibility, we need to check all pairs of line segments for intersection. For each permutation, there are (n choose 2) pairs of line segments. For n=10, that's 45 pairs per permutation. Each pair requires checking for intersection.\n\nBut for each pair of line segments, how do we check if they intersect?\n\nI remember that there's a standard algorithm for checking if two line segments intersect. Let me recall. The steps are:\n\n1. Check if the two line segments' bounding boxes overlap. If not, they can't intersect.\n2. Use the orientation method. For two line segments AB and CD, compute orientations of (A,B,C), (A,B,D), (C,D,A), (C,D,B). If the orientations of (A,B,C) and (A,B,D) are different, and the orientations of (C,D,A) and (C,D,B) are different, then the segments intersect. Also, handle cases where a point is colinear and lies on the segment.\n\nBut given that the problem states that no three points are colinear, that simplifies things. Because if two segments are colinear, then their endpoints would be colinear, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. Wait, but the problem says that no three points are on the same line. So, any two line segments that are colinear would have their endpoints lying on the same line, but since no three points are colinear, that would imply that the line segments can't share more than two points. But for two line segments AB and CD, if they are colinear, then they could overlap. However, since the problem says that no three points are colinear, but AB and CD could be colinear if they are two separate line segments. Wait, but the problem states that no three points are colinear. So for example, if AB is a line segment and CD is another line segment, then the four points A, B, C, D can't lie on the same line. Because that would be three or more points on the same line. So, for example, if A and B are on the same line as C and D, then that would be four points on the same line. Which is not allowed. Therefore, the problem statement ensures that any two line segments cannot be colinear. Because if they were, then there would be three points on the same line (for example, A, C, D if AB and CD are colinear). Wait, no. Suppose AB is a line segment, and CD is another line segment. If AB and CD are colinear, but none of the points are overlapping. Then, for example, the points A, B, C, D are on the same line. But that would be four points on the same line. Which violates the problem's condition that no three points are on the same line. Therefore, the problem's input ensures that any two line segments cannot be colinear. Therefore, when checking for intersection between two line segments, we don't have to worry about colinear cases. So the only possible intersections are proper crossings, not overlapping or touching.\n\nTherefore, for two line segments AB and CD, they intersect if and only if the orientations of (A,B,C) and (A,B,D) are different, and the orientations of (C,D,A) and (C,D,B) are different. So the standard method for checking whether two line segments intersect, assuming that they are not colinear.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each possible permutation of assigning spaceships to bases (i.e., for each possible perfect matching):\n\n- Generate all pairs of line segments (each pair being between two different assignments)\n- Check if any pair of line segments intersect.\n- If none do, then return \"Yes\".\n\nIf any permutation passes this check, then output \"Yes\", else \"No\".\n\nNow, the steps for coding:\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is given as two lines. Wait, the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, looking back at the example input:\n\nThe first example input is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, but the first line is for the first test case. Wait, perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says that the input is read from stdin. But the sample shows that the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the actual input would be given via standard input.\n\nWait, perhaps the user provided the input as a list of strings for the example, but for the actual code, the code should read from stdin. For example, the first input line is R and B, then R lines for spaceships, then B lines for bases.\n\nSo the code needs to read from stdin. Let me think about the input format.\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains R and B.\n\nThen R lines for the spaceships, each with x and y.\n\nThen B lines for the bases, each with x and y.\n\nSo for the first example input, the first line is 3 3, then three lines for spaceships, then three lines for bases.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, split into lines, process accordingly.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nIf R != B, output No.\n\nElse:\n\nCollect the list of R spaceship coordinates, then B base coordinates.\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of assigning spaceships to bases. For example, for each permutation of the bases (since each spaceship is assigned to a unique base), we can check if the lines between them don't cross.\n\nWait, the problem is that the spaceships are R in number and the bases are B in number. So for R = B, the perfect matching is a bijection between the two sets. So the possible matchings are all possible permutations of the bases, where each spaceship is matched to a base. For example, if the spaceships are [S1, S2, S3], and bases [B1, B2, B3], then a permutation would be [B1, B2, B3], [B1, B3, B2], etc. So for each permutation, we can pair S1 with B_perm[0], S2 with B_perm[1], etc.\n\nSo for each possible permutation of the bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of bases to spaceships), we need to check if all the line segments between the pairs do not intersect.\n\nSo the code will generate all possible permutations of the bases (since the order of the permutation corresponds to the assignment of each spaceship to a base). For example, for the i-th spaceship, assign the base at position i in the permutation.\n\nSo for each permutation, we generate all pairs of line segments (each pair is between two different assignments) and check for intersections.\n\nBut how to generate permutations? Well, in Python, itertools.permutations can be used. For example, if the bases are stored as a list, then permutations(bases, len(bases)) would generate all possible orderings.\n\nBut wait, the bases are stored as a list. So for example, if the bases are [B1, B2, B3], then permutations would generate all possible orderings of these, and for each permutation, we can pair spaceship 0 with the first base in the permutation, etc.\n\nBut how to represent the points. Let's think: the spaceships are stored as a list, say, rebels = [ (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ... ] and bases = [ (x1, y1), ... ].\n\nSo for a permutation p (which is a tuple of the bases in some order), the line segments are between rebels[i] and p[i], for each i in 0..R-1.\n\nNow, for each such permutation, check all pairs of line segments (i,j) where i < j. For each pair, check if the line segments (rebels[i], p[i]) and (rebels[j], p[j]) intersect.\n\nIf any pair of line segments intersects, then this permutation is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.\n\nOnce any valid permutation is found, output \"Yes\". Otherwise, after checking all permutations, output \"No\".\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\nCheck R == B. If not, output No.\n\nElse:\n\nGenerate all possible permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   For all pairs of line segments in the current permutation:\n\n      Check if they intersect.\n\n   If none intersect, return Yes.\n\nIf no permutation is valid, return No.\n\nNow, the key part is implementing the line segment intersection check.\n\nSo, how to implement that in Python.\n\nFirst, the function to check if two line segments AB and CD intersect.\n\nImplementing the orientation function.\n\nThe orientation function for three points (p, q, r) returns:\n\n0 if colinear,\n\n1 if clockwise (right turn),\n\n2 if counter-clockwise (left turn).\n\nBut the exact values may vary. The standard approach is to compute the cross product.\n\nThe cross product of (q-p) and (r-p). The sign tells us the orientation.\n\nSo, the cross product is (qx - px)*(ry - py) - (qy - py)*(rx - px). Wait, no. Wait, the cross product of vectors (q - p) and (r - p) is:\n\n(q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x).\n\nWhich gives the z-component of the cross product. If positive, then counter-clockwise; if negative, clockwise; zero, colinear.\n\nSo, the orientation function can be implemented as:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # colinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2  # 1 for clockwise, 2 for counter-clockwise\n\nBut according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear. So, in our case, when checking two line segments, any three points (like A, B, C) would not be colinear. Wait, but the line segments are between a spaceship and a base. For example, AB is a line segment between a spaceship and a base, CD is between another spaceship and another base. But the points A, B, C, D are all distinct and no three are colinear. Therefore, for any three points in the problem, they are not colinear. Wait, the problem says that no three points are on the same line. So, for example, the points A, B, C can't be colinear. So, in the case of checking two line segments AB and CD, any three points among A, B, C, D can't be colinear. So, when checking for orientation between (A, B, C), the orientation is not zero.\n\nSo, during the check for two line segments AB and CD, the orientations for (A,B,C) and (A,B,D) must be different (since otherwise, if both are same, then C and D are on the same side of AB, so the segments can't cross). Similarly for the other orientations.\n\nSo, the standard method for checking if two line segments AB and CD intersect is:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if AB and CD intersect\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    # General case: the segments intersect\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n\n    # Special cases: check if any of the endpoints lie on the other segment\n    # But according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear, so the only way this can happen is if one of the endpoints is on the other segment. But since no three points are colinear, this can't happen unless one of the points is an endpoint of the other segment. Wait, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. So for example, if C is on AB, then A, B, C are colinear, which is not allowed. So the problem's input ensures that this can't happen. Therefore, the special cases (where endpoints lie on the other segment) can't occur. So the only possible way for the segments to intersect is the general case.\n\n    # So, in our case, we can ignore the special cases.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but suppose that AB and CD share an endpoint. Like, if A is C. But according to the problem statement, all points are distinct. So, no two points are same. So, in the input, all the points (spaceships and bases) are distinct. So, the line segments can't share endpoints. So, the case where A is C is impossible. Therefore, the only possible way for the segments to intersect is the general case where o1 != o2 and o3 != o4. Therefore, the function can be written as above.\n\nWait, but what if AB and CD cross at a point that is not an endpoint? For example, AB is from (0,0) to (2,2), and CD is from (0,2) to (2,0). These cross at (1,1). In this case, the orientations would be o1 and o2 different, and o3 and o4 different, so the function returns True. Which is correct.\n\nSo, with that in mind, the function segments_intersect can be written as above.\n\nSo, in code, the steps are:\n\nImplement the orientation function.\n\nImplement the segments_intersect function.\n\nThen, for each permutation, check all pairs of line segments.\n\nNow, for each permutation, for all i < j, check if the line segment between rebels[i] and perm[i] intersects with the line segment between rebels[j] and perm[j].\n\nIf any pair does, the permutation is invalid. Else, it's valid.\n\nOnce any valid permutation is found, output \"Yes\".\n\nNow, considering that R and B are up to 10, the worst case is 10! = 3,628,800 permutations. For each permutation, checking (10*9)/2 = 45 pairs. Each pair requires 4 orientation checks. So, for each permutation, 45 * 4 = 180 operations. For 3.6 million permutations, that's about 648 million operations. Which might be slow in Python, but given that the constraints are small (R and B up to 10), perhaps it's manageable. But maybe there are optimizations.\n\nBut given that the problem says that R and B are up to 10, but for the code submission, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nBut let's think about possible optimizations. For example, once a permutation is being checked, and during the checking of pairs, if any pair of segments intersect, we can break early and move to the next permutation. That's important for performance.\n\nSo, in code, for each permutation, iterate through all pairs (i, j) where i < j. For each pair, check if segments intersect. If any of them do, break and proceed to the next permutation. Only if all pairs are non-intersecting, then return \"Yes\".\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nFirst, the code structure.\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, print No.\n\nElse, read R points for rebels, then B points for bases.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the bases.\n\nFor each permutation:\n\n   Check all pairs of line segments between the rebels and the bases in the permutation.\n\n   If no intersections, return Yes.\n\nIf none of the permutations work, return No.\n\nNow, in Python, the permutations can be generated using itertools.permutations.\n\nBut note that the bases are stored as a list. So, for example, bases = [ (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ... ].\n\nSo, for each perm in itertools.permutations(bases), we can pair the i-th rebel with perm[i].\n\nBut wait, the permutations are of the bases. So, for each permutation, it's a tuple of the B bases in some order. So, for each i in 0..R-1 (since R=B), the i-th rebel is paired with perm[i].\n\nNow, for each pair of indices i and j (i < j), check if the line between rebels[i] and perm[i] intersects with the line between rebels[j] and perm[j].\n\nSo, code for that.\n\nNow, code for the orientation function and the segments_intersect function.\n\nBut in Python, functions can be written as helper functions.\n\nNow, testing the example input.\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3\n\nRebel positions:\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\nBase positions:\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, the permutation could be the identity permutation. So, the first rebel (0,0) is connected to (-2, 1), second (2,0) to (0,3), third (3,1) to (2,2). Let's check if any of the line segments cross.\n\nBut according to the note, this is a valid case.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 2 1. Since R != B, output is No.\n\nSo, code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the orientation function.\n\nBut wait, in the problem statement, the input says that no three points are colinear. So, the orientation function can return 0, but according to the problem's input, that can't happen. However, the code must still handle it, but according to the problem's input, it's guaranteed that no three points are colinear. Therefore, the code can assume that for any three points, the orientation is not zero.\n\nBut in the code, the segments_intersect function will return True only when o1 != o2 and o3 != o4. So, even if the problem's input ensures that no three points are colinear, the code is safe.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut for the code, the helper functions:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\nBut wait, the code for segments_intersect returns True when the two segments intersect. But according to the problem's input, the segments can't have colinear points, so the code doesn't need to handle the cases where a point lies on a segment. But in the code, the segments_intersect function returns True only when the general case applies.\n\nBut in reality, the code may miss some cases where the segments intersect at endpoints. However, according to the problem's input, no two points are same. So, the endpoints can't be same. So, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code proceeds as follows.\n\nRead R and B.\n\nif R != B: print 'No'\n\nelse:\n\nread R points as rebels = list of tuples.\n\nread B points as bases = list of tuples.\n\nimport itertools.permutations.\n\nfor perm in itertools.permutations(bases):\n\n    for each i in 0 to R-1:\n\n        create a list of line segments (rebels[i], perm[i])\n\n    check all pairs (i, j) with i < j:\n\n        if segments_intersect(rebels[i], perm[i], rebels[j], perm[j]):\n\n            mark as invalid, break and check next permutation.\n\nif any permutation passes, output 'Yes', else 'No'.\n\nBut in code, how to implement this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n    o1 = orientation(a1, a2, b1)\n    o2 = orientation(a1, a2, b2)\n    o3 = orientation(b1, b2, a1)\n    o4 = orientation(b1, b2, a2)\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx +=1\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        rebels.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    # Now generate all permutations of bases\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        # Check all pairs of line segments\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                a1 = rebels[i]\n                a2 = perm[i]\n                b1 = rebels[j]\n                b2 = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(a1, a2, b1, b2):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut wait, the code for checking the pairs is nested loops. For i in 0 to R-1, j from i+1 to R-1.\n\nBut in the code, for each i, it loops j from i+1 to R-1. For each pair (i,j), check if the segments between rebels[i] and perm[i], and rebels[j] and perm[j] intersect.\n\nIf any of them do, then valid becomes False, break the inner loop, and proceed to the next permutation.\n\nOnce all pairs are checked, if valid is True, then output Yes.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput lines:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo rebels are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nbases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nIn the first permutation, the perm is [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nCheck all pairs:\n\ni=0, j=1: check segment between (0,0)-(-2,1) and (2,0)-(0,3). Do they intersect?\n\nLet me compute the orientations.\n\nFor segment A (0,0) to B (-2,1), and segment C (2,0) to D (0,3).\n\nCheck orientation of A, B, C: points (0,0), (-2,1), (2,0).\n\nval = (-2 -0)*(0 - 0) - (1 - 0)*(2 - 0) ?\n\nWait, orientation(p, q, r) is (q.x - p.x)*(r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y)*(r.x - p.x)\n\nSo p is (0,0), q is (-2,1), r is (2,0).\n\n(q.x - p.x) = -2 - 0 = -2.\n\n(r.y - p.y) = 0 - 0 = 0.\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n(r.x - p.x) = 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nval = (-2)*0 - 1*2 = -2.\n\nWhich is negative, so orientation is 2 (counter-clockwise).\n\no1 = 2.\n\nThen, orientation of A, B, D (point (0,0), (-2,1), (0,3)):\n\nq is (-2,1), r is (0,3).\n\n(q.x - p.x) = -2.\n\n(r.y - p.y) = 3 - 0 = 3.\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 1.\n\n(r.x - p.x) = 0.\n\nval = (-2)*3 - 1*0 = -6. Negative. So o2 is 2.\n\nSo o1 and o2 are same. So the first condition (o1 != o2) is false. So segments_intersect returns false.\n\nThen check for o3 and o4.\n\nFor segment C (2,0) to D (0,3), check orientation of C, D, A (2,0), (0,3), (0,0).\n\nval = (0-2)*(0-0) - (3-0)*(0-2) ?\n\nWait, p is (2,0), q is (0,3), r is (0,0).\n\n(q.x - p.x) = 0-2 = -2.\n\n(r.y - p.y) = 0-0 = 0.\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 3-0=3.\n\n(r.x - p.x) = 0-2 = -2.\n\nval = (-2)*0 - 3*(-2) = 6. Positive. So orientation is 1.\n\no3 = 1.\n\nCheck orientation of C, D, B (point (2,0), (0,3), (2,0) ? Wait, B is (2,0) ?\n\nWait, for the segment between (2,0) and (0,3), and the other segment is between (0,0) and (-2,1). So for the second part, o3 is orientation of C, D, A (which is (2,0), (0,3), (0,0)), and o4 is orientation of C, D, B (which is (2,0), (0,3), (2,0))? No, B is rebels[j], which is (2,0) for j=1? Wait, in this case, for the pair i=0 and j=1, the segments are rebels[i] (0,0) to perm[i] (-2,1), and rebels[j] (2,0) to perm[j] (0,3). So for the segment between rebels[j] (2,0) and perm[j] (0,3). So for the other part, the segment is between (2,0) and (0,3). So when checking the other orientation, o3 is orientation of (C, D, A), where C is (2,0), D is (0,3), A is (0,0). And o4 is orientation of (C, D, B), where B is rebels[j] (2,0)? Or wait, the other segment is between (2,0) and (0,3). So the segment is CD. The other segment is AB. So for checking the other orientations, the code computes o3 = orientation of (C, D, A) and o4 = orientation of (C, D, B). Where A is (0,0) and B is (2,0) ?\n\nWait, the parameters to segments_intersect are a1, a2 (the first segment) and b1, b2 (the second segment). So in this case, a1 is (0,0), a2 is (-2,1). b1 is (2,0), b2 is (0,3). So the code computes o3 as orientation(b1, b2, a1) = orientation of (2,0), (0,3), (0,0). Which was calculated as 1. Then o4 is orientation(b1, b2, a2) = orientation of (2,0), (0,3), (-2, 1). Let's calculate that.\n\np is (2,0), q is (0,3), r is (-2, 1).\n\n(q.x - p.x) = -2.\n\n(r.y - p.y) = 1 - 0 = 1.\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 3 - 0 = 3.\n\n(r.x - p.x) = -2 - 2 = -4.\n\nval = (-2)*1 - 3*(-4) = -2 + 12 = 10. Positive. So orientation is 1. So o3 is 1, o4 is 1. So o3 == o4. Therefore, the condition o3 != o4 is false. Therefore, segments_intersect returns false. So the two segments do not intersect.\n\nSo for this pair, no intersection.\n\nNow, check for i=0, j=2. The segments are (0,0) to (-2,1), and (3,1) to (2,2). Do they intersect?\n\nLet me compute orientations.\n\na1 is (0,0), a2 is (-2,1). b1 is (3,1), b2 is (2,2).\n\nCheck orientation of a1, a2, b1: (0,0), (-2,1), (3,1).\n\nval = (-2-0)*(1-0) - (1-0)*(3-0) = (-2)(1) - (1)(3) = -2-3=-5. Negative. So o1 is 2.\n\norientation a1, a2, b2: (0,0), (-2,1), (2,2).\n\nval = (-2)(2-0) - (1)(2-0) ?\n\nWait, p=(0,0), q=(-2,1), r=(2,2).\n\n(q.x - p.x) is -2.\n\n(r.y - p.y) is 2-0=2.\n\n(q.y - p.y) is 1-0=1.\n\n(r.x - p.x) is 2-0=2.\n\nval = (-2)*2 - 1*2 = -4-2 = -6. Negative. So o2 is 2. o1 and o2 are same. So condition fails. So segments_intersect returns false.\n\nSimilarly, for other pairs.\n\nThus, this permutation is valid, and the code would return yes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle this case.\n\nAnother test case: sample input 2 is:\n\n2 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. So output is No.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother test case: R=1, B=1. Then, there is only one possible pairing. So check if the line between the single rebel and base. Since there's only one line, no intersections. So output Yes.\n\nNow, code for that.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The code reads input correctly. For example, the input may have multiple test cases? Or is it one test case?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first example. But looking at the sample input, the first example input is given as a list of two elements, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. The sample shows that the first input is a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read from stdin. For example, the first line of input is R and B, then R lines of spaceships, then B lines of bases.\n\nSo the code reads all lines from stdin, and processes them as one test case. But perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases? But the problem's sample input shows two test cases, but the output is two lines. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains R and B, etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, the sample input is given as a list of two elements, but in the problem statement, the first example's input is given as a list of two strings. But perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, and the code is supposed to process them all. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains R and B, etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle a single test case. But in the sample input, the first example's input is given as two test cases. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nIn the example input, the first input is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWhich is two test cases. The output is ['Yes', 'No'].\n\nSo, the code should read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nBut the original problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the initial code I wrote assumes that there is a single test case. But this is incorrect.\n\nWait, the problem's input format is not clear. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B. Then the next R lines are for the spaceships, then B lines for the bases.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is given as two separate test cases. However, the way the sample is presented is perhaps for the code submission. For example, the first line is the first test case, the second line is the second test case.\n\nBut in reality, the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says nothing about multiple test cases. The sample input shows that the input is given as two separate test cases. However, the problem's note says that the first example's input is a list of strings, but that's perhaps just for the example. So the code should process one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example's input is given as two lines. Wait, the first example's input is:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich is one test case. The second example's input is:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nWhich is another test case. But the sample input shows that the input is given as two separate test cases. So the code should read multiple test cases. But how?\n\nThis is a critical point. Because the code written earlier would process only one test case. However, the sample shows that there are two test cases. So the code must read multiple test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut how to know? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base, with the additional constraint that no two line segments connecting a spaceship to its assigned base intersect.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B).
