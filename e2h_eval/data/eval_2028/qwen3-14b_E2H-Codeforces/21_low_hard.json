The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, it needs a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, it needs a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the approach should be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Similarly, count the number of even and odd keys. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, right! Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, and each odd chest can be paired with an even key. But since each key can be used once and each chest once, we take the minimum of each pair. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parity:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9, 11).\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Their parities: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd_keys = 1 (7), even_keys = 3 (others). \n\nSo min(3,1) is 1 (even chests paired with odd keys) and min(2,3) is 2 (odd chests paired with even keys). Total 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example: \nChests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0.\nKeys: 5 (odd). So odd_keys=1, even_keys=0. \nSo min(5,1) is 1, and min(0,0) is 0. Total 1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are all even (20,30,40,50). So even_chests=1, odd_keys=0. So min(1,0) is 0. And odd_chests=0, even_keys=4. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo the logic seems solid. \n\nNow, the code needs to compute these counts. Let's think about how to implement this.\n\nIn Python, read n and m. Then read the list of a_i, then list of b_j.\n\nFor the a_i list, count how many are even and odd. Similarly for the b_j list.\n\nThen compute the sum as min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nBut wait, how to count even and odd? For each number in a, check if it's even (num % 2 == 0). Same for the keys.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nRead a list: list(map(int, input().split())).\n\nRead b list: same.\n\ncount_even_a = number of elements in a where x % 2 == 0.\n\ncount_odd_a = n - count_even_a.\n\ncount_even_b = number of elements in b where x % 2 == 0.\n\ncount_odd_b = m - count_even_b.\n\nresult = min(count_even_a, count_odd_b) + min(count_odd_a, count_even_b)\n\nPrint(result)\n\nYes. That's the plan.\n\nNow, let's test edge cases. For example:\n\nCase where there are zero even chests. Suppose all chests are odd, and there are some even keys. Then min(odd_chests, even_keys) would be the min of those.\n\nAnother case: if there are more even keys than needed. Like even_chests is 2, odd_keys is 3. Then min(2,3) is 2. So that's correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when n or m",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. The key condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd, which implies that one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Even and Odd Chests**: Determine how many chests have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n2. **Count Even and Odd Keys**: Similarly, count how many keys have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n3. **Optimal Pairing**: \n   - Even chests can be paired with odd keys.\n   - Odd chests can be paired with even keys.\n   - The maximum number of pairs is determined by taking the minimum of the counts of even chests and odd keys, plus the minimum of the counts of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nresult = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Counting Even and Odd Values**: By iterating through the list of chests and keys, we count how many are even and how many are odd.\n- **Pairing Strategy**: The optimal way to maximize the number of opened chests is to pair even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. This is because an even number plus an odd number results in an odd sum, which meets the requirement for unlocking a chest.\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently counts the necessary values in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes up to the given constraints (100,000 elements). This ensures the solution is both optimal and efficient.",
