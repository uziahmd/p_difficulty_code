They decided to encode the number of laughy mushrooms on every lawn in the following way: on every edge between two lawns they wrote two numbers, the greatest common divisor (GCD) and the least common multiple (LCM) of the number of mushrooms on these lawns. But one day Pasha and Akim had an argument about the laughy mushrooms and tore the map. Pasha was left with just some part of it, containing only m roads. Your task is to help Pasha — use the map he has to restore the number of mushrooms on every lawn. As the result is not necessarily unique, help Pasha to restore any one or report that such arrangement of mushrooms does not exist. It is guaranteed that the numbers on the roads on the initial map were no less that 1 and did not exceed 106.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two numbers n and m () which are the numbers of lawns and roads we know about. Each of the following m lines contains four numbers which are the numbers of lawns the road connects, the GCD and the LCM of the numbers of mushrooms on these lawns (1 ≤ GCD, LCM ≤ 106).It is guaranteed, that no road connects lawn to itself, and no two lawns are connected by more than one road.\n\n## Output\nThe answer should contain \"YES\" or \"NO\" on the first line, saying whether it is possible or not to perform the arrangement.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about restoring the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on the given edges which have GCD and LCM values of the two connected lawns. The task is to determine if such a configuration exists and output one possible solution if it does.\n\nHmm. So each edge between two nodes (lawns) has a GCD and LCM of their mushroom counts. Let's think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for any two nodes u and v connected by an edge with GCD g and LCM l, we know that:\n\n- The GCD of u's value and v's value is g.\n- The LCM of u's value and v's value is l.\n\nBut there's a relationship between GCD and LCM: GCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a*b. So for each edge, the product of the GCD and LCM must be equal to the product of the two node values. However, since the GCD is given, and LCM is given, we can check if their product is divisible by the GCD squared? Or wait, maybe there's another condition here.\n\nWait, for two numbers a and b, GCD(a,b) divides both a and b, and LCM(a,b) is a multiple of both. Also, since GCD(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b, then for given g and l, the product g*l must be equal to a*b. But since a and b are multiples of g, let's say a = g * x, b = g * y, where GCD(x,y) = 1. Then LCM(a,b) is g*x*y. So given that the LCM is l, we have g*x*y = l. Therefore, x*y = l/g. Also, since GCD(x,y)=1, x and y must be coprime factors of l/g. \n\nSo for each edge, we can check whether l is divisible by g. If not, then it's impossible. Because if l is not divisible by g, then the equation g*l = a*b would require that a and b are multiples of g, but their product would be g^2 * x*y. Which equals g*l. So that implies that g*l must be divisible by g^2, so l must be divisible by g. Therefore, if for any edge, l % g != 0, then the answer is immediately NO.\n\nSo first step: check for all edges if LCM is divisible by GCD. If not, output NO.\n\nOnce that is done, for each edge, we can compute the product of the two node values as g*l. But since a = g * x, b = g * y, and x and y are coprime, and x*y = l/g. So for each edge, we need to assign x and y such that they are coprime and their product is l/g.\n\nBut how do we model this across the entire graph?\n\nThis seems like a graph problem where each node has a value, and edges impose constraints between pairs of nodes. The problem is to assign values to nodes such that for each edge, the GCD and LCM conditions are satisfied.\n\nLet me think about how to model the relationships. For each edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l, the values of u and v must be multiples of g. Let's denote the value of u as a_u, and the value of v as a_v. Then:\n\na_u = g * x\na_v = g * y\nwhere GCD(x, y) = 1 and x * y = l / g.\n\nSo for each edge, the product x*y is fixed. Also, since x and y are coprime, each of them must be a divisor of l/g. But how do we assign x and y to the nodes?\n\nThis feels similar to building a graph where each node's value is determined up to some factors, and the constraints between nodes are that their ratios (x and y) must be coprime and multiply to a certain value.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe we can model this as a graph where each node has a value that is a multiple of some base value, and the edges impose relations between those multiples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model the problem as a graph where each node's value is determined by a variable, and for each edge, we have constraints on the ratio between the variables.\n\nWait, considering that for each edge between u and v, the values of u and v are g * x and g * y, and x and y are coprime. Also, their product is l/g. So, x * y = (l/g). So, for each edge, the product of the x and y terms is fixed.\n\nBut how to assign these x and y across the graph?\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where each node has a value that is a multiple of some base, and the edges enforce relations between the multiples. But how?\n\nAnother approach: For each node, let's assign a value that is a multiple of the GCDs along the paths. But perhaps we need to model the problem using a union-find structure with constraints, or some kind of system of equations.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a graph where each edge imposes that the value of u and v must be in a certain ratio. For example, for each edge, a_u / g and a_v / g must be coprime and their product is l/g. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, since for each edge, a_u and a_v must be multiples of g, perhaps we can model the problem by dividing all values by their GCDs. Wait, but the GCD for different edges may vary. So perhaps that's not straightforward.\n\nAnother idea: Let's model the problem as building a graph where each node's value is determined by some base value, and the constraints between nodes. For example, for each edge between u and v, the values of u and v must be such that their GCD is g and LCM is l. Which implies that their values are g * x and g * y, where x and y are coprime and x*y = l/g. So for each edge, we can think of the relation between u and v as x and y. But how do we assign x and y across the entire graph?\n\nLet me consider that for each connected component, we can assign values in such a way that the constraints are satisfied.\n\nFor example, suppose we have a connected component. Let's pick a root node and assign it a value. Then, for each edge connected to it, we can determine the possible value of the adjacent node. However, this might lead to contradictions if the constraints are not compatible.\n\nThis seems similar to a bipartition problem, or building a system of equations where each equation is a ratio between variables. However, the variables here are not real numbers but integers with certain constraints.\n\nLet me try to model this with variables. For each node u, let's define a_u = g_u * k_u, where g_u is some base value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since for any two nodes connected by an edge, their values are multiples of the GCD of that edge. So perhaps for each node, its value must be a multiple of the GCDs of all edges in its connected component. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of each edge as requiring that a_u and a_v are multiples of g. So, the value of a_u must be a multiple of all the GCDs of edges connected to it. But that's not necessarily true. For example, if a node is connected to two edges with different GCDs, say 2 and 3. Then the value of the node must be a multiple of both 2 and 3, i.e., 6. So, for each node, the value must be a multiple of the least common multiple of all the GCDs of edges connected to it. But how do we find that?\n\nBut perhaps this is not directly helpful. Let's think again about the per-edge constraints.\n\nFor each edge (u, v) with GCD g and LCM l:\n\nWe have that a_u = g * x, a_v = g * y, where x and y are coprime, and x * y = l/g.\n\nBut since x and y are coprime, then x must divide l/g and y must divide l/g. Also, since x and y are coprime, their product is exactly l/g. So, for each edge, we can split l/g into two coprime factors x and y. However, which one is assigned to u and which to v?\n\nThis choice could affect the rest of the graph. So perhaps, during the traversal of the graph, we need to assign these factors in a way that is consistent across the entire connected component.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a graph traversal, such as BFS or DFS, where we assign values to nodes as we go, ensuring that the constraints are satisfied.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose we have a connected component. We can pick a starting node, assign it a value, then propagate through the edges.\n\nBut what value should we assign to the starting node? Well, for the first node, perhaps we can assign a value that is compatible with the edges connected to it. However, since the edges have different GCDs, the starting node's value must be a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. Wait, no. For example, if the first node is connected to two edges with GCDs 2 and 3, then the value of the node must be a multiple of both 2 and 3, hence 6. But how do we determine this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each node, the value must be a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. But how to ensure that?\n\nAlternatively, for each edge (u, v), the value of u must be a multiple of g, and the same for v. So, the value of u must be a multiple of all the GCDs of the edges connected to it. Hence, the value of u must be a multiple of the LCM of all the GCDs of edges connected to u. But how do we compute that?\n\nBut perhaps this is not necessary. Let's think again about the process of building the values. Let's take a connected component. Let's choose a starting node, say node u. Assign it some value, then for each adjacent edge, determine the value of the adjacent node.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose we have an edge between u and v, with GCD g and LCM l. Suppose we assign a value to u. Then, the value of v is determined based on that.\n\nWait, but for the edge (u, v), the GCD of a_u and a_v is g. Suppose we have a_u. Then a_v must be such that GCD(a_u, a_v) = g and LCM(a_u, a_v) = l. But how?\n\nLet me think. Given a_u and the edge's g and l, can we compute a_v?\n\nWell, since GCD(a_u, a_v) = g, then g divides both a_u and a_v. So, a_u must be a multiple of g. Similarly, a_v must be a multiple of g.\n\nSo, let's assume that a_u is known. Let me denote a_u = g * x. Then, since the LCM of a_u and a_v is l, and GCD is g. The product of a_u and a_v is g * l. So, a_v = (g * l) / a_u. But since a_u is a multiple of g, this division will be integer.\n\nBut also, the GCD(a_u, a_v) must be equal to g. Let's check:\n\nIf a_u = g * x and a_v = (g*l)/a_u = (g*l)/(g*x) ) = l/x. Wait, but that would imply that a_v = l/x. But for that to be valid, x must divide l. Also, since a_u and a_v are multiples of g, then l must be divisible by g, which we already checked earlier.\n\nWait, but this seems conflicting. Let me re-express this.\n\nGiven that a_u and a_v have GCD g and LCM l, then:\n\na_u = g * x\n\na_v = g * y\n\nwith x and y coprime, and x*y = l/g.\n\nSo, given a_u, we can compute x as a_u / g, then y must be (l/g)/x. And then a_v is g*y. But for this to work, x must divide (l/g), and y must be an integer.\n\nBut if a_u is chosen such that x divides (l/g), then this works. However, how do we choose a_u?\n\nThis suggests that during the traversal, when we assign a value to a node, we need to make sure that for all edges connected to it, the corresponding adjacent nodes can be assigned values that satisfy the constraints.\n\nBut how can we do this?\n\nPerhaps, during a BFS or DFS traversal, we can assign values to nodes step by step, ensuring consistency. Let's think of the following approach:\n\n- For each connected component in the graph, process it separately.\n\n- Choose a starting node, assign it a value. Then, for each adjacent edge, compute the required value for the neighbor node.\n\nBut the problem is, how to choose the initial value for the starting node. For example, if the starting node is connected to multiple edges, the initial value must be compatible with all of them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial value can be set as g * x, where x is some factor of l/g for each edge connected to the starting node. But how to choose x?\n\nWait, but for each edge connected to the starting node, the product x * y must be (l/g) for that edge. However, since the starting node is connected to multiple edges, each with their own l/g values, this may complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting node's value is determined by the constraints of the edges. Let me think of a simple case: suppose the starting node is connected to only one edge. Then, for that edge, the value of the starting node can be set as g * x, where x is any divisor of (l/g), and the other node's value is g * y, where y = (l/g)/x. However, since x and y must be coprime, x must be a divisor of (l/g) and co-prime with (l/g)/x.\n\nBut how do I choose x? Well, perhaps I can choose x as 1, then y becomes l/g. But then, since x and y are 1 and l/g, which are coprime only if l/g is 1. Otherwise, they might not be coprime. Wait, no. For example, if l/g is 6, then x=1 and y=6. Are they coprime? Yes. Because 1 and 6 have GCD 1. Similarly, x=2 and y=3 would also be coprime. So for any pair (x, y) such that x * y = (l/g) and GCD(x, y) = 1, we can choose either x or y for the node.\n\nBut how to choose which one to assign to the starting node?\n\nThis seems like a problem where, for each edge, we have to choose between two possibilities for the ratio between the nodes. However, this choice may affect the rest of the graph.\n\nThis seems similar to building a bipartition graph, where each edge enforces that the two nodes have certain relationships. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node has a value that is a multiple of some base value, and for each edge, the ratio between the nodes is fixed. But how?\n\nLet me think again. For each edge between u and v, the product of a_u and a_v is g * l. Also, since a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y, x * y = l/g. So, the ratio between a_u and a_v is x/y. But x and y are coprime. However, since a_u * a_v = g*l, then a_v = (g*l)/a_u. So, once a_u is determined, a_v is determined.\n\nTherefore, during traversal, once a node's value is determined, the adjacent nodes' values are determined. However, this leads to a problem: if the same node is reached via different paths, the computed value must be the same. Otherwise, it's impossible.\n\nThis suggests that we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal, assigning values to nodes as we go, and checking for consistency.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\n- For each connected component in the graph:\n\n   - Choose a starting node and assign it an initial value. However, what value should this be?\n\n   - Wait, but the initial value can't be arbitrary. For example, suppose the starting node is connected to an edge with GCD g and LCM l. Then, the starting node's value must be a multiple of g, and when combined with the adjacent node's value, their product must be g*l. However, since the adjacent node's value is determined once the starting node's value is chosen, but how to choose the starting node's value?\n\n   - Alternatively, perhaps the starting node's value can be set to g * k, where k is a divisor of (l/g) such that when you compute the adjacent node's value, the GCD and LCM conditions are satisfied.\n\nBut how do we choose k? It seems that there's a lot of possibilities. However, perhaps for the purposes of the problem, any valid assignment is acceptable, so we can choose k as 1, or any other valid value, and proceed. However, this may lead to inconsistencies in the graph.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial value can be determined based on the constraints of the edges. For example, for the starting node, the value must be a multiple of the GCDs of all edges connected to it. But again, how to determine that?\n\nWait, perhaps the initial value can be set as the GCD of the edge multiplied by some factor, but how to choose that factor?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the starting node's value can be set to the GCD of the edge. Let me think. Suppose we have an edge between u and v with GCD g and LCM l. If I set a_u = g, then a_v must be (g*l)/a_u = l. Then, GCD(g, l) must be equal to g. Which is true only if g divides l. Which is already ensured by the earlier check (since l must be divisible by g).\n\nBut for example, if the edge has GCD 2 and LCM 6, then setting a_u = 2 gives a_v = 6. Then, GCD(2,6) is 2, which matches. LCM(2,6) is 6, which matches. So that works. But if I set a_u to 2 * something else, say 4, then a_v would be (2*6)/4 = 3. Then GCD(4,3) is 1, which does not match the given GCD of 2. So that's invalid.\n\nAh! So choosing the initial value of the starting node as g is not sufficient. Because in this case, the initial value of u is 2, and the adjacent node is 6. But if the starting node was connected to another edge, then the value of u must satisfy all the edges.\n\nWait, but if the starting node is connected to multiple edges, how can we choose a value that satisfies all of them?\n\nThis seems complicated. Let's think of a scenario where a node is connected to two edges. For example, node u is connected to node v with GCD g1 and LCM l1, and to node w with GCD g2 and LCM l2. How can we choose the value of u so that both edges are satisfied?\n\nIn this case, the value of u must be a multiple of both g1 and g2. Let's say the value of u is LCM(g1, g2) * k, where k is some integer. Then, for each edge, the adjacent node's value can be determined accordingly. However, this might not be feasible if the constraints from different edges conflict.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nPerhaps the key is that for each edge, the value of the nodes must be such that their product is g * l. So, for the node u, which is connected to edges with parameters (g1, l1) and (g2, l2), the value of u must be such that:\n\na_u * a_v = g1 * l1\n\nand \n\na_u * a_w = g2 * l2.\n\nBut since a_v and a_w are determined by a_u, we need to ensure that the constraints from other edges are satisfied. However, this seems challenging.\n\nAn alternative approach: For each connected component, build a system where each node's value is determined by the product of the GCD and LCM of the edges. However, this seems vague.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of variables. Let's assume that the graph is connected. We can perform a BFS traversal starting from a node. Assign the starting node a value, then for each neighbor, compute their value based on the edge's parameters. Then, for each subsequent neighbor, check if their value is consistent with previous assignments.\n\nBut the problem is that the starting node's value is not known. How to choose it?\n\nWait, but for the first edge, if we assign the starting node's value as g * x, then the adjacent node's value is g * (l/g)/x = l/x. However, since x and (l/g)/x must be coprime, this implies that x must be a divisor of (l/g) and that x and (l/g)/x are coprime. Which is only possible if x is 1 or l/g, because otherwise, if x has a common factor with (l/g)/x, then their product would have that factor squared.\n\nWait, no. For example, if l/g is 6, then x can be 2 and (l/g)/x is 3, which are coprime. So in this case, x and y are coprime. So, the choice of x is any divisor of (l/g) such that x and (l/g)/x are coprime. But how to find such x?\n\nBut for any divisor x of (l/g), if x and (l/g)/x are coprime, then x must be a divisor of (l/g) that is square-free? Not sure.\n\nBut regardless, the key point is that for the first edge, there are multiple possibilities for x. Choosing one of them may lead to a valid assignment, while others may not. However, trying all possibilities is computationally expensive, especially for large graphs.\n\nBut given that the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps there's a way to choose x in a way that allows the rest of the graph to be filled in correctly.\n\nSo, here's an idea: during BFS traversal, when processing a node for the first time, assign it a value based on the edge's parameters. For example, for the first edge, assign the starting node's value as g * x, and the adjacent node's value as g * y, where x and y are coprime factors of (l/g). But how to choose x and y?\n\nBut for the starting node, since it's the first node, there's no prior constraints. So, perhaps we can choose x as 1, leading to y = l/g. Then, the starting node's value is g * 1 = g, and the adjacent node's value is g * (l/g) = l. This ensures that the GCD of g and l is g (since l is divisible by g), and the LCM is l. Which satisfies the condition.\n\nWait, let's check: GCD(g, l) = g? Only if l is a multiple of g, which we have already checked. So yes, this works. So, for the first edge, setting the starting node's value to g and the adjacent node's value to l would satisfy the edge's constraints.\n\nThen, for subsequent edges, we can use this approach. Let's see.\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose we have a chain of nodes u-v-w. The edge u-v has GCD g1 and LCM l1. Edge v-w has GCD g2 and LCM l2.\n\nWe start with u, assign it value g1. Then, v's value is l1. Now, for the edge v-w, the product of v's value and w's value must be g2 * l2. Since v's value is l1, then w's value is (g2 * l2) / l1. However, we must check that this value satisfies the GCD and LCM conditions with v's value.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For the edge between v and w, the GCD of l1 and (g2*l2/l1) must be equal to g2. And the LCM must be l2.\n\nBut this depends on the actual values. Let's take a concrete example. Suppose the edge v-w has GCD 2 and LCM 6. Then, the product of v's value and w's value must be 2*6=12. Suppose v's value is 3 (from the previous example). Then, w's value is 12/3 = 4. Now, check GCD(3,4)=1, which is not equal to 2. So this would be invalid. Hence, this assignment would fail.\n\nBut why? Because the initial assignment for u was based on the first edge's parameters, but that led to a conflict in the second edge.\n\nSo, this approach may not work. Therefore, the problem is that choosing the initial value for the starting node may lead to conflicts later on.\n\nThis suggests that the initial value must be chosen in a way that allows all constraints to be satisfied. However, how?\n\nAlternative idea: For each edge, the ratio between the two nodes is fixed. Let me think again. For any two nodes u and v connected by an edge with GCD g and LCM l, their values a_u and a_v must satisfy:\n\na_u = g * x\n\na_v = g * y\n\nwith x * y = l/g and GCD(x, y) = 1.\n\nSo, x and y are coprime divisors of l/g. Therefore, the ratio between a_u and a_v is x/y. However, since x and y are coprime, this implies that a_u and a_v are in the ratio x:y, and their product is g^2 * x*y = g^2 * (l/g) = g*l.\n\nBut during traversal, if I can model the ratio between nodes, perhaps I can assign values accordingly.\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where each edge has a ratio between the nodes. For example, for the edge between u and v, the ratio a_u/a_v = x/y. However, since x and y are coprime, and x*y = l/g, then x/y can be expressed as (some fraction) that depends on how we split the factors.\n\nBut how can we model this ratio during traversal?\n\nLet me consider that during traversal, for each node, we can store a value that is the product of the ratios along the path from the root. For example, if we have a root node with value a, then for each neighbor, the value is a * (x/y), where x and y are determined by the edge's parameters.\n\nBut this seems too abstract. Let's think in terms of variables. Suppose during BFS, we have a node u with assigned value a_u. When we visit an edge (u, v), we need to compute a_v based on the edge's parameters.\n\nAs before, a_v = (g * l) / a_u. However, we must ensure that the GCD(a_u, a_v) is equal to g and that the LCM is equal to l.\n\nBut how to ensure this? Well, since we have already ensured that l is divisible by g, and that a_u is a multiple of g, then a_v = (g*l)/a_u will be an integer. However, the GCD(a_u, a_v) may not be equal to g. So, this approach may not work.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the edge between u and v has GCD 2 and LCM 6. Then, l/g is 3. So, x*y = 3. Possible pairs (x,y) are (1,3) and (3,1). So, a_u could be 2*1 = 2, a_v = 2*3 = 6. GCD(2,6)=2, LCM is 6. Correct.\n\nOr, if a_u is 2*3 = 6, a_v is 2*1 = 2. Same result.\n\nNow, suppose during BFS, we have a_u = 2. Then, a_v is (2*6)/2 = 6. Which is correct.\n\nNow, suppose there's another edge from v to w, with GCD 2 and LCM 6 again. Then, a_v is 6. So, a_w would be (2*6)/6 = 2. Which is correct. GCD(6, 2) is 2, LCM is 6. Correct.\n\nBut now, suppose there's an edge from v to w with GCD 3 and LCM 6. Then, l/g is 6/3 = 2. x*y = 2. Possible pairs (1, 2) or (2, 1). So, a_v = 6. Then, a_w = (3*6)/6 = 3. Check GCD(6, 3) = 3, LCM is 6. Correct. So, this works.\n\nBut what if there's a conflict?\n\nLet's take an example where the initial assignment leads to a contradiction. Suppose there's a cycle in the graph. For instance, a triangle u-v-w-u.\n\nEdge u-v: GCD 2, LCM 6.\n\nEdge v-w: GCD 2, LCM 6.\n\nEdge w-u: GCD 2, LCM 6.\n\nAssume we start with u = 2, then v = 6, then w = (2*6)/6 = 2. Then, the edge w-u would require that GCD(2, 2) is 2, which is correct, and LCM is 2. But the LCM for the edge is supposed to be 6. Oh, this is a problem.\n\nWait, the edge between w and u has GCD 2 and LCM 6. But if both are 2, then their LCM is 2, not 6. Which is a contradiction.\n\nSo, the initial assignment leads to a contradiction. Hence, the problem is that the BFS approach may assign values that don't satisfy all edges.\n\nThis suggests that the problem requires more than just propagating values based on the edge's product. We need to also ensure that the GCD and LCM conditions are met.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems very complex. Let's think of the constraints again. For any two nodes u and v connected by an edge with GCD g and LCM l, the following must hold:\n\na_u = g * x\n\na_v = g * y\n\nx * y = l/g\n\nGCD(x, y) = 1.\n\nSo, during the traversal, once we assign a_u, then a_v is determined as g * y = (g*l)/a_u. However, we must also ensure that GCD(x, y) = 1, where x = a_u/g and y = a_v/g.\n\nBut how can we ensure that?\n\nBecause once we have a_u and a_v, x and y are determined, and their GCD must be 1.\n\nSo, during the traversal, after assigning a_u and computing a_v, we must check that GCD(a_u/g, a_v/g) = 1.\n\nIf this is not the case, then the assignment is invalid, and we need to backtrack or choose a different initial value.\n\nBut how to handle this in practice?\n\nThis seems computationally intensive. For example, in the previous example of the triangle, if we start with u=2, then v=6. For the edge v-w, we compute a_w = (2*6)/6 = 2. Then, for the edge w-u, a_w is 2 and a_u is 2. The GCD of 2 and 2 is 2, which is correct. However, the LCM is 2, but the edge expects LCM 6. Hence, this is invalid.\n\nBut why? Because according to the earlier formula, the LCM of a_u and a_v should be l. But in this case, the LCM is 2 instead of 6. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Because the product of a_u and a_v is g * l. For the edge between w and u, g is 2, l is 6. So the product should be 2 * 6 = 12. But a_u is 2, a_w is 2. Product is 4, which is not equal to 12. Hence, the error.\n\nSo, the earlier approach of setting a_v = (g*l)/a_u is incorrect. Wait, why? Because for the edge between u and v, the product of a_u and a_v should be g * l. But in the case of the edge between w and u, the product of a_w and a_u is 2 * 2 = 4, but g*l is 2*6=12. Hence, the product is not matching.\n\nThis indicates that the earlier assumption that a_v = (g*l)/a_u is incorrect. What's wrong with that?\n\nLet me re-derive the formula.\n\nWe know that for two numbers a and b:\n\nGCD(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b.\n\nSo, for the edge between u and v, GCD(a_u, a_v) = g, LCM(a_u, a_v) = l. Hence, a_u * a_v = g * l.\n\nSo, if a_u is known, then a_v = (g * l) / a_u.\n\nBut in the example above, for the edge between w and u, which has g=2 and l=6, the product should be 12. But in our example, a_u is 2 and a_w is 2, product is 4. Hence, this is invalid.\n\nBut why did this happen?\n\nBecause during the traversal, when we computed a_w based on the edge between v and w, we used the edge's g and l. However, the edge between v and w has its own parameters. Let's recheck.\n\nIn the example, the edge between v and w has GCD 2 and LCM 6. Hence, a_v * a_w = 2 * 6 = 12. Since a_v is 6, a_w = 12 / 6 = 2. This is correct. So, the product is indeed 12. However, the edge between w and u has GCD 2 and LCM 6, which requires a_w * a_u = 2 * 6 = 12. But a_w is 2 and a_u is 2, product is 4. Hence, this is a contradiction.\n\nSo, the problem is that the traversal assumed that the edge between w and u would have its parameters respected, but it doesn't. Hence, the initial assignment is invalid.\n\nThis suggests that the approach of setting a_v = (g * l) / a_u for each edge is insufficient, because it doesn't account for the other edges that the node may be part of.\n\nThus, the problem requires that for every edge, the product of the two nodes' values is equal to g*l. Hence, during the traversal, whenever we reach a node that has already been assigned a value, we must check that the new computed value matches the existing one.\n\nSo, the algorithm should be:\n\nFor each connected component:\n\n   - Choose a starting node, assign it an initial value (but what value?).\n\n   - Perform BFS or DFS traversal:\n\n      - For each edge (u, v) with parameters g and l, if u is visited and v is not, compute a_v = (g*l)/a_u, then check that a_v is an integer, and that GCD(a_u/g, a_v/g) = 1. If so, assign a_v and continue.\n\n      - If during traversal, a node is visited again and the computed value doesn't match the existing one, return NO.\n\nBut the problem is choosing the initial value for the starting node. How to choose it so that all constraints are satisfied?\n\nLet me think. For the starting node, the initial value can be any value that is compatible with the edges connected to it. But how to choose it?\n\nPerhaps, the initial value can be set as g * x, where x is a divisor of (l/g) for each edge connected to the starting node. However, this may not be possible unless all edges connected to the starting node have the same l/g value. But this is not guaranteed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial value for the starting node is set to g, and then during traversal, if conflicts arise, we try other possibilities. But this seems computationally expensive.\n\nAlternatively, for the starting node, we can choose its value as g * x, where x is any divisor of (l/g) for the first edge. However, this may not work for other edges connected to it.\n\nThis seems very challenging. Perhaps there's a way to represent the problem as a graph where each node's value is determined by multiplying by certain factors, and we need to ensure that the factors are compatible.\n\nLet me think again about the relationship between nodes. For any edge between u and v, a_u = g * x and a_v = g * y, where x*y = l/g and GCD(x,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if we can restore the number of mushrooms on each lawn based on given GCD and LCM values for each road connecting two lawns. The solution involves checking consistency across all roads and using a graph traversal approach to assign values to each node (lawn) while ensuring all constraints are met.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Validity of Input**: For each road, ensure that the LCM is divisible by the GCD.
