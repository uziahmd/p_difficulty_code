He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives c as a string in base a. The output depends on whether b is R or another base.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Read a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number.\n2. Read the number c as a string in base a. Need to convert it to decimal first.\n3. Then, convert that decimal number to base b. If b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals. Otherwise, convert to base b as a string, using letters for digits above 9 (like A for 10, etc.)\n\nSo the main steps are: converting c from base a to decimal, then converting that decimal to the target representation (base b or Roman).\n\nLet me think about each part.\n\nFirst, converting c from base a to decimal. Since c can have leading zeros, but that doesn't affect the value. The problem says that if Roman is involved, the number is non-zero and <= 3000 in decimal. For other cases, it's up to 1e15.\n\nBut how to handle the conversion from base a? For example, if a is 10, then c is a normal decimal string. But if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-9 and A-F (assuming uppercase?), but the input's c may have letters? Wait, the problem says that the input c is given as a string in base a. But the problem says that in the input, the c may contain letters? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input says that the second line is a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros. But how are the digits represented? For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F (uppercase?), but the problem says that for bases greater than 10, letters are used. But the input's c is given as a string. So, for example, if a is 12, then the digits in c can be 0-9 and A (for 10), B (for 11). So when converting from base a to decimal, we need to process each character of c as a digit in base a.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, if the input c is 'A', then in base 12, it represents 10 in decimal. So the code needs to parse each character of c into its corresponding value.\n\nSo the first step is to convert the string c (in base a) to a decimal integer. How to do that?\n\nWe can loop through each character in the string, and for each character, compute its value. For example, '0' is 0, '1' is 1, ..., '9' is 9, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So for each character in the string, we can convert it to its numerical value, then compute the total as sum(digit * a^position), but perhaps more efficiently by processing each digit left to right, multiplying current total by a and adding the digit.\n\nBut how to handle the letters? For example, the input c may have letters in uppercase? The problem says that in the input, the c may have letters? Well, the problem says that in the input, the c is given as a non-negative integer in base a. So for bases larger than 10, the digits would be represented with letters. However, the problem says that in the input, the c may contain leading zeros, but the actual digits must be valid for base a. For example, if a is 12, then the digits can be 0-9, A, B. So the input c can have letters in uppercase?\n\nAssuming that the input c uses uppercase letters for digits above 9. For example, if the input is 'A', then it's 10 in base 12. So during processing, we need to convert each character to its value. So for a character ch in c:\n\nif it's a digit, then value is int(ch)\n\nelse, it's a letter, so value is 10 + (ord(ch) - ord('A')).\n\nBut wait, what if the input has lowercase letters? The problem says that the input is given as a single non-negative integer. Probably, the input uses uppercase letters. For example, in the sample input, there's an example where the input is 'A' in base 12, which is converted to 'A' in base 13. So the code should process letters as uppercase.\n\nSo for the conversion from base a to decimal, the code needs to process",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, with the special case of converting to Roman numerals when the target base is specified as 'R'. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its original base to decimal, and then converting that decimal value to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a` and needs to be converted to a decimal (base 10) integer. This involves processing each digit of the input string, considering both numeric digits and alphabetic characters for bases greater than 10.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: After converting the input number to decimal, we handle two cases:\n   - If the target base `b` is not 'R', convert the decimal number to the specified base `b`, using letters for digits greater than 9.\n   - If the target base `b` is 'R', convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef from_decimal(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(num):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, r) in val:\n        while num >= v:\n            res += r\n            num -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        parts = line.strip().split()\n        a_part = parts[0]\n        b_part = parts[1]\n        c_str = parts[2]\n        \n        a = int(a_part)\n        if b_part == 'R':\n            target = 'R'\n        else:\n            target = int(b_part)\n        \n        # Convert c_str from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        \n        if target == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            result = from_decimal(decimal_value, target)\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` processes each character of the input string, converting it to its corresponding decimal value by considering both numeric and alphabetic characters.\n2. **Conversion from Decimal to Target Base**: The function `from_decimal` converts a decimal number to a specified base, handling digits greater than 9 by using alphabetic characters.\n3. **Roman Numeral Conversion**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts a decimal number to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, iterating through these pairs to construct the Roman numeral string.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution efficiently handles both standard base conversions and the special case of Roman numerals, adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
