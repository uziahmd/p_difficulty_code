He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign each input string as either a prefix (P) or suffix (S) such that there exists at least one string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The answer can be any valid possibility as long as there exists at least one possible s that fits.\n\nSo, how do I approach this?\n\nFirst, I need to find a way to determine for each input string whether it's a prefix or suffix of some possible s. But since there are multiple possibilities, I need to find an assignment that works for at least one s.\n\nBut how do I find that s? Well, the key idea here is that the correct s must have all the prefixes and suffixes given. So for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) must be the first n-1 characters of s. Similarly, the longest suffix (length n-1) must be the last n-1 characters of s. Also, the actual s must be such that all the given strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n1. Find all possible candidates for the full string s. Then, for each candidate, check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it. Then, for each such candidate, assign the P/S labels accordingly.\n\nBut how do I generate possible candidates for s?\n\nAlternatively, since the input contains all the prefixes and suffixes of s, then the correct s can be determined by combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix. For example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must overlap in such a way that their combination gives the full string. However, since there are two strings of each length, perhaps the correct s is determined by taking the longest prefix (say, p) and the longest suffix (say, s), and then checking if they can form a string s of length n. For example, the first n-1 characters of s are p, and the last n-1 characters are s. Therefore, the entire string s must be p[0] + s[1], since the first character of p is the first character of s, and the last character of s is the last character of s. Wait, let me think:\n\nLet me take the example from the first sample input. The input for n=5 has the strings: ba, a, abab, a, aba, baba, ab, aba. The correct s is ababa. The longest prefix is abab (length 4) and the longest suffix is baba (length 4). The full string is ababa. So the longest prefix (abab) is the first four characters, and the longest suffix (baba) is the last four. The full string is a followed by bab (from the prefix) and then a (the last character). So combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix, the full string would be the first part of the prefix plus the last part of the suffix. But how to find that?\n\nThe full string s must have the longest prefix (of length n-1) as its first n-1 characters, and the longest suffix (of length n-1) as its last n-1 characters. Therefore, the first character of the longest prefix is the first character of s, and the last character of the longest suffix is the last character of s. Also, the overlapping part between the longest prefix and the longest suffix must be compatible. For example, the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must share the middle part. So, the full string s can be determined by combining the longest prefix and the longest suffix. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the longest prefix is P and the longest suffix is S. Then, the full string s must be P + last character of S. But wait, since the length of P is n-1, and the length of S is n-1. The full string s is length n. So the first n-1 characters are P, and the last n-1 characters are S. Therefore, the first character of P is the first character of s. The last character of S is the last character of s. Also, the (n-1)th character of P (which is the last character of P) is the (n-1)th character of s. The first character of S is the second character of s. So, the full string s must be P[0] followed by S[0..n-2] ? No, because the last n-1 characters of s are S. So for example, s's last n-1 characters are S. So the full string s is equal to P concatenated with the last character of S. Because the first n-1 characters are P, and the last n-1 characters are S. So the first n-1 characters are P, and the last n-1 characters are S. Therefore, the full string s is P[0..n-2] + S[-1], but also S[0..n-2] must be equal to P[1..n-1]. Because the first n-1 characters are P, so the second character of s is P[1], which is also the first character of S's first n-1-1 = n-2 characters? Wait:\n\nLet me think of the full string s. Let's say the length is n. The longest prefix is of length n-1. Let's call it P. The longest suffix is S of length n-1. Then:\n\ns = P + [last_char], where last_char is the last character of S. Because the first n-1 characters are P, and the last n-1 characters are S. Therefore, the first character of S is s[1], the second character of S is s[2], ..., the (n-1)th character of S is s[n-1]. But the last character of S is s[n-1], which is the same as the last character of s. Also, the first n-1 characters of s are P, which is s[0...n-2]. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of S must be s[1...n-2], which is the same as P[1...n-2]. Therefore, the first n-2 characters of S must match the second to (n-1)-th characters of P. So S[0...n-2] = P[1...n-2].\n\nTherefore, combining P and S, the full string s can be constructed as P[0] + S[0...n-2], but since S[0...n-2] is equal to P[1...n-2], then s is P[0] followed by P[1...n-2] and then S's last character (which is s[n-1]).\n\nWait, but S is the suffix of length n-1, so the first character of S is s[1], and the last character of S is s[n-1]. Therefore, the full string s can be constructed as follows: the first n-1 characters are P, and the last n-1 characters are S. Therefore, the first n-1 characters of s are P, and the last n-1 characters of s are S. Thus, the entire s must be P concatenated with the last character of S. But since the first n-1 characters of s are P, the last character of S must be s[n-1], and the first n-1 characters of S must be s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the first n-1 characters of S must be equal to the last n-1 characters of P. So the first n-1 characters of S is the substring of P starting at index 1. So for example, if P is of length 4 (n-1 = 4 when n is 5), then S's first 4-1=3 characters must be P[1..3], and the last character of S is s[4], which is the last character of s.\n\nSo to find the possible s, we can consider all possible pairs of the longest prefix and suffix. Since the input has two strings of length n-1, one of them is the longest prefix, and the other is the longest suffix. So for each possible pair (p, s) where p is one of the two strings of length n-1 and s is the other, we can check if they can form a valid s.\n\nOnce we have a candidate s, we can check all the input strings to see if each is either a prefix or suffix of s. Then, assign P/S accordingly.\n\nBut how do I find the correct pair of longest prefix and suffix?\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\nFor the given input, collect all the strings. Then, among them, find the two strings of length n-1. For each possible pairing of these two (since there are two options: one is the prefix, the other is the suffix), check if combining them as described gives a valid s. If so, then use that s to assign the P/S labels.\n\nOnce we have such an s, we can check all the input strings and for each, determine if it's a prefix or suffix of s. Then, assign P or S accordingly. However, there may be multiple possible s's, but we just need to find one that works.\n\nBut how do I find the correct pair of longest prefix and suffix?\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have two candidates for the longest prefix and suffix. Let's call them L1 and L2. Let's try both possibilities: L1 is the prefix and L2 is the suffix, and vice versa.\n\nFor each case, I can attempt to build the full string s. How?\n\nCase 1: L1 is the prefix of length n-1, L2 is the suffix of length n-1. Then, the full string s must be such that:\n\ns[0...n-2] = L1\n\ns[1...n-1] = L2\n\nTherefore, the full string s is L1[0] + L2[0...n-2], but wait, because L2 is the suffix of length n-1. So the first character of L2 is s[1], the second is s[2], ..., the (n-1)th character is s[n-1]. So the full s is s[0] = L1[0], s[1] = L2[0], s[2] = L2[1], ..., s[n-1] = L2[n-2]. But since s[0...n-2] is L1, then s[1...n-2] must be L1[1...n-2], which is also equal to L2[0...n-3]. Therefore, L1[1...n-2] must be equal to L2[0...n-3]. Also, the last character of s is L2[n-2], and the last character of L1 is s[n-2], which is L1[n-2].\n\nSo the full string s is L1[0] + L2[0 ... n-2], but that would be of length 1 + (n-1) - 0? Wait, L2 has length n-1. So the length of the full string is 1 + (n-1) - 0? No, the full string is length n. Let me think again. The full s is constructed as follows: the first n-1 characters are L1. The last n-1 characters are L2. Therefore, the full s is L1[0 ... n-2] concatenated with the last character of L2. Wait, no. Let me think of the positions:\n\ns[0 ... n-2] = L1 (length n-1)\ns[1 ... n-1] = L2 (length n-1)\n\nTherefore, s[0] is the first character of L1. s[1] is the first character of L2. s[2] is the second character of L2. ... s[n-1] is the (n-2)th character of L2. Also, since s[1 ... n-2] is the same as the first n-2 characters of L2. But also, those characters are the same as the second to (n-1)th characters of L1. So, L1[1 ... n-2] must be equal to L2[0 ... n-3].\n\nTherefore, the full s can be built as follows: s[0] = L1[0], and the rest of the characters are the first n-1 characters of L2. Wait, no. Because the s[1 ... n-1] is L2. So the full s is s[0] followed by L2. But s[0] is the first character of L1, and the rest of the s is L2. However, since s[1 ... n-1] is L2, then the length of s is 1 + (n-1) = n. Which is correct. However, we need to make sure that the first n-1 characters of s (i.e., s[0 ... n-2]) is equal to L1. So, the first n-1 characters of s are L1. Which is s[0] followed by s[1 ... n-2]. But s[1 ... n-2] is the first (n-2) characters of L2. So the first n-1 characters of s would be L1[0] + L2[0 ... n-3]. This must be equal to L1. Therefore, L1 must be equal to L1[0] + L2[0 ... n-3]. Which implies that L1[1 ... n-2] must equal L2[0 ... n-3], and L1's last character (L1[n-2]) is equal to L2[n-3]? Wait, maybe not. Let me take an example.\n\nTake the first sample input. The two longest strings are abab (length 4) and baba (length 4). Let's assume that abab is the prefix (L1) and baba is the suffix (L2). Then, according to the above logic, the full s would be L1[0] + L2, which is 'a' + 'baba' → 'ababa', which is length 5. Now, check that the first n-1 =4 characters of s are abab. The first four characters of 'ababa' are 'abab', which matches L1. The last four characters are 'baba', which matches L2. So this works.\n\nNow, check if L1[1 ... n-2] equals L2[0 ... n-3]. For n=5, n-2 is 3. So L1[1..3] is 'bab'. L2[0 ... 5-3-1? Wait, n-3 is 2. So L2[0 ... 2] is 'bab'. So yes, they are equal. So the condition holds.\n\nSo the general approach is: for each pair of the two longest strings, check if the first n-2 characters of the suffix (L2) equals the substring of the prefix (L1) starting at index 1 and of length n-2. If that is true, then the full string s is L1[0] + L2. Then, once we have this s, we can check all the input strings to see if they are prefixes or suffixes of s. If all of them are either prefixes or suffixes of s, then this is a valid candidate. Then, we can assign the P/S labels accordingly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For the given input, collect all the strings.\n\n- Find the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates.\n\n- For each possible way to assign one as prefix (L1) and the other as suffix (L2):\n\n   - Check if L1[1 ... n-2] == L2[0 ... n-3]. If so, then the full string s is L1[0] + L2.\n\n   - Once s is determined, check if all the input strings are either a prefix or suffix of s.\n\n   - If yes, then proceed to assign P/S labels based on this s.\n\nOnce such a valid s is found, we can proceed to generate the answer.\n\nBut what if there are multiple possibilities? For example, in the third sample input, n=2, and the input strings are 'a' and 'c'. The two strings of length 1 (n-1=1) are 'a' and 'c'. Trying to assign one as prefix and the other as suffix. Let's see:\n\nCase 1: L1 is 'a' (prefix), L2 is 'c' (suffix). Then, the full string s would be L1[0] (which is 'a') + L2 (which is 'c') → 'ac'.\n\nCheck if the input strings are prefixes or suffixes. The input strings are 'a' and 'c'. For s='ac', 'a' is a prefix (length 1), 'c' is a suffix (length 1). So that's valid.\n\nCase 2: L1 is 'c' (prefix), L2 is 'a' (suffix). Then s is 'c' + 'a' → 'ca'. Again, the input strings are prefixes and suffixes. So both possibilities are valid. Hence, the answer can be PS or SP. But the sample output shows 'PS' as acceptable, but others like SP are also acceptable.\n\nSo the code needs to generate any valid assignment. So once we find a valid s, we can process all input strings and assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how to check if all input strings are either a prefix or suffix of s?\n\nOnce s is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with the string) or a suffix of s (s ends with the string). If for all input strings, this is true, then the s is valid.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 strings. Let's store them in a list called 'strings'.\n\nFind all the strings of length n-1. There should be exactly two of them.\n\nFor each possible pair (p, s) where p is one of the two, and s is the other:\n\n   Check if p[1:] (the substring from index 1 to end) equals s[:-1] (the substring from start to index len(s)-2). Because for p of length n-1, p[1:] is of length n-2. Similarly, s[:-1] is of length (n-1) -1 = n-2. So if they are equal, then the full string is p[0] + s.\n\n   Once we get the candidate s_candidate = p[0] + s.\n\n   Then, check for all input strings whether they are a prefix or suffix of s_candidate.\n\n   If yes, then proceed to assign P/S labels.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate, then we can generate the output.\n\nBut how to check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of s_candidate?\n\nFor each input string in the list, check if it is a prefix (s_candidate starts with it) or a suffix (s_candidate ends with it). If all of them are either, then proceed.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, then for each input string, we need to assign 'P' or 'S' in the output. However, there might be cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the second sample input, the string is 'aaa'. All input strings are 'a', 'aa', 'aa', 'a'. For example, the string 'a' is both a prefix and suffix. However, in that case, the assignment can be either P or S. But since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can choose either.\n\nBut how to decide which to assign? Well, the problem says that Ivan has given all the improper prefixes and suffixes. So for the correct s, each input string is either a prefix or suffix. So for each input string, it must be a prefix or suffix of s_candidate. However, if a string is both, then it can be assigned as P or S. But since the problem allows any valid assignment, we can choose either.\n\nBut for the code, how to assign the P/S? For each input string, we can check if it's a prefix. If it is, assign P. Else, assign S. But if it is both, then we can choose either. However, the problem requires that the number of P's and S's are equal. Because there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes. So in total, for the 2n-2 strings, exactly n-1 are P and n-1 are S.\n\nBut when a string is both a prefix and a suffix, how do we assign it? For example, in the case of s = 'aaa', the string 'a' is both a prefix and suffix. So when building the output, we need to assign it as P or S, but ensuring that the total counts are correct.\n\nBut how to handle that? Well, perhaps during the assignment phase, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix. If it is, assign P. Otherwise, assign S. However, this may not account for the fact that some strings are both, but the counts may not balance. However, since the problem states that the input is guaranteed to be possible, and that the given strings are prefixes and suffixes of some s, then for the correct s_candidate, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix. So for each input string, it is at least one of them. But for some, it may be both. So when assigning, we can choose either P or S, but need to ensure that the total count of P and S is equal.\n\nBut how to ensure that? Well, perhaps during the assignment phase, we can first assign all possible prefixes (for each string that is a prefix, assign P), and then assign the rest as S. However, since the total number of P's must be exactly n-1, and the same for S's, perhaps we need to find a way to assign the ambiguous cases (those that are both) in a way that balances the counts.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, since the problem allows any valid assignment, perhaps we can proceed as follows: for each input string, if it is a prefix of s_candidate, assign it as P. Otherwise, assign as S. However, this may not work if some strings are both. But since the input is correct, the number of P's and S's will be correct. Let me think:\n\nEach of the input strings is either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. So for each input string, it is in the set of prefixes or suffixes. However, the total number of prefixes is exactly n-1. The same for suffixes. But since the input has 2n-2 strings, which is exactly the sum of prefixes and suffixes (each of length 1..n-1, two per length). However, some strings may be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the case of s_candidate = 'aaa', the string 'a' is both a prefix and a suffix. However, in the input, there are two strings of length 1. Both are 'a's. So for each of them, they are both prefix and suffix. But when assigning, we need to choose one as P and the other as S. Because the total number of P's must be exactly n-1 (for n=3, 2 P's and 2 S's). So in this case, for the two 'a's, one is assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do this in code? Well, the code can first collect all the input strings and for each, check if it is a prefix. Then, count how many are prefixes. If that count is exactly n-1, then assign all of them as P and others as S. Otherwise, for those that are both, we need to adjust the counts.\n\nBut perhaps the code can first assign all the strings that are prefixes (and not suffixes) as P. Then, for the strings that are both, assign some as P and some as S to reach the required count.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps in practice, when the correct s_candidate is used, the number of prefixes (including those that are both) is exactly n-1, and the same for suffixes. But how?\n\nBecause the input is given as all the prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate. So for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings. One is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. However, if for a certain length l, the prefix and suffix are the same string, then that string appears twice in the input. For example, for s_candidate = 'aaa', the prefixes of length 1 is 'a', and the suffix of length 1 is 'a'. So in the input, there are two 'a's. So when processing, each of these two 'a's must be assigned as either P or S, but the total number of P's must be exactly n-1. For example, for n=3, there are two prefixes (length 1 and 2) and two suffixes (length 1 and 2). The input has four strings. The two 'a's (length 1) are both prefixes and suffixes. The other two strings are 'aa' (prefix and suffix). So in this case, the correct assignment would be to assign one 'a' as P, the other as S, and the 'aa' as P and S. But the code needs to assign exactly two P's and two S's.\n\nBut how to do that? Well, perhaps the code can proceed as follows: for each input string, check if it is a prefix. If it is, assign as P. Else, assign as S. But for the case where a string is both, it can be assigned as P or S, but the code will count it as P. However, this may lead to more than n-1 P's. For example, in the case of 'aaa' and the two 'a's, both are prefixes and suffixes. Assigning them as P would give two P's, and the other two strings (the 'aa's) would also be prefixes and suffixes. Assigning them as P would give four P's, which is wrong.\n\nBut that's impossible, because the input is generated from the prefixes and suffixes. So for the correct s_candidate, the number of prefixes is exactly n-1. So for each input string, exactly one of the following is true: it is a prefix (but not a suffix), a suffix (but not a prefix), or both. However, the total number of prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) is exactly n-1, and same for suffixes. Therefore, when we count all the input strings that are prefixes (including those that are also suffixes), that count is exactly n-1. Similarly for suffixes.\n\nBut how to verify that? For example, in the case of s_candidate = 'aaa' (n=3). The proper prefixes are 'a' (length 1), 'aa' (length 2). Proper suffixes are 'a' (length 1), 'aa' (length 2). So the input for n=3 would have four strings: two 'a's and two 'aa's. Each of these is both a prefix and a suffix. So when we count how many of the input strings are prefixes, each of the four strings is a prefix. So that would be 4, which is larger than n-1=2. But that's impossible. Wait, this suggests that my previous reasoning is incorrect.\n\nWait, the input for n=3 in the second sample is:\n\nInput:\n\n3\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nWhich is the second example. The output is PPSS, but other answers are acceptable. The correct string is 'aaa'.\n\nThe prefixes of 'aaa' are:\n\nlength 1: 'a'\n\nlength 2: 'aa'\n\nThe suffixes are:\n\nlength 1: 'a'\n\nlength 2: 'aa'\n\nSo the input contains all four of these. But each of the input strings is both a prefix and a suffix. However, there are two strings of length 1 (both 'a's) and two of length 2 (both 'aa's). So for each of these, they are both a prefix and a suffix. But how can the code assign exactly two P's and two S's? Because the total number of prefixes is two (each of the two lengths), and the same for suffixes. So in this case, the code needs to assign exactly two of the four input strings as P and two as S. But how?\n\nThe code can't just assign all as P, because that would be four P's, which is invalid. Therefore, the previous approach of assigning P if the string is a prefix is not sufficient.\n\nSo how to handle this?\n\nAh, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be such that there exists at least one possible assignment. Therefore, for the correct s_candidate, the input strings are exactly the union of the prefixes and suffixes. But each of the input strings is either a prefix, or a suffix, or both. However, the code must assign exactly n-1 P's (since there are exactly n-1 prefixes) and n-1 S's (same for suffixes). Therefore, for each input string, it must be assigned to exactly one of P or S, such that the total counts are correct.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nPerhaps the approach is:\n\nOnce we have the correct s_candidate, for each input string, determine if it is a prefix (P) or a suffix (S). However, if it is both, we need to choose whether to assign it as P or S, making sure that the total number of P's is exactly n-1.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAn alternative idea: for each input string, if it is a prefix, then it must be assigned as P. If it is not a prefix, then it must be assigned as S. But this would only work if the number of prefixes (including those that are both) is exactly n-1. However, in the case of the 'aaa' example, the number of prefixes is 2 (the two different lengths), but the input has four strings, each of which is a prefix. So that approach would fail.\n\nThis suggests that my previous reasoning was wrong. What's the correct way to count the number of prefixes and suffixes?\n\nAh! The input contains all the prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate. For example, for s_candidate of length n, there are exactly n-1 prefixes (each of length 1 to n-1) and exactly n-1 suffixes. However, some of these prefixes and suffixes may be the same string. For example, in the case of s_candidate being 'aaa', the prefixes and suffixes for length 1 and 2 are the same. Therefore, the input has two strings of length 1 (both 'a') and two of length 2 (both 'aa'). But these are the prefixes and suffixes. So, the total number of prefixes is n-1 (two for n=3), but each prefix is present twice in the input. However, the problem statement says that the input has exactly two strings of each length. So for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are two strings, which are the prefix and suffix of that length. So for example, for the 'aaa' case, the two strings of length 1 are the prefix and suffix of length 1. So for each length, one is a prefix and the other is a suffix. But in reality, they are the same string. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e., there exists some s_candidate for which the input is the set of its prefixes and suffixes. So in the 'aaa' case, the two strings of length 1 are both the prefix and suffix of length 1. So how can this be?\n\nAh, no. The problem says that the input contains exactly two strings of each length. However, for the correct s_candidate, for each length l, there is exactly one prefix (of length l) and exactly one suffix (of length l). However, it's possible that these two are the same string. In that case, the input would contain two copies of that string. So, for example, for the string 'aaa', the prefix of length 1 is 'a', and the suffix of length 1 is 'a'. Therefore, the input has two 'a's for length 1. Similarly for the length 2.\n\nSo, for the input, for each length l, there are two strings. One is the prefix of length l, and the other is the suffix of length l. But they may be the same string.\n\nTherefore, for the correct s_candidate, the input strings are exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate. So, for each input string, it is either a prefix of s_candidate (and possibly a suffix) or a suffix of s_candidate (and possibly a prefix). Therefore, when we have the correct s_candidate, the number of input strings that are prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) is exactly n-1, and similarly for suffixes. But how?\n\nNo. Because for each length l, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix. Therefore, there are exactly n-1 prefixes (one per length) and n-1 suffixes. However, the input contains two strings per length, which are the prefix and suffix for that length. Therefore, for each length l, one of the two strings is the prefix, and the other is the suffix. So, for the entire input, there are exactly n-1 prefixes and exactly n-1 suffixes. Therefore, when considering all input strings, exactly n-1 of them are prefixes (possibly overlapping with suffixes), and exactly n-1 are suffixes.\n\nThus, for the correct s_candidate, when we process all input strings, the number of input strings that are prefixes (including those that are also suffixes) is exactly n-1. Similarly for suffixes.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as follows: for each input string, check whether it is a prefix of s_candidate. The number of such strings is exactly n-1. So, for each input string, if it is a prefix, assign P. Else, assign S. This will ensure that exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's are assigned.\n\nBut how to verify that?\n\nIn the case of the 'aaa' example, with input strings ['a', 'a', 'aa', 'aa'].\n\nFor s_candidate = 'aaa', each of these strings is a prefix. So the code would assign P to all four strings. But that would give 4 P's, which is wrong. But according to our earlier reasoning, there should be exactly n-1 = 2 P's.\n\nThis contradiction indicates that there is a flaw in the reasoning. Where is the error?\n\nAh, here's the mistake: the input contains for each length l, two strings. One is the prefix of length l, and the other is the suffix of length l. So for the 'aaa' example, for length 1, the two strings are the prefix and suffix of length 1. Both are 'a'. So for the input strings, one of them is the prefix (so must be assigned P), and the other is the suffix (assigned S). Similarly for the two 'aa's. Therefore, for the input, there are exactly two P's and two S's. However, each of the four strings is both a prefix and a suffix of s_candidate. So how can the code distinguish between them?\n\nThe problem is that the code needs to assign for each input string whether it is a prefix or a suffix. However, for the input strings that are both, the code must assign exactly one of them as P (as the prefix for that length) and the other as S (as the suffix for that length).\n\nBut how can the code know which one is which?\n\nThe answer is that during the process of generating the candidate s_candidate, we already know which of the two strings of length l is the prefix and which is the suffix. For example, when we built the s_candidate from the longest prefix and suffix, we had to choose which of the two strings of length n-1 was the prefix and which was the suffix. But for other lengths, how can we know which is prefix and which is suffix?\n\nAh, this is the crux of the problem. The initial approach of building s_candidate from the two longest strings (n-1 length) and checking if they fit, gives us the correct s_candidate. But once we have that s_candidate, we can determine for each input string whether it is a prefix or suffix. However, for strings that are both, we need to assign them as either P or S, but ensuring that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is assigned as P (the prefix) and the other as S (the suffix).\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nOne possible way is to group the input strings by their lengths. For each length l, there are exactly two strings. For each such pair, one must be assigned as P (the prefix of length l), and the other as S (the suffix of length l). Therefore, for each length l, we can check which of the two strings is the actual prefix of s_candidate. That string must be assigned as P, and the other as S.\n\nYes! Because for each length l, there is exactly one prefix (the first l characters of s_candidate), and exactly one suffix (the last l characters of s_candidate). So,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The input consists of all improper prefixes and suffixes of `s`, and we need to assign each input string as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S) such that there exists at least one valid string `s` consistent with the assignment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix Candidates**: The two longest strings (of length `n-1`) are potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix of `s`.\n2. **Construct Candidate String**: For each pair of these longest strings, check if they can form a valid string `s` by ensuring their overlap is correct.\n3. **Validate Candidate String**: Once a candidate string `s` is constructed, verify that all input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n4. **Assign P/S Labels**: For each input string, determine if it is a prefix or suffix of the valid candidate string `s`.
