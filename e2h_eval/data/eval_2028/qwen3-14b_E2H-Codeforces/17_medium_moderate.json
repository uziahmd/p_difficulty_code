He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, but we don't know which is prefix or suffix). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings. The key is that there must be at least one possible s that matches the assignments.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the main idea is that for the correct string s, the prefixes and suffixes must match. For example, the prefix of length k is the first k characters of s, and the suffix of length k is the last k characters.\n\nBut since we have all the prefixes and suffixes, but not knowing which is which, we need to find an assignment of P and S such that:\n\n- For each input string, if it's marked as a prefix, then there exists some s where that string is a prefix of s. Similarly for suffix.\n\nBut since we need to find any valid assignment, perhaps we can find the correct s first, and then check which of the input strings are prefixes and suffixes of it.\n\nBut how do we find s? Because there might be multiple possibilities, but the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid (i.e., there exists at least one s that matches the given set of prefixes and suffixes).\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\nFind the correct string s. Once we have s, we can check which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of s. Then assign P and S accordingly.\n\nBut how do we find s?\n\nLet me think. The correct s must have all its prefixes and suffixes present in the input. So for example, the full string s has prefixes of lengths 1 to n-1, and suffixes of lengths 1 to n-1. So, the input contains all those prefixes and suffixes. But the input is given as a list of 2n-2 strings, which includes all of them.\n\nSo, the correct s must be such that:\n\n- All of its prefixes of length 1 to n-1 are present in the input.\n\n- All of its suffixes of length 1 to n-1 are present in the input.\n\nBut how can we find s?\n\nOne way is to consider that the longest prefix (of length n-1) must be a prefix of s, and the longest suffix (of length n-1) must be a suffix of s. Also, the full string s can be determined by combining these two. For example, the longest prefix (length n-1) is s[0...n-2], and the longest suffix (length n-1) is s[1...n-1]. So combining these two, the full string s would be the first n-1 characters of the longest prefix plus the last character of the longest suffix. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the longest prefix is P (length n-1), and the longest suffix is S (length n-1). Then the full string s must be P + c, where c is the last character of the suffix S. But also, the suffix S is the last n-1 characters of s, so the first character of S is the second character of s. So, for example, if P is the first n-1 characters of s, and S is the last n-1 characters of s, then the first n-1 characters of s is P, and the last n-1 is S. Therefore, the entire s is P[0] followed by S[0..n-2] ?\n\nWait, let me think of an example. Suppose s is \"ababa\" (length 5). The longest prefix is \"abab\" (length 4), and the longest suffix is \"baba\" (length 4). So the full string is ababa. The first four letters are abab, the last four are baba. So the first letter is a, and the last four letters are baba. So combining the first four (abab) and the last four (baba), the overlapping part is the third character. So the full string is abab (prefix) plus the last character of the suffix (a), but wait: the suffix is baba. So the full string is the prefix of length 4 (abab) and the suffix of length 4 (baba). The full string must be such that the first 4 letters are abab and the last four letters are baba. So the full string is ababa. So the fifth character is the last character of the suffix (a). So the full string is the first n-1 letters of the prefix (which is the entire prefix) plus the last character of the suffix. But how do I find that?\n\nSo for the correct s, the full string can be determined by taking the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1), and combining them. The correct s must be the concatenation of the longest prefix (length n-1) and the last character of the longest suffix (since the suffix of length n-1 is the last n-1 characters of s). However, the first n-1 characters of s is the longest prefix, and the last n-1 characters is the longest suffix. Therefore, the first character of the longest suffix is the second character of s. So the full string s is the longest prefix (length n-1) plus the last character of the longest suffix. But that's only possible if the longest prefix and the longest suffix overlap correctly.\n\nBut how do we find which of the input strings are the longest prefix and the longest suffix?\n\nThe input has 2n-2 strings. For each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings. So for length n-1, there are two strings. One of them is the longest prefix (the prefix of length n-1), and the other is the longest suffix (the suffix of length n-1). So, the correct s must be formed by combining these two. But how do we find which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nWell, suppose we take the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them A and B. Then, the correct s must be such that A is the prefix (so s starts with A), and B is the suffix (so s ends with B). Therefore, the first n-1 characters of s is A, and the last n-1 characters is B. Therefore, the entire s is A's first n-2 characters plus B's last character. Because the first n-1 characters is A, and the last n-1 characters is B. So the first character of B must be the second character of A, and the last character of B is the last character of s.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me imagine that the full string s is of length n. The prefix of length n-1 is A. The suffix of length n-1 is B. So, the first n-1 characters of s is A, and the last n-1 characters is B. Therefore, the first n-1 characters of s is A, and the last n-1 characters is B. Therefore, the first character of B is the second character of s. So, the entire s is A[0], A[1], ..., A[n-2], and the last character is B's last character. But since the last n-1 characters of s is B, the first n-1 characters of s is A, and the last n-1 is B. So the first n-1 characters of s is A, which is s[0..n-2], and the last n-1 is B, which is s[1..n-1]. Therefore, the first character of B is s[1], and the last character of B is s[n-1]. Therefore, the full s is A concatenated with s[n-1], but s[n-1] is the last character of B. Also, the first character of B is s[1], which is A[1].\n\nTherefore, the full string s can be constructed as follows: Take the prefix of length n-1 (A), and append the last character of the suffix of length n-1 (B). But how do we know which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix?\n\nSo for the two candidates (say, A and B), we can try both possibilities:\n\nCase 1: A is the prefix, B is the suffix. Then s is A + last_char(B). But then, the suffix of length n-1 of s must be B. Let's check that. The suffix of length n-1 of s would be the last n-1 characters of s. Since s is A + last_char(B), which is of length (n-1) + 1 = n. The last n-1 characters are the last n-1 characters of s. Which would be the last n-1 characters of A + last_char(B). Since A is of length n-1, the last n-1 characters of s would be A[1:] + last_char(B). But this must equal B. So, A[1:] + last_char(B) == B?\n\nAlternatively, B is of length n-1. So, for this to hold, B must be equal to A[1:] + last_char(B). Which implies that B[0 ... n-2] = A[1 ... n-2] and B's last character is B's last character. So B[0] must equal A[1], B[1] must equal A[2], ..., B[n-2] must equal A[n-1]. And then B's last character is the same as itself. So this implies that B is A[1:] + (some character). But B is of length n-1. So A[1:] is of length n-2. Adding one character gives length n-1. So yes, B must be equal to A[1:] + last_char(B). Which would mean that B is A[1:] + (last_char(B)). Which is always true. Wait, no. Because B is of length n-1, and A[1:] is of length n-2. So adding any character (like the last character of B) gives a string of length n-1. But that would imply that B equals A[1:] + last_char(B). Which would require that B's first n-2 characters are A[1 ... n-2], and B's last character is whatever it is. So for example, if B is A[1:] + x, then x is the last character of B. Which is obviously true. So this is always true. So in that case, the s would be A + x, where x is the last character of B. But then, the suffix of length n-1 of s would be B.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's take an example. Suppose A is \"abab\" (n-1=4, n=5), and B is \"baba\". Then s would be A + last_char(B) = \"abab\" + \"a\" = \"ababa\". The suffix of length 4 is \"baba\", which is B. So that works. So the way to construct s is to take the prefix (A) and add the last character of the suffix (B). Then, the suffix of length n-1 of s is B. So that's correct.\n\nBut how do we know which of the two strings of length n-1 is the prefix and which is the suffix? Because for each pair, we can try both possibilities and see if the resulting s has all the prefixes and suffixes present in the input.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Find all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\n2. For each possible combination (each of the two could be the prefix, and the other the suffix):\n\n   a. Construct the candidate s as prefix_str + last_char(suffix_str).\n\n   b. Check if all the prefixes and suffixes of s are present in the input list.\n\n3. Once we find such an s, then we can proceed to assign P and S to each input string based on whether they are prefixes or suffixes of s.\n\nBut how do we check if all the prefixes and suffixes of s are present in the input?\n\nBut the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid. So there must be at least one such s. So for each candidate s generated from the two possibilities (the two strings of length n-1), we can check if all the required prefixes and suffixes are present in the input.\n\nOnce we find the correct s, then we can process the input strings and for each, determine if it is a prefix or suffix of s. Then assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Find the two strings of length n-1.\n\n- For each possible pair (A, B) where A is the prefix and B is the suffix, generate s_candidate = A + B[-1].\n\n- For this s_candidate, check if all the prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate are present in the input list.\n\nBut how to check that? Because the input list contains exactly all the prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate. So for the generated s_candidate, we can generate all its prefixes (for lengths 1 to n-1) and all its suffixes (for lengths 1 to n-1), and check that each of these is present in the input list.\n\nBut since the input list has exactly 2n-2 elements, and each of these prefixes and suffixes must be present in the input, then for the candidate s_candidate, if all of its prefixes and suffixes are present in the input list, then that s_candidate is valid.\n\nOnce we find such an s_candidate, we can proceed.\n\nBut how do we check if the generated prefixes and suffixes are present in the input list?\n\nBut the input list may contain duplicates. For example, in the second sample input, the input is:\n\n3\n\na\n\naa\n\naa\n\na\n\nWhich corresponds to the string \"aaa\". The prefixes are \"a\", \"aa\" (for lengths 1 and 2), and the suffixes are \"a\", \"aa\". So the input has two \"a\" and two \"aa\".\n\nSo for the candidate s_candidate, we need to generate all prefixes and suffixes (for lengths 1 to n-1), and check that each of them is present in the input list (with multiplicity? Or just presence? Well, the problem says that the input list is exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes, so for the correct s_candidate, each of the prefixes and suffixes must be present in the input list. However, since the input list has exactly two entries per length, and the correct s_candidate's prefixes and suffixes will have exactly two entries per length (since for each length, there is one prefix and one suffix). Wait no. For example, for a string like \"aaa\", the prefix of length 1 is \"a\", and the suffix of length 1 is \"a\". So in the input list, there are two entries for length 1, which are both \"a\". So when generating the prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate, we need to check that for each of them, there are enough occurrences in the input list.\n\nBut how to handle that? Because the input list may have duplicates. For example, for the sample input with n=3, the input has two \"a\" and two \"aa\".\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to collect all the prefixes and suffixes of the candidate s_candidate, and check that each of them is present in the input list, considering their counts.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, since the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, once we find a candidate s_candidate, then the input list must contain all the prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate. So perhaps for the candidate s_candidate, we can generate all prefixes and suffixes, and check that each of them is present in the input list. However, since the input list may have duplicates, perhaps the way to check is to count the frequency of each string in the input, and compare with the frequency generated by the candidate s_candidate.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, for the candidate s_candidate, the prefixes and suffixes are:\n\nprefixes: for length 1 to n-1, each is unique? Not necessarily. For example, for \"aaa\", the prefix of length 1 is \"a\", and the suffix of length 1 is \"a\". So the input list must contain two \"a\" entries.\n\nSo for the candidate s_candidate, the set of prefixes and suffixes is exactly the same as the input list. So for the candidate s_candidate, when we generate all prefixes and suffixes, we can collect them into a list, and then check if this list is a permutation of the input list.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nBut the input list is given as a list of 2n-2 strings. For the candidate s_candidate, the list of prefixes and suffixes is exactly 2n-2 strings. So, if we generate the prefixes and suffixes for s_candidate, and compare their multiset with the input list, then they should be equal.\n\nBut comparing multisets can be done by counting the frequency of each string in both lists.\n\nSo here's the plan for checking if a candidate s_candidate is valid:\n\nGenerate all prefixes (for lengths 1 to n-1) and all suffixes (for lengths 1 to n-1) of s_candidate. Collect all of these into a list (total 2n-2 elements). Then, compare this list with the input list. However, since the order of the input is arbitrary, we can't compare directly. Instead, we can count the frequency of each string in the input list and compare with the frequency generated by the candidate's prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nIn Python, perhaps using collections.Counter for both the input list and the generated list. But since the input list may have duplicates, and the generated list must have the same counts.\n\nBut for example, in the sample input with n=3, the input list is [\"a\", \"aa\", \"aa\", \"a\"], and the candidate s_candidate is \"aaa\". The generated prefixes and suffixes would be:\n\nprefixes of lengths 1 and 2: \"a\", \"aa\"\n\nsuffixes of lengths 1 and 2: \"a\", \"aa\"\n\nSo the generated list is [\"a\", \"aa\", \"a\", \"aa\"], which is the same as the input list. So Counter would match.\n\nSo for the candidate s_candidate, generate all prefixes and suffixes, collect them into a list, create a Counter for that list, and compare with the Counter of the input list.\n\nIf they are equal, then the candidate is valid.\n\nOnce we find such a candidate s_candidate, then we can proceed to assign 'P' and 'S' for each input string.\n\nBut how to generate the candidate s_candidate?\n\nSo, first, find the two strings of length n-1 in the input. Let's call them candidates.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, the input is:\n\n5\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nSo the two strings of length 4 (n-1=5-1=4) are \"abab\" and \"baba\".\n\nSo for each of the two possibilities (A is prefix, B is suffix):\n\nCase 1: A is \"abab\", B is \"baba\". Then s_candidate is \"abab\" + \"a\" (last character of B) = \"ababa\".\n\nCheck if the generated prefixes and suffixes match the input.\n\nCase 2: A is \"baba\", B is \"abab\". Then s_candidate is \"baba\" + \"b\" (last character of B) = \"babab\". Now check if the generated prefixes and suffixes match the input.\n\nOnly the first case would be correct, because the correct s is \"ababa\".\n\nSo, for each candidate s_candidate generated from the two possibilities, check if the generated prefixes and suffixes match the input. Once found, proceed.\n\nOnce we have the correct s_candidate, we can process each input string and check whether it is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate (i.e., s_candidate starts with the string) or a suffix (s_candidate ends with the string). However, note that some strings may be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the case of \"aaa\", the string \"a\" is both a prefix and a suffix.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input contains exactly two strings of each length. For example, for length 1, there are two strings. But for the correct s_candidate, the prefix of length 1 is \"a\", and the suffix of length 1 is also \"a\". So in the input list, there are two copies of \"a\".\n\nSo, for each input string, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of the correct s_candidate. But how do we assign which is which?\n\nOnce we have the correct s_candidate, we can generate all the prefixes and suffixes. Then, for each input string, check if it is a prefix or suffix of s_candidate. However, since the input list contains exactly the prefixes and suffixes, each input string must be either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate. So, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix (i.e., s_candidate starts with it) or a suffix (ends with it). But how to decide which one to assign as 'P' or 'S'?\n\nBut the problem allows any assignment as long as there exists at least one s that is consistent with it. So, once we have the correct s_candidate, we can assign each input string as prefix or suffix, as long as it is one of them.\n\nBut for each input string, there may be multiple possibilities. For example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix of s_candidate, then we can choose to assign it as P or S, as long as the total number of P and S is equal (n-1 each, since there are 2n-2 strings, half P and half S).\n\nBut how to ensure that? Well, the problem says that the output must have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's. Because there are 2n-2 strings, and exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes.\n\nSo, once we have the correct s_candidate, the approach is:\n\nFor each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If it is, then assign 'P' (but need to make sure that there are exactly n-1 P's and S's). However, since the input list contains exactly the prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate, each input string must be either a prefix or a suffix. So, for each input string, it must be a prefix or a suffix. So, the way to assign is to check for each input string whether it is a prefix or a suffix, and assign accordingly. However, if a string is both, we can choose either.\n\nBut how to do that in code?\n\nLet me think. For each input string, check if it's a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, then mark as P. Else, mark as S. But what if a string is both a prefix and a suffix? Then, we can choose either. However, the problem requires that the number of P's and S's is equal. But since the input list contains exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, the total number of P's must be n-1 and S's must be n-1. So, regardless of how we assign (as long as each string is assigned as P or S according to whether it is a prefix or suffix), the count will be correct.\n\nBut how to make sure that for each input string, it's assigned as either P or S?\n\nFor example, take the third sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\n2\n\na\n\nc\n\nThe possible s_candidate is \"ac\" or \"ca\". Let's say we pick \"ac\". Then the prefixes are \"a\" (length 1), and suffixes are \"c\" (length 1). The input strings are \"a\" and \"c\". So the output can be PS or SP. But the sample output says that PS is acceptable.\n\nSo, for each input string, we can check if it's a prefix. If it is, assign P, else assign S. But in the case where a string is both a prefix and a suffix, we can choose either. However, in practice, for the correct s_candidate, each string in the input list is either a prefix or a suffix. But some may be both. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so for the correct s_candidate, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix.\n\nBut how to check for that?\n\nOnce we have the correct s_candidate, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, then it's a prefix. Otherwise, check if it is a suffix. Since the input list is guaranteed to be valid, it must be one of them.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nOnce we have s_candidate, for each string in the input list, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, assign 'P'. Else, assign 'S'.\n\nBut how to check for prefix? For a given string, check if s_candidate starts with it. Similarly for suffix.\n\nSo, the code steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 strings into a list called inputs.\n\nFind the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates.\n\nFor each possible pair (A, B) where A and B are the two candidates:\n\n   Generate s_candidate = A + B[-1]\n\n   Check if the generated prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate match the input list.\n\n   If yes, proceed to assign P/S.\n\nOnce s_candidate is found, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. Assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nNow, the problem is how to generate the two candidates of length n-1.\n\nSo, in code, for the inputs list, collect all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\nOnce that is done, try both possibilities for which is prefix and which is suffix.\n\nBut how to generate the candidate s_candidate?\n\nOnce we have the two strings, say, str1 and str2, then:\n\ncase 1: str1 is the prefix, str2 is the suffix. So s_candidate = str1 + str2[-1]\n\ncase 2: str2 is the prefix, str1 is the suffix. So s_candidate = str2 + str1[-1]\n\nThen check for each case if the generated prefixes and suffixes match the input list.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, proceed.\n\nNow, how to check if the generated prefixes and suffixes match the input list?\n\nAs discussed earlier, generate all prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate, collect them into a list, and compare their multiset with the input list.\n\nBut in code, how to do that?\n\nIn Python, we can generate the list of prefixes and suffixes for s_candidate. Then, create a Counter for that list, and compare it with the Counter of the input list.\n\nBut since the input list may have duplicates, this comparison is necessary.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\ndef is_valid(s_candidate, input_list):\n\n    generated = []\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s_candidate)):\n\n        generated.append(s_candidate[:i])\n\n        generated.append(s_candidate[-i:])\n\n    # Now generated has 2*(n-1) elements, since len(s_candidate) is n.\n\n    # Now compare the Counter of generated with the Counter of input_list.\n\n    from collections import Counter\n\n    return Counter(generated) == Counter(input_list)\n\nWait, but for n=5, the len(s_candidate) is 5, and for i in 1..4 (since len(s_candidate) - 1 = 4), so for each i from 1 to 4, append prefix and suffix. So generated will have 2*4=8 elements, which is 2n-2 when n=5 (2*5-2=8). So yes.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo, in code, for a given s_candidate, generate all prefixes and suffixes of lengths 1 to n-1, and check if their multiset matches the input list.\n\nOnce we find a valid s_candidate, proceed.\n\nOnce that is done, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, assign 'P', else 'S'.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFor example, for each string in input_list:\n\nif s_candidate.startswith(string):\n\n   assign 'P'\n\nelse:\n\n   assign 'S'\n\nBut since the input list is guaranteed to be valid, this will work.\n\nSo, putting this together.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 lines, store in input_list.\n\nCollect all the strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates.\n\nIf there are two candidates, then for each possible pair (A, B) where A and B are the two candidates, generate s_candidate as A + B[-1], and check if it's valid.\n\nOnce a valid s_candidate is found, proceed.\n\nOnce found, generate the answer string as follows:\n\nfor each string in input_list:\n\n   if it is a prefix of s_candidate: append 'P'\n\n   else: append 'S'\n\nBut what if there are multiple valid s_candidates? For example, in the third sample input, there are two possible s_candidates (\"ac\" and \"ca\"). How do we choose which one to use?\n\nIn that case, the code may generate one of them, and proceed. Since the problem allows any valid assignment, any of them would work.\n\nBut how to ensure that the code finds a valid s_candidate?\n\nThe problem says that the input is guaranteed to be valid, so at least one of the two possibilities (A as prefix and B as suffix, or vice versa) will generate a valid s_candidate.\n\nBut perhaps in some cases, both possibilities are valid. For example, if the input is for s_candidate \"ab\" and \"ba\" (n=2), but that's not possible. Let's think.\n\nBut for n=2, the input has 2n-2=2 strings. Each of length 1. The two strings are the prefixes and suffixes. For example, if s is \"ab\", the prefixes are \"a\" (length 1), and the suffixes are \"b\" (length 1). So the input list would have \"a\" and \"b\". So the two candidates of length n-1=1 are \"a\" and \"b\". Trying A as prefix (a) and B as suffix (b): s_candidate is a + b[-1] = a + b = ab. Which is correct. Trying B as prefix (b) and A as suffix (a): s_candidate is b + a[-1] = b + a = ba. Which is another possible s_candidate. But for that case, the input list would have \"a\" and \"b\", and for the generated s_candidate \"ba\", the prefixes and suffixes are \"b\" (prefix length 1) and \"a\" (suffix length 1). So the generated list is [\"b\", \"a\"], which is same as the input list (assuming input list is [\"a\", \"b\"], but Counter would match regardless of order. So in this case, both possibilities are valid. So the code would generate either one, and the answer can be either PS or SP.\n\nThus, the code can pick the first valid s_candidate it finds.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the above logic.\n\nPotential edge cases:\n\n- When the two candidates of length n-1 are the same. For example, if the input has two same strings of length n-1. For example, n=3, and the two strings of length 2 are \"aa\" and \"aa\". Then, trying both possibilities (A and B) would generate the same s_candidate. For example, A is \"aa\", B is \"aa\": s_candidate is \"aa\" + \"a\" (last character of B, which is \"a\") → \"aaa\".\n\nAnother case: when the two candidates are same, but the generated s_candidate is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the sample input 2, the correct s_candidate is \"aaa\". The input strings include two \"a\" and two \"aa\". For each input string, when checking if it is a prefix or suffix, it will be both, but the code will assign 'P' if it is a prefix. However, since the code needs to assign exactly n-1 P and S, but since the input list has exactly the prefixes and suffixes, the code will assign the correct counts.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nLet me outline the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead 2n-2 strings. Let's say input_list = [input().strip() for _ in range(2n-2)]\n\nThen, collect the two candidates of length n-1.\n\ncandidates = [s for s in input_list if len(s) == n-1]\n\nThen, for each possible pair (A, B) in candidates (there are two possibilities: (candidates[0], candidates[1]) and (candidates[1], candidates[0])):\n\n   generate s_candidate as A + B[-1]\n\n   check if the generated prefixes and suffixes match the input list.\n\n   if yes:\n\n      proceed to generate the answer.\n\nOnce found, proceed.\n\nBut how to check the generated prefixes and suffixes?\n\nImplement the is_valid function as discussed.\n\nBut in code:\n\ndef is_valid(s_candidate, input_list):\n\n    generated = []\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s_candidate)):\n\n        generated.append(s_candidate[:i])\n\n        generated.append(s_candidate[-i:])\n\n    # Now compare the Counter of generated and input_list\n\n    from collections import Counter\n\n    return Counter(generated) == Counter(input_list)\n\nBut note that len(s_candidate) is n, which is given.\n\nOnce we find a valid s_candidate, then for each string in input_list, check if it is a prefix of s_candidate. If yes, assign 'P', else 'S'.\n\nBut how to check for the prefix? For each string in input_list, check if s_candidate starts with it.\n\nSo:\n\nresult = []\n\nfor s in input_list:\n\n    if s_candidate.startswith(s):\n\n        result.append('P')\n\n    else:\n\n        result.append('S')\n\nThen, print ''.join(result)\n\nBut wait, what if the string is a suffix but not a prefix? Then, the code would assign 'S'.\n\nBut how can that happen? Because the input list is guaranteed to be valid, so for each string in input_list, it must be either a prefix or a suffix of s_candidate.\n\nBut for example, if the string is a suffix but not a prefix, then the code would assign 'S'.\n\nSo this approach is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut what if there are multiple candidates for s_candidate? For example, in the third sample input, the code may generate either \"ac\" or \"ca\" as the valid s_candidate. But in both cases, the code will generate a correct answer.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut how to handle the case where the two candidates are the same? For example, if the two candidates are same, then both possibilities generate the same s_candidate. So the code will process it once.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in code, for the candidates, we have two possibilities. So:\n\nfor a in candidates:\n\n    for b in candidates:\n\n        if a is not b:\n\n            generate s_candidate.\n\nBut since there are exactly two candidates, and they can be same or different. However, in the case where the two candidates are same, the code would generate the same s_candidate for both possibilities.\n\nBut to avoid redundant checks, perhaps better to check both possibilities (A as prefix, B as suffix) and (B as prefix, A as suffix), even if A and B are same.\n\nBut in code, for the candidates list, which is of length 2, we can generate the two possibilities:\n\nfor a, b in [(candidates[0], candidates[1]), (candidates[1], candidates[0])]:\n\n    generate s_candidate = a + b[-1]\n\n    check if valid.\n\nOnce a valid one is found, proceed.\n\nBut in code, the code may generate the same s_candidate twice. But in that case, the code will check it twice, but once it's found valid, it will proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut let's code it.\n\nNow, let's test with the first sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=5\n\ninput_list is:\n\nba\n\na\n\nabab\n\na\n\naba\n\nbaba\n\nab\n\naba\n\nThe candidates are the two strings of length 4 (n-1=4). Looking at the input list, the strings of length 4 are \"abab\" and \"baba\".\n\nSo, for the first possibility:\n\na is \"abab\", b is \"baba\". s_candidate is \"abab\" + \"a\" → \"ababa\".\n\nCheck if the generated prefixes and suffixes match the input list.\n\nThe generated prefixes and suffixes for \"ababa\" (n=5):\n\nprefixes of length 1: a\n\nprefixes of length 2: ab\n\nprefixes of length 3: aba\n\nprefixes of length 4: abab\n\nsuffixes of length 1: a\n\nsuffixes of length 2: ba\n\nsuffixes of length 3: aba\n\nsuffixes of length 4: baba\n\nSo the generated list is:\n\na, ab, aba, abab, a, ba, aba, baba.\n\nBut the input list is:\n\n['ba', 'a', 'abab', 'a', 'aba', 'baba', 'ab', 'aba']\n\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct string `s` based on the given prefixes and suffixes and then assigning each input string as either a prefix or a suffix accordingly.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Candidates**: Extract the two strings of length `n-1` from the input. These strings are potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix of the unknown string `s`.\n2. **Generate Candidate Strings**: For each pair of these candidates, generate potential strings `s` by combining the prefix candidate with the last character of the suffix candidate and vice versa.\n3. **Validate Candidate String**: Check if the generated candidate string `s` has all the required prefixes and suffixes matching the input list.\n4. **Determine Assignments**: Once the valid string `s` is identified, check each input string to see if it is a prefix or suffix of `s` and assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    input_list = [sys.stdin.readline().strip() for _ in range(2 * n - 2)]\n    \n    # Find the two candidates of length n-1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in input_list:\n        if len(s) == n - 1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try both possibilities for the two candidates\n    for a, b in [(candidates[0], candidates[1]), (candidates[1], candidates[0])]:\n        s_candidate = a + b[-1]\n        # Generate all prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate\n        generated = []\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            generated.append(s_candidate[:i])\n            generated.append(s_candidate[-i:])\n        # Compare with input_list using Counter\n        if Counter(generated) == Counter(input_list):\n            # Found the correct s_candidate\n            result = []\n            for s in input_list:\n                if s_candidate.startswith(s):\n                    result.append('P')\n                else:\n                    result.append('S')\n            print(''.join(result))\n            return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in a list. The first line gives the length `n` of the unknown string `s`.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix of `s`.\n3. **Generating Candidate Strings**: For each combination of these candidates, a potential string `s` is generated by appending the last character of the suffix candidate to the prefix candidate.\n4. **Validation**: The generated string `s` is validated by checking if all its prefixes and suffixes match the input list using a counter to ensure frequency matches.\n5. **Assignment**: Once a valid string `s` is found, each input string is checked to determine if it is a prefix or suffix of `s`, and the corresponding 'P' or 'S' is assigned.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignments while adhering to the constraints and requirements of the problem.",
