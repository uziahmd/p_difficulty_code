He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that a string is formed in a specific way. Let me break down the steps:\n\nInitially, A has a string with some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's to the end, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's. The number of 'c's added must be equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string at that point. Also, it's possible that the count of 'c's equals both.\n\nOur task is to check if a given string could have been formed through this process.\n\nSo, for the given string S, we need to determine if it meets these conditions.\n\nLet me think about the steps required to check this.\n\nFirst, the string must consist of only 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. But the input is guaranteed to have only those, so maybe we don't need to check that.\n\nBut the structure of the string must be such that:\n\n- All 'a's come before 'b's, which come before 'c's. Because A's string is all 'a's, then B adds 'b's to the end. Then C adds 'c's to the end. So the string must be a sequence of a's followed by b's followed by c's. If there's any 'c's before 'b's or 'a's, that's invalid.\n\nSo first, check the order. For example, the string 'bbacc' would have 'a's after 'b's, but then 'c's. But the original process requires that after B adds the 'b's, the string is a's followed by b's. Then C adds c's. So the entire string must be a's, then b's, then c's. So any occurrence of a 'c' before a 'b' or 'a' would be invalid.\n\nSo first step: check that the string is in the form a* b* c*. So all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. If that's not the case, return NO.\n\nFor example, the second example input is 'bbacc'. Let's see: the letters are b, b, a, c, c. The 'a' comes after 'b's, which violates the order. So that's invalid. Hence output is NO.\n\nSo first, we need to check that the string is composed of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. How can I check that?\n\nWe can iterate through the string and check that the characters are non-decreasing in terms of their order. For example, 'a' comes before 'b', which comes before 'c'. So the string should not have any 'b's followed by 'a's, or 'c's followed by 'a's or 'b's.\n\nSo for the string, the order must be a's, then b's, then c's. So the first part is all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, then we can proceed to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts. Let's denote:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's.\n\nNow, according to the process:\n\nAfter A and B have done their steps, the string has count_a 'a's and count_b 'b's. Then C adds count_c 'c's. And count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b (or both).\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when C appends the 'c's, the number of 'c's is equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string at that time. At that time, the string has count_a 'a's and count_b 'b's. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo for the entire string, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, the initial steps require that after A and B, there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. So count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nThe conditions are:\n\n1. The string is in the form a* b* c*.\n\n2. count_a >= 1, count_b >=1.\n\n3. count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf all these are true, then output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string has only a's and c's? Like, suppose the string is 'aabc'? Wait, no, because according to the process, B must add at least one 'b'. So the string must have at",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string can be formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. The string must be structured such that all 'a's come first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must match either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: Ensure the string is composed of a block of 'a's, followed by a block of 'b's, and then a block of 'c's. This ensures the string follows the required order.\n2. **Count Validation**: Verify that there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' in the string, as per the problem constraints.\n3. **C Count Check**: Ensure the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check if the string is in the form a*b*c*\n    prev_char = ''\n    for char in s:\n        if char == 'a':\n            if prev_char not in ('', 'a'):\n                return False\n        elif char == 'b':\n            if prev_char not in ('', 'a', 'b'):\n                return False\n        elif char == 'c':\n            if prev_char not in ('', 'a', 'b', 'c'):\n                return False\n        prev_char = char\n\n    # Count the number of a, b, c\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    # Check if there is at least one a and one b\n    if count_a < 1 or count_b < 1:\n        return False\n\n    # Check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b\n    if count_c != count_a and count_c != count_b:\n        return False\n\n    return True\n\n# Read input and process\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    if is_valid_string(input_str):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The function `is_valid_string` iterates through each character of the string to ensure that the characters follow the order 'a' followed by 'b' followed by 'c'. If any character breaks this sequence, the function returns `False`.\n2. **Count Validation**: After confirming the order, the counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c' are determined. The presence of at least one 'a' and one 'b' is checked.\n3. **C Count Check**: The number of 'c's must match either the count of 'a's or 'b's. If this condition is met, the function returns `True`, indicating the string is valid according to the problem's constraints.\n\nThis approach ensures that all conditions specified in the problem are checked efficiently, leading to the correct determination of whether the string can be formed by the described process.",
