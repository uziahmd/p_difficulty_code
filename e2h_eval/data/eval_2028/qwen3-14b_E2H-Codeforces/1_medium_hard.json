    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, the i-th ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the next inner rectangle is 2 less in width and height. Wait, no. Let's think: the first ring is the outermost layer. For example, if the original plate is w x h, then the first ring is the perimeter. The perimeter's area is calculated as 2*(w + h - 2), because for a rectangle, the perimeter in cells would be 2*(width + height) - 4 (since the four corners are counted twice). Wait, maybe another way: for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*m + 2*(n-2) = 2*(m + n) - 4. Because the top and bottom rows have n cells each, and the left and right columns (excluding the top and bottom) have (m-2) cells each. So total is 2n + 2(m-2) = 2(n + m - 2).\n\nBut for each ring i, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, the first ring is when i=1. Then the rectangle is w x h. But the ring is the perimeter of that rectangle. Then for the second ring, it's the perimeter of a rectangle that is (w - 4*(2-1)) = w-4, and same for h. Wait, but why subtract 4? Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side. Like, for the first ring, the next inner rectangle would be (w-2*2) by (h-2*2)? Wait, no. Let's think: the first ring is the perimeter of the original rectangle. The next ring is two cells away from the edge. So, imagine that after removing the first ring (the perimeter), the next ring would be the perimeter of the rectangle that is 2 cells inwards. So, for example, if original width is w, then after removing 2 cells from left and right, the new width is w - 2*2 = w-4. Similarly for height. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1))? Wait, for i=1, it's w and h. For i=2, it's w-4*(1) and h-4*(1). So yes. So for each ring i, we calculate the perimeter of that rectangle, and sum all those perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how does that work? For example, the first ring is the border of the original rectangle. The second ring is the border of a rectangle that's 4*(i-1) smaller. So for i=2, it's 4*(1) = 4. So the rectangle is (w-4) × (h-4). But the ring is the border of that rectangle. So the number of cells for each ring is the perimeter of that rectangle.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating the sum of perimeters for each of the k rings. But wait, the perimeter for each ring is 2*( (width) + (height) - 2 ), as discussed earlier. Because for a rectangle of m rows and n columns, the perimeter is 2*(m + n) - 4. Because 2*(m + n) counts each side, but the four corners are counted twice. So subtracting 4 gives the correct count.\n\nWait, let me take an example. For a 3x3 rectangle. The perimeter is 3*4 - 4 = 8? Wait, 3x3. The perimeter would be the outer cells. The total cells in the perimeter would be 3*4 - 4 (since the four corners are counted twice). Wait 3*4 is 12, minus 4 is 8. Which matches the first example input where 3 3 1 gives output 8. So yes.\n\nSo for each ring i, the perimeter is 2*( (current_width + current_height) - 2 ). Where current_width is w - 4*(i-1), current_height is h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for each ring, the perimeter is 2*(current_width + current_height - 2). So for each i from 1 to k, we compute that and sum them all.\n\nBut we need to make sure that for each i, the current_width and current_height are at least 3? Because otherwise, the rectangle can't have a perimeter. Wait, but according to the input constraints, k is such that it's up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, if w and h are 3, then min is 3. (3+1)/4 is 1, floor is 1. So k can be 1. Which is correct because for i=1, the rectangle is 3x3, which has a perimeter. For i=2, the rectangle would be 3-4*(2-1) = 3-4= -1, which is invalid. But the input constraints ensure that k is chosen such that for all i up to k, the rectangles are valid. So we don't have to worry about negative dimensions.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nsum all perimeters.\n\nBut wait, let me check the examples.\n\nFirst example input is 3 3 1. So current_w =3, current_h=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input is 7 9 1. So current_w=7, current_h=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example input is 7 9 2. So for i=1, perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 28. For i=2, current_w = 7-4*(1) =3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the sample output.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: loop from 1 to k, calculate for each i the current_w and current_h, compute the perimeter, add to the total.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement this?\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nfor i in 1..k:\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nreturn total\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? Well, according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. For example, the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me check for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. For i=1, current_w and current_h are 3 and ... Well, if w and h are 3, then for i=1, it's 3,3. For i=2, 3-4*(1) = -1, but k can't be 2. So the input constraints ensure that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Or maybe not. Let me think.\n\nWait, the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think for example, if min(w, h) is 5. Then (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can be 1. For i=1, current_w and current_h are 5-0=5, which is okay. If min(w, h) is 7, then (7+1)/4 is 2. So k can be 2. For i=2, current_w =7-4*(1) =3, which is okay. So for i=2, the current_w and current_h are 3 and ... Well, if the other dimension is >=3. So the input constraints ensure that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Let me see:\n\nLet me think for the maximum possible k. Let's suppose that min(w, h) is m. Then k is up to floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let's take m= 3. Then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k=1. For i=1, current_w and current_h are w - 4*(0) =w, which is >=3. Similarly for h. For m=7, k can be 2. For i=2, current_w is w -4*(1) =w-4. Since m is min(w, h) =7, so say w is 7, then current_w is 7-4=3. Which is okay. For i=3, it would be 7-4*2=7-8=-1, but k is 2. So the input constraints ensure that for all i up to k, current_w and current_h are >=3? Because for the maximum k allowed, the i-th step would be:\n\ncurrent_w = w -4*(i-1) >= 3?\n\nBecause when k is floor( (m +1)/4 ), then for i=k, 4*(k-1) <= m - 3 ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think. Let's take m=7, which is min(w, h). Then (m +1)/4 = 8/4=2. So k can be 2. For i=2, the current_w is m -4*(i-1) =7 -4*(1) =3. Which is okay. Now if m=8, then (8+1)/4= 2.25, floor is 2. So for i=2, current_w is 8-4*(1) =4, which is okay. For m=9, (9+1)/4=2.5, floor 2. i=2: 9-4*(1) =5. So okay. So for the maximum k allowed, the current_w and current_h would be >=3. Because for m being the min(w, h), and k is floor( (m +1)/4 ), then for i= k, 4*(k-1) <= m - 3 ?\n\nLet me see: Let's suppose that k is floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let me take m=3, then k=1. Then 4*(1-1) =0 <= 3-3=0. Yes. For m=4, (4+1)/4=1.25, floor 1. So k=1. 4*(1-1) =0 <= 4-3=1. Yes. For m=5, (5+1)/4=1.5, floor 1. 4*(1-1)=0 <=5-3=2. Yes. For m=6, (6+1)/4=1.75, floor 1. 0 <=6-3=3. Yes. For m=7, (7+1)/4=2, floor 2. Then for i=2, 4*(2-1)=4. m-3=7-3=4. So 4<=4. So yes. For m=8, (8+1)/4=2.25, floor 2. i=2, 4*(2-1)=4 <=8-3=5. Yes. So for the maximum k, the current_w and current_h would be m -4*(k-1) >=3. Because m -4*(k-1) >=3 ?\n\nBecause since k is floor( (m +1)/4 ), then (m +1)/4 >=k. So m+1 >=4k. So m >=4k -1. Then for i=k, m -4*(k-1) >= 4k-1 -4(k-1) = 4k-1 -4k +4 = 3. So yes. So m -4*(k-1) >=3. So the current_w and current_h will be >=3. So for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3. Thus, the perimeters are valid.\n\nTherefore, the code can proceed as described.\n\nNow, coding in Python. Read the input line as three integers. Then loop for each i from 1 to k, compute current_w and current_h, add 2*(current_w + current_h -2) to the total.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst sample input: 3 3 1. The code computes current_w=3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: 7 9 1. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: 7 9 2. First iteration i=1: 7,9 → 28. Second iteration i=2: current_w =7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say, w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. If k=2, then for i=2, current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. Wait, but that would be 1x1. But according to the constraints, k is floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). For min(w,h)=5, (5+1)/4=1.5 → floor 1. So k can't be 2. So the code is safe.\n\nAnother example: w=7, h=7, k=2. Then for i=1: 7x7 → perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24. i=2: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. total is 24+8=32.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly. Now, code-wise, the only thing is to read the input. The input is given as three integers on one line. So in Python:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute as above.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Let me write it.\n",
