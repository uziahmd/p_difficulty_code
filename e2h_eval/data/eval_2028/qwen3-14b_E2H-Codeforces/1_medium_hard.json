The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, for the i-th ring. So for each ring, we need to calculate the perimeter of that rectangle and sum them all up.\n\nWait, but how do you calculate the number of cells in a ring? For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. For example, a rectangle of 3x3: perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (the four corners counted twice) → 8, which matches the first example input where output is 8.\n\nSo for each ring i from 1 to k, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all these perimeters.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that each subsequent ring is possible. For example, if the original w and h are such that after subtracting 4*(i-1) from both, the dimensions are still at least 3? Well, the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ), which probably ensures that for each i up to k, the dimensions are valid. So we don't have to check that.\n\nSo the plan is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum all those perimeters.\n\nLet me test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. The first ring is the perimeter of 3x3. Which is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. The perimeter is 2*(7 + 9 - 2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example input: 7 9 2. First ring is 7x9 → perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 28. Second ring is (7 - 4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1)=5. So 3x5. Perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total is 28 + 12 = 40. Which matches the sample output. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the formula is correct. Now, how to implement this?\n\nThe code needs to read w, h, k. Then for each i from 1 to k, compute the current width and height. For each i, current_w = w - 4*(i-1), current_h = h - 4*(i-1). Then compute perimeter as 2*(current_w + current_h - 2). Sum all these.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead input line as three integers.\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nLoop for i in 1..k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nReturn total.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. Because the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then floor((3+1)/4) = 1. So k can be 1. For that case, when i=1, the current_w and current_h are 3 - 0 = 3, and same for h. So for i=1, it's okay. For i=2, it would be 3 - 4*(1) = -1, but since k is limited, that's not allowed.\n\nSo the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the code would be straightforward.\n\nNow, let's code that.\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k. Then loop from 1 to k, compute each perimeter.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nFirst input: 3 3 1 → 2*(3+3-2) = 8 → correct.\n\nSecond input: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 28 → correct.\n\nThird input: 7 9 2 → first iteration i=1: 7,9 → perimeter 2*(7+9-2) = 28. i=2: 7-4=3, 9-4=5 → 2*(3+5-2) = 12. Total 28+12=40 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=2. Then first ring: 5x5 → perimeter 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Second ring: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. Wait, but the rectangle is 1x1. Then perimeter would be 2*(1+1-2) = 0? That's a problem. But according to the input constraints, k is up to floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). For min(w,h) =5, floor( (5+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can't be 2. So the code will not have such cases.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k. Then sum for each i in 1..k the perimeters.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead input line as w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but in Python, the input is read as a single line. So for example, the input could be given as '3 3 1' etc.\n\nSo code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute as above.\n\nYes.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nLet me test another example. Let's take the third sample input: 7 9 2. Let's compute:\n\ni=1: current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. i=2: current_w =7-4=3, current_h=9-4=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: say w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: say w=7, h=7, k=2. Then first ring is 7x7 → perimeter 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24. Second ring: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Total 24+8=32.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells that will be gilded on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that it forms a border around an inner rectangle, starting from the edge of the plate and moving inward by two cells for each subsequent ring.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Ring Structure**: Each ring is essentially the perimeter of a rectangle. For the i-th ring, the dimensions of the rectangle are reduced by 4*(i-1) from both the width and height of the original plate. This is because each ring reduces the effective dimensions by 2 cells on each side (left, right, top, bottom), hence 4 cells in total for each ring.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: The perimeter of a rectangle of width `w` and height `h` is calculated as `2 * (w + h - 2)`. This formula accounts for the four sides of the rectangle while avoiding double-counting the corners.\n3. **Summing Perimeters**: For each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the corresponding rectangle and sum these values to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers representing the width (`w`), height (`h`), and the number of rings (`k`).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, calculate the adjusted width and height by subtracting 4*(i-1) from the original dimensions.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each adjusted dimension, compute the perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)`.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring once, ensuring a time complexity of O(k), which is optimal given the constraints.",
