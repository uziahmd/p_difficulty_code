There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about examples. For n=2, there's only one game, so the answer is 1. For n=3, the winner can play two games. How? Like, first beat player 2, then player 3. But wait, when the winner plays the second game, the other player (player 3) has zero games played. The winner has one game already. The difference is one, which is allowed. So that's okay. So output is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the answer is 2. Wait, why can't the winner play three games? Let's see. Let's think about the structure. If the winner plays three games, that would require that each time they play, the opponent has either the same number of games or differs by one. Let's imagine the winner starts with player 2. Then they have one game. Then they need to play someone else. But for the next game, the opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. Suppose the winner plays against player 3. Then after that, the winner has 2 games. Now, to play a third game, the opponent must have 1 or 2 games. But the only remaining player is player 4, who hasn't played yet. So the difference is 2 games (winner has 2, opponent has 0). That's not allowed. Hence, the maximum is 2 games. So the answer is 2 for n=4.\n\nSo the question is, how to model this. What's the pattern here?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that the maximum number of games the winner can play is k. Then, for each game the winner plays, they must have opponents that are structured in a way that allows them to meet the condition.\n\nWait, maybe this is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because, for the winner to play k games, they must have defeated k opponents. Each of those opponents must have been in a subtree where their maximum games is at most k-1, and so on. Let me think. For example, the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the largest k such that the Fibonacci(k+2) is less than or equal to n. Because each time the winner plays a game, they need to have opponents that have a certain number of games. \n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider that for the winner to play k games, the minimum number of players required is the (k+2)th Fibonacci number. Let me check with the examples. \n\nFor example, when k=1: the minimum players is 2 (Fibonacci(3) = 2). Which matches the first example. For k=2: the minimum players is 3 (Fibonacci(4)=3). Which matches the second example. For k=3, the minimum players would be 5 (Fibonacci(5) = 5). So if n is 5, the answer is 3. Let's see. Let's imagine the structure. The winner plays 3 games. Let's think about how that works. First, the winner plays someone (game 1). Then, in the next game, they play someone who has played once (so they can have a difference of 0). How does that happen? Maybe the winner's path requires that each round, the opponents are arranged in a way that their previous games are balanced.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a binary tree. Each game the winner plays, they must have an opponent. For the winner to have played k games, each of those games must have opponents that themselves have a certain number of games. \n\nThis seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence. For example, to have a player reach k games, the total number of players needed is Fib(k+2). Because, for each step, the winner needs to have a certain number of players in their path. Let me think recursively. Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games. Then, for the first game, the winner plays one player. Then, for the next game, the winner has to have an opponent who has played either 0 or 1 games. But to get to the second game, the opponent must have played 1 game (since the winner has already played 1 game). So that opponent must have had their own game. So for the second game, the winner's opponent must have come from a subtree where they played 1 game. So the total players needed for the winner to play 2 games is 1 (the initial opponent) + f(1) (the players needed for the opponent's path). Since f(1) is 2 (the initial game). Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.\n\nAlternatively, think of f(k) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games. Then, for the winner to play k games, they must have played in the first game, then in the second, etc. For the k-th game, the opponent must have played either k-1 or k-2 games. But to maximize the number of games, the winner would have to have opponents that have played as many games as possible. So, for the winner's k-th game, the opponent must have played k-1 games. But that opponent must have had their own path of k-1 games. Therefore, the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because, the winner's path requires that in the first game, they have an opponent (which requires f(1) players?), and then for the next steps... Hmm, maybe this is the Fibonacci sequence. Let's try:\n\nBase cases:\n\nf(0) = 1? (if the winner has played 0 games, there's only one player, but that's not possible since the tournament starts with n players. Maybe I need to adjust the base cases.)\n\nWait, for k=1: the winner plays one game. So there are two players. So f(1) = 2.\n\nFor k=2: the winner plays two games. To do that, the first game is against one player, and the second game is against another player who has played one game. So that player's path requires that he has played one game, which requires two players. So the total number of players is 2 (for the first game) + 2 (for the second game's opponent's path) - 1 (since the winner is counted in both parts?) Or maybe it's f(2) = f(1) + f(1) ?\n\nWait, for the first game, the winner plays against someone. Then, for the second game, the winner must play against someone who has played one game. That someone must have come from a subtree where they played one game. So that subtree requires f(1) players. So the total players would be f(1) + f(1) = 2 + 2 = 4? But in the example where n=3, the answer is 2. Which suggests that for k=2, the minimal number of players is 3. So my previous reasoning is wrong.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the formula is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Let's see:\n\nLet's define f(k) as the minimal number of players needed for the winner to play k games.\n\nFor k=1: f(1)=2.\n\nFor k=2: the winner has to play two games. The first game is against one player (so 2 players). Then, for the second game, the opponent must have played 1 game. So that opponent's subtree must have f(1) = 2 players. But the winner is part of that subtree. Wait, perhaps the total players is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Let me think again.\n\nLet me take the example of k=2. For the winner to play two games, the first game is against one player (so 2 players). Then, the second game is against someone who has played one game. That someone must have a subtree of players that allows them to have played one game. So that's f(1) players. However, the winner is already part of that subtree. So maybe the total is f(1) + f(1) - 1? Like, 2 + 2 - 1 = 3. Which matches the case where n=3 gives k=2. \n\nSo perhaps f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2) - 1? Or maybe f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Let me think for k=2.\n\nIf f(2) = f(1) + f(0). What's f(0)? If the winner plays zero games, that's just one player. So f(0) = 1. Then f(1) = f(0) + f(-1) ? No, that's not making sense. Maybe the recurrence is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2), with base cases f(0)=1, f(1)=2.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1) = 2\n\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 2 + 1 = 3. Which matches the case where for n=3, the answer is 2.\n\nFor k=3, f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5. So if n is 5, the answer is 3. Let's check. How can the winner play 3 games? Let's imagine:\n\nFirst game: beats player 2. Second game: beats player 3 (who has played one game). Third game: beats player 4 (who has played two games). Wait, but how does player 4 get to have two games? Well, maybe the structure is such that the winner's opponents are arranged in a way that each step allows for the required number of games.\n\nBut for n=5, the answer would be 3. So for n=5, the maximum is 3. Then for n=6, the answer would be 3 as well, since the minimal required for 3 is 5, and 6 is more than 5. But for n=8, which is larger than f(4)=f(3)+f(2) = 5 + 3 = 8. So f(4) = 8. So for n=8, the answer is 4. So the maximum number of games is the largest k such that f(k) ≤ n.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k where f(k) ≤ n, where f(k) is the Fibonacci sequence starting with f(0)=1, f(1)=2, f(2)=3, f(3)=5, f(4)=8, etc. Wait, because f(k) is the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games. So for a given n, the maximum k is the largest such that f(k) ≤ n.\n\nSo the approach is to generate this Fibonacci sequence until the value exceeds n. Then, the answer is the largest k for which f(k) ≤n.\n\nLet me test this with the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 2: n=3. The f(k) sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5... So for k=2, f(2)=3. So answer is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample input 4: n=4. The f(2)=3, f(3)=5. So 4 is between f(2) and f(3). So the maximum k is 2, which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nAnother sample: n=10. Let's compute the sequence:\n\nf(0) =1\n\nf(1)=2\n\nf(2)=3\n\nf(3)=5\n\nf(4)=8\n\nf(5)=13.\n\nSo for n=10, the largest k is 4 (f(4)=8 ≤10). So answer is 4. Which matches the sample output of 4. So that's correct.\n\nSo the problem becomes: find the maximum k where f(k) ≤n, where f(k) is defined as f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2), with f(0)=1, f(1)=2.\n\nSo the plan is to generate this sequence up to the point where the next term exceeds n, and then find the maximum k.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need to generate the sequence until the term exceeds n. For example, for n=1e18, the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so the number of terms will be around O( log n ), which is manageable.\n\nSo the algorithm steps:\n\n- Initialize variables a = 1 (f(0)), b = 2 (f(1)), k=1.\n\n- While the next term (a + b) is <= n:\n\n   - compute next term c = a + b.\n\n   - increment k by 1.\n\n   - set a = b, b = c.\n\n- The maximum k is the answer.\n\nWait, let's think. For example, for n=2:\n\nInitially, a=1 (f(0)), b=2 (f(1)), k=1. The next term is 3. Since 3>2, the loop doesn't run. So the answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nFor n=3, the next term is 3 (a=1, b=2, c=3). Since 3<=3, we increment k to 2, then a becomes 2, b becomes 3. Now, next term is 5. Which is larger than 3. So the answer is 2. Correct.\n\nFor n=4, the next term is 3 (c=3) which is <=4. So k increases to 2, a becomes 2, b becomes 3. Then next term is 5, which is larger than 4. So answer is 2. Correct.\n\nFor n=5: the next term is 3, then 5. So during the loop, after c=3, k becomes 2, then a=2, b=3. Then next term is 5 (a + b = 2+3=5). Since 5<=5, k becomes 3. Then a=3, b=5. Next term is 8>5. So answer is 3.\n\nYes. So the code should work.\n\nSo the code needs to read n, and compute this sequence.\n\nNow, handling n=1? Well, according to the problem statement, n starts from 2. So no need to handle n=1.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nInitialize a=1, b=2, k=1.\n\nWhile True:\n\n   next_c = a + b.\n\n   if next_c >n: break.\n\n   else:\n\n      k +=1\n\n      a, b = b, next_c\n\nreturn k.\n\nWait, but for example, when n=2, the initial a=1, b=2. next_c is 3, which is >2. So loop breaks. return k=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example, n=3: next_c is 3, which is <=3. So k becomes 2. Then next_c is 2+3=5>3. So return 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example, n=5: after first step, next_c is 3, which is <=5. So k becomes 2, a=2, b=3. Then next_c is 5. Which is <=5. So k becomes 3, a=3, b=5. Then next_c is 8>5. So return 3. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nSo the Python code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nHandle n=2: returns 1.\n\nElse:\n\nInitialize a=1, b=2, k=1.\n\nLoop:\n\nnext_c = a + b.\n\nif next_c >n: break.\n\nelse:\n\nk +=1\n\na, b = b, next_c\n\nreturn k.\n\nWait, but what about n=1? Well, the problem says n starts from 2.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n as integer.\n\nif n < 2: ... but according to problem statement, n is >=2.\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n == 1:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    a, b = 1, 2\n\n    k = 1\n\n    while True:\n\n        c = a + b\n\n        if c > n:\n\n            break\n\n        k +=1\n\n        a, b = b, c\n\n    print(k)\n\nWait, let's test with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 2: 3 → output 2. Let's see:\n\nn=3.\n\na=1, b=2, k=1.\n\nc=3, which is equal to n. So k becomes 2. Then a becomes 2, b becomes 3. Next loop: c = 2+3=5>3. Break. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample input 4: n=4. The code:\n\na=1, b=2, k=1.\n\nc=3 <=4 → k=2, a=2, b=3.\n\nc=5>4 → break. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample input 10: n=10.\n\nLet's track:\n\nInitial a=1, b=2, k=1.\n\nc=3 ≤10 → k=2, a=2, b=3.\n\nc=5 ≤10 → k=3, a=3, b=5.\n\nc=8 ≤10 → k=4, a=5, b=8.\n\nc=13>10 → break. So output is 4. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: n=5. Output is 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=8. The code would generate:\n\nAfter steps:\n\nk=1, a=1, b=2.\n\nc=3 → k=2, a=2, b=3.\n\nc=5 → k=3, a=3, b=5.\n\nc=8 → k=4, a=5, b=8.\n\nc=13>8 → break. So output is 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works for all these cases.\n\nSo this should be the solution. Now, implement it in Python.\n\nBut wait, what about n=2?\n\nn=2: the code starts with a=1, b=2, k=1. c=3>2 → break. Output is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=6. The sequence is 1,2,3,5,8. So for n=6, the maximum k is 3 (since 5<=6, but next is 8>6). So output is 3.\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Python code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can participate in, given a specific rule about the number of games each player has already played. The solution involves understanding the structure of the tournament and leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key rule is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. This constraint leads us to consider the structure of the tournament in terms of a binary tree where each node represents a game.\n2. **Fibonacci Insight**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a Fibonacci-like sequence. This is because each game the winner plays requires an opponent who has played a certain number of games, leading to a recursive structure similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n3. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: We generate Fibonacci numbers until the value exceeds the given number of players `n`. The maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na, b = 1, 2\nk = 1\nwhile True:\n    c = a + b\n    if c > n:\n        break\n    k += 1\n    a, b = b, c\nprint(k)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the first two Fibonacci numbers, `a = 1` (representing the minimum players for 0 games) and `b = 2` (representing the minimum players for 1 game).\n2. **Loop to Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: Continuously generate the next Fibonacci number `c` by summing the previous two numbers `a` and `b`. If `c` exceeds `n`, stop the loop.\n3. **Track Maximum Games**: For each valid Fibonacci number generated (i.e., less than or equal to `n`), increment the count of maximum games `k`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance even for very large values of `n` up to $10^{18}$. The complexity is logarithmic in terms of `n`, making it highly efficient.",
