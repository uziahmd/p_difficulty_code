Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position.\n\nFirst, I should think about how to model this problem. The key idea is probably to look at the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum required d for those gaps. Because if there's a gap between two lanterns, the worst case is the middle of that gap. For example, if two lanterns are at positions a and b (with a < b), then the maximum distance from either lantern to the middle point would be (b - a)/2. But wait, that's only if the lanterns are covering the entire street. However, we also need to consider the ends of the street. Like, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position minus d must be covered. Similarly for the end at l.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in ascending order.\n2. Check the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. The required d for this part is (first_lantern_pos - 0). Because the lantern's coverage must reach 0. So if the first lantern is at position a, then the distance from 0 to a is a. So d must be at least a. Wait no, because the lantern's coverage extends d units in both directions. So if the first lantern is at a, then the leftmost point it can cover is a - d. To cover 0, we need a - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a. But that's only if a is not zero. If a is zero, then d can be zero here. But since the problem says d is positive, but maybe the answer can be zero? No, the problem says d is a positive number. Wait, but in the input, the lanterns can be at the ends. For example, in the second sample input, the lanterns are at 2 and 5. The street is length 5, so 0 to 5. The first lantern is at 2. The distance from 0 to 2 is 2. So the first lantern's coverage must reach 0, which requires d ≥ 2. But the second lantern is at 5, which covers up to 5 + d. But since the street ends at 5, the d here is 0. But that's not the case. Wait, the lantern's coverage is up to d distance from it. So for the lantern at 5, the coverage is from 5 - d to 5 + d. But since the street ends at 5, the coverage on the street is up to 5. So for the end of the street, the required d is (l - last_lantern_pos). Because the lantern's coverage needs to reach l. So for the last lantern at position b, l must be ≤ b + d → d ≥ l - b.\n\nSo the initial steps are:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the maximum between the first lantern's position (since 0 needs to be covered) and (l - last lantern's position).\n- Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum gap between consecutive lanterns is divided by 2. Because the worst point is the middle of the gap. For example, if two lanterns are at positions a and b (a < b), the middle is at (a + b)/2. The distance from a to this point is (b - a)/2. Similarly from b. So the required d for this gap is (b - a)/2. So the maximum of all these values would be the required d for the gaps between lanterns.\n\nSo the overall answer is the maximum between the first part (the start and end) and the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1, l=10. The lantern is at position 5. Then the required d is max(5, 10 -5, (gap between consecutive lanterns... but there are none). So the max between 5 and 5 (since l - last is 5). So the maximum is 5. Which is correct because the lantern's coverage must reach 0 and 10. So d must be 5.\n\nSo the algorithm steps are:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute initial_max = max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen, for each i from 1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_required = current_gap / 2\n\nif current",
