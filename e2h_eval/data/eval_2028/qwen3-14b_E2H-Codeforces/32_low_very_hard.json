    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. So, when I remove one element, I want to minimize this difference. \n\nFirst, let's think about the original array. The instability is max(a) - min(a). But when we remove one element, the new max and min could be different. For example, if the original array has elements [1, 3, 3, 7], the original instability is 7-1=6. If we remove 7, the new array is [1,3,3], so instability is 3-1=2. Which is better than removing any other element. \n\nSo the key is to find which element to remove such that the new max and min are as close as possible. \n\nBut how do I efficiently compute this for large arrays (up to 1e5 elements)?\n\nLet me think: For each element, when we remove it, the new max and min would be the max and min of the remaining elements. But computing this naively for each element would take O(n^2) time, which is not feasible for n=1e5.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, the original array's max and min are known. Let's sort the array first. Because when the array is sorted, the max is the last element, and the min is the first. \n\nIf I sort the array, then for each element, when I remove it, the new max and min would be:\n\nIf the element removed is not the first or last element, then the new max and min are still the same as the original array. Wait no. Wait, suppose the array is sorted. Let's say the array is sorted as a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1]. If I remove a[i], then the new min is a[0] unless i=0. Similarly, the new max is a[n-1] unless i = n-1. \n\nSo for example, if the array is sorted, then removing any element except the first or last would leave the min and max as the original ones. However, if we remove the first element, the new min is a[1], and the max remains a[n-1]. Similarly, if we remove the last element, the new max is a[n-2], and the min is a[0].\n\nSo in this case, the instability after removing an element can be calculated as follows:\n\nIf we remove the first element (i=0), then the instability is a[-1] - a[1].\n\nIf we remove the last element (i = n-1), then the instability is a[-2] - a[0].\n\nIf we remove any other element (i not 0 or n-1), the instability is a[-1] - a[0], which is the original instability. \n\nWait, but that's only if the original array's min and max are a[0] and a[-1]. Which they are, since the array is sorted. \n\nSo in this case, the minimal instability would be the minimum between:\n\n- The original instability (if we remove any element except first or last)\n- The instability when removing the first element (a[-1] - a[1])\n- The instability when removing the last element (a[-2] - a[0])\n\nWait, but that's only considering the cases where the element removed is the first or last. Because if you remove any other element, the min and max remain the same. Therefore, the instability is the same as the original. So the minimal possible instability would be the minimum between the original instability (if you remove any element that's not first or last) and the two options of removing the first or last element.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple elements with the same value as the min or max?\n\nFor example, consider the array [1, 1, 3, 3]. The original instability is 3-1=2. If we remove one of the 1s, the new array's min is 1 (since there's another 1), and the max is 3. So instability is still 2. Similarly, if we remove one of the 3s, the instability is 3-1=2. So in this case, the minimal instability is 2, which is the same as the original. \n\nSo in this case, removing any element except the first or last (but in this case, the first and last are 1 and 3, but others are 1 and 3) would not change the instability. So the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum between the original instability (if you remove any element except the first or last) and the two options of removing first or last.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently determining the potential minima and maxima when elements are removed.\n2. **Evaluate Instability for Edge Cases**: When considering the removal of the first or last element, the instability can be calculated by adjusting the minima or maxima accordingly.\n3. **Compare Possibilities**: The minimal instability can be found by comparing the instability after removing the first element, the last element, or any other element (which would leave the original instability unchanged).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    \n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    \n    # If we remove the first element\n    instability = a[-1] - a[1]\n    min_instability = min(min_instability, instability)\n    \n    # If we remove the last element\n    instability = a[-2] - a[0]\n    min_instability = min(min_instability, instability)\n    \n    # If we remove any other element, the instability remains a[-1] - a[0]\n    # So compare with the original instability\n    original_instability = a[-1] - a[0]\n    min_instability = min(min_instability, original_instability)\n    \n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Array**: Sorting allows us to easily access the minimum and maximum values in the array, which simplifies the calculation of instability after removing elements.\n- **Edge Case Evaluation**: By evaluating the instability when removing the first and last elements, we consider scenarios where the minima or maxima might change. For all other elements, the instability remains the same as the original array because the minima and maxima are not affected.\n- **Efficient Comparison**: The solution efficiently compares the instability values from the three possible scenarios (removing the first element, removing the last element, or removing any other element) to determine the minimum possible instability.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle large input sizes efficiently with a time complexity dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n). The subsequent operations are O(1), making the overall approach optimal for the given constraints.",
