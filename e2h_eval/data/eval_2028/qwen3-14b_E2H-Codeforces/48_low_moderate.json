            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Capture Valerian\n\nIt's now 260 AD. Shapur, being extremely smart, became the King of Persia. He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, where b can be Roman numerals. The input gives me a and b (or R), and then a number c in base a. My job is to convert c to base b, handling Roman numerals when needed.\n\nFirst, let's break down the steps. The process should be:\n\n1. Convert the input number c (which is in base a) to a decimal (base 10) integer.\n2. Then convert that decimal integer to base b. But if b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals instead.\n\nSo the main steps are converting from base a to decimal, then converting from decimal to base b or Roman.\n\nLet's think about each part.\n\nFirst part: converting c from base a to decimal.\n\nThe input c can have leading zeros, but that's okay. For example, if a is 10 and c is '001', it's 1 in decimal. So I need to process each digit of c, multiply by a^position, etc. But since the length can be up to 10^3, we need to handle large numbers. However, the note says that if Roman is involved, the number is <= 3000 in decimal. Otherwise, it's up to 1e15. So for the conversion from base a to decimal, we need to handle very large numbers. But Python can handle big integers, so that's manageable.\n\nSo for the first step, I can loop through each character in the string c, and compute the value. For example, for each digit in c, the value is (current_value * a) + digit_value. But how to get the digit value? For example, if a is 16, then digits can be 0-9 and A-F. Wait, the problem says that in bases greater than 10, letters are used. So for example, in base 12, digits go up to B (11). So the input c's digits can be numbers and letters (uppercase?), but the problem says that the input is given as a string. So the input c may have letters if a is larger than 10. But how are they represented? For example, in base 16, the digits would be 0-9, A-F. But the problem says that the input c is a non-negative integer in base a. So the input c may contain letters for digits above 9. However, the problem says that the input is given as a string, which may have leading zeros. So for example, if the input is 'A' in base 12, that's 10 in decimal.\n\nSo, for converting c to decimal, I need to process each character in the string, and for each character, find its value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. So I need a helper function to convert a character to its numeric value. Similarly, when converting from decimal to base b, if b is greater than 10, letters will be needed.\n\nSo first, the code for converting c to decimal:\n\nLet me think. For each character in the string c, we can process it as follows:\n\nFor example, for the string '1A' in base 16: the value is 1*16 + 10 = 26.\n\nSo, the code would be something like:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but the input c is given as a string. But what if the input has letters in lowercase? The problem says that the input is given as a single non-negative integer in base a. Probably, the input uses uppercase letters for digits beyond 9. But the problem statement says that the input may have letters for digits in bases higher than 10. So perhaps the input is case-insensitive, but the code should process them as uppercase.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as a string. For example, in the sample input, there's an entry where the input is 'A' in base 12. So the code should process letters as uppercase.\n\nSo, the code for converting c to decimal is straightforward.\n\nNow, the next part is converting the decimal number to base b, which can be a normal base (2-25) or Roman numerals.\n\nSo, first, handle the case where b is not R. Then, convert the decimal number to base b, using letters for digits above 9.\n\nFor example, if the decimal number is 10 and base is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base or to Roman numerals. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its original base to decimal (base 10), and then converting the decimal number to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert from Base `a` to Decimal**: This involves processing each digit of the input number, converting it to its decimal equivalent. For bases greater than 10, digits are represented using letters (A-Z).\n2. **Convert from Decimal to Base `b` or Roman Numerals**: If the target base is not Roman numerals, convert the decimal number to the specified base using appropriate digit representations. If the target is Roman numerals, convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a standard conversion method.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, symbol) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    inputs = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in inputs:\n        parts = line.strip().split()\n        a_part = parts[0]\n        b_part = parts[1]\n        c_str = parts[2]\n        \n        a = int(a_part.split()[0])\n        b = b_part\n        c = c_str\n        \n        # Convert c from base a to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n        \n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            result = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` processes each character of the input string, converting it to its decimal equivalent by iterating through each digit and accumulating the value.\n2. **Conversion from Decimal to Base `b`**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts a decimal number to a specified base. For bases greater than 10, letters are used for digits beyond 9.\n3. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts a decimal number to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, iterating through these pairs to construct the Roman numeral string.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the conversion between different bases and Roman numerals, ensuring correctness and handling edge cases such as leading zeros and large numbers.",
