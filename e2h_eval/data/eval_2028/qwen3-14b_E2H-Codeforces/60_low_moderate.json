            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Morse Code\n\nIn Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about Morse code representations and counting the number of valid sequences after each modification to a string S. The key points are:\n\nEach time we append a 0 or 1 to S, we have to compute how many non-empty sequences of English letters are represented by some substring of S. But not all possible Morse code strings are valid. The invalid ones are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring of S that corresponds to one of these four is not considered as a valid letter. All other Morse code strings of length 1-4 are valid.\n\nThe task is, after each append, to find the total number of valid sequences. But what counts as a sequence? It's any non-empty sequence of letters, which would correspond to concatenations of valid Morse code strings. For example, if there are two valid Morse codes in the string, like \"1\" and \"1\", then \"T\" (from first) and \"T\" (from second) is one sequence, and \"TT\" (from combining both) is another. Wait, but how do substrings work here?\n\nWait, the problem says that each non-empty sequence of English letters is represented by some substring of S. So for example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" (positions 1), \"1\" (position 2), \"1\" (position3)\n- \"11\" (positions 1-2), \"11\" (positions 2-3)\n- \"111\" (positions 1-3)\n\nEach of these substrings is a Morse code string. But each of them must be a valid code (i.e., not in the forbidden list). Then, each such valid substring represents a letter. The number of sequences is the number of ways to split the substrings into valid codes. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\".\n\nWait, perhaps the question is that each valid Morse code substring (i.e., a substring that is a valid code) contributes 1 to the count. But that can't be right, because the example shows that for S being \"111\", the answer is 7. Let me check the example:\n\nIn the first sample input, after appending three '1's, S is \"111\". The output is 7. According to the note, the valid sequences are:\n\n- \"T\" (from \"1\")\n- \"M\" (from \"11\")\n- \"O\" (from \"111\")\n- \"TT\" (from \"1\"+\"1\")\n- \"TM\" (from \"1\"+\"11\")\n- \"MT\" (from \"11\"+\"1\")\n- \"TTT\" (from \"1\"+\"1\"+\"1\")\n\nSo each of these sequences corresponds to splitting the string into valid Morse code parts. But how do these relate to substrings?\n\nWait, the problem says that the sequences are represented by some substring of S. So for example, the substring \"1\" is a valid code (so it's counted once), the substring \"11\" is valid (counted once), the substring \"111\" is valid (counted once). Then, the substrings that are longer than 4 characters can't be valid, but since S is built incrementally, and each step adds one character, maybe the maximum length of S is up to 3000, but the substrings that are considered can be up to length 4.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each Morse code representation is of length 1-4. Therefore, any substring of S that is of length 1-4 and is not forbidden is a valid letter. However, the sequences of letters are formed by concatenating these valid letters. For example, if there are two valid Morse codes in the string, like \"1\" and \"1\", then the sequence \"TT\" is formed by taking the first \"1\" and the second \"1\".\n\nBut how does that relate to the substrings of S? Because the sequences are represented by some substring of S. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\n\nAh, so each such sequence is represented by a substring of S. So for example, the sequence \"TT\" is represented by the substring \"11\" (which is the Morse code for M, but that's a single letter. Wait, no. Wait, the sequence \"TT\" is two letters, which would be represented by the concatenation of their Morse codes. So for example, T is \"1\",",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of valid sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a growing string `S` in Morse code. The valid Morse code strings are those of lengths 1 to 4, excluding four specific invalid strings: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: We use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of valid sequences ending at each position in the string `S`.\n2. **Valid Morse Code Check**: For each substring of length 1 to 4, we check if it is a valid Morse code string (i.e., not in the forbidden list).\n3. **Efficient Counting**: As we append each character to `S`, we update our DP array to reflect the new valid sequences formed by the current character and previous valid sequences.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    ops = input[1:]\n    \n    forbidden = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    # dp[i] represents the number of valid sequences ending at position i-1\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)\n    s = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        s.append(ops[i - 1])\n        current = ''.join(s)\n        # Check all possible substrings ending at position i\n        # We need to check substrings of length 1 to 4 that end at i\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if i - l >= 0:\n                sub = current[-l:]\n                if sub not in forbidden:\n                    if l == 1:\n                        dp[i] = (dp[i] + 1) % MOD\n                    else:\n                        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - l] + 1) % MOD\n        # Sum up all dp values from 1 to i\n        total = 0\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            total = (total + dp[j]) % MOD\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations `m` and the sequence of operations.\n2. **Forbidden Strings**: A set of forbidden Morse code strings is defined for quick lookup.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: `dp[i]` keeps track of the number of valid sequences ending at the i-th position of the string `S`.\n4. **Substring Checking**: For each new character added to `S`, we check all substrings ending at the current position with lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid, it contributes to the count of valid sequences.\n5. **Total Valid Sequences**: After processing each character, we sum up all valid sequences counted in the DP array to get the total number of valid sequences for the current string `S`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of valid sequences after each modification using dynamic programming, keeping the complexity manageable even for the upper limit of input size.",
