She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. Let's think about how she can do this optimally.\n\nFirst, the initial setup: there are n tabs, and the mouse is at position pos. She needs to leave only tabs from l to r. So any tabs outside that range must be closed. The challenge is figuring out the fastest way to do that.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. The key here is that closing tabs can be done by moving the cursor to a certain position and then closing left or right. But each move takes a second, and each close operation also takes a second. So, the strategy would involve moving the cursor to positions where closing operations can eliminate as many tabs as possible with minimal steps.\n\nLet me consider the cases where the current position is already in the [l, r] range. If the entire [l, r] is already open, and there's nothing to close, then the answer is 0. But that's only if the initial tabs are already in the desired state. Wait, but the problem says that she needs to close tabs outside [l, r]. So, if the initial tabs are already all in [l, r], then no action is needed. But that's only possible if l=1 and r=n, but maybe not. Wait, no. For example, if the initial tabs are from 1 to n, and l and r are 1 to n, then yes. But in general, for example, if l=2 and r=4, and n=6, then the tabs outside 2-4 (i.e., 1,5,6) need to be closed.\n\nSo the first thing is to check whether the current [l, r] is already the entire set. But maybe not, but the problem says that the input could have l=1 and r=n, which would require no action.\n\nBut how to model the steps.\n\nLet me think about the required steps. The optimal approach would be to close all tabs to the left of l and all tabs to the right of r. So, she needs to perform two operations: close left and close right. However, depending on her current position, the order and steps might vary.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps can be found by considering the following:\n\nCase 1: The current position is already in the [l, r] range. Then, she can close the left and right parts. But how?\n\nFor example, suppose she needs to close tabs to the left of l. To do that, she must move to the position l, then close all tabs to the left. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r, she needs to move to r and close to the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can do it in a different order. But what's the minimal steps?\n\nAnother case: when the current position is not in [l, r]. Then she needs to move into the [l, r] range first, then perform the closing steps.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. Let me think of the example given in the first input:\n\nInput is 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The output is 5.\n\nIn the note, they explain that she moves to tab 2 (from 3, which takes 1 second?), closes left (which is tabs 1). Then moves to tab 3 (maybe 1 step?), then to 4 (another step), then closes right (tabs 5 and 6). Let's count the steps:\n\nMoving from 3 to 2: 1 sec.\n\nClose left: 1 sec. (total 2)\n\nThen move from 2 to 3 (1 sec) and then to 4 (another sec) — total 2 more steps (total 4). Then close right (1 sec). Total 5 steps. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the steps are: move to l, close left, then move to r, close right. But the movement steps depend on where the current pos is.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nSo, the problem can be broken down into two parts: closing the left part (tabs before l) and closing the right part (tabs after r). The steps required for each part depend on where the cursor is.\n\nBut to close the left part, you need to be at position l, and then close all to the left. Similarly, to close the right part, you need to be at position r, and then close all to the right.\n\nSo, the steps required for closing the left part is the time to move from the initial position to l (if not already there), plus 1 second for the closing operation. Similarly for the right part.\n\nBut wait, what if the initial position is already in the [l, r",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given position pos. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check if No Tabs Need Closing**: If the segment [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no operations are needed.\n2. **Determine Movement Steps**:\n   - **Left Segment Closure**: Calculate the time required to move the cursor to the leftmost tab of the segment (l) and close all tabs to the left.\n   - **Right Segment Closure**: Calculate the time required to move the cursor to the rightmost tab of the segment (r) and close all tabs to the right.\n3. **Sum the Steps**: Sum the steps required for both closures, considering the initial position and the positions of l and r.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# If the required segment is already the entire range, nothing to do\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    # Calculate steps to close left part (tabs before l)\n    # Need to move to l, then close left\n    steps_left = 0\n    if pos < l:\n        steps_left += (l - pos)  # move to l\n        steps_left += 1  # close left\n    elif pos > l:\n        steps_left += (pos - l)  # move to l\n        steps_left += 1  # close left\n    else:\n        # already at l, just close left\n        steps_left += 1\n\n    # Calculate steps to close right part (tabs after r)\n    steps_right = 0\n    if pos < r:\n        steps_right += (r - pos)  # move to r\n        steps_right += 1  # close right\n    elif pos > r:\n        steps_right += (pos - r)  # move to r\n        steps_right += 1  # close right\n    else:\n        # already at r, just close right\n        steps_right += 1\n\n    # However, if l == r, then after closing left, closing right is not needed\n    # Wait, no. Because if l == r, then the segment is a single tab. So we need to close left and right?\n    # For example, if n=5, l=3, r=3. Then tabs 1,2,4,5 must be closed. So closing left and right would do that.\n    # But when you close left from position 3, you close tabs 1-2. Then closing right from position 3 closes 4-5.\n    # So even if l == r, we need both steps.\n\n    total_steps = steps_left + steps_right\n    print(total_steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **No Tabs to Close**: If the segment [l, r] already spans all tabs, no operations are needed.\n- **Closing Left Tabs**: Calculate the steps required to move the cursor to the leftmost tab of the segment (l) and close all tabs to the left.\n- **Closing Right Tabs**: Similarly, calculate the steps required to move the cursor to the rightmost tab of the segment (r) and close all tabs to the right.\n- **Total Steps**: Sum the steps required for both operations to get the minimum time needed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps by focusing on moving to the necessary positions and performing the closure operations in the optimal order.",
