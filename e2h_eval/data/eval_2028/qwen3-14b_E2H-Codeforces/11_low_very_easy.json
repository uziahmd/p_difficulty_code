A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, each toast requires nl ml of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and np grams of salt per friend.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs these things. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl ml. Because each friend has one toast. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (since each friend uses one slice per toast). And the salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the total resources available:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d.\n\nSalt: p grams.\n\nThen, for each toast, the total required is:\n\ndrink: n * nl ml per toast.\n\nlime slices: n per toast.\n\nsalt: n * np grams per toast.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute. For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made with that resource, then take the minimum of those numbers.\n\nSo for drink: total_drink = k*l. Each toast uses n * nl. So possible toasts from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, if it's not divisible, we take the floor.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: total_lime_slices = c*d. Each toast needs n slices. So possible toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast needs n * np. So possible toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nLet me calculate:\n\nTotal drink: 4 * 5 = 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend? Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink needed is n * nl. For the first example, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3*3=9 ml. So total toasts possible from drink is 20 / 9 = 2.222... so floor is 2. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nLimes: c=10, d=8. Total slices 80. Each toast needs n=3 slices. 80 / 3 is 26.666..., floor 26. But sample says limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait wait, no. Wait the sample explanation says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Oh, but according to my previous calculation, each toast requires n slices. So for the first sample, n is 3. So 80 slices can make 80//3 = 26 toasts. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement. The note says:\n\n\"In the first sample: ... the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait why is the limes for 80 toasts? Because the sample says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires a slice per friend. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices. So for the first sample, 3 friends, each toast requires 3 slices. So total slices available is 10 * 8 = 8",
