Файлы копируются последовательно в заданном порядке.При копировании вы видите два прогресс-бара: первый показывает процент скопированных данных в текущем файле, а второй — общий процент скопированных данных по всем $$$n$$$ файлам. Оба процента отображаются округлёнными вниз до целого числа. Значения на прогресс-барах обновляются после копирования каждого байта.Формально, после копирования байта номер $$$x$$$ из файла номер $$$i$$$ первый прогресс-бар показывает $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot x}{a_i} \\rfloor$$$ процентов, а второй — $$$\\lfloor \\frac{100 \\cdot (a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_{i - 1} + x)}{a_1 + a_2 + \\ldots + a_n} \\rfloor$$$ процентов.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about copying files and tracking two progress bars. The first shows the progress of the current file, the second the overall progress. Both are floored to integers. After each byte copied, these values update. We need to find all percentages from 0 to 100 inclusive that appear on both bars at the same time.\n\nHmm. So for each moment when a byte is copied (including the initial state?), we have to check if both progress bars show the same value. But how do we model all these moments?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, the total size of all files is total = sum(a). For each file i, which has size a_i, we process each byte x from 1 to a_i (since after each byte, the progress updates). Wait, but also, after the last byte of the last file, the progress bars would be 100%? Or maybe after the last byte, the progress is 100%?\n\nWait, according to the problem statement, the progress bars are updated after each byte. So for example, when the first byte is copied, the current file's progress is 100 * x / a_i, floored. For the first file, when x is 1, it's 100*1/a_i, which could be 0 if a_i is large. But when x reaches a_i, then 100 * x /a_i is exactly 100, which is correct.\n\nBut the initial state is before any bytes are copied. Both bars show 0. So that's a valid moment. So the initial state is included. So for example, in the first sample input where there's one file of size 6, the initial 0 is counted, and then each byte's progress is checked.\n\nSo the approach is: simulate each possible byte copied, compute the two progress percentages, and check if they are equal. Then collect all such percentages.\n\nBut how to model all possible moments?\n\nLet me think. For each file i (from 0 to n-1), and for each byte x in 1..a_i, we can compute the current progress and the overall progress. Also, the initial state (before any bytes) is 0 for both.\n\nWait, but the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So that's a moment where both are 0. So that's definitely part of the answer.\n\nThen, for each byte copied, after that byte, we have the current progress and overall progress. So for each such byte, we need to check if the two percentages are equal.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the total size of all files, total = sum(a).\n\n2. Initialize a set to collect all valid percentages.\n\n3. Add 0 to the set, since the initial state is 0 for both.\n\n4. For each file i (starting from 0 to n-1):\n\n   a. For each byte x in 1 to a_i:\n\n      i. Compute current progress: floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\n      ii. Compute overall progress: floor(100 * (sum_prev + x) / total), where sum_prev is the sum of the sizes of the previous files.\n\n      iii. If current progress equals overall progress, add that value to the set.\n\n5. After processing all bytes, collect all the values in the set, sort them, and output.\n\nWait, but sum_prev is the sum of a_1 to a_{i-1} (assuming 1-based index). So for the first file, sum_prev is 0. Then for each x in 1 to a_i, the overall progress is (sum_prev + x) / total * 100, floored.\n\nYes.\n\nBut how do I compute sum_prev for each file?\n\nWe can precompute the prefix sums. For example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a_1, prefix_sums[2] = a_1 + a_2, etc. Then, for the i-th file (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), sum_prev is prefix_sums[i].\n\nWait, let's say the files are 0-based. For the i-th file (0-based), the sum_prev is the sum of the first i files. Wait no. For the i-th file (0-based), the previous files are 0 to i-1. So sum_prev is prefix_sums[i], where prefix_sums[i] is the sum of the first i files (if prefix_sums starts from 0).\n\nLet me think about prefix_sums. Let's create a list where prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a_0, prefix_sums[2] = a_0 + a_1, etc. So for the i-th file (0-based), the sum_prev is prefix_sums[i], and the total is prefix_sums[n].\n\nSo for each file i (0-based), and for each x in 1 to a_i:\n\ncurrent_progress = (100 * x) // a_i\n\noverall_progress = (100 * (prefix_sums[i] + x)) // total\n\nIf current_progress == overall_progress, then add that value to the set.\n\nBut also, what about when the entire file is copied? For example, when x is a_i, the current progress is 100, and the overall progress is (sum_prev + a_i) / total * 100, which is (prefix_sums[i] + a_i) = prefix_sums[i+1]. So that's part of the calculation.\n\nBut the problem says that the progress bars are updated after each byte. So for each byte x (from 1 to a_i), the progress is calculated. Also, after the last byte, the overall progress is (total) * 100 / total = 100. So that would be added as well.\n\nBut wait, in the example given in the note, the first test case is 1 file of size 6. So the initial 0 is included. Then, for each x from 1 to 6, current progress is (100x)/6, floored. The overall progress is (x)/6 * 100, same as current. So all those values are added. Also, after the last byte, the overall progress is 100. So 100 is added.\n\nBut the sample output for the first input is 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Let's check that. For example, when x=1: 100*1/6 is 16.666..., floored to 16. Similarly, for x=2: 33.333... floored to 33. x=3: 50, x=4: 66.666 floored to 66, x=5: 83.333 floored to 83, x=6: 100. So the percentages are 0 (initial), 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the first sample output.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the steps for code:\n\nRead n, then read the list a. Compute total = sum(a). Compute prefix_sums, where prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nThen, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n       current_p = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n       overall_p = (100 * (sum_prev + x)) // total\n\n       if current_p == overall_p:\n\n           add to the set.\n\nAlso, include 0 in the set.\n\nBut wait, the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So the initial 0 is added. But when you start copying the first byte, the progress bars are updated. So the initial 0 is considered as a moment.\n\nBut in the code above, the initial 0 is added. Then, for each x in each file, we check if the current_p and overall_p are equal. However, when x is 1, the current_p is (100 * 1)/a_i, which may be 0. So for example, if a_i is 1000, then x=1 gives 0.1% floored to 0. So that would be considered. But the initial 0 is already in the set. So perhaps the initial 0 is added once, and then during processing, other instances of 0 may be added again. But since it's a set, duplicates don't matter.\n\nSo the code would:\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nAdd 0 to the set.\n\nThen loop through all the files and their bytes, and check for equality.\n\nBut wait, what about the moment when the entire copy is done? For example, after the last byte of the last file is copied, the overall progress is 100. So in that case, during the loop, when x is a_i (the last file's size), the overall_p is (sum_prev + x) * 100 / total. Since sum_prev + x is the total sum, that's 100. So that would be added.\n\nBut what about after the last byte is copied, but the progress bars are still showing 100? Well, the problem says that the progress bars are updated after each byte. So the last byte's processing includes that 100% for both bars. So that is captured.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code structure in Python:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nRead the next line as list a.\n\nCompute total = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums. Let's compute it as a list, where prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nThen, for each i in range(n):\n\n   current_file_size = a[i]\n\n   sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to current_file_size:\n\n       current_p = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n       overall_p = (100 * (sum_prev + x)) // total\n\n       if current_p == overall_p:\n\n           add to the set.\n\nAlso, add 0 to the set.\n\nWait, but the initial 0 is before any bytes are copied. But during the processing of the first file's x=1, the current_p and overall_p may be 0. So that's another occurrence of 0. But the initial 0 is already in the set. So adding 0 once is sufficient.\n\nBut what about the case where during the processing of some x, both progress bars are 0? For example, when the first file is very large. Like, say, a file of 1000 bytes. Then, for x=1, current_p is 0.1% floored to 0. The overall_p is (1 / 1000)*100 = 0.1, floored to 0. So this would be added. But the initial 0 is already present. So the code will collect all such occurrences, but since the set is used, duplicates are not a problem.\n\nSo the code should proceed as follows.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n, then a list. For example, in the first sample input, n is 1, a is [6].\n\nNow, compute prefix_sums. How to compute it?\n\nIn Python:\n\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\n\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n\n    prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nYes. Because for i-th element in prefix_sums (starting from 1), it's the sum of the first i elements of a.\n\nOnce that's done, for each i (from 0 to n-1), the sum_prev is prefix_sums[i], and the current file is a[i].\n\nNow, code:\n\nInitialize a set called result = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\nThen loop through each i in 0 to n-1:\n\n   sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   file_size = a[i]\n\n   for x in range(1, file_size + 1):\n\n       current_p = (100 * x) // file_size\n\n       overall_p = (100 * (sum_prev + x)) // total\n\n       if current_p == overall_p:\n\n           result.add(current_p)\n\nOnce all that is done, collect the sorted list of the elements in the set, and print them.\n\nWait, but what about the case when the overall_p is 100? For example, when the last byte is copied, the overall_p is 100. But in the code, that is added. Also, the initial 0 is added.\n\nBut in the first sample input, the code adds 0, and then during processing of x=6, current_p is 100*6//6= 100, and overall_p is (sum_prev + x) = 6, total is 6. So 100 * 6 /6 = 100. So 100 is added. So the set contains 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one: n=2, a=[100, 500]. Total is 600.\n\nThe output is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nLet me think. How does that happen?\n\nThe initial 0 is added. Then, during processing of the first file (size 100), sum_prev is 0. For x from 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_p = 100*x//100 = x. So for x=1, current_p is 1, overall_p is 100*(0 + x)/600 = x/6. So for x=1, 1/6 is 0.166... floored to 0. So current_p is 1, which is not equal to 0. So no addition.\n\nBut for x= 599? No, wait the first file is 100 bytes. So for x in 1-100, the overall_p is (x) * 100 / 600 = x/6. So for example, when x is 599, no, that's not in the first file. Let me think about when the first file is processed. For example, when x=600, but that's not possible here. So for the first file, the overall_p is x/6, and current_p is x. So for x=600, but that's not in the first file. So during the first file's processing, current_p is x, which ranges from 1 to 100, and overall_p is x/6, which is 0.166 (0), up to 100/6=16.666, floored to 16. So during this phase, the only time when current_p equals overall_p is when x is 0? But that's the initial state. So during the first file's processing, there are no new values added except possibly when x is 0, which is already handled.\n\nWait, but in the second sample input, the output includes 95, 96, etc. How does that happen?\n\nAh, the second sample input is n=2, a = [100, 500]. The total is 600. So during processing of the second file (size 500), sum_prev is 100. So for x in 1..500:\n\ncurrent_p is (100 * x) // 500 = x//5.\n\noverall_p is (100 * (100 + x)) // 600.\n\nSo for example, when x is 500, sum_prev + x is 600. So overall_p is 100. current_p is (500 * 100)/500 = 100. So 100 is added. But how about other values?\n\nBut the output includes 95, 96, etc. So let's think about when the overall_p is 95. Let's compute when (100*(100 + x))/600 = 95. So 100 + x = 95 * 600 / 100 = 570. So 100 +x = 570 → x=470. So x is 470. So current_p is (100 * 470)/500 = 94. So 94 vs 95. Not equal. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to find x such that (100*(sum_prev +x )) // total = (100 * x) // a_i.\n\nSo for the second file, sum_prev = 100, a_i = 500. So for x in 1..500:\n\ncurrent_p = (100x) // 500 = x//5.\n\noverall_p = (100*(100 + x)) // 600.\n\nWe need x//5 == (100*(100 +x )) // 600.\n\nLet me try x= 475:\n\ncurrent_p = 475 //5 = 95.\n\noverall_p = (100*(100+475 )) / 600 = (100 * 575)/600 = 57500 / 600 = 95.8333... → floored to 95. So yes. So 95 is added. So that's one of the values.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 476:\n\ncurrent_p is 476//5 = 95.2 → 95.\n\noverall_p: 100*(100+476) = 57600 → 57600 / 600 = 96 → 96. So 95 != 96. So not added.\n\nBut for x= 475, the two are 95. So that's added.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 480:\n\ncurrent_p = 480//5 = 96.\n\noverall_p: 100*(100 + 480) = 58000 → 58000 /600 = 96.666... → 96. So 96 equals 96. So added.\n\nSo for x=480, it's added. So 96 is in the set.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 485:\n\ncurrent_p = 485//5 = 97.\n\noverall_p: 100*(100 + 485) = 58500 → 58500/600 = 97.5 → floored to 97. So 97 is added.\n\nSame for x= 490: current_p is 98, overall_p is (100 + 490) = 590 → 590 * 100 / 600 = 59000 / 600 = 98.333... → 98. So yes. So 98 added.\n\nx= 495: current_p is 99, overall_p is (595 * 100)/600 = 59500 / 600 = 99.166... → 99. So added.\n\nx= 500: current_p is 100, overall_p is 600 * 100 /600 = 100. So added.\n\nSo the numbers 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 are added during processing of the second file. Also, the initial 0 is added. So the output is 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nWhat if all files are 1 byte? For example, n=2, a=[1,1]. total is 2.\n\nFor initial 0, added.\n\nProcessing first file (size 1):\n\nx=1: current_p is 100*1//1 = 100. overall_p is (0 +1)*100 / 2 = 50 → 50. So 100 !=50, not added.\n\nProcessing second file (size 1):\n\nsum_prev is 1.\n\nx=1: current_p is 100*1//1 =100. overall_p is (1+1)*100/2 = 100 → 100. So added. So the set contains 0, 100. So output is 0,100.\n\nAnother case: n=1, a=[1]. Then total is 1. For initial 0. Then x=1: current_p is 100, overall_p is 100. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a = [2, 2]. total is 4.\n\nInitial 0 added.\n\nFirst file (size 2):\n\nx=1: current_p is 50, overall_p is (0+1)*100/4 = 25 → 25. Not equal.\n\nx=2: current_p is 100, overall_p is (2)*100/4 = 50 → 50. Not equal.\n\nSecond file (sum_prev=2):\n\nx=1: current_p is 50, overall_p is (2+1)*100/4 = 75 → 75. Not equal.\n\nx=2: current_p is 100, overall_p is (4 * 100)/4 = 100. So added. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: when during processing of a file, multiple x's produce the same value. For example, if a file is size 5, and during x=1, 2, 3, etc., the current_p is 20, 40, 60, etc. So the code adds them if they match the overall_p.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nRead n from input. Then read a list of integers.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nIn the first line, an integer n. Then the second line has n integers. So the code should read n, then a list of n integers.\n\nBut looking at the sample input given in the problem, the examples are given as lists, like ['1\\n6', ...], but that's probably for the purposes of the example. The actual input is two lines: first line is n, second line is the a_i's.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead n via input(). Then read the next line, split into integers.\n\nThen compute the prefix_sums.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(1, n+1):\n    prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nresult = set()\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        current_p = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n        overall_p = (100 * (sum_prev + x)) // total\n        if current_p == overall_p:\n            result.add(current_p)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nprint('\\n'.join(map(str, sorted_result)))\n\nWait, but in the first sample input, the output is '0\\n16\\n33\\n50\\n66\\n83\\n100' — which is the sorted list of the numbers. So the code would generate that.\n\nBut let's test the code with the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nThe code would process:\n\nn=1, a = [6], total=6.\n\nprefix_sums is [0, 6].\n\nLoop for i=0:\n\ncurrent_file_size = 6, sum_prev = 0.\n\nx runs from 1 to 6.\n\nFor x=1: current_p = 100 *1 //6 = 16. overall_p = (0+1)*100//6 = 100//6 = 16. So added.\n\nSimilarly for x=2: 200//6 = 33.333... → 33. overall_p is 200//6 = 33. So added.\n\nAnd so on. So the set will have 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nn=2\n\na = [100, 500]\n\ntotal is 600.\n\nThe code would generate the set containing 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is the third one:\n\n4\n\n1000 2 2 998\n\nTotal is 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002?\n\nWait 1000 + 2 is 1002, plus 2 is 1004, plus 998 is 2002.\n\nThe output is 0, 50, 99, 100.\n\nLet me see why.\n\nFor example, during the processing of the first file (1000 bytes). sum_prev is 0. For x=1000, current_p is 100, overall_p is (1000 * 100)/2002 = 100000 / 2002 ≈ 49.95... → 49. So not 100. So during the first file, no 50.\n\nBut during the processing of the second file (size 2, sum_prev is 1000). For x=1, sum_prev +x = 1001. 100 * 1001 / 2002 = 50. So 50. current_p is (100 *1 )//2 = 50. So 50 == 50. So added.\n\nThus, 50 is in the set.\n\nAnother case when during processing of the fourth file (size 998). sum_prev is 1000 + 2 + 2 = 1004. So during processing of x in 1..998:\n\nAt some point, the overall_p is 99. Let's see:\n\noverall_p is (1004 + x) * 100 / 2002 = ?\n\nLet me compute when (1004 + x) * 100 / 2002 = 99.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2002:\n\n(1004 +x) * 100 = 99 * 2002 → 100*(1004 +x) = 198198 → 1004 +x = 198198 / 100 = 1981.98 → 1981.98 → 1004 +x must be 1981.98, but since x is integer, perhaps 1981.98 is not possible. But the floor is 99. So the equation is:\n\n(100*(sum_prev +x )) // total = 99.\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nsum_prev +x >= (99 * total) / 100 → but since it's floored.\n\nBut regardless, during the processing of the fourth file, there's a moment where the overall_p is 99 and current_p is 99. Which would be added.\n\nSo the code would capture that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code-wise, what about when total is zero? But according to the input constraints, a_i is at least 1, so total is at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nAnother edge case: n=1, a_1=1. So total is 1. For x=1: current_p is 100, overall_p is 100. So set is {0, 100}.\n\nAnother case: when the same percentage is achieved multiple times, but the set takes care of uniqueness.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the output should be the numbers in increasing order. The code does sorted(result), which is correct.\n\nNow, let's test the code against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nOutput is 0,16,33,50,66,83,100.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n2\n\n100 500 → output 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\n4\n\n1000 2 2 998 → output 0,50,99,100.\n\nSample Input 4:\n\n6\n\n170 130 400 256 30 100 → output 0,17,43,44,84,90,99,100.\n\nThe code should generate these outputs correctly.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the percentages from 0 to 100 that appear simultaneously on two progress bars during the copying of files from one server to another. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the overall percentage of all files copied. Both percentages are floored to the nearest integer and updated after each byte is copied.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: Compute prefix sums to efficiently calculate the cumulative size of files up to each point.\n3. **Progress Calculation**: For each byte copied in each file, compute both the current file progress and the overall progress.\n4. **Check for Matching Percentages**: Track all percentages where both progress bars show the same value using a set to avoid duplicates.\n5. **Output the Results**: Sort the collected percentages and print them in ascending order.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)\nfor i in range(1, n + 1):\n    prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i-1] + a[i-1]\n\nresult = set()\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        current_p = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n        overall_p = (100 * (sum_prev + x)) // total\n        if current_p == overall_p:\n            result.add(current_p)\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nprint('\\n'.join(map(str, sorted_result)))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their sizes. These values are read and stored in a list.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: We compute prefix sums to quickly determine the cumulative size of files up to each index, which helps in calculating the overall progress efficiently.\n3. **Progress Calculation**: For each byte copied in each file, we calculate the current file's progress and the overall progress. These values are computed using integer division to simulate the floor operation.\n4. **Tracking Matching Percentages**: A set is used to collect all unique percentages where both progress bars match. This ensures no duplicates and efficient lookups.\n5. **Output**: The collected percentages are sorted and printed in ascending order to meet the problem requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check each byte's progress and determine the matching percentages, leveraging prefix sums for quick calculations and a set for tracking unique values.",
