Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Vasily and his candles. So he starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The thing is, every 'b' used candles can be turned into a new one. And this new one can be used again, which in turn becomes another used candle when it's done. The question is to find out the total number of hours he can keep the room lit.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break that down. Initially, he uses 4 candles, so 4 hours. Then, those 4 used ones are turned into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those, adding 2 hours. Now, those 2 are used, so he can make 2/2 = 1 new. That adds 1 hour. Now, that one is used, but 1 is less than 2, so no more. Total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Oh right, but wait, when he makes the new candles, each time he uses them, they contribute to the total hours.\n\nSo the approach here is to keep track of the total hours and the number of used candles. Let me think of the steps:\n\nStart with 'a' candles. Each time you burn them, you add to the total hours. Then, the number of used candles is equal to the number of candles burned. Then, you can make new candles from them by dividing by 'b', but you have to take the floor. But then, each new candle you make can be burned again, adding to the hours, and so on.\n\nSo the process is like:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\nused_candles = 0\n\nInitially, he has 'a' candles. So he burns them all, adding 'a' to total_hours. Then, used_candles becomes 'a'.\n\nThen, while used_candles >= b:\n\n    new_candles = used_candles // b\n    total_hours += new_candles\n    used_candles = (used_candles % b) + new_candles\n\nRepeat until used_candles < b.\n\nWait, that seems right. Let's test with the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\nInitial total is 4. used_candles =4.\n\nFirst loop: 4//2=2. total becomes 4+2=6. used_candles is 4%2=0 +2 = 2.\n\nNext loop: 2//2=1. total is 6+1=7. used_candles is 0 +1=1. Now, 1 <2, so stop. Total is 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: input 6 and 3. Output is 8.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitial total is 6. used_candles=6.\n\nFirst loop: 6//3=2. total is 6+2=8. used_candles is 0 +2=2. Now, 2 <3, so stop. So total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=3. Let's compute.\n\nInitial total is 5. used_candles=5.\n\nFirst loop: 5//3=1. total becomes 5+1=6. used_candles is 5%3=2 +1=3.\n\nNow, 3 >=3. So loop again. 3//3=1. total is 6+1=7. used_candles is 0 +1=1. Now stop. So total is 7.\n\nAnother example: a=3, b=3. Initial total is 3. Then, 3//3=1. total becomes 4. used_candles is 1. Then, 1 <3. So total is 4.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Start with total = a, used = a.\n\n- While used >= b:\n\n   new = used // b\n\n   total += new\n\n   used = (used % b) + new\n\nRepeat until used <b.\n\nSo the code needs to read a and b, then perform this loop.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nRead input as two integers. For example, the input could be given as a single line with two numbers, like '4 2' or '6 3'.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nThen, total = a\n\nused = a\n\nloop:\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n   new = used // b\n\n   total += new\n\n   used = used % b + new\n\nreturn total.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase when a=1, b=2. Then, initial total is 1. used=1. Since 1 <2, nothing else. So output is 1.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Initial total is 2. used is 2. Then, new is 1. total becomes 3. used is 0 +1 =1. Now stop. So output is 3.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=5. Initial total is 5. used is 5. new is 1. total is 6. used is 0 +1=1. stop. So output 6.\n\nAnother case where after making new candles, the used is again >=b. Like a=7, b=3.\n\nInitial total is 7. used=7.\n\nFirst iteration: 7//3=2, total becomes 7+2=9. used is 7%3=1 +2=3.\n\nAgain, 3 >=3. new=1. total is 10. used is 0 +1=1. stop. So total is 10.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead a and b. Then compute as per the steps.\n\nSo in Python:\n\nRead input line, split into two integers.\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen:\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = used % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample 1: input 4 2.\n\ntotal starts at 4, used=4.\n\nLoop: 4//2=2. total is 6. used is 0 + 2 = 2.\n\nLoop again: 2//2=1. total is 7. used is 0 +1=1. exit. Output 7.\n\nSample 2: 6 3.\n\ntotal is 6, used=6.\n\n6//3=2. total 8. used is 0 +2=2. exit. Output 8.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample: a=5, b=3. Output is 7 as discussed.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nI think that's the correct approach.\n",
