При передаче двух одинаковых сообщений подряд возможна ошибка, в результате которой эти два сообщения сливаются в одно. При таком слиянии конец первого сообщения совмещается с началом второго. Конечно, совмещение может происходить только по одинаковым символам. Длина совмещения должна быть положительным числом, меньшим длины текста сообщения. Например, при передаче двух сообщений «abrakadabra» подряд возможно, что оно будет передано с ошибкой описанного вида, и тогда будет получено сообщение вида «abrakadabrabrakadabra» или «abrakadabrakadabra» (в первом случае совмещение произошло по одному символу, а во втором — по четырем).По полученному сообщению t определите, возможно ли, что это результат ошибки описанного вида работы локальной сети, и если возможно, определите возможное значение s. Не следует считать ошибкой ситуацию полного наложения друга на друга двух сообщений. К примеру, если получено сообщение «abcd», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет. Аналогично, простое дописывание одного сообщения вслед за другим не является признаком ошибки. Например, если получено сообщение «abcabc», следует считать, что в нём ошибки нет.\n\n## Input\nВ единственной строке выходных данных следует непустая строка t, состоящая из строчных букв латинского алфавита. Длина строки t не превосходит 100 символов.\n\n## Output\nЕсли сообщение t не может содержать ошибки, выведите «NO» (без кавычек) в единственную строку выходных данных.В противном случае в первой строке выведите «YES» (без кавычек), а в следующей строке выведите строку s — возможное сообщение, которое могло привести к ошибке. Если возможных ответов несколько, разрешается вывести любой из них.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abrakadabrabrakadabra', 'acacacaca', 'abcabc', 'abababab', 'tatbt']\n\n### Output\n['YES\\nabrakadabra', 'YES\\nacaca', 'NO', 'YES\\nababab', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nВо втором примере подходящим ответом также является строка acacaca. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining if a given string t could have been formed by merging two identical messages s with an error. The error occurs when two same messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that some part of the end of the first message matches the start of the second. The overlap length has to be positive but less than the length of s. Also, the case where the two messages are completely overlapping (so the merged string is exactly s) or just concatenated normally (like s + s) should not be considered as errors. So, the task is to check if there's a possible s such that t can be formed by overlapping two copies of s with some positive overlap less than len(s).\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to check for possible overlaps. Let's think about the possible scenarios.\n\nLet me think: For the merged string t to be formed by two copies of s with an overlap. Let's denote the length of s as L. Then the length of t would be 2L - k, where k is the overlap length. Since k must be between 1 and L-1 (inclusive), then the length of t must satisfy:\n\n2L - k = len(t). \n\nBut since k is at least 1 and at most L-1, substituting:\n\nFor k=1: len(t) = 2L -1 → L = (len(t) +1)/2. But since k can't be larger than L-1, then L must be such that 2L - (L-1) = L +1 ≥ len(t). Wait, maybe I should approach this differently.\n\nLet me think: The original two messages are s and s. When merged with an overlap of k characters, the resulting string is of length len(s) + len(s) - k = 2L -k. So for the given t, its length must be equal to 2L -k. But since k is between 1 and L-1, we can write:\n\nlen(t) = 2L -k → k = 2L - len(t). \n\nBut since k must be between 1 and L-1, substituting:\n\n1 ≤ 2L - len(t) ≤ L-1.\n\nLet me rearrange these inequalities.\n\nFirst inequality: 2L - len(t) ≥ 1 → 2L ≥ len(t) +1 → L ≥ (len(t)+1)/2.\n\nSecond inequality: 2L - len(t) ≤ L-1 → 2L - len(t) ≤ L-1 → L ≤ len(t) -1.\n\nSo combining these two:\n\n(len(t)+1)/2 ≤ L ≤ len(t) -1.\n\nBut since L is the length of s, which must be such that when you take two copies of s and merge them with overlap k, you get t. So for each possible L in this range, we can check if there exists a k (which is 2L - len(t)) such that the overlap is valid.\n\nWait, but k must be between 1 and L-1. So given that L is in the range [(len(t)+1)/2, len(t)-1], let's see for each possible L, what k would be.\n\nLet me compute k = 2L - len(t). For example, if len(t) is 2L -k. So for each possible L, k is determined. And since k must be between 1 and L-1, then for each L in the allowed range, we can check whether k falls into that interval.\n\nBut how do I find possible L values?\n\nLet me take an example. Let's say t has length n. Then for possible L, we have:\n\nL must be between ceil((n+1)/2) and n-1.\n\nBecause len(t) = 2L -k, and k is between 1 and L-1.\n\nSo for example, if the length of t is 6, then possible L ranges from (6+1)/2 = 3.5 → ceil(3.5) is 4, up to 6-1=5. So L can be 4 or 5.\n\nFor each L in that range, compute k = 2L -n. Then check if k is between 1 and L-1. Let's see:\n\nFor L=4, n=6: k=8-6=2. Which is between 1 and 3 (since L-1 is 3). So yes.\n\nFor L=5, k=10-6=4. But L-1 is 4, so k must be ≤4. So yes. So k=4 is allowed.\n\nSo for each possible L in that range, we can compute k, and check if it's valid.\n\nOnce we have possible L and k, we need to check if the first s (of length L) and the second s (also of length L) can be merged with an overlap of k characters. That is, the last k characters of the first s must match the first k characters of the second s.\n\nBut since the merged string is t, then the first s is the first part, and the second s is the second part. However, when merged with overlap k, the merged string is the first s, but with the last k characters overlapping with the first k of the second s. So the entire t must be equal to s[0 ... L -k -1] + s (the second s). Wait, perhaps another way to look at it is:\n\nThe merged string t should be equal to s concatenated with s, but with the last k characters of the first s overlapping with the first k of the second s. Therefore, the total length is L + (L -k) = 2L -k. Which is the length of t.\n\nSo, for the given t, and a candidate L, we can check:\n\nTake the first L characters of t as s_candidate. Then check if the last k characters of s_candidate match the first k characters of s_candidate. Because when you merge two s_candidates, the overlapping part is k characters. So the merged string would be s_candidate's first (L -k) characters followed by the entire s_candidate. But since the merged string is t, which is of length 2L -k, then the entire t must be s_candidate's first (L -k) characters plus s_candidate. So:\n\nt should be equal to s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate.\n\nBut wait, the length of s_candidate[:L -k] is (L -k), and adding s_candidate (length L) gives total length (L -k) + L = 2L -k, which equals the length of t. So, the entire t must be equal to that concatenation.\n\nAlternatively, the first part of t (up to L -k) plus the entire s_candidate must form t. But since s_candidate is the first L characters of t, then:\n\ns_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate must equal t. Let's check this.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose s is 'abrakadabra' (length 11). If the overlap is 1, then the merged string is s + s[1:] (since the first s's last 1 character overlaps with the second's first 1). So the merged string would be s[0..10] + s[1..10], which is length 11 + 10 = 21. Which is 2*11 -1 = 21. So for t being that merged string, the length is 21. So for L=11, k=1. Then the first L characters of t is s_candidate = 'abrakadabra', and then the merged string is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. L-k is 11 -1 = 10. So s_candidate[:10] is 'abrakadabr' (the first 10 letters), then adding s_candidate gives 'abrakadabr' + 'abrakadabra' = 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which is the merged string. Which is the example given in the problem.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each possible L in the range [(n+1)/2, n-1], where n is the length of t:\n\n- Compute k = 2L - n. Check if k is between 1 and L-1. If not, skip this L.\n\n- Then check if the first L characters of t (call it s_candidate) has its last k characters equal to the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\n- Also, check that the entire t is equal to s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. Because that's the merged string.\n\nIf any such L and k exist, then output YES and the s_candidate. Otherwise, output NO.\n\nBut how do I find all possible L values?\n\nLet me code this logic step by step.\n\nFirst, get the input string t, and compute n = len(t).\n\nThen, iterate over possible L values. The possible L values must satisfy:\n\nL must be >= ceil( (n + 1)/2 ), and <= n -1.\n\nBut since L must be an integer, let's compute the minimum possible L as (n +1 +1)//2? Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nFor example, if n is even: say n=6. Then (n+1)/2 is 3.5. So ceil(3.5) is 4. So L starts at 4.\n\nIf n is odd, say n=5: (5+1)/2=3. So L starts at 3.\n\nSo the minimum L is ceil( (n + 1)/2 ). But how to compute that in Python?\n\nWell, (n +1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, for example, n=6: (6+1)/2 is 3.5 → ceil is 4. (6+1)//2 = 3.5 floored to 3? No, in Python, integer division with // truncates towards negative infinity. So (n+1) // 2 for n=6 is 7//2=3. But that's not correct. Wait, perhaps I need to compute it as (n + 1 +1) // 2? Or maybe use math.ceil?\n\nAlternatively, the minimal L is (n + 1) // 2 if (n+1) is even? Not sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe condition is that L must be >= (n+1)/2. Since L must be an integer, the minimal possible L is ceil( (n+1)/2 ). For example, if (n+1) is even, then (n+1)/2 is integer. If it's odd, then ceil would be (n+1 +1)/2.\n\nBut how to compute that in Python. Well, using math.ceil.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. Let me think for n:\n\nceil( (n + 1)/2 ) can be written as (n + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nWait, let's take examples:\n\nn=6 → (6+1)/2=3.5 → ceil is 4. (6+1 +1)//2 = 8//2=4 → correct.\n\nn=5 → (5+1)/2=3 → ceil is 3. (5+1 +1)//2 = 7//2=3.5 → 3.5? No, in integer division, 7//2 is 3. So (n+1 +1)//2 is (n+2)//2. Let me check:\n\nn=5 → (5+2)//2 = 7//2 = 3. Which is correct.\n\nn=6 → (6+2)//2 = 8//2=4 → correct.\n\nn=4 → (4+1)/2=2.5 → ceil is 3. (4+2)//2=3 → correct.\n\nYes. So the minimal L is (n + 1 + 1) // 2 = (n + 2) // 2 ?\n\nWait, (n + 1)/2 rounded up is equal to (n +1 +1) // 2 ?\n\nYes. Because for any real number x, ceil(x) is equal to (x + 1) // 1, but here, for integers, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal L is (n + 1 + 1) // 2 ?\n\nYes. So for the possible L values, the range is from L_min = (n + 1 + 1) // 2 to L_max = n-1.\n\nWait, but let me check for n=5:\n\nn=5, L_min is (5 + 1 + 1)//2 = 7//2 = 3. Which is correct.\n\nBut for n=5, the maximum L is 4 (since L must be <=n-1=4).\n\nSo the loop would run for L from L_min to L_max inclusive.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor L in range(L_min, L_max + 1):\n\nBut what if L_min > L_max? Like when n is 1? But according to the problem statement, the input string t is non-empty, but for n=1, L_min would be (1 + 2) // 2 = 3//2=1. L_max is 0. So the loop would not run. So in that case, no possible L, output NO.\n\nSo the steps:\n\nCompute n = len(t). If n < 2, then output NO. Because for example, if n=1, then 2L -k = 1. But L must be at least (1+1)/2 = 1. So L_min is 1. L_max is 0. So no possible L. Hence, no solution.\n\nSo for n < 2, output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nLoop over possible L from L_min to L_max.\n\nFor each L, compute k = 2L - n.\n\nCheck if k is between 1 and L-1. Because for the given L, k must be in that range. Because:\n\nk must be ≥1 and ≤ L-1.\n\nBut since L is chosen in the range that comes from the constraints, perhaps this check is redundant? Let's think.\n\nEarlier, we derived that L is between (n+1)/2 and n-1. So for L in that range, k = 2L -n.\n\nWe need to check that k is between 1 and L-1.\n\nBut since L >= (n+1)/2 → 2L >= n+1 → 2L -n >= 1 → k >=1.\n\nAlso, since L <= n-1 → 2L -n <= 2(n-1) -n = 2n -2 -n = n-2. Now, since L is at least (n+1)/2, but what about the upper bound for k?\n\nWe need to ensure that k = 2L -n ≤ L-1.\n\nRearranging:\n\n2L -n ≤ L-1 → L ≤ n -1 → which is already true because L_max is n-1. So yes, for all L in the range L_min to L_max, k will be between 1 and L-1.\n\nTherefore, for each L in that range, k is valid. So no need to check again.\n\nSo for each L in that range, compute k = 2L -n.\n\nNow, check if the first L characters of t (s_candidate) has the last k characters equal to the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\nIf that's true, then check if the entire t is equal to s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate.\n\nWait, but why do we need to check that? Because the merged string is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. Because the overlapping part is k characters. So the first part is the first L -k characters of s_candidate, then the entire s_candidate. So the total length is (L -k) + L = 2L -k = n. Which matches the length of t.\n\nSo for example, if the first L characters of t is s_candidate, then the merged string would be s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. So if that equals t, then it's valid.\n\nBut how do we check this?\n\nLet me take the first L characters as s_candidate. Then, the merged string should be s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. So the entire t must be equal to that.\n\nBut since the first L characters of t is s_candidate, then the first part of the merged string is s_candidate[:L -k], and then the rest is s_candidate. So the entire merged string would be s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. Which would be of length (L -k) + L = 2L -k = n. Which is the length of t. Therefore, if the first L characters of t is s_candidate, and the merged string is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate, then t must be exactly that.\n\nBut how to check that? Let's think.\n\nThe merged string is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. Let's take the first L -k characters of s_candidate, then add the entire s_candidate. So the total is:\n\ns_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate.\n\nBut the original t is supposed to be this. So for example, the first part (L -k) characters of s_candidate plus the entire s_candidate must be equal to t.\n\nBut since the first L characters of t is s_candidate, then the first L -k characters of s_candidate are the first L -k characters of t. Then, adding the entire s_candidate (which is the first L characters of t) would make the merged string as follows:\n\nthe first L -k characters of t, followed by the first L characters of t. But the total length is (L -k) + L = 2L -k = n. So the entire t must be equal to this.\n\nBut how can we check that? Well, we can check if the first part of t (up to L -k) is equal to s_candidate[:L -k], and then the rest of t (from position L -k onwards) is equal to s_candidate. But since the first L characters of t is s_candidate, then the first L -k characters of t is s_candidate[:L -k], and the rest of t (from position L -k onwards) must be equal to s_candidate. But the length of the rest is n - (L -k) = (2L -k) - L +k = L. Which is the length of s_candidate. So the rest of t (from L -k onwards) must be equal to s_candidate.\n\nBut since the first L characters of t is s_candidate, then the rest of t (from L -k onwards) is:\n\nif L -k is less than L, then the part from L -k to the end of t is:\n\nt[L -k : ] ?\n\nBut the length of t is n = 2L -k. So t[L -k : ] has length (2L -k) - (L -k) ) = L. Which is the same as the length of s_candidate.\n\nSo, for example, the part t[L -k : ] must be equal to s_candidate.\n\nBut since s_candidate is the first L characters of t, then:\n\nt[L -k : ] == s_candidate ?\n\nBut how can that be? Let's take an example.\n\nTake the first example input: 'abrakadabrabrakadabra' (assuming that's the input). Let me check the sample input. The first sample input is 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', and the output is 'abrakadabra'.\n\nThe length of t is len('abrakadabrabrakadabra') → let's count. The original s is 'abrakadabra' (11 letters). The merged string is s + s with overlap of 1. So the merged string length is 11 + 11 -1 = 21. So len(t) is 21. So n=21.\n\nPossible L values are from (n + 2) // 2 = (21 + 2)/2 = 23//2 = 11.5 → 11.5 floored? Wait, no, in Python (21 + 2) // 2 is 23//2=11. So L_min is 11, L_max is 21-1=20. So L ranges from 11 to 20.\n\nFor L=11, k=2*11 -21 = 22-21=1. Which is between 1 and 10 (L-1=10). So valid.\n\nCheck if the first 11 characters of t is s_candidate. Let's see: the first 11 characters of t are 'abrakadabra' (since the merged string is 'abrakadabra' + 'abrakadabra' with overlap of 1. So the first 11 letters are s_candidate. Then check if the last k=1 characters of s_candidate (which is 'a') equals the first k=1 characters of s_candidate (also 'a'). So that's true.\n\nThen check if the merged string is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. L-k is 11-1=10. s_candidate[:10] is 'abrakadabr' (the first 10 letters). Adding s_candidate (11 letters) gives a string of length 10 + 11 = 21. Which is the length of t. So check if this equals t.\n\nIn this case, the merged string is 'abrakadabr' + 'abrakadabra' = 'abrakadabrabrakadabra', which is the input t. So yes.\n\nSo the check would pass.\n\nSo the steps for checking are:\n\nFor each L in the possible range:\n\n   k = 2L -n\n\n   s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n   if the last k characters of s_candidate == first k characters of s_candidate:\n\n       then check if t == s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate → which would be the case if the overlapping is correct.\n\nBut wait, since the s_candidate is the first L characters of t, and the merged string is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate, then the entire t must be equal to this. So how can we check that?\n\nWell, the merged string is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. Which is of length (L -k) + L = 2L -k = n. Which is the same as t's length. So to check if this equals t, we can check if the first (L -k) characters of t are equal to s_candidate[:L -k], and the remaining part (from position L -k onwards) is equal to s_candidate.\n\nBut since s_candidate is t[:L], then the remaining part of t (from L -k onwards) must be equal to s_candidate. Let's think:\n\nt[L -k : ] must be equal to s_candidate.\n\nBut the length of t[L -k : ] is n - (L -k) = (2L -k) - L +k = L. Which is the same as the length of s_candidate. So comparing the two strings.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif t[L -k : ] == s_candidate:\n\nthen it's valid.\n\nBut also, the overlapping part must be correct. Because the first part of the merged string is s_candidate[:L -k], which is the first part of t. So the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce we have s_candidate, check if the last k characters of s_candidate equal the first k characters of s_candidate. If that's true, then check if t equals s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. But since s_candidate is the first L characters of t, then t[:L] is s_candidate, and the rest of t is t[L:]. But the merged string is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate, which is t[:L -k] + s_candidate. So comparing that to t would require that t[:L -k] + s_candidate == t. Which is equivalent to checking that t[L -k : ] == s_candidate.\n\nBecause:\n\nt[:L -k] + s_candidate == t → since t[:L -k] is the first part, and the rest of the string is s_candidate. So the entire string is t[:L -k] + s_candidate. But the original t is of length n = 2L -k. The length of t[:L -k] is L -k, and s_candidate is length L. So the total is L -k + L = 2L -k = n. So the entire string is t[:L -k] + s_candidate. So for this to be equal to t, the t must be equal to that. But since t[:L] is s_candidate, then the first L -k characters of t is s_candidate[:L -k]. So t[:L -k] is s_candidate[:L -k]. Therefore, the merged string is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. Which is equal to t only if the rest of the t (from position L -k onwards) is s_candidate.\n\nSo the check can be done by checking if t[L -k : ] == s_candidate.\n\nSo in code:\n\ns_candidate = t[:L]\n\nif s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k] and t[L -k : ] == s_candidate:\n\n    return YES and s_candidate.\n\nBut why do we need both conditions? Because the first condition ensures that the overlapping part is correct. But even if that is true, the rest of the string may not match. However, perhaps the first condition is sufficient?\n\nWait, suppose that the overlapping is correct. Then the merged string would be s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. Which is the same as the first part of t (up to L -k) plus s_candidate. But since the first L characters of t is s_candidate, then the first L -k characters of t is s_candidate[:L -k], and the rest of the t (from L -k onwards) must be s_candidate. So the check t[L -k : ] == s_candidate is necessary.\n\nBut why not just check whether the entire string equals s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate? Because that would be equivalent to checking t == (s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate). But since s_candidate is t[:L], and the merged string is s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate, which is t[:L -k] + t[:L]. So the code can check if t equals this.\n\nBut for example, in the first example, t is equal to s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate. So checking that would be sufficient.\n\nBut how to compute that in code?\n\nWell, the code can generate the candidate merged string as s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate, and compare it to t. But since L and k are known, and s_candidate is t[:L], then this can be done.\n\nBut generating that string may be computationally expensive for very long strings, but given the constraints (n up to 100), it's acceptable.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor each possible L in the range:\n\n   k = 2L -n\n\n   s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n   if len(s_candidate) != L → but that's guaranteed since L is chosen such that L <= n-1, and t has length n. So t[:L] is of length L.\n\n   check if s_candidate ends with the first k characters of s_candidate.\n\n   if yes:\n\n      then check if the merged string (s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate) equals t.\n\n      if yes:\n\n          return YES and s_candidate.\n\nSo, the code can proceed with this.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2: 'acacacaca' → Output is 'YES' and 'acaca'.\n\nLet's see. The length of t is 9. So n=9.\n\nL_min is (9 + 2)//2 = 11//2=5. L_max is 8.\n\nSo possible L values are 5,6,7,8.\n\nFor each L:\n\nFor L=5:\n\nk = 2*5 -9 = 10-9=1.\n\nCheck if s_candidate (first 5 chars) is 'acaca'.\n\nCheck if last 1 char of 'acaca' is 'a' and first 1 char is 'a' → yes.\n\nThen check if merged string is s_candidate[:5-1=4] + s_candidate → 'acac' + 'acaca' = 'acacacaca', which is the input. So yes. So this is valid.\n\nThus, output YES and 'acaca'.\n\nAnother possible L is 6:\n\nk = 2*6 -9 = 3.\n\nCheck if the first 6 characters of t (which is 'acacac').\n\nCheck if last 3 chars of s_candidate (i.e., 'cac') equals first 3 chars of s_candidate ('aca')? No. So invalid.\n\nNext, L=7:\n\nk=2*7 -9 = 5.\n\ns_candidate is first 7 chars: 'acacaca'.\n\nCheck last 5 chars of s_candidate: 'acaca' (positions 2-6?), wait:\n\ns_candidate is 'acacaca' (length 7). Last 5 chars are positions 2 to 6 (indices 2,3,4,5,6?), assuming 0-based. Let me see:\n\ns_candidate[-5:] → for length 7, indexes 0-6. -5 is 2. So from index 2 to 6: 'c a c a c a'? Wait:\n\nOriginal s_candidate is 'a c a c a c a' (indices 0-6). So the last 5 characters are indices 2-6: 'a c a c a' → 'acaca'. The first 5 characters are 'acaca' (indices 0-4). So yes, they are equal. Then check if merged string is s_candidate[:7 -5=2] + s_candidate → first 2 characters of s_candidate is 'ac' + 'acacaca' → 'acacacaca' which is the input. So this is also valid. So for L=7, k=5, the s_candidate is 'acacaca' (length 7). So the output could be that as well. However, the sample says that 'acaca' is a possible answer. So the code can return any of them.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, any correct s is acceptable.\n\nSo the code needs to find any such s_candidate.\n\nSo in code, once a valid L is found, return the s_candidate.\n\nNow, the code needs to iterate through possible L in order, and return the first valid s_candidate.\n\nBut what order? For example, in the sample input 2, there are multiple possible Ls. The code can return the first one found.\n\nSo, the code can iterate L from L_min to L_max, and for each L, check the conditions, and return the first valid s_candidate.\n\nNow, let's think about the third sample input: 'abcabc' → output is 'NO'.\n\nn=6.\n\nL_min is (6+2)//2 = 4. L_max is 5.\n\nCheck L=4:\n\nk = 2*4 -6 = 8-6=2.\n\ns_candidate is first 4 characters: 'abca'.\n\nCheck if last 2 chars of s_candidate (i.e., 'ca') equals first 2 chars of s_candidate (i.e., 'ab')? No. So invalid.\n\nL=5:\n\nk= 2*5 -6=4.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 characters: 'abcab'.\n\nCheck if last 4 characters of s_candidate is 'bcab' and first 4 is 'abca'? No. So invalid. Thus, no solution. Hence, output is NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input: 'abababab' → output is 'YES' and 'ababab'.\n\nLet's check. n=8.\n\nL_min is (8 +2)//2 = 5. L_max is 7.\n\nCheck L=5: k=2*5 -8=2. s_candidate is first 5 chars: 'ababa'.\n\nCheck last 2 chars of s_candidate: 'ba' vs first 2 chars 'ab' → no.\n\nL=6: k=12-8=4.\n\ns_candidate is first 6 chars: 'ababab'.\n\nCheck last 4 chars of s_candidate: 'baba' (positions 2-5?), wait:\n\ns_candidate is 'ababab' (length 6). last 4 chars: positions 2-5: 'abab'? Or indexes 2 to 5 (assuming 0-based): indexes 2,3,4,5 → 'abab' (since the string is a b a b a b). So last 4 chars are 'abab' (positions 2-5). First 4 chars are 'abab' → same. So yes. Then check if merged string is s_candidate[:6-4=2] + s_candidate → first 2 chars 'ab' + 'ababab' → 'abababab' which is the input. So yes. So the code returns YES and 'ababab'.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, coding steps:\n\nRead the input string t.\n\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2 → output NO.\n\nElse:\n\ncompute L_min = (n + 2) // 2\n\nL_max = n -1\n\nfor L in range(L_min, L_max + 1):\n\n   k = 2*L -n\n\n   if k <1 or k >= L → but earlier analysis says this is not needed. But perhaps due to integer division, maybe?\n\nWait, earlier analysis said that for L in [L_min, L_max], k is between 1 and L-1. So no need to check again.\n\nBut to be safe, perhaps include the check. But for now, proceed.\n\ns_candidate = t[:L]\n\nif s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n   if t == (s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate):\n\n       print YES and s_candidate.\n\n       exit.\n\nOnce all L are checked, if none found, print NO.\n\nBut how to compute s_candidate[-k:]?\n\nIn Python, s_candidate[-k:] is the last k characters.\n\nBut what if k is zero? Well, in our case, k is at least 1.\n\nSo code:\n\nfor L in range(L_min, L_max + 1):\n\n    k = 2 * L - n\n\n    # check if k is between 1 and L-1?\n\n    # but according to previous analysis, it's not needed.\n\n    s_candidate = t[:L]\n\n    if len(s_candidate) < k:\n\n        # but since k = 2L -n, and L is at least (n+2)//2.\n\n        # Let me see: For example, n=5, L=3. k= 6-5=1. len(s_candidate) is 3 ≥1.\n\n        # So no problem.\n\n    # check if the last k chars of s_candidate equals first k chars.\n\n    if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n\n        # check if the merged string equals t.\n\n        merged = s_candidate[:L -k] + s_candidate\n\n        if merged == t:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n            print(s_candidate)\n\n            exit()\n\nAfter checking all L, print \"NO\".\n\nBut why do we need to check merged == t? Because even though the overlapping part is correct, the rest of the string might not be. For example, imagine that the overlapping part is correct, but the rest of the string is different. But how?\n\nLet me think of a case where the overlapping part is correct but the merged string is not t.\n\nSuppose t is 'aabbaa'.\n\nn=6.\n\nL_min is (6+2)//2 = 4. L_max is 5.\n\nCheck L=4: k= 8-6=2.\n\ns_candidate is first 4 characters: 'aabb'.\n\nCheck if last 2 chars of s_candidate is 'bb' and first 2 is 'aa' → no. So invalid.\n\nCheck L=5: k= 10-6=4.\n\ns_candidate is first 5 chars: 'aabba'.\n\nCheck last 4 chars: 'abba' and first 4: 'aabb' → no. So invalid.\n\nSo no solution.\n\nAnother example: t is 'aaaabaaaa'.\n\nn=9.\n\nLet me think of possible L.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct.\n\nBut why check merged == t? Because the overlapping part is correct, but the rest of the string may not match. For example, suppose that the overlapping part is correct, but the rest of the string is not. How?\n\nLet me think of a scenario where the overlapping is correct, but the merged string is not t.\n\nSuppose t is 'ababa'.\n\nn=5.\n\nL_min is (5+2)//2 = 3.5 → 3.5 floored? Wait, (5+2) is 7, divided by 2 is 3.5. In Python, integer division 7//2 is 3. So L_min is 3, L_max is 4.\n\nFor L=3, k= 6 -5 =1.\n\ns_candidate is first 3 characters: 'aba'.\n\nCheck if last 1 char (a) equals first 1 (a). Yes.\n\nCheck merged string: s_candidate[:3-1=2] + s_candidate → 'ab' + 'aba' = 'ababa' which is t. So valid. So output YES and 'aba'.\n\nBut what if t was 'ab",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string `t` could have been formed by merging two identical messages `s` with an error. The error occurs when two identical messages are sent consecutively and they merge by overlapping. The overlap must be such that some part of the end of the first message matches the start of the second message, with the overlap length being positive and less than the length of the message.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand the Overlap Constraints**: For a string `t` of length `n`, we need to check possible lengths `L` of the original message `s` such that `2L - k = n` where `k` is the overlap length. Here, `k` must be between 1 and `L-1`.\n2. **Determine Valid Ranges for L**: Calculate the minimum and maximum possible values for `L` based on the constraints derived from the overlap conditions.\n3. **Check Each Possible Length**: For each valid length `L`, compute the corresponding overlap length `k` and check if the first `L` characters of `t` can form a valid message `s` such that the overlap conditions are satisfied.\n4. **Validation**: Ensure that the merged string formed by overlapping two instances of `s` matches the given string `t`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nt = input().strip()\nn = len(t)\n\nif n < 2:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    found = False\n    L_min = (n + 2) // 2\n    L_max = n - 1\n    for L in range(L_min, L_max + 1):\n        k = 2 * L - n\n        if k < 1 or k >= L:\n            continue\n        s_candidate = t[:L]\n        if s_candidate[-k:] == s_candidate[:k]:\n            merged = s_candidate[:L - k] + s_candidate\n            if merged == t:\n                print(\"YES\")\n                print(s_candidate)\n                found = True\n                break\n    if not found:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input string `t` and determine its length `n`.\n2. **Edge Case Check**: If the length of `t` is less than 2, immediately output \"NO\" as it's impossible to form a valid message with such a short string.\n3. **Range Calculation**: Calculate the minimum (`L_min`) and maximum (`L_max`) possible lengths for the original message `s`.\n4. **Iterate Over Possible Lengths**: For each possible length `L` within the calculated range, compute the overlap length `k` and check if the first `L` characters of `t` can form a valid message `s`.\n5. **Overlap Check**: Verify if the last `k` characters of the candidate message `s` match the first `k` characters, ensuring a valid overlap.\n6. **Merged String Check**: Construct the merged string using the candidate message and check if it matches the original string `t`. If valid, print \"YES\" followed by the candidate message and exit. If no valid message is found after all iterations, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible valid configurations for the original message `s` and ensures correctness by validating both the overlap and the merged string against the input.",
