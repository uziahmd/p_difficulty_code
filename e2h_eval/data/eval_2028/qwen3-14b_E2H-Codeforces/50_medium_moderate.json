    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding the sum of d(1,n) for all good trees. Let me first understand what a good tree is.\n\nSo, a good tree is an edge-weighted tree where each edge has weight 1 or -1. And for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i must be -1. Oh right, because each vertex's edges' product is -1. \n\nLet me think about the constraints here. For each vertex, the product of its adjacent edges is -1. So, for example, if a vertex has degree k, then the product of those k edges is -1. Since each edge is either 1 or -1, the product being -1 implies that there must be an odd number of -1 edges incident to that vertex. Because multiplying an odd number of -1s gives -1, and even gives 1. \n\nSo each vertex must have an odd degree in terms of the number of -1 edges. Wait, but the actual degree of the vertex (number of edges) could be anything. But the count of -1 edges incident to it must be odd. \n\nBut how does this affect the structure of the tree? Let me think. Let's consider the entire tree. Each edge connects two vertices. Suppose we take the product of all the edges around each vertex. For each edge, it contributes to two vertices. So if I take the product of all the vertex products, each edge's weight is multiplied twice (once for each endpoint). Therefore, the product of all vertex products is equal to the product of (each edge's weight)^2. Which is 1, since any number squared is 1. \n\nBut the product of all vertex products is (-1)^n, because each vertex contributes -1. So (-1)^n must equal 1. Which implies that n must be even. Wait, that's a key point. \n\nWait, if n is odd, then (-1)^n is -1, but the product of all the vertex products is 1. That would be impossible. Therefore, when n is odd, there are no good trees. So for any odd n ≥ 1, the answer is zero. \n\nLooking at the sample input: the second test case is n=1. Wait, n=1. Then, there are no edges. But the condition is that for each vertex (only one vertex here), the product of the edges incident to it is -1. But there are no edges, so the product is 1 (product of zero elements is 1?), which is not -1. So for n=1, there are no good trees, hence the answer is 0. Which matches the sample input's second case where output is 0. \n\nSo the first thing to check is whether n is even. If n is odd, the answer is zero. But wait, for n=1, it's odd, and answer is zero. For n=2, even, possible. So for the general case, when n is odd, output 0. Otherwise, proceed. \n\nSo that's a crucial observation. So for n odd, output is zero. For even n, proceed. \n\nNow, the problem reduces to handling even n. Let's proceed under the assumption that n is even. \n\nNow, the problem is to compute the sum of d(1, n) over all good trees. \n\nBut how do we model the good trees? Let's think about the constraints again. Each vertex must have an odd number of edges with weight -1. \n\nBut since each edge is between two vertices, changing the weight of an edge affects two vertices. \n\nThis seems like a system of constraints. Let me think about the degrees. Let me think of the variables as the edges. Each edge can be assigned a value of +1 or -1. Let me denote the edges as variables. \n\nFor each vertex v, the product of the edges adjacent to v is -1. Let me take the logarithm? No, maybe not. Alternatively, think in terms of parity. Since the product is -1, the number of -1 edges adjacent to v must be odd. \n\nSo, for each vertex v, the number of edges incident to v that are -1 is odd. \n\nLet me model this as a system of linear equations over GF(2). Let me think: for each vertex, the sum (mod 2) of the variables (where each variable is 1 if the edge is -1, 0 otherwise) equals 1. \n\nBut the variables here are the edges. However, each edge is connected to two vertices. So, for each edge e between u and v, the variable x_e (which is 1 if the edge is -1, 0 otherwise) contributes to the equations of u and v. \n\nSo, the system of equations is:\n\nFor each vertex v, sum_{e incident to v} x_e ≡ 1 mod 2. \n\nBut this is a system of n equations. However, there's a dependency between them. Let me see: summing all equations, each x_e is counted twice (once for each endpoint). So the sum of all left-hand sides is 2 * sum x_e ≡ 0 mod 2. The sum of the right-hand sides is n * 1 mod 2. So for this system to be consistent, n must be even. Which aligns with our previous observation. So when n is even, the system is consistent, and when n is odd, it's inconsistent. \n\nTherefore, for even n, there are solutions. Now, the number of solutions depends on the rank of the system. \n\nBut how many solutions are there? Let's think about the system. The system is for a tree. The tree has n-1 edges. The system has n equations, but they are not all independent. \n\nThe sum of all equations is 0 mod 2 (as discussed), and since n is even, the sum of the RHS is n mod 2 = 0. So the system is consistent. The rank of the system is n-1. Therefore, the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (n-1)} } ? Wait, the system has n equations, but the rank is n-1. So the number of solutions is 2^{(number of variables - rank)}. The variables are the edges, which are n-1 variables. The rank is n-1, so the number of solutions is 2^{ (n-1) - (n-1) } } = 1. Wait, but that would imply that there's only one solution. But that's impossible. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The system is for a tree. Let me think for a specific example. Take n=2. There is one edge between 1 and 2. The equations are: for vertex 1, x_1 ≡ 1 mod 2. For vertex 2, x_1 ≡ 1 mod 2. So the system has only one equation (since the two equations are the same). The solution is x_1 = 1. Which is the case in the first sample input. So for n=2, the number of solutions is 1. Which fits with the formula. \n\nBut for n=4, how many solutions are there? Let's think. Suppose we have a tree with 4 nodes. How many ways to assign the edge weights such that each node has an odd number of -1 edges. \n\nBut according to the system, the number of solutions is 2^{(n-1) - (rank)}. The rank is n-1 - 1? Or what?\n\nWait, the system is n equations, but with one dependency. So the rank is n-1. The variables are n-1. So the number of solutions is 2^{ (n-1) - (n-1) } } = 1. So for any tree structure, the system of equations has exactly one solution. \n\nWait, that's strange. Because for a given tree structure, the equations are dependent. So for any tree structure, there's exactly one way to assign the edge weights to satisfy the conditions. \n\nBut that would mean that the number of good trees is equal to the number of trees multiplied by 1. But according to the note for n=4, there are 16 good trees. Let's check. \n\nFor n=4, the number of trees is 4^{2} = 16. And according to the note, there are 16 good trees. Which matches with the idea that for each tree, there is exactly one way to assign the edge weights. \n\nYes! Because for each tree structure, there's exactly one assignment of edge weights (each edge is either 1 or -1) that satisfies the condition. So the total number of good trees is equal to the number of trees (n^{n-2}) multiplied by 1. \n\nSo, for each tree structure, there's exactly one way to assign the edge weights. Therefore, the total number of good trees is n^{n-2}.\n\nWait, but the sample for n=4 says there are 16 good trees. For n=4, the number of trees is 4^{2} = 16. Which matches. So yes. \n\nSo the problem now becomes: for each tree structure, compute d(1, n) under the unique valid edge weight assignment, and sum all these values over all possible tree structures. \n\nBut how can we compute this sum? Because considering all possible trees is computationally impossible for large n. We need a mathematical formula. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to: for all possible trees on n nodes, compute the sum of d(1,n) where the edge weights are uniquely determined by the condition that each node has an odd number of -1 edges. \n\nBut how to find this sum?\n\nFirst, let's think about how the edge weights are determined for a given tree. For a given tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined by the system of equations. Let's think about how to compute them. \n\nEach edge is part of the equations for its two endpoints. Let me think of the system of equations again. For each node, the sum of x_e (for edges adjacent to it) is 1 mod 2. \n\nThis system can be solved as follows. Since the system is connected (the tree is connected), the system has a unique solution. \n\nBut how to find the solution? Let me think. Let me pick a root, say node 1. Then, perform a traversal of the tree, determining the edge weights. \n\nAlternatively, think of the tree as a graph. Let me consider the system as a set of equations. Let me think of the variables x_e (each is 0 or 1, representing whether the edge is -1 or 1). \n\nBut since the system is over GF(2), and the equations are that for each node, the sum of x_e for adjacent edges is 1. \n\nLet me think about the solution. Let me imagine that for each node except one, we can assign variables based on the equations, and the last equation will be determined. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this. Let me think of the tree as rooted at node 1. For each node, except the root, we can determine the edge between it and its parent. \n\nSuppose we have a tree with root at node 1. For each node u (other than root), we can assign x_e (the edge from u to parent) as follows. Let me think recursively. \n\nBut how? Let me think of the equations. For the root node, the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. For each other node, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. \n\nBut for a node u that is not the root, suppose we have already determined the x_e for all edges except the one connecting u to its parent. Let's say that the sum of x_e for the edges adjacent to u (excluding the edge to parent) is s. Then, the edge to parent must be 1 - s mod 2. \n\nWait, that's a possible approach. Let me think. For example, take a tree rooted at node 1. For each node u (other than root), we can process it in a way that when we reach it, all its children have been processed. \n\nBut perhaps the solution can be found by choosing arbitrary values for some edges, and then determining others. However, since the system is determined uniquely, there's only one solution. \n\nAlternatively, think of the solution as follows: For any tree, the solution is determined by the following. Let me choose an arbitrary spanning tree (but the tree is already given). For each node, the sum of the edges adjacent to it is 1. \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to express the edge weights in terms of the structure of the tree. \n\nAlternatively, think of the system as follows. Let me define for each node, the sum of x_e for edges adjacent to it is 1. \n\nIf I consider the entire tree, and think of the variables x_e as the edge weights (with 0 for 1 and 1 for -1), then the system is equivalent to:\n\nsum_{e adjacent to v} x_e = 1 mod 2 for all v.\n\nLet me think of the system as a vector equation. Let me think of the variables as x_e. The system is Ax = 1, where A is the incidence matrix of the tree (mod 2), and 1 is the all-ones vector. \n\nBut since the tree is connected, the incidence matrix has rank n-1. The system Ax = 1 has a solution if and only if the sum of the equations is 0 mod 2, which is true when n is even. \n\nBut how to find x? \n\nIn graph theory, the incidence matrix of a tree has rank n-1. The solution to Ax = b is unique up to adding a vector in the kernel. But since the kernel of A is the space of vectors that are constant on the connected components. Since the tree is connected, the kernel is just the scalar multiples of the all-ones vector. However, since the system Ax = 1 is solvable, the solution is unique modulo the kernel. But since the system is Ax = 1, and the kernel is the set of vectors where all entries are equal. So, if we have a solution x, then any other solution is x + c * 1, where c is a scalar. However, since the system Ax = 1, adding c * 1 to x would give Ax + A(c * 1) = 1 + c * (A1). But A1 is the sum of each row of A. Each row of A has exactly the degree of the vertex, mod 2. For a tree, each row has degree of the vertex. However, since the tree has n nodes and n-1 edges, the sum of all degrees is 2(n-1). So, each row's sum is the degree of the node. \n\nBut for the system Ax = 1, the solution is unique. Because the system has rank n-1, and the solution is unique once we fix one variable. \n\nBut perhaps there's a more straightforward way. Let me think of the tree as a rooted tree. Let me pick any root, say node 1. For each node, except the root, I can determine the value of the edge between it and its parent. \n\nLet me consider the root. For the root, the sum of all edges adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. Let me assume that for each child of the root, we can determine the edge's value based on the children's constraints. \n\nWait, here's an approach. Let me root the tree at node 1. For each node u (other than root), we can set the edge between u and its parent as follows: \n\nLet me consider the subtree rooted at u. For each node in the subtree, the sum of their edges must be 1. But how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, for each node u (other than root), let me process the tree in a post-order traversal. For each node u, after processing all its children, we can determine the value of the edge between u and its parent. \n\nLet me think. Suppose I have a node u with parent p. Let me assume that for all children of u (except p), their edges to u have been determined. Let me denote the sum of x_e for all edges adjacent to u, except the edge to p. Let's call this sum s. Then, the equation for u requires that s + x_pu = 1 mod 2. Therefore, x_pu = (1 - s) mod 2. \n\nThis seems promising. So, for each node u (other than the root), we can determine the value of the edge between u and its parent based on the sum of the edges in its subtree. \n\nBut how do we compute s? Let's think recursively. For the root node, we have no parent, so the sum of all edges adjacent to it must be 1 mod 2. However, the root's edges are to its children. So, for the root, the sum of the edges to its children must be 1 mod 2. \n\nWait, but according to this approach, the root's edge values are determined by the children's processing. However, the root's equation is that the sum of its edges is 1 mod 2. But how do we ensure that? \n\nLet me think through an example. Suppose the tree is a straight line: 1-2-3-4. Root is 1. Let's process node 2 first. Node 2's children are 3. Wait, maybe I should think of the tree as a rooted tree with parent pointers. \n\nLet me think of the tree as rooted at node 1. For each node, except root, we have a parent. \n\nProcessing nodes in post-order traversal (children first, then parent). For each node u (not root), after processing all children, we can calculate the sum of the edges adjacent to u, excluding the edge to parent. Let's call this sum s. Then, the edge to parent is set to (1 - s) mod 2. \n\nOnce all nodes are processed, we have to check that the root's equation is satisfied. However, since the system is consistent, the root's equation will automatically be satisfied. \n\nLet me verify this. Suppose we process all nodes in post-order. For the root, which has no parent, the sum of all edges adjacent to it (which are edges to its children) is the sum of the x_e's for those edges. According to the processing steps, each of those edges was determined based on the children's processing. But how does that ensure that the sum is 1 mod 2?\n\nWell, the system of equations is designed to ensure that. Since the system has a unique solution, the way we process the tree ensures that all equations are satisfied. \n\nSo, this suggests that the edge weights can be uniquely determined by this method. \n\nBut how does this relate to the distance d(1, n)? \n\nThe distance d(1, n) is the sum of the weights of the edges along the path from 1 to n. \n\nLet me think about the edge weights. Each edge's weight is either 1 or -1. But in the system above, the x_e variables are 0 or 1, where x_e is 1 if the edge is -1, else 1. So, the actual weight is (-1)^{x_e}. \n\nBut the distance d(1, n) is the sum of the weights along the path. Let me denote the path from 1 to n as a sequence of edges e_1, e_2, ..., e_k. Then, d(1, n) is sum_{i=1}^k (-1)^{x_{e_i}}. \n\nBut how can we find this sum for all trees, summed over all trees? \n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps there's a way to find the expected value of d(1, n) over all trees, and multiply by the number of trees. But since the number of trees is n^{n-2}, and each contributes some value, the total sum is (number of trees) * E[d(1,n)], where E is the expectation. \n\nBut how to compute E[d(1,n)]?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each edge, the contribution to d(1, n) across all trees. \n\nBut since d(1,n) is the sum of edge weights along the path from 1 to n, the total sum over all trees is the sum over all trees of [sum_{e in path} w_e] = sum_{e} [sum_{trees where e is on the path from 1 to n} w_e]. \n\nBut how to compute this? \n\nBut since each tree is considered with its unique edge weights, and the edge weights depend on the structure of the tree. \n\nAlternatively, for a given edge e, what is the contribution of e to the total sum? It depends on whether e lies on the path from 1 to n in the tree, and the weight of e in that tree. \n\nBut this seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, let's think about the relationship between the edge weights and the structure of the tree. For a given tree, the edge weights are determined by the system of equations. \n\nLet me think of the edge weights as determined by the process of assigning values based on the post-order traversal. \n\nLet me consider the path from node 1 to node n. Let's denote this path as P. The sum d(1, n) is the sum of the weights of the edges in P. \n\nBut how can I find this sum for all trees? \n\nPerhaps there's a clever way to model the contribution of each edge. \n\nLet me think about the variables. For each tree, the edge weights are determined uniquely. For each edge e, let me find the expected value of its weight (either 1 or -1) multiplied by the indicator that e is on the path from 1 to n. Then, the total sum would be the sum over all edges e of [expected value] * (number of trees). \n\nBut how to compute this expected value? \n\nAlternatively, for each tree, the edge weights are determined by the system of equations. So, for each edge e, its weight is determined by the structure of the tree. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think of the tree as rooted at 1, and for each node, the edge from the node to its parent is determined by the process I described earlier. Let me consider the edge between node u and its parent p. \n\nLet me denote the value of this edge as w(u), which is either 1 or -1. \n\nThen, the weight of the edge from u to p is determined by the sum of the edges in the subtree rooted at u. \n\nBut how? Let's think again. \n\nIn the earlier approach, for each node u (not root), during the post-order traversal, we calculate the sum of the x_e's for the edges in its subtree (excluding the edge to parent). Let's call this sum s. Then, the edge to parent is x_pu = (1 - s) mod 2. \n\nSo, the x_pu is 1 if s is 0, and 0 if s is 1. \n\nBut the actual weight of the edge is (-1)^{x_pu}. So, the weight is -1 if x_pu is 1, and 1 otherwise. \n\nLet me denote the weight of the edge from u to its parent as w(u). So, w(u) = (-1)^{x_pu} = (-1)^{1 - s} = (-1)^{1} * (-1)^{-s} = - (-1)^{s}. \n\nBut since s is the sum of x_e's for edges in the subtree of u (excluding the edge to parent). \n\nBut s is the sum of x_e's for edges adjacent to u's children. \n\nWait, but how is s computed? \n\nLet me think recursively. For each node u, after processing all children, the sum s is the sum of x_e's for edges from u to its children. \n\nBut each of those x_e's is determined by the same process. For example, for each child v of u, the edge from v to u has x_v = (1 - s_v), where s_v is the sum of x_e's for edges in the subtree of v (excluding the edge to u). \n\nBut this seems complex. However, perhaps there's a pattern here. \n\nLet me think about the product of the weights along the path from node 1 to node n. \n\nAlternatively, think about the sum d(1, n) as the sum of the weights of the edges on the path. \n\nBut for each tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined. So, perhaps there's a relation between the structure of the tree and the value of d(1, n). \n\nAlternatively, since the system of equations is linear over GF(2), perhaps there's a way to find the value of d(1, n) in terms of some properties of the tree. \n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's think differently. \n\nLet me consider that for any tree, the value of d(1, n) is equal to the number of edges on the path from 1 to n with weight -1 minus the number of edges with weight 1. Because each edge contributes either +1 or -1. \n\nBut the sum is equal to (number of -1 edges on path) * (-1) + (number of +1 edges on path) * 1 = (number of +1 edges - number of -1 edges) = (total edges on path) - 2 * (number of -1 edges on path). \n\nAlternatively, the sum is equal to (number of edges on path) * 1 - 2 * (number of -1 edges on path). \n\nBut how to find this for all trees?\n\nAnother approach: since the edge weights are uniquely determined for each tree, perhaps we can find a relationship between the structure of the tree and the value of d(1, n). \n\nLet me think of the entire tree. For each node, the product of the edge weights around it is -1. \n\nBut the product of all edge weights around a node is -1. So, for node 1, the product of all edges adjacent to it is -1. Similarly for node n. \n\nBut the path from 1 to n has some edges. Let me consider the product of the edge weights along the path. \n\nWait, but how does that relate to the product of all edges around node 1 and node n?\n\nAlternatively, think about the entire tree. Let me imagine that I traverse from node 1 to node n along the path P. Let me denote the edges on this path as e_1, e_2, ..., e_k. \n\nEach of these edges has a weight w_i. The sum d(1, n) is sum w_i. \n\nNow, for each node along the path, except for the endpoints, the edges on the path contribute to their degree. \n\nBut perhaps I need to find some invariant or property that can be used. \n\nLet me think of the entire tree. For each node, the product of its adjacent edges is -1. \n\nLet me consider the product of all these products for all nodes. As mentioned earlier, this product is (-1)^n. But also, each edge is counted twice (once for each endpoint), so the product is the product of (w_e)^2 for all edges. Which is 1. Hence, (-1)^n = 1 → n is even. Which we already know. \n\nBut perhaps I can find something else. \n\nLet me consider the product of all the edge weights around node 1. This product is -1. Similarly for node n. \n\nBut the product of the edge weights around node 1 includes all edges incident to node 1. The path from node 1 to node n starts with one of these edges. Let me say that the path from node 1 to node n has m edges. Then, the product of all edges incident to node 1 is -1. This includes the edge along the path (say, e_1) and other edges (if node 1 has degree > 1). \n\nBut I don't see a direct connection to the sum of the path's weights. \n\nAlternative idea: Let's consider that for any tree, the sum d(1, n) is equal to -1 multiplied by the number of edges on the path from 1 to n. Wait, that can't be right. For example, in the first sample input where n=2, the path has one edge with weight -1, so sum is -1, which matches. \n\nBut what about for n=4, the sample says that the sum is -10. Let's think about the average. For n=4, there are 16 trees. The sum is -10. So average is -10/16 = -5/8. \n\nNot sure. \n\nAnother idea: Let me think of the value of d(1, n) for a given tree. Since each edge weight is determined uniquely by the system, perhaps there's a way to express d(1, n) in terms of the number of nodes or something else. \n\nLet me think about the entire tree. The sum of all d(1, v) for all v might have some properties. But not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think of the sum of all d(1, v) over all v. But not sure. \n\nWait, but the problem only asks for d(1, n). \n\nLet me try to find for a given tree, what is the value of d(1, n). \n\nLet me consider the tree as rooted at 1. For each node u, let me define f(u) as the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to u. Then, f(n) is what we need. \n\nNow, for the root, f(1) = 0. For each child v of the root, the path from 1 to v is just the edge from 1 to v. So f(v) = w(1,v). \n\nFor other nodes, f(u) = f(p) + w(p, u), where p is the parent of u. \n\nBut how can we find f(u) for all u? \n\nBut the edge weights are determined by the system of equations. So for each node u, the product of the weights of all edges incident to u is -1. \n\nLet me denote that for each node u, the product of the weights of all edges incident to u is -1. \n\nBut how does this relate to f(u)? \n\nFor example, consider node u. The edges incident to u are the edge to its parent p, and the edges to its children. The product of all these weights is -1. \n\nBut the product of the weights of the edges to the children and the parent is -1. \n\nLet me think about the product of the weights of the edges incident to u. Let me denote the weight of the edge between u and its parent as w_p. And the weights of the edges between u and its children as w_1, w_2, ..., w_k. Then, the product is w_p * w_1 * w_2 * ... * w_k = -1. \n\nBut for each child v of u, the weight of the edge between u and v is determined during the post-order traversal. \n\nBut I'm not seeing a direct way to relate this to f(u). \n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose I have a tree rooted at 1, and for each node u, I have f(u) = sum of weights along the path from 1 to u. \n\nFor the root, f(1) = 0. \n\nFor each node u, the product of the weights of all edges incident to u is -1. This includes the edge to its parent and all edges to children. \n\nLet me think of the product for node u. Let me denote the product as P_u = -1. \n\nThe product P_u = w_p * product_{v is child of u} (w_{u,v}).\n\nBut for each child v of u, the weight w_{u,v} is determined by the system of equations. \n\nBut how does this help us with f(u)? \n\nMaybe not directly. \n\nAnother idea: Let's think about the entire tree. For each edge e, let me denote its weight as w_e. The sum of all d(1, v) for v in the tree is equal to the sum over all edges e of (number of nodes in the subtree of e that are on the side away from the root) * w_e. \n\nBut this is similar to the concept of contribution of edges to all paths. However, I'm not sure if this helps. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem requires the sum of d(1, n) over all trees, perhaps there's a symmetry or combinatorial argument that allows us to compute this sum without considering each tree individually. \n\nLet me think about the following: for each tree, the value of d(1, n) is equal to -1 multiplied by the number of edges on the path from 1 to n. Is this possible? \n\nIn the first sample, n=2, the path has 1 edge, and the sum is -1. Which matches. \n\nIn the third sample, n=4. The sum of d(1,4) over all 16 trees is -10. Let's see what would happen if it were -k, where k is the number of edges on the path. For example, if the path has 2 edges, then each tree contributes -2, and 16 * -2 = -32, which doesn't match the sample's -10. So this hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nAnother idea: Perhaps the value of d(1, n) is equal to -1 for all trees. But the sample for n=4 shows that it varies between -2, -1, 0, 1. So that's not the case. \n\nHmm. \n\nLet me think about the system of equations again. For a given tree, the edge weights are uniquely determined. Let me consider that for any tree, the value of d(1, n) is equal to the number of edges on the path from 1 to n with weight -1 minus the number of edges with weight 1. \n\nBut how to find this? \n\nLet me think of the path from 1 to n. Let's say it has k edges. Let m be the number of edges with weight -1 on this path. Then, the sum is m * (-1) + (k - m) * 1 = k - 2m. \n\nSo, d(1, n) = k - 2m. \n\nBut how to find m? \n\nBut m is the number of edges on the path from 1 to n that are assigned -1. \n\nBut how is this determined by the system of equations? \n\nLet me think about the process of assigning edge weights. For each node u, the edge from u to its parent is determined based on the sum of the x_e's in its subtree. \n\nLet me think of the root node 1. Its children are connected via edges. For each child v of 1, during the post-order traversal, the edge from v to 1 is determined based on the sum of the x_e's in the subtree of v. \n\nLet me consider the entire tree. The value of d(1, n) depends on the path from 1 to n and the weights of the edges along that path. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nMaybe it's helpful to realize that the system of equations leads to certain properties about the tree. For example, the sum of the weights along any path from 1 to another node may have certain properties. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the sum of the weights along any path from 1 to v is equal to the number of times -1 appears on the path minus the number of 1's. \n\nBut how does this relate to the system of equations? \n\nLet me think about the root node. The product of all edges incident to the root is -1. Let's say the root has degree d. The number of -1 edges incident to it is odd. \n\nBut how does this affect the path from the root to other nodes?\n\nAnother idea: Let's consider the entire tree. Let me imagine that I assign to each node u a value of f(u) = d(1, u). Then, for any edge between u and v, the value of f(v) = f(u) + w(u, v). \n\nNow, for each node u, the product of the weights of all edges incident to u is -1. Let me consider the product of the weights of the edges incident to u. This product is equal to the product of w(u, v) for all neighbors v of u. \n\nBut for each neighbor v of u, we have f(v) = f(u) + w(u, v). Rearranging, w(u, v) = f(v) - f(u). \n\nSo, the product of all w(u, v) for neighbors v of u is equal to the product of (f(v) - f(u)) for all v adjacent to u. And this product must be -1. \n\nSo, for each node u, product_{v ∈ adj(u)} (f(v) - f(u)) = -1. \n\nThis seems like a complex equation, but perhaps there's a way to find f(u) for all nodes. \n\nFor example, the root node u=1 has f(1) = 0. Let's see what the equation for node 1 looks like. \n\nFor node 1, the product of (f(v) - 0) for all neighbors v is -1. So, product(f(v)) = -1. \n\nFor any other node u, the product of (f(v) - f(u)) for all neighbors v is -1. \n\nBut how can we use this to find f(u)? \n\nThis seems very abstract. Maybe there's a pattern here. \n\nLet me think about the function f(u). For the root, f(1) = 0. Let's assume that for all nodes u, f(u) is an integer",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the sum of the distances $d(1, n)$ for all good edge-weighted trees with $n$ vertices.

Hence, the answer is 0.\n2. **Tree Structure and Constraints**: For even $n$, each tree structure can have exactly one valid assignment of edge weights that satisfies the conditions. This is derived from solving a system of linear equations over GF(2).\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance $d(1, n)$ for a given tree is the sum of the weights along the path from node 1 to node $n$.
