Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, for each cell in the grid, determine if it's on either of the two diagonals. For a square of size n x n (where n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). \n\nFor each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So, any cell that is on either of these two lines is part of the diagonals.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's say the diagonal character is 'd'.\n- Check that all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same, and that they are not equal to 'd'.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal characters. Then check that they are all the same. Then collect all non-diagonal characters and check they are all same and different from the diagonal.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the two diagonals have different characters. For example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'y', then that's invalid. So the first step is to check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. So, collect all the cells from both diagonals and check they are all the same.\n\nWait, but the two diagonals might overlap. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when collecting the diagonal cells, we need to make sure that we don't have duplicates. But for checking, it's okay to check that all cells in the diagonals are same. Because even if a cell is part of both diagonals, it's still part of the diagonals and needs to be same as others.\n\nSo the process would be:\n\n- Iterate through all cells in the grid. For each cell, check if it is on either diagonal. If yes, collect its value. Then check that all these values are the same. Let's call this value 'd'.\n\n- Then, collect all the cells that are not on either diagonal. Check that all these values are the same, and that they are not equal to 'd'.\n\nIf both conditions are satisfied, output YES. Otherwise, NO.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is n, then n lines each with n characters.\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j):\n\nCheck if i == j or i + j == n-1. If yes, it's a diagonal cell. Else, non-diagonal.\n\nSo, let's collect the diagonal characters and non-diagonal characters.\n\nBut perhaps, for efficiency, we can check for each cell whether it's part of the diagonals. For each cell in the grid:\n\nLoop through each row i from 0 to n-1, and each column j from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1: it's a diagonal cell.\n\nElse: non-diagonal.\n\nNow, for all diagonal cells, check that they are all the same. Then, for all non-diagonal cells, check that they are all same and different from the diagonal.\n\nBut how to collect those values?\n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize a set for diagonal characters. For each diagonal cell, add the character to this set. If the size of the set is more than 1, then it's invalid.\n\nSimilarly for non-diagonal cells. Collect their characters into another set, check that the size is 1, and that the element is different from the diagonal's element.\n\nBut wait, the diagonal's set may have only one element. So, for example, if all diagonal cells are same, then the set has size 1. Similarly for non-diagonal.\n\nSo steps:\n\nCheck that all diagonal cells are same. Then check that all non-diagonal cells are same and different from the diagonal.\n\nBut how to handle the case where the non-diagonal cells are empty? Well, since n is at least 3, and odd. For example, n=3. The diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping in the middle. So total diagonal cells is 2n-1. For n=3, 5 cells. The non-diagonal cells are 9-5 =4 cells. So for n=3, non-diagonal cells are 4. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells. So for any n >=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is n^2 - (2n-1) = (n^2 -2n +1) = (n-1)^2. Which for n >=3 is positive. So there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line is a string of length n. Let's store them as a grid, perhaps a list of lists.\n\nThen:\n\nCollect all diagonal characters. Let's create a set called diag_chars.\n\nCollect all non-diagonal characters in another set called non_diag_chars.\n\nBut for the diag_chars, we need to check that all are same. So, for example, if the grid is:\n\nx o o o x\n\no x o o o\n\no o x o o\n\no o o x o\n\nx o o o x\n\nThen, the diagonals are the main and anti-diagonal. All x's. So diag_chars is {'x'}, and non-diag chars are o's. So that's valid.\n\nBut for the first example in the input:\n\nInput is 5, and the grid is:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo, let's see. The diagonals are:\n\nLooking at each cell (i,j) where i==j or i +j =4 (since n=5, 0-based).\n\nFor i=0, j=0 (main diagonal) and j=4 (anti-diagonal). So for row 0, the first and last characters are x and x. So that's x. Then row 1: j=1 (i=1) and j=3 (i=1 + j=3=4). So for row 1, the characters are o and o. Then row 2: j=2 (i=2) and j=2 (since i=2, j=2, i +j =4? 2+2=4? Yes. So for row 2, j=2 is part of both diagonals. So the cell is 's' (from the third row, which is 'soxoo'). So the third row is s o x o o. So (2,2) is x? Wait, the third line is 'soxoo' — so indexes 0: s, 1: o, 2: x, 3: o, 4: o. So for row 2, i=2. The main diagonal is j=2. So cell (2,2) is x. Also, for anti-diagonal, i +j =4. For i=2, j=2. So yes. So that's part of both. So for the diagonals, the cell (2,2) is x. But in the third row, the cell (2,2) is x. But the third row is 'soxoo' — yes. So the diagonals for this example:\n\nLooking at each cell in the diagonals:\n\nRow 0: positions 0 and 4 → x and x.\n\nRow 1: positions 1 and 3 → o and o.\n\nRow 2: position 2 → x (since i=j=2, and i+j=4 → same cell).\n\nRow 3: positions 1 and 3 → o and o.\n\nRow 4: positions 0 and 4 → x and x.\n\nSo the diagonals have x, o, x, o, x, o, x, o, x? Wait, let's count all the cells in the diagonals. For n=5, the main diagonal has 5 cells (i=0-4, j=i). The anti-diagonal has 5 cells (i + j =4). However, the cell (2,2) is in both. So total unique cells is 5 +5 -1 =9 cells.\n\nSo for the first example, the diagonals are:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0) x; (1,1) o; (2,2) x; (3,3) o; (4,4) x.\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,4) x; (1,3) o; (2,2) x; (3,1) o; (4,0) x.\n\nSo combining all, the diagonal cells are x, o, x, o, x, x, o, x, o, x? Wait, no. Wait for the main diagonal, the cells are (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). The anti-diagonal is (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0). So when combined, the union is all these cells. So the values are:\n\nMain diagonal: x, o, x, o, x.\n\nAnti-diagonal: x, o, x, o, x.\n\nBut since (2,2) is counted in both, but the set is collected once. So the diagonal cells are:\n\nx, o, x, o, x, x, o, x, o, x? No, no. Wait, the main diagonal has 5 elements, the anti-diagonal has 5 elements, but overlapping in one element. So the total number of unique cells is 5 + 5 - 1 = 9. So the values are:\n\nLooking at each cell in the diagonals:\n\n(0,0) x\n\n(0,4) x\n\n(1,1) o\n\n(1,3) o\n\n(2,2) x\n\n(3,1) o\n\n(3,3) o\n\n(4,0) x\n\n(4,4) x\n\nSo the values are x, x, o, o, x, o, o, x, x. So the set of these values is {x, o}. So the diag_chars set would have size 2, which is invalid. Hence, the first example outputs NO, which matches the sample input.\n\nSo the code needs to check that all the diagonal cells are the same. So in this case, the first example's diagonals have x and o, so the set is of size 2. Therefore, the answer is NO.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. For all cells in the grid, check if they are on either diagonal. Collect all their characters into a set. If the size is not 1, return NO.\n\n2. Then, collect all non-diagonal cells into another set. If the size is not 1, return NO.\n\n3. Also, check that the non-diagonal set's element is different from the diagonal's element.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, return YES, else NO.\n\nSo, how to implement this in Python?\n\nFirst, read n.\n\nThen read n lines. Let's read them as a list of strings. For example, grid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j), check if i == j or i + j == n-1.\n\nSo, for all i in 0..n-1, j in 0..n-1:\n\nWe can loop through each cell.\n\nInitialize diag_chars as a set. non_diag_chars as another set.\n\nBut for each cell, check if it's on the diagonal. If yes, add to diag_chars. Else, add to non_diag_chars.\n\nOnce all cells are processed, check:\n\nif len(diag_chars) != 1 → NO.\n\nElse, check len(non_diag_chars) != 1 → NO.\n\nElse, check that diag_chars.pop() != non_diag_chars.pop() → if not, NO.\n\nElse, YES.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut for n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 9 - 5 =4. So yes, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\ndiag_chars = set()\n\nnon_diag_chars = set()\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    for j in range(n):\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diag_chars) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelif len(non_diag_chars) != 1:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if diag_chars.pop() == non_diag_chars.pop():\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\nWait, but for the first example, the diag_chars would have x and o. So len(diag_chars) is 2 → output NO.\n\nIn the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2 is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\nFor i=0, j=0 (w) and j=2 (w). So added to diag_chars.\n\ni=1, j=1 (w) and i+j=2 → j=1 (since i=1, j=1 → 1+1=2? n=3, n-1=2. So yes. So for i=1, j=1 is on both diagonals. So the cell is w.\n\ni=2, j=2 (w) and j=0 (w). So the diag_chars are {w}.\n\nnon-diagonal cells are:\n\nFor cell (0,1): s → added to non_diag.\n\ncell (0,2) is part of diagonal.\n\ncell (1,0): s → added.\n\ncell (1,2): s → added.\n\ncell (2,1): s → added.\n\nSo non_diag_chars is {s}.\n\nSo diag is {w}, non-diag {s} → different. So output YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0 (x) and j=2 (x) → added.\n\ni=1, j=1 (x) and i + j = 2 → j=1 (i=1, j=1 → 1+1=2? Yes. So cell is x.\n\ni=2, j=2 (e) and j=0 (x). So for the diagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So diag_chars is {x, e} → len is 2 → output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, when checking the non-diagonal characters, what if there are no non-diagonal characters? Well, n is at least 3, so for n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 4. So no problem.\n\nBut what about when the non-diagonal characters are empty? Well, that's impossible.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut what about the case where the diagonals are all same, but the non-diagonal cells are same as diagonals?\n\nFor example, n=3, all cells are x. Then, the non-diagonal cells are x. So the code will check that diag_chars is {x}, non_diag is {x}, and then check if they are different. Since they are same, output NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, diagonals are x, and non-diagonal are y. Then output YES.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that the input is given as a list of strings. For example, the first input example is given as:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\xpe']\n\nWait, the input is given as a list of inputs. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given via standard input. However, the sample input shows that the user may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nOutput:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is given as per the following:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Then n lines follow.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is a list of three test cases. But that's probably a mistake in the way the sample is presented. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input is written as:\n\nInput:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent that there are three test cases. However, in reality, the actual input for the program is given as per the problem's input description. So for example, the program should read from standard input, and for each test case, process it.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the following:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo, the input is a single test case. However, the sample input shows that there are three test cases. But that's probably because the sample input is given as a list of possible test cases. However, the actual code must read from stdin, which for the problem's purposes, would be a single test case.\n\nWait, but the sample input is given as a list of three test cases, and the output is a list of three answers. But how does that translate into actual input?\n\nProbably, the problem's sample input is written in a way that represents multiple test cases. But the actual program must process a single test case. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line being n, then n lines. So for each test case, the input is n followed by n lines. However, the sample input shows that there are three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line is n. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual program must process one test case.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line containing n, then n lines. So the code must read one test case. However, the sample input shows that there are three test cases. That suggests that perhaps the code must process multiple test cases. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first line is a list of three test cases. For example, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen the second test case is 3, then wsw, sws, wsw. Third is 3, xpx, pxp, xpe.\n\nBut the sample output is the list of three answers. So the code must process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n, then n lines. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. But the original problem's input description is unclear. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo the input is for one test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. So this is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is written as a list of three test cases. However, the sample output is also a list of three answers. So perhaps the code must read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains n. How can that be?\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the input is a list of test cases. For example, the first line is the number of test cases, then each test case is given as per the input description. However, the problem's input description does not mention that. But looking back:\n\nThe problem's input says:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo, the code must process one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nThis suggests that the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. Therefore, perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that each test case is given as a single string. For example, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhich would be represented as a single string with newlines. So, in code, the input is read as multiple lines, but for the code submission, perhaps the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input description says that the first line is n, etc. This is a bit confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement, the sample input and output are given as lists. However, in practice, when the code is written for programming competition, the code must read from standard input, which for the problem's purpose is a single test case. However, the sample input seems to have multiple test cases, but perhaps the problem is written in a way that the input is multiple test cases. But this is unclear.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is written as a list of three test cases. However, the actual input format is that each test case is given as per the problem's input description. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as a separate block, but the code is supposed to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description doesn't mention anything about multiple test cases. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but the code is supposed to process a single test case, and the sample input is just written in a way that the user can see the three test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the style of Codeforces, where each test case is processed, but the code must read all test cases. However, the problem's input description says nothing about multiple test cases. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input shows that there are three test cases. The output is three answers. So the code must process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. Which would imply that the code must process a single test case. However, in programming competitions, sometimes the input may have multiple test cases, but the problem description may not state that clearly. But in this case, the sample input shows multiple test cases, but the problem's input description says that the first line is n. This is a contradiction.\n\nBut perhaps the problem's sample input is written in a way that the first line is the number of test cases, but the problem's input description is incorrect. However, looking at the sample input, for example, the first test case is 5 followed by 5 lines. The second is 3 followed by 3 lines, etc. So perhaps the code must read multiple test cases, where the first line is the number of test cases, and then for each test case, read n followed by n lines.\n\nBut the problem's input description does not say that. However, given the sample input and output, this must be the case. Otherwise, the sample input would not make sense.\n\nBut how to resolve this?\n\nWell, the user provided the sample input as:\n\nInput:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nOutput:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nWhich suggests that each element in the input list is a separate test case. So, for example, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nWhich is a single test case. So the code must read multiple test cases, each of which starts with n, then n lines.\n\nTherefore, the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous. But given the sample input and output, this must be the case.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, the input is read via input() or sys.stdin. So if the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, but the problem's input description says nothing about it, then this is a problem. However, based on the sample input, it's clear that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says that the input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nBut the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases. So this is conflicting. However, the sample input and output suggest that the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem's input is actually multiple test cases, but the problem's description is missing that part. For example, the first line is the number of test cases T, and then for each test case, the input is n followed by n lines. But in the sample input, the first line is not T but the first test case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that the user can see the input for multiple test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, this would make the sample input and output inconsistent.\n\nBut in the problem's sample input, the first line is 5, then 5 lines, then the second test case starts with 3, etc. So the code must read multiple test cases. However, in programming competitions, it's common for the code to process multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem's input is such that there are multiple test cases, and the code must read them all.\n\nBut the problem's input description does not mention that. So this is a problem.\n\nBut given that the sample input has multiple test cases, I think that the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear. But since the sample input has multiple test cases, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? In Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into test cases, and process each one.\n\nBut how to parse the input?\n\nEach test case is composed of n+1 lines: the first line is n, then n lines of n characters.\n\nSo, for example, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the code needs to read the input as a sequence of test cases. However, the code must read from stdin, which could be provided as multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line contains n, which implies that there is only one test case. This is very confusing.\n\nBut given that the sample input and output show multiple test cases, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description may be incorrect. For example, perhaps the first line is the number of test cases T, and then for each test case, the input is n followed by n lines.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is not T. For example, the sample input starts with '5\\nxooox...' which is the first test case's n.\n\nSo perhaps the code must process multiple test cases, but the number of test cases is not given, and the code must read until EOF. But how to do that in practice?\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, perhaps the code must process multiple test cases, each of which is given as n followed by n lines.\n\nSo, the code can read all lines from stdin, and process them as test cases.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nFor example, read all the input as a list of lines.\n\nThen, process the lines sequentially.\n\nFor example, the code can do:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\nThen, process the lines as follows:\n\ncurrent_line = 0\n\nwhile current_line < len(lines):\n\n    n = int(lines[current_line])\n\n    current_line +=1\n\n    grid = []\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n\n        grid.append(lines[current_line])\n\n        current_line +=1\n\n    # process grid here\n\nBut this would handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's sample input shows that the first line is n, then the next n lines are the grid, then another n, etc.\n\nSo assuming that the code must process multiple test cases, this is the way to go.\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line is n, implying that there is only one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases, and the sample output shows multiple answers.\n\nThus, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nProcess each test case as follows:\n\nRead n from the first line.\n\nRead the next n lines as the grid.\n\nProcess the grid as per the logic discussed earlier.\n\nThen, output YES or NO for each test case.\n\nSo, the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input description may have been wrong. However, based on the sample input and output, this seems to be the case.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and print to stdout. So, for example, the code would read all test cases, process them, and output the results.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nImplementing the steps discussed earlier.\n\nBut now, considering that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nProcess each test case.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead next n lines as the grid.\n\nCheck the conditions.\n\nPrint YES or NO.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[idx])\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(lines[idx])\n\n            idx +=1\n\n        # process grid\n\n        diag_chars = set()\n\n        non_diag_chars = set()\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n                    diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n                else:\n\n                    non_diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        if len(diag_chars) != 1:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        elif len(non_diag_chars) != 1:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            d = diag_chars.pop()\n\n            nd = non_diag_chars.pop()\n\n            if d != nd:\n\n                print(\"YES\")\n\n            else:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what about if the grid is empty? Well, n is at least 3, so no.\n\nBut what about when the grid is read correctly?\n\nBut in the code above, for each test case, the lines are read as per the grid.\n\nBut what about the input lines? For example, for a test case, the first line is n, then n lines of exactly n characters.\n\nBut the code assumes that the lines are read correctly.\n\nNow, testing this code with the sample input.\n\nSample input is:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nn=5\n\ngrid:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nProcessing:\n\ndiag_chars is {x, o} → len is 2 → print NO.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nn=3\n\ngrid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ndiag_chars is {w} → non_diag is {s} → print YES.\n\nThird test case:\n\nn=3\n\ngrid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nProcessing:\n\ndiag_chars includes (0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So diag_chars is {x, e} → len 2 → print NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the non-diagonal cells are empty? Well, n is at least 3, so there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals are a, a, a, a, a. So diag_chars is {a}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are the positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). These are a, a, a, a. So non_diag_chars is {a}. So the code checks that d and nd are same → print NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\nbaa\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals: (0,0)=a, (0,2)=a; (1,1)=a; (2,0)=a, (2,2)=a. So diag_chars is {a}.\n\nNon-diagonal cells are (0,1) a, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) a. So non_diag_chars is {a, b} → len 2 → print NO.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about the case where the non-diagonal cells are all same but same as the diagonals?\n\nYes, code returns NO.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in the code, for reading lines, the code uses [line.strip() ... ].\n\nBut for example, if the input lines have leading or trailing spaces, but the problem says that each line contains n small letters. So the code assumes that each line is exactly n characters.\n\nBut in practice, the code reads the line as per the input, stripping whitespace. But the problem says that each line contains exactly n letters, so stripping may not be needed. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input may have leading/trailing whitespaces, but the problem says that each line contains exactly n letters. So perhaps the code should read the line as is, without stripping.\n\nWait, for example, the input line could be 'xooox\\n' which when stripped becomes 'xooox'. But the code uses line.strip(), which removes leading and trailing whitespace. However, if the input lines have leading or trailing whitespace, then this would cause errors. But according to the problem statement, each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So the lines are exactly n characters long, and no leading or trailing whitespace. Thus, the code can safely read each line as line.strip().\n\nBut in some cases, for example, if the line is read with a newline, but the problem says that each line is exactly n letters. So perhaps the code should read each line as line.rstrip('\\n') or just line.\n\nBut in practice, for programming competition problems, it's better to read the entire line except for the newline. So using line.rstrip('\\n') or line.strip() may be problematic if the line has leading or trailing spaces. However, according to the problem statement, the input lines contain exactly n letters, so the code can read the line as line.strip().\n\nBut perhaps it's better to read the line as line.rstrip('\\n') to avoid stripping any leading/trailing whitespace. But in practice, the problem says that each line contains exactly n letters, so the code can assume that each line is exactly n letters long. Thus, using line.strip() may be safe.\n\nBut in Python, when you read a line using input(), it includes the newline character. However, when using sys.stdin, each line is read",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals of the grid must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the letters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (the size of the grid), followed by `n` lines each containing `n` lowercase letters.\n2. **Identify Diagonals**: For each cell in the grid, check if it lies on either of the two diagonals:\n   - Main diagonal: cells where row index equals column index (`i == j`).\n   - Anti-diagonal: cells where the sum of row and column indices equals `n-1` (`i + j == n - 1`).\n3. **Check Uniformity**: Collect characters from the diagonals and non-diagonal cells into separate sets. If all diagonal characters are the same and all non-diagonal characters are the same and different from the diagonal characters, the grid forms an 'X'.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        n = int(lines[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            grid.append(lines[idx])\n            idx += 1\n        diag_chars = set()\n        non_diag_chars = set()\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                    diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n                else:\n                    non_diag_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n        if len(diag_chars) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        elif len(non_diag_chars) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            d = diag_chars.pop()\n            nd = non_diag_chars.pop()\n            if d != nd:\n                print(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of strings, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace. This helps in handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n2. **Grid Processing**: For each test case, the grid is processed to identify characters on the diagonals and non-diagonal cells.\n3. **Set Operations**: Using sets ensures that all characters on the diagonals are the same and all non-diagonal characters are the same. If these sets have more than one unique character, the answer is \"NO\".\n4. **Comparison**: After ensuring uniformity in both sets, we check if the characters in the diagonal set are different from those in the non-diagonal set. If they are, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using set operations, ensuring clarity and correctness in determining if the grid forms the letter 'X'.",
