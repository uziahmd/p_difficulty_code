Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, the steps I need to perform are:\n\nFirst, check if all the elements on both diagonals are the same. Then, check that all the non-diagonal elements are the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's think about the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). But for each cell in the grid, how do I check if it's on either of these diagonals?\n\nFor a cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So, for each cell, if either of these conditions is true, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo, the first step is to collect all the characters on the diagonals and check if they are all the same. Also, collect all the non-diagonal characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the diagonals have different characters. For example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'y', then that's invalid. So, the first thing is to check that all diagonal elements are the same. So, collect all elements on both diagonals and check if they are all the same.\n\nWait, but the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letters. So, all elements on both diagonals must be the same. So, for example, if the main diagonal has 'x' and the anti-diagonal has 'x', then that's okay. But if any element on either diagonal is different, then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the first check is: collect all the elements on the diagonals. Check that all of them are the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n\nThen, collect all elements not on the diagonals. Check that all of them are the same, and that they are not equal to 'd'.\n\nSo, how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nRead the input. The first line is n, then n lines of strings.\n\nFor each of the n lines, we can read them as a list of characters.\n\nThen, iterate through each cell (i, j) in the grid.\n\nFor each cell, check if it's on either diagonal. If yes, add to diagonal_chars. Else, add to other_chars.\n\nOnce we have diagonal_chars and other_chars, check:\n\n- All elements in diagonal_chars are the same. Let's say the first element is d_char. All others must be equal to it.\n\n- All elements in other_chars are the same. Let's say the first element is o_char. All others must be equal to it.\n\n- Additionally, d_char must not equal o_char.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no other_chars? Well, since n is at least 3 and odd. For example, n=3. The diagonals have 3 elements each, but overlapping at the center. So total unique elements on diagonals is 2n - 1. For n=3, 5 elements. The total cells is 9. So other_chars is 4 elements. So for n=3, there are other elements. For larger n, same thing. So the other_chars list will have elements.\n\nBut what if the other_chars is empty? Well, n is at least 3. For example, n=1? But the problem says n is at least 3. So no, there are other elements.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nCollect all the diagonal characters and other characters.\n\nCheck that all diagonal characters are same.\n\nCheck that all other characters are same.\n\nCheck that the two characters are different.\n\nIf all these are true, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, how to collect the diagonal characters and other characters.\n\nLet me think about code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string. Let's store them as a list of lists, grid.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1: return NO\n\nif len(set(other_chars)) != 1: return NO\n\nif diagonal_chars[0] == other_chars[0]: return NO\n\nElse, return YES.\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, other_chars is not empty. For example, n=3, the center cell is on both diagonals. The other cells are 8- (2*3-1) = 8-5=3? Wait, for n=3, the number of cells on diagonals is 3 + 3 -1 = 5 (since the center is counted twice). So total cells in diagonals is 5. The other cells are 9-5=4. So other_chars has 4 elements. So for n=3, it's okay.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut let's test some examples.\n\nLooking at the sample input.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nSo the diagonals are:\n\nFor i=0, j=0: x (main)\n\ni=0, j=4: x (anti)\n\ni=1, j=1: x (main), j=3: x (anti)\n\ni=2, j=2: x (main), j=2: i +j = 2+2 =4, which for n=5 is 5-1=4. So yes, anti-diagonal. So for row 2, column 2 is on both diagonals.\n\ni=3, j=1: i +j =4, so anti. j=3 is i=3, j=3? No, for i=3, j=1: i +j =4. So yes, anti.\n\nBut for the main diagonal, i=3, j=3. So the cell (3,3) is on main.\n\nSo the diagonals for this grid would have:\n\nLooking at each cell on diagonals:\n\nRow 0: x (0,0), x (0,4)\n\nRow 1: x (1,1), x (1,3)\n\nRow 2: x (2,2), o (2,2)? Wait, no. Wait for row 2, column 2 is i=2, j=2. i==j, so yes. Also, i + j = 4, which is n-1 (since n=5, 5-1=4). So yes. So this cell is on both diagonals. So for row 2, column 2, it's part of the diagonals. So the value here is 'x' (from the third row, which is 'soxoo' — row 2, column 2 is 'x').\n\nWait, the third row is 'soxoo' — that's row index 2. So row 2 is s o x o o. So (2,0) is s, (2,1) is o, (2,2) is x, (2,3) is o, (2,4) is o.\n\nSo for the diagonals, the cells are:\n\n(0,0) x\n\n(0,4) x\n\n(1,1) x\n\n(1,3) x\n\n(2,2) x\n\n(3,1) o (i=3, j=1: i +j = 4. So anti-diagonal.)\n\n(3,3) o (i=3, j=3: main diagonal. i=3, j=3, i==j. So yes. So cell (3,3) is o? Let's check row 3: 'oxoxo' — row 3 is o x o x o. So (3,3) is x? Wait, indexes are 0-based. For row 3, the string is \"oxoxo\", which is positions 0: o, 1: x, 2: o, 3: x, 4: o. So (3,3) is x. So that's part of the main diagonal. So for (3,3), the value is x. So in the diagonal_chars, that's x.\n\nWait, but for the cell (3,1): i=3, j=1. i + j = 4, which is n-1 (5-1=4). So it's part of the anti-diagonal. The value is row 3, j=1 is x. So that's x.\n\nThen, row 4: (4,0) x, (4,4) x.\n\nSo the diagonal_chars would consist of:\n\nLooking at all cells on diagonals:\n\nRow 0: x, x\n\nRow 1: x, x\n\nRow 2: x\n\nRow 3: x (main diagonal at (3,3)), and (3,1) x (anti)\n\nRow 4: x, x.\n\nWait, but for row 3, the main diagonal is (3,3) which is x. And the anti-diagonal is (3,1) which is x. So all the diagonal elements are x?\n\nWait, but what about the cell (2,2) is x, yes. So the diagonal_chars would have all x's? Then why is the first sample output NO?\n\nWait the first sample input is:\n\nThe first input is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x\n\nRow 1: o x o x o\n\nRow 2: s o x o o\n\nRow 3: o x o x o\n\nRow 4: x o o o x\n\nNow, looking at the diagonals. Let's check each cell.\n\nFor i=0, j=0: x (main)\n\ni=0, j=4: x (anti)\n\ni=1, j=1: x (main), j=3: x (anti)\n\ni=2, j=2: x (main), and j=2 (i=2, j=2) is part of anti-diagonal? i + j = 2 + 2 =4 (n-1=5-1=4). Yes. So that's part of anti. So the cell (2,2) is x.\n\ni=3, j=3: main diagonal. row 3, j=3 is x. i=3, j=1: anti. row 3, j=1 is x.\n\ni=4, j=4: x (main), j=0: x (anti).\n\nSo all the diagonal elements are x. So diagonal_chars is all x's. Then the other_chars are all the other elements. Let's check some of them.\n\nFor example, row 2, column 0: s. That's not on any diagonal. So it's part of other_chars. So other_chars includes s. But the other elements must be same. So in this case, other_chars includes s, o, o, etc. So for example, in row 2, column 0 is s. So other_chars has s, which is different from x. So the other_chars are not all same. Hence, the first sample input returns NO.\n\nYes, which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code would correctly detect that.\n\nAnother sample input is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=3. The grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe diagonals are:\n\ncells (0,0) w, (0,2) w.\n\ncells (1,1) w.\n\ncells (2,0) w, (2,2) w.\n\nSo all diagonals are w. The other cells are:\n\n(0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So other_chars is all s. So diagonal is w, others are s. So it's valid. Output YES.\n\nThird sample input: 3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nDiagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) x, (0,2) x.\n\ncells (1,1) x.\n\ncells (2,0) x, (2,2) e.\n\nSo the diagonals include x, x, x, x, e. So the diagonal_chars are [x, x, x, x, e]. So the set is {x, e} which has length 2. So the first check fails. Hence output is NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nWhat about when n=3, and all diagonals are same, but other_chars are same as diagonals?\n\nLike:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nThen diagonals are a's. Other chars are b and a's? Let's see:\n\nThe grid:\n\nrow 0: a a a\n\nrow 1: a b a\n\nrow 2: a a a\n\nThe diagonals are (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). All a's. The other cells are (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1). Which are a, a, a, a. So other_chars is all a. So the code would check that other_chars is same, but then check that they are different from diagonal. But they are same. So output is NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, all cells are same. Then diagonals are same, other chars same. But same as diagonals. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are a, others are b. So output YES.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut how to read the input? The input is given as first line n, then n lines. But in the sample input, the first input is given as a list of strings, but in actual code, the input is read from stdin.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as first line n, then n lines of letters.\n\nSo, in Python, the code should read from stdin. For example:\n\nn = int(input())\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nBut then, for each row, we can process as a string.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), grid[i][j] is the character.\n\nNow, collect the diagonal and other characters.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid.\n\nCollect diagonal and other.\n\nCheck:\n\nif len(set(diagonal)) != 1 → no.\n\nElse, check len(set(other)) != 1 → no.\n\nElse, check if diagonal[0] != other[0]. If not, no.\n\nElse yes.\n\nBut what if other is empty? Well, n is at least 3. For n=3, other has 4 elements. So no problem.\n\nBut code needs to handle the case where other is empty? Well, no, since n is at least 3, and for n=3, the number of non-diagonal elements is 4. So other_chars is not empty.\n\nSo code can proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead grid as list of strings.\n\ndiagonal = []\nother = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diagonal)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif len(set(other)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif diagonal[0] == other[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if the other list is empty? Well, for n=3, the other list has 4 elements. For n=5, other has 25 - (2*5 -1) = 25-9=16 elements. So no problem.\n\nBut what if the other list is empty? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut in code, when n=3, the other list is 4 elements. So code is safe.\n\nNow, testing the sample input:\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=5, grid as per first example.\n\ndiagonal has all x's? Let's see:\n\nIn the first example, the third row is 'soxoo'. So for (2,2), it's x. So diagonal is all x's. But the other list includes the 's' in (2,0). So other has s, which is different. So the other list has elements that are not same. So len(set(other)) is more than 1. Hence, output is NO.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\ndiagonal is:\n\n(0,0) w, (0,2) w, (1,1) w, (2,0) w, (2,2) w → all w. other is (0,1) s, (1,0) s, (1,2) s, (2,1) s. So set(other) is {s}, so len 1. diagonal is {w}, len 1. and w != s. So output YES.\n\nSample input 3:\n\nn=3, grid:\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ndiagonal: (0,0) x, (0,2) x; (1,1) x; (2,0) x, (2,2) e. So diagonal is [x, x, x, x, e]. So set(diagonal) is {x, e} → len 2. So first condition fails. Output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\ndiagonal is all a's. other is [a, a, a, a]. So set(other) is {a}. So check if diagonal[0] (a) == other[0] (a). So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naba\n\nbaa\n\naba\n\ndiagonal is (0,0) a, (0,2) a; (1,1) a; (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonal is all a. other is (0,1) b, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) b. So other is [b, b, a, b]. So set is {a, b} → len 2. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, grid:\n\naxa\n\nxaa\n\naxa\n\ndiagonals: (0,0) a, (0,2) a; (1,1) x; (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonal is [a, a, x, a, a]. So set is {a, x} → len 2. So output NO.\n\nAnother case where diagonals are same, but other is same but same as diagonal. So output NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut need to read input. The input is given as first line n, then n lines.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the first input is given as a list of strings. However, in practice, the code will read from stdin. So for example, for the first sample input, the input would be:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nBut in code, the code reads n as int(input()), then reads n lines via input().strip().\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines, each line is a string.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = []\nother = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(set(diagonal)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif len(set(other)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif diagonal[0] == other[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nBut wait, what if the other list is empty? For example, n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut for n=3, the other list has 4 elements. So code is safe.\n\nBut what if the other list is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So code is okay.\n\nNow, test the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe grid is:\n\nrow 0: 'wsw' → indexes 0, 1, 2 → 'w', 's', 'w'\n\nrow 1: 'sws' → 's', 'w', 's'\n\nrow 2: 'wsw' → 'w', 's', 'w'\n\ndiagonal:\n\ncells (0,0) → w, (0,2) → w, (1,1) → w, (2,0) → w, (2,2) → w. So diagonal is [w, w, w, w, w]. set is {w}.\n\nother is cells (0,1) → s, (1,0) → s, (1,2) → s, (2,1) → s. So other is [s, s, s, s]. set is {s}.\n\nso check diagonal[0] (w) != other[0] (s). So output YES.\n\nSample input 3:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\ngrid:\n\nrow0: x p x\n\nrow1: p x p\n\nrow2: x p e\n\ndiagonal:\n\ncells (0,0) x, (0,2) x, (1,1) x, (2,0) x, (2,2) e → diagonal is [x, x, x, x, e]. set is {x, e} → len 2. So first condition fails, output NO.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, all cells are same. Then diagonals are same, other is same. But same as diagonals. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are a, others are b. Output YES.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code should be written. Now, what about performance? For n up to 300, the code is O(n^2) which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut in Python, for the case when the diagonal is empty? No. For n=3, the diagonal has 5 elements. So code is okay.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter 'X' based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all characters on both diagonals of the grid must be the same, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the characters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal and Non-Diagonal Characters Collection**: Traverse the grid to collect characters on the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left). Collect all other characters separately.\n3. **Validation Checks**:\n   - Ensure all characters on both diagonals are the same.\n   - Ensure all non-diagonal characters are the same.\n   - Ensure the characters on the diagonals are different from the non-diagonal characters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal = []\nother = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(set(diagonal)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif len(set(other)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif diagonal[0] == other[0]:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first input line is the integer `n`, followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n2. **Character Collection**: We iterate through each cell of the grid.
