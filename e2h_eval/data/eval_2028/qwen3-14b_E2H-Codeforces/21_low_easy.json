The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. Let's break down the condition. The sum a_i + b_j is odd. That means one of them is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. Conversely, for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting how many even and odd numbers there are in the chests and keys. Then, for each even chest, we can pair it with an odd key, and for each odd chest, pair it with an even key. But since each key can be used only once, we need to find the minimum between the count of even chests and the number of odd keys, and similarly for the other case.\n\nWait, right. Let me formalize this:\n\nLet's count:\n\n- even_chests = number of a_i that are even\n- odd_chests = number of a_i that are odd\n- even_keys = number of b_j that are even\n- odd_keys = number of b_j that are odd\n\nThen, the maximum possible chests is the sum of min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys). Because each even chest needs an odd key, and each odd chest needs an even key. But since the keys can't be reused, we take the minimum of each pair.\n\nYes! That makes sense. So the solution would be to compute these four counts and then calculate that sum.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=5, m=4\n\na = [9,14,6,2,11]\n\nLooking at the a values:\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So odd_chests is 2, even_chests is 3.\n\nb is [8,4,7,20]. Let's see:\n\n8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3, odd_keys = 1.\n\nSo min(even_chests (3), odd_keys (1)) is 1. And min(odd_chests (2), even_keys (3)) is 2. Sum is 3, which matches the first example's output.\n\nSecond example input:\n\nn=5, m=1\n\na is [2,4,6,8,10], all even. So even_chests=5, odd_chests=0.\n\nb is [5], which is odd. So even_keys=0, odd_keys=1.\n\nSo min(5, 1) is 1, and min(0, 0) is 0. Total 1, which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: n=1, m=4. a is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests=1, odd_chests=0. Keys: even_keys=4, odd_keys=0. So min(1, 0) is 0, and min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Which matches the third example.\n\nGreat, so the logic works here.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Count the number of even and odd chests.\n- Count the number of even and odd keys.\n- The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe steps for code:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nRead the list of a_i, then count how many are even and odd.\n\nRead the list of b_j, count how many even and odd.\n\nCompute the sum as described.\n\nBut wait, how to count even and odd? For each number in a list, check if it's even or odd. For example, for a number x, x % 2 == 0 is even, else odd.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n, m.\n\nThen read a list of n integers. Then even_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0), odd_chest = n - even_chest.\n\nSame for the keys: even_keys = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0), odd_keys = m - even_keys.\n\nThen answer is min(even_chest, odd_keys) + min(odd_chest, even_keys).\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's handle the input. The input is given as multiple",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. The key condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. This means that each chest with an even number must be paired with a key with an odd number, and each chest with an odd number must be paired with a key with an even number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Even and Odd Chests**: First, count how many chests have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n2. **Count Even and Odd Keys**: Similarly, count how many keys have even numbers and how many have odd numbers.\n3. **Determine Maximum Pairs**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by the minimum of the number of even chests and odd keys, plus the minimum of the number of odd chests and even keys.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+m]))\n    \n    even_chest = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_chest = n - even_chest\n    \n    even_key = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n    odd_key = m - even_key\n    \n    result = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go and split into a list of integers for easier processing.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: We count the number of even and odd numbers in both the chests and keys lists.\n3. **Calculating Result**: The result is calculated by summing the minimum of even chests and odd keys, and the minimum of odd chests and even keys. This ensures that we are using the available keys optimally to open the maximum number of chests.\n\nThis approach efficiently processes the input and computes the result in linear time relative to the number of chests and keys, making it suitable for large input sizes up to the given constraints.",
