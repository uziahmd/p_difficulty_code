His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the results of two tours, but without names. So, the task is to determine, given the lists of first tour scores (a) and second tour scores (b), what's the best and worst possible position Vasya can have, considering that his total is at least x. \n\nThe key points here are:\n\n- The participants are sorted by their total points (a_i + b_j). If two have the same total, the jury can assign their ranks in any way. So for the best rank, we want to maximize Vasya's total (so he can be as high as possible), and for the worst rank, minimize his total (so others can have higher or equal totals, pushing him down as much as possible).\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nFirst, for the best possible rank: We need to find the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have, which is the maximum a_i + b_j where a_i and b_j are from the two lists. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But since the teacher knows that he has at least x points, but the actual total could be higher. However, when determining the best possible rank, we want to assume that Vasya's total is as high as possible (so that he can be placed as high as possible). But how?\n\nWait, no. Because the teacher has to consider all possible combinations of a_i and b_j that sum to at least x. But Vasya's actual total is some value >=x. However, the best possible rank for him would be when his total is as high as possible, so that he can be placed first. But how do we find that?\n\nWait, the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst place Vasya could have. So, the best possible scenario for Vasya is when his total is as high as possible, and others' totals are as low as possible. But since the teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to Vasya, we have to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x, and then arrange the other participants' pairs such that Vasya's rank is as good as possible (for best case) or as bad as possible (for worst case).\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher has the lists of a and b, but they are not paired. For example, each participant has a score in the first tour (a) and a score in the second tour (b), but the teacher doesn't know which a and b belong to which participant. So, for the purposes of calculating possible rankings, we can pair the a's and b's in any way, as long as each a is used exactly once and each b is used exactly once. Because the actual pairing is unknown, but the teacher has to consider all possibilities.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that each participant participated in both tours. So, for each participant, there's a unique a_i and b_j. But the teacher has the lists of a's and b's, but not knowing which a corresponds to which b. So, the actual pairing is fixed (but unknown to the teacher). However, the teacher wants to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have, depending on how the a's and b's are paired.\n\nBut since the teacher knows that there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x (because it's guaranteed), we need to find for all possible pairings of a's and b's (permutations), what is the best and worst possible rank that Vasya could have.\n\nBut how can we model this? Since the teacher can choose any possible pairing (as long as each a is matched with exactly one b, and vice versa), the best and worst possible positions for Vasya would depend on how we pair the a's and b's.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, we want to choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others' totals are as low as possible. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's total is the maximum possible (so that he can be ranked first), and for the worst possible rank, we imagine that his total is the minimum possible (so that others can have higher or equal totals, pushing him down).\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think about the best possible rank first. To get the best possible rank, we need to select a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible (so that Vasya's total is maximized). Then, the best possible rank is 1 if there's no one else with a higher total. But how?\n\nWait, but the other participants' pairings can be arranged in a way that their totals are as low as possible. Wait, but the pairing is fixed. For example, the actual pairing is fixed, but the teacher doesn't know it. However, for the best possible scenario for Vasya, the teacher can imagine that the actual pairing is such that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and other participants' totals are as low as possible.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have, given that there exists at least one possible pairing where his total is at least x.\n\nSo, for the best possible position, we can assume that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others' totals are as low as possible. How to model this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by considering that Vasya's total is the maximum possible (so, the maximum a_i + b_j), and then count how many people can have a total higher than that. But since the teacher can choose the pairing, perhaps the best possible scenario is that Vasya's total is as high as possible, and others are paired in a way that their totals are as low as possible.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, the pairing is fixed. But the teacher can choose any possible pairing (since they don't know which a_i and b_j belong to Vasya). So, for the best possible rank, the teacher can choose a pairing where Vasya's a_i and b_j are paired in a way that gives him the maximum possible sum, and others are paired in a way that their sums are as small as possible. However, the pairing must be a perfect matching between a and b.\n\nBut how can we model that? For example, to maximize Vasya's total, we can choose the maximum a_i + b_j. Then, the other pairings are arranged in a way that their sums are as small as possible, but that's not necessarily possible. However, for the purpose of calculating the best possible rank, the teacher can imagine that Vasya's pair is the one that gives the maximum possible sum, and others are arranged in such a way that as few as possible have a higher sum than Vasya's.\n\nBut how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, the best possible rank is 1 if there exists a pairing where Vasya's total is the maximum possible. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's total is the maximum possible sum (max_a + max_b?), but that's not correct because the same a and b can't be used twice. For example, if you take the maximum a_i and the maximum b_j, but they are not part of the same participant. Wait, but in the pairing, each a_i is paired with exactly one b_j, and vice versa. So, to maximize Vasya's sum, we can take the maximum possible a_i + b_j, but ensuring that the a_i and b_j are paired in a way that allows this. However, since the teacher can choose any pairing, the best possible scenario for Vasya is that his a_i and b_j are paired such that their sum is the maximum possible (i.e., the maximum of all possible a_i + b_j, but considering that each a and b can be used once). Wait, but that's not possible. Because if you have a_i and b_j, they can be paired only once. So, the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have is the maximum of a_i + b_j, but that's only possible if there exists a pairing where that a_i is paired with that b_j.\n\nBut how can we find that maximum? Well, the maximum possible sum for any pair is the maximum a_i plus maximum b_j, but that's only possible if those two are not used in other pairings. But since the pairing is a permutation, the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have is the maximum a_i + b_j, but the actual pairing depends on how you arrange the rest. However, for the purpose of the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's pair is the one with the maximum possible sum. So, regardless of the other pairings, the best possible rank would be determined by how many other pairs could possibly have a sum greater than or equal to that maximum.\n\nWait, but if Vasya's sum is the maximum possible (say, S), then no one else can have a sum higher than S. Because if someone else has a sum higher than S, then that would mean that there exists a pair with sum higher than S, which contradicts that S was the maximum. Therefore, in this case, Vasya's best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut wait, this is only possible if the maximum a_i + b_j is achievable. For example, if the maximum a_i is 5, and the maximum b_j is 5, then pairing them gives 10. But if there are other pairs that could also sum to 10, but that's okay. So, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut then, in the first sample input, all a and b are 1. So, the maximum sum is 2. All participants have sum 2. So, the best possible rank is 1 (since the jury can assign him first place), and the worst possible is 5 (since they can assign him last).\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, the answer is 1 if there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is the maximum possible. Because in that case, the teacher can choose that pairing, and then Vasya's sum is maximum, so his rank is 1.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nWait, but the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. So, for the best possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible sum that is at least x, and then determine how many people can have a sum higher than that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible rank, we can take the maximum possible sum (regardless of x) and then see how many people can have a sum higher than that. But since the maximum sum is the highest possible, no one can have higher than that. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1. But that's only if the maximum sum is >=x. Which is guaranteed, because the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya has at least x points. So, in the pairing that we choose, Vasya's sum must be at least x. But for the best possible rank, we can choose the maximum possible sum (which is >=x, since there's at least one pair with sum >=x). Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut that's not correct. Let's look at the second example.\n\nIn the second input:\n\nn=6, x=7\n\na = [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb = [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nThe output is 1 and 5.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1. Which makes sense. Because there's a way to pair a and b such that Vasya's sum is 12 (like 6+6, but wait, looking at the note, the best scenario is when Vasya's sum is 4+8=12. So yes, that's the maximum possible sum. So, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut what if the maximum sum is less than x? Well, the problem says that there exists a pair with sum >=x. So the maximum sum must be >=x. So, for the best possible rank, Vasya can have the maximum sum, which is >=x, and thus, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nWait, that seems to be the case. So the best possible rank is always 1? But that's not possible. For example, suppose there are two people. Suppose x is 5, and the a is [3, 3], b is [3,3]. Then each pair sum is 6. So the best possible rank is 1 (since the jury can assign him first). But if there are two people, then the best possible rank is 1, and the worst possible is 2.\n\nBut according to the first sample, the best possible is 1. So why in the first sample, the answer is 1 and 5. So, the best possible is 1.\n\nSo, for the best possible rank, the answer is always 1? That can't be right. Wait, maybe not. What if x is very high. Suppose n=2, x=10. a is [5,5], b is [5,5]. Then each pair sum is 10. So, the best possible rank is 1. But what if x is 11? Then there's no pair with sum >=x. But the problem says that it is guaranteed that there exists a pair with sum >=x. So, in this case, the problem would not have such input.\n\nTherefore, the best possible rank is always 1. But that seems to contradict the problem's example. Wait, no. The problem's example shows that the best possible is 1. So maybe the best possible rank is always 1. But why?\n\nBecause the teacher can choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. Since the maximum possible sum is >=x, then Vasya's sum is the maximum. So, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut then why does the problem ask for the best possible rank? It seems that it's always 1. But that's not the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, no. Suppose there are three participants. Let's say a = [3, 3, 3], b = [3, 3, 3]. So all possible sums are 6. Now, Vasya's sum is 6. The best possible rank is 1 (if the jury assigns him first), but the worst is 3. But in this case, the best possible is 1. So the answer would be 1 and 3.\n\nBut what if there are two people with sum higher than Vasya's? No, because if Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, then no one else can have a higher sum. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nTherefore, the best possible rank is always 1. So why does the problem include it in the output? Because the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible. But according to this reasoning, the best possible is always 1. However, looking at the sample input, the first sample's output is 1 5, which aligns with this.\n\nBut then why is the first sample's best possible 1? Because the maximum sum is 2, and all participants have that sum. So, the best possible is 1, and the worst is 5.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is always 1. Therefore, the first part of the output is always 1. But why then does the problem have the first sample output as 1 5? Because that's correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a case where even though the maximum sum is >=x, but there are multiple people with that sum, and the best possible rank is 1. But the problem says that the jury can assign the ranks in any way for ties. So, the best possible is 1.\n\nSo, the first number in the output is always 1. But that seems too easy. So why is the problem asking for it?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the teacher has to find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. The note says that in the first sample, all participants have 2 points. So, depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get first or fifth. So for the best possible, it's 1. For the worst, it's 5.\n\nBut what if there are other participants with higher sums? For example, suppose there are two participants. a = [5, 1], b = [5, 1]. x is 6. So, possible pairs:\n\nIf Vasya is (5,5), sum is 10. The other participant is (1,1), sum 2. So best rank is 1.\n\nIf x is 6, but there's another possible pairing where Vasya's sum is 5+1=6. Then, the other participant has 1+5=6. So, the best possible rank is 1 (if the jury assigns him first), and worst is 2.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is always 1, regardless of other possibilities. Because the teacher can choose the pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. Therefore, the best possible rank is always 1.\n\nBut why is the problem asking for that? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the teacher cannot choose the pairing. The pairing is fixed, but unknown. So, the teacher needs to find the best and worst possible ranks that Vasya could have, based on all possible pairings. But the teacher knows that there exists at least one pairing where Vasya's sum is >=x. But for the best and worst possible, the teacher has to consider all possible pairings where there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) that sum to >=x.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have. So, for example, if there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is 10, and another pairing where his sum is 6, then the best possible is 1 (from the first case), and the worst possible is whatever it is in the second case.\n\nBut how do we find the best and worst possible positions across all possible pairings where Vasya's sum is at least x?\n\nAh! Now I think I understand. The problem is not about choosing the best possible pairing for Vasya, but considering all possible pairings (i.e., all possible ways to pair a and b) that satisfy the condition that there exists at least one participant (Vasya) whose sum is at least x. Then, among all those possible pairings, find the minimal possible rank (best) and maximal possible rank (worst) that Vasya could have in any of those pairings.\n\nWait, but how can we model that? Because for each possible pairing, there is a certain sum for each participant. But since the pairing is arbitrary, the teacher can choose any possible pairing (as long as there's at least one participant with sum >=x). Then, for each such pairing, Vasya's rank depends on his sum and others'.\n\nBut how can we find the best and worst possible ranks across all possible pairings?\n\nThis is more complicated than I thought earlier.\n\nSo, the problem is to find:\n\n- The minimal possible rank (best) that Vasya can have in any possible pairing (where at least one participant has sum >=x).\n\n- The maximal possible rank (worst) that Vasya can have in any possible pairing (where at least one participant has sum >=x).\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think again. The teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to Vasya. But the teacher knows that there exists at least one pair (a_i, b_j) with sum >=x. So, for the purpose of the problem, we can imagine that in the actual pairing, Vasya is one of the participants, and his sum is some value >=x. The teacher wants to find, over all possible pairings (that have at least one participant with sum >=x), the minimal and maximal possible rank that Vasya could have in that pairing.\n\nBut how can we find that?\n\nFor the best possible rank (minimal possible), we need to find a pairing where Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others are as low as possible, leading to his rank being as high as possible (i.e., 1). For the worst possible rank, we need to find a pairing where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and others' sums are as high as possible, leading to his rank being as low as possible.\n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nLet me think about the best possible rank again. To get the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible. But how to find that maximum possible sum?\n\nThe maximum possible sum for Vasya is the maximum of a_i + b_j, but considering that each a_i and b_j can be used only once. However, since the pairing is arbitrary, the maximum sum that Vasya can have is the maximum a_i + b_j, provided that there exists a pairing where that a_i is paired with that b_j. For example, if the maximum a_i is A and the maximum b_j is B, then pairing them would give A+B. However, this requires that the rest of the pairings can be done in a way that uses the remaining a's and b's. But since the pairing is possible (as the problem says that there is at least one pairing where Vasya's sum is >=x), we can assume that this is possible.\n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1, since in that pairing, Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, and thus he is first.\n\nBut then why is the problem asking for the best rank? Because in some cases, even if Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, there might be other participants with the same sum. However, the jury can assign the rank as 1. So the best possible is always 1.\n\nSo, the first part of the output is always 1. Then, why in the sample input, the output is 1 and 5? Because that's correct.\n\nNow, the second part is the worst possible rank. This is more complex.\n\nTo find the worst possible rank, we need to find a pairing where Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and as many other participants as possible have a higher sum than Vasya's.\n\nSo, the approach is:\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal possible value of Vasya's sum (s) that is >=x, and then count how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than s in some pairing.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nLet me think. For the worst case scenario, we want to choose a pairing where Vasya's sum is the minimal possible (but still >=x), and arrange the other pairings so that as many as possible participants have a sum higher than that.\n\nBut how to find this minimal s?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst possible rank, we can imagine that Vasya's sum is exactly x (the minimal possible), and then count how many other participants can have sums higher than x. However, this may not be possible, but we need to find the minimal possible s (>=x) such that there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is s, and others are arranged to maximize the number of participants with sum > s.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, the worst possible rank is determined by the following steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible value of s (Vasya's sum) such that s >=x and there exists a pairing where Vasya's sum is s.\n\nBut how to find this s? Well, the minimal possible s is the minimal possible sum that is >=x and can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j). However, since we can choose any pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya, the minimal s is the minimal a_i + b_j that is >=x. But how to find that?\n\nBut even that may not be sufficient. For example, if we choose s as the minimal possible, but in the pairing, there are many other participants who have sums higher than s. Thus, Vasya's rank would be worse.\n\nSo, the steps for the worst possible rank are:\n\n- Choose a value s (Vasya's sum) which is >=x, and find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum >s in some pairing. Then, the worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nBut how to find s and the maximum number of participants with sum >s?\n\nThis seems challenging.\n\nLet me think of an approach.\n\nFor the worst case scenario, we need to choose a pairing where:\n\n- Vasya's sum is s >=x.\n\n- As many other participants as possible have sum >s.\n\nThus, the worst possible rank is determined by the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum >s, for some s >=x.\n\nSo, the approach is to find for all possible s >=x, the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s, and then take the maximum over all such possibilities. Then, the worst possible rank is that number plus 1.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nAlternatively, for the worst possible scenario, we can imagine that Vasya's sum is as small as possible (but >=x), and others are arranged to have as many as possible higher sums.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the following approach for the worst possible rank:\n\nWe need to find the maximum number of participants that can have a sum greater than some s (where s >=x). The worst possible rank is that number + 1.\n\nTo find this, we can consider that for each possible s (which is the sum of Vasya's pair), we need to find how many pairs (other than Vasya's) can have sum >s. However, since the pairing is a permutation, we have to ensure that the pairing is possible.\n\nBut this seems computationally expensive.\n\nAn alternative approach is to find the minimal possible s (Vasya's sum) that is >=x, and then find the maximum number of other pairs that can be formed with sum >s.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Find all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) that have sum >=x. These are the candidates for Vasya's sum.\n\n2. For each candidate pair (a_i, b_j) with sum s >=x, we want to find the maximum number of other pairs that can be formed with sum >s. Then, the worst possible rank for this candidate is that number + 1.\n\n3. The overall worst possible rank is the maximum of all these values.\n\nBut how to compute step 2 efficiently?\n\nBut considering that n can be up to 1e5, iterating through all possible pairs is O(n^2), which is impossible.\n\nThus, this approach is not feasible for large n.\n\nAlternative idea: For the worst possible scenario, we want to maximize the number of participants with sum >s, where s is Vasya's sum (>=x). So, to maximize the number of participants with sum >s, we need to choose s as small as possible (so that more participants can have sum >s).\n\nThus, the worst possible rank is determined when s is the minimal possible value >=x. Once we find that minimal s, we can compute how many pairs (a_i, b_j) can have sum >s, but with the constraint that each a and b is used exactly once, except for one pair (Vasya's) which is s.\n\nBut how?\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n\nFind the minimal possible s (Vasya's sum) that is >=x. Then, for that s, compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s. This would be the worst possible rank.\n\nBut how to find the minimal s?\n\nThe minimal s is the minimal possible sum of a_i + b_j that is >=x.\n\nOnce we have this minimal s, we need to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed such that their sum is >s, with the constraint that each a and b is used once, and one of the pairs (Vasya's) is exactly s.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum number of pairs with sum >s?\n\nThis seems like a problem of maximum matching. But perhaps there's a way to approximate it.\n\nAlternatively, for a given s, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s is equal to the maximum number of pairs that can be formed between a and b such that their sum exceeds s. But since one of the pairs is fixed as s (Vasya's pair), we need to subtract that from the total.\n\nWait, no. Because the total number of participants is n. So, the maximum number of participants with sum >s is equal to the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >s, given that one of the pairs (Vasya's) is s.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given s, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s is equal to the maximum matching between a and b where each pair's sum is >s. But since we can choose one pair to be exactly s (and the rest to be >s), we need to check whether there exists such a pairing.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFor the worst possible scenario, we want to choose s as small as possible (so that more people can have sum >s). So, find the minimal s that is >=x. Then, compute the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >s. Let's call this number m. Then, the worst possible rank is m + 1 (since Vasya's sum is s, and m people have higher sum, so he is m+1-th).\n\nBut how to compute m?\n\nBut even this approach requires that there exists a pairing where one pair is s (Vasya's) and m pairs have sum >s.\n\nBut how to find m?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s is the maximum possible for that s. So, for the given s, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s is the maximum matching between a and b where each pair's sum is >s. But since we need to leave one pair (Vasya's) with sum s, which is >=x, but this may complicate things.\n\nBut perhaps for the worst possible scenario, we can ignore the Vasya's pair and just find the maximum number of pairs with sum >s. Then, the worst possible rank would be that number plus 1, assuming that there's a way to choose one pair with sum s (which is >=x) and the rest with sum >s.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with the following steps:\n\n1. Find the minimal s >=x. Let's call it s_min.\n\n2. Compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >s_min. Let this be m.\n\n3. The worst possible rank is m + 1, provided that there exists a pair with sum s_min (which is guaranteed, since s_min is the minimal possible sum >=x).\n\nBut how to compute m?\n\nThe maximum number of pairs with sum >s_min can be found by greedily pairing the largest a's with the largest b's, or using some other method.\n\nWait, for a given s, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s is the maximum matching where a_i + b_j > s.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum number?\n\nThis is similar to the problem of maximum bipartite matching, but for large n (up to 1e5), we need an efficient way.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to compute this with sorting.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we sort a in ascending order, and sort b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, we try to pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet, such that a_i + b_j > s. This greedy approach may give the maximum number of pairs.\n\nAlternatively, sort a in ascending order and sort b in ascending order. Then, use two pointers to find the maximum number of pairs.\n\nWait, let's think of the standard problem of finding the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j > s. How is this done?\n\nFor example, sort a in ascending order and sort b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, find the smallest b_j that when paired with a_i gives a sum >s. But since we want to maximize the number of pairs, we can use a two-pointer approach.\n\nLet me think. Sort a in ascending order and b in ascending order. Initialize i = 0 (start of a), j = n-1 (end of b). For each a_i, if a_i + b_j >s, then we can pair them, increment count, and move j to j-1. Else, move i to i+1. This approach tries to pair the smallest a with the largest possible b to maximize the number of pairs.\n\nYes, this is a standard approach for this kind of problem.\n\nSo, for a given s, the maximum number of pairs with sum >s can be computed with this two-pointer approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe steps for solving the problem are:\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\nIt is always 1, since we can choose the pairing where Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, making him first.\n\nFor the worst possible rank:\n\nFind the minimal s >=x (call it s_min). Then compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >s_min. Let this number be m. Then the worst possible rank is m + 1.\n\nBut how to find s_min?\n\ns_min is the minimal possible value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. However, since the pairing is a permutation, we need to find if there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. But the problem states that this is guaranteed.\n\nBut how to find the minimal s that is >=x and can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j)?\n\nWell, the minimal s is the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. So, we can compute all possible a_i + b_j, filter those >=x, and find the minimal among them. However, for large n (up to 1e5), this would be O(n^2), which is impossible.\n\nWait, but that's not feasible. For example, n is 1e5, then O(n^2) is 1e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nSo, this approach is not feasible. Therefore, we need a better way to find s_min.\n\nWait, but the problem says that we can choose any pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya. So, s_min is the minimal a_i + b_j that is >=x. But how can we find this minimal value?\n\nWe need to find the minimal possible value of a_i + b_j >=x.\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the minimal value in the set {a_i + b_j | a_i + b_j >=x}.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nOne way is to sort the array a and b. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, for each a_i, the minimal b_j is the smallest possible b_j that satisfies this condition. Then, among all these a_i and corresponding b_j, find the minimal sum.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet's think. Sort a in ascending order, and sort b in ascending order.\n\nFor each a_i, we can find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. This can be done using binary search.\n\nOnce we find that b_j, the sum would be a_i + b_j. We can track the minimal sum across all a_i and their corresponding b_j.\n\nBut since we need to find the minimal sum >=x, this approach should work.\n\nBut there's a problem: after selecting a particular b_j for a_i, we need to ensure that it's available for pairing. However, since we are only trying to find the minimal possible sum, not considering the pairing constraints. But since we are allowed to choose any pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya, regardless of the rest of the pairing, the minimal s_min can be found as the minimal a_i + b_j >=x, even if there are overlapping elements. Because in the pairing, we can choose that pair for Vasya, and then arrange the rest of the pairs as needed.\n\nWait, but the problem is that when you choose a particular (a_i, b_j) for Vasya, the rest of the pairs must be formed with the remaining a's and b's. However, for the purpose of finding s_min, we don't need to worry about that. Because the problem says that there exists at least one pairing where Vasya's sum is >=x. So, the minimal s_min is simply the minimal a_i + b_j that is >=x. Even if this pair (a_i, b_j) is not part of a valid pairing (due to overlapping elements), but that's not possible. Because the pairing is a permutation, and for any pair (a_i, b_j), there exists a way to pair the rest of the elements (assuming that the rest can be paired). But for the purpose of finding s_min, we can ignore that and just find the minimal sum >=x.\n\nWait,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours.
