    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe task is to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least twice in the given string. The occurrences can overlap. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice, overlapping. So the output is 3.\n\nThe input is a string, and the output is the maximum length of such a substring. If there's no such substring (like in the first sample 'abcd' where all characters are unique), output 0.\n\nConstraints: the string length is up to 100. So even a brute force approach might work here, but I need to think about how to implement it efficiently.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. The brute force way would be to check all possible substrings, track their occurrences, and find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nBut how to generate all possible substrings and check their occurrences?\n\nFirst, for all possible lengths starting from the maximum possible down to 1, check if there's a substring of that length that appears at least twice. Once found, return that length.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Iterate possible lengths from the maximum possible (which is len(s)//2, because if a substring is longer than half the string, it can't appear twice. Wait, not exactly. For example, if the string is \"aaaaa\", then a substring of length 3 can appear twice (positions 0-2 and 1-3, etc). But the maximum possible length for a substring that can appear twice is floor(len(s)/2) ? Well, for example, for a string of length 5, the maximum possible length is 2 (since 2*2=4 <=5). Wait, if the string is \"aa\", then the maximum is 1. So for a string of length n, the maximum possible substring length that can appear twice is floor(n/2). But maybe even longer? Like for a string of length 3, like \"aaa\". Then a substring of length 2 can appear twice (positions 0-1 and 1-2). So for n=3, the maximum possible is 2, which is floor(3/2) = 1.5 → floor is 1. Wait, no. Wait, 3//2 is 1. So perhaps the maximum possible length to check is up to (n-1), but for each length l, we need to check if there exists a substring of length l that occurs at least twice.\n\nBut for the problem, the maximum possible l is n-1, but for that to have two occurrences, the string must be something like \"aa...a\", so that the substring of length n-1 occurs twice. For example, \"aaa\" has substrings of length 2: \"aa\" occurs twice.\n\nSo for the general case, the maximum possible l is up to n-1, but for each l, we need to check if any substring of that length occurs at least twice.\n\nSo the approach could be:\n\nFor l in range (max_length, 0, -1):\n\n   for each starting index i in 0 to (n - l):\n\n       substring s[i:i+l]\n\n       check if this substring appears again in the string (at least once more)\n\n       if yes, return l as the answer.\n\nOnce we find the maximum l for which this is true, return it.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCheck for the largest possible l first. Once we find a l where there's a substring of length l appearing at least twice, return that l.\n\nNow, the question is how to implement this efficiently.\n\nBut since n is up to 100, even a O(n^3) approach would work. Because for each l (up to 100), for each possible start (up to 100), and for each occurrence, checking if it exists again.\n\nBut let's think about the steps:\n\nFor each possible l from min(len(s), max possible) down to 1:\n\n   collect all substrings of length l, and check if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\nIf yes, return l.\n\nSo for example, for the sample input 'ababa', the length is 5. Let's check l=5: possible substrings are only one, so no. l=4: substrings are 'abab' and 'baba' — each occurs once. l=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So 'aba' occurs twice. So return 3.\n\nSo the algorithm would work.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nFirst, for each l in range from len(s)-1 down to 1:\n\n   create a set of substrings of length l. But wait, if a substring appears more than once, then the set will have duplicates. Wait, no. The set will contain each substring once. So, for example, if there are two occurrences, the set will have that substring once. So, perhaps for each l, we can collect all substrings of length l, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nBut how to check that? For example, for l=3 in 'ababa', the substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. So the list would have these three. So if we count the frequency of each substring, and see if any has count >= 2.\n\nSo for each l, we can generate all substrings of length l, and check if any of them occurs more than once.\n\nSo for each l, the steps are:\n\n   substrings = [s[i:i+l] for i in range(0, len(s) - l + 1)]\n\n   create a frequency dictionary or use a set to track duplicates.\n\nBut how to check if any of the substrings occurs more than once?\n\nAn alternative is to check for each substring in the list, if it appears again later.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps using a set. For example, for each substring in the list, if adding it to a set and checking if it was already present. But that would require checking for each substring in the list, but perhaps it's easier to use a set.\n\nWait, for example, for the list of substrings, if the length of the set is less than the length of the list, then there's at least one duplicate. But that's not sufficient. Because if there are multiple duplicates, but the set is smaller. So for example, if the list is [a, a, b], the set is size 2, list is size 3. So yes, there are duplicates.\n\nBut for our purpose, we just need to know if there's at least one substring that occurs at least twice. So for each l, generate all substrings, and check if there's any duplicates in that list.\n\nSo for each l, generate all substrings of length l, and check if there are duplicates. If yes, then return l as the answer.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows:\n\nfor l in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n    substrings = [s[i:i+l] for i in range(0, len(s) - l + 1)]\n\n    if len(set(substrings)) < len(substrings):\n\n        return l\n\nreturn 0\n\nWait, but that's not exactly correct. Because the set may have some elements that are duplicated. For example, if there are two same substrings, then the set will have one element, and the len(set) is less than len(substrings). So the condition len(set) < len(substrings) would indicate that there's at least one duplicate.\n\nBut this is only true if there's at least one duplicate. Because if all elements are unique, then the len(set) equals the len(substrings). So if the len(set) is smaller, then there's at least one duplicate.\n\nTherefore, for each l, if the list of substrings has duplicates, then return l.\n\nBut this approach would work. Let me test with sample cases.\n\nSample 1: 'abcd' (len 4). For l=4: substrings is ['abcd'], len(set) is 1, same as len(substrings) (1). So no. l=3: substrings are ['abc', 'bcd'], len is 2. set size is 2. So no. l=2: substrings are ab, bc, cd. All unique. l=1: substrings are a, b, c, d. All unique. So returns 0. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 'ababa' (len 5). For l=5: substrings is ['ababa'], len 1. No. l=4: substrings are 'abab', 'baba'. Both unique. l=3: substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba'. The list is length 3. set is {'aba', 'bab'}, size 2. So 2 < 3 → yes. So returns 3. Correct.\n\nSample 3: 'zzz' (len 3). For l=3: substrings is ['zzz'], no. l=2: substrings are 'zz', 'zz'. len(set) is 1 < 2. So returns 2. Correct.\n\nYes, this approach works.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input string s.\n\nFor l in range from len(s) down to 1:\n\n   generate all substrings of length l.\n\n   if there are duplicates in the list (i.e., len(set) < len(list)), then return l.\n\nIf after checking all l down to 1, none found, return 0.\n\nBut wait, for l= len(s) - 1, for example, in 'zzz' (len 3), l=2. The substrings are 'zz' and 'zz' → len(set) is 1 < 2 → returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\ndef main():\n\n    s = input().strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n        subs = [s[i:i+l] for i in range(0, n - l + 1)]\n\n        if len(set(subs)) < len(subs):\n\n            print(l)\n\n            return\n\n    print(0)\n\nBut wait, what about when there are multiple duplicates but for different l's? For example, the code checks from largest l down, so the first l that meets the condition is the maximum possible, so returns it.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the same substring occurs more than twice? For example, in 'aaaaa', for l=2, there are 4 substrings (aa, aa, aa, aa). The set is size 1, len(subs) is 4 → 1 < 4 → returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut the maximum possible l is 4? For example, in 'aaaaa', len is 5. For l=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' (positions 0-3), 'aaaa' (1-4). So the list has two elements. The set size is 1 < 2 → returns 4. Which is correct. So the code would return 4, which is the correct maximum.\n\nSo this code seems to handle that.\n\nBut wait, the code checks for l in range(n, 0, -1). So for l=5 (the length of the string), the substrings list is [s[0:5]] → len 1. So len(set) is 1, which equals len(subs) → no. Then l=4, which would be checked. So the code would return 4 for 'aaaaa'.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'abcd' → output 0. The code checks l=4, 3, 2, 1. All have no duplicates. So returns 0.\n\nSample Input 2: 'ababa' → l=5 (substrings len 5 → 1 element, no. l=4: 2 elements, unique. l=3: 3 elements, set size 2. So returns 3.\n\nSample Input 3: 'zzz' → l=3: 1 element. l=2: 2 elements, same. returns 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aaaaa' → for l=4, the substrings are 'aaaa' and 'aaaa' → set size 1, len 2 → returns 4.\n\nAnother test case: 'aa' → len 2. l=2: substrings is ['aa'], no. l=1: substrings are ['a', 'a'] → set size 1 < 2 → returns 1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaa' → len 6. Let's see. For l=5: substrings are 'aabba', 'abbaa'. Unique. l=4: 'aabb', 'abba', 'bbaa' → unique? No. Let's see. Wait, the substrings for l=4 are:\n\ni=0: aabb\n\ni=1: abba\n\ni=2: bbaa\n\nSo no duplicates. l=3: substrings are 'aab', 'abb', 'bba', 'baa' → no duplicates? Or maybe not. Let's see. Wait, for 'aabbaa', the substrings of length 3 are:\n\ni=0: aab\n\ni=1: abb\n\ni=2: bba\n\ni=3: baa\n\ni=4: aaa?\n\nWait, the original string is 'aabbaa' (indices 0-5). For l=3, the substrings are:\n\n0-2: aab\n\n1-3: abb\n\n2-4: bba\n\n3-5: baa → no, wait, 3-5 is 3,4,5? So the substring is 'baa'? Or is the string 'aabbaa'?\n\nYes. So for l=3, there are 4 substrings. Are there duplicates? No. Then for l=2: substrings are aa, ab, bb, ba, aa. So the substrings are:\n\ni=0: aa\n\ni=1: ab\n\ni=2: bb\n\ni=3: ba\n\ni=4: aa → so the list is [aa, ab, bb, ba, aa]. The set is {aa, ab, bb, ba} → size 4. The len(subs) is 5. So 4 <5 → returns 2. But wait, there's a substring of length 2 that occurs twice. But what about for l=3? Are there any duplicates?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's think again. For the string 'aabbaa', the maximum possible is 3? Let's see. The substring 'aa' occurs at positions 0-1, 4-5. Also, the substring 'aab' occurs once, 'abb' once, 'bba' once, 'baa' once. But for l=3, there's no duplicates. However, for l=2, the 'aa' occurs twice. So the code returns 2. But what about the substring 'ab'? No. So the code returns 2. However, there is a longer substring that occurs twice. For example, the substring 'aab' occurs once. But maybe there's another substring of length 3?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Let's take the string 'aabbaa' → the substrings of length 3 are:\n\na a b → 'aab'\n\na b b → 'abb'\n\nb b a → 'bba'\n\nb a a → 'baa'\n\nSo no duplicates. So the maximum is indeed 2. So the code returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: 'ababab' → length 6. Let's check for l=3. Substrings are 'aba', 'bab', 'aba', 'bab', 'aba' → so the list is [aba, bab, aba, bab, aba]. The set has size 2. len(subs) is 5. So 2 <5 → returns 3. Which is correct. So the code would return 3.\n\nSo the code seems to work correctly.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input string, loop from len(s) down to 1, generate all substrings of length l, check if there are duplicates. If yes, return l. Otherwise, continue. If none found, return 0.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is given as a list, but looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the sample input, it's given as ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'], but the actual input is a single string. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. So the sample input is probably a list of test cases, but the actual code should read one string per input.\n\nWait, the original problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed that the string is non-empty, etc.\n\nBut the sample input shows something like ['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz'] which is probably a list of test cases, but the code needs to process one string at a time.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\nOutput:\n\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nBut that's probably not the actual input. Probably, the problem is written in a way that the input is a single string. But the sample input shows a list of strings, perhaps as an example of multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the actual input is a single string, and the sample input is a list of test cases, but the code is supposed to process one string.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the sample input and output are given as lists, but the code must read from standard input. So perhaps the actual input is a single string, and the sample input is a list of test cases. But the code must read a single string.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The first input line contains the string. So for example, the first sample input would be the string 'abcd', and the output is 0. The second input is 'ababa', output 3, third input is 'zzz' output 2.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings. That's probably a mistake in the problem statement. For example, perhaps the sample input is written as:\n\nInput:\n\nabcd\n\nababa\n\nzzz\n\nBut in the problem statement, it's written as a list. So the code should read a single string from input. So the code should read the input as s = input().strip().\n\nBut the sample input shows a list of strings. But perhaps that's a formatting error. For example, in the problem statement, the sample input is written as a list, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one string at a time.\n\nTherefore, the code should read one string from input, and output the answer.\n\nSo the code is as follows:\n\nRead the string, process it, output the answer.\n\nSo the code is:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nn = len(s)\n\nfor l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n    subs = [s[i:i+l] for i in range(0, n - l + 1)]\n\n    if len(set(subs)) < len(subs):\n\n        print(l)\n\n        exit()\n\nprint(0)\n\nBut wait, in Python, the exit() function may not be the best way. But in code submission, returning after print is okay.\n\nBut for code submission, perhaps the code should be written as:\n\ndef main():\n\n    s = input().strip()\n\n    n = len(s)\n\n    for l in range(n, 0, -1):\n\n        subs = [s[i:i+l] for i in range(0, n - l + 1)]\n\n        if len(set(subs)) < len(subs):\n\n            print(l)\n\n            return\n\n    print(0)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut the code needs to read from stdin and output the answer.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: input is 'abcd' → output 0.\n\nSample 2: input 'ababa' → output 3.\n\nSample 3: input 'zzz' → output 2.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about when the same substring occurs more than once but in different positions. Like 'aaaaa' → for l=4, the code returns 4, which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: string of length 1. Then output is 0. Because no substring can occur twice.\n\nAnother case: 'aa' → output is 1. Because the substring 'a' occurs twice.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nThus, this should be the correct solution.\n",
