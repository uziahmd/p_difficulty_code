Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border between two blocks. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a block here. Since the roads are infinite lines, they divide the plane into regions. Each block is a region bounded by these lines. The key thing is that moving from one block to another requires that they share a common border of non-zero length. So, if two blocks are adjacent along a line segment (part of a road), you can move between them in one step.\n\nBut how do I model the blocks and their adjacency? It seems impossible to represent all possible blocks directly because there are infinitely many regions. However, perhaps we can model this as a graph where each node represents a block, and edges exist between blocks that are adjacent. But since there are infinitely many blocks, that approach isn't feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe we can model this problem using the concept of dual graphs. Each region (block) is a node, and edges connect regions that share a common boundary. But again, how do we compute this?\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem in terms of the positions of the home and university relative to the roads. Because each road divides the plane into two halves. For any given road, a point (like home or university) is either on one side or the other. The key idea here is that two blocks are adjacent if they differ by exactly one road. Wait, no. Because each time you cross a road, you move into a different block. But when you cross a road, you enter a new block. However, the adjacency depends on which roads are crossed.\n\nBut how to model the blocks? Here's an idea: the position of a point relative to each road can be represented as a binary vector. For each road, the point is on one side or the other. For example, for road i, compute the sign of a_i*x + b_i*y + c_i. If the value is positive, it's on one side; negative on the other. Since the home and university are not on any road, their signs for all roads are well-defined.\n\nEach block can be uniquely identified by the set of signs for each road. However, since the roads are infinite lines, each block is determined by the sign of each equation. But two different sets of signs might represent the same block? No, because each line divides the plane into two regions, and the combination of all these signs defines a unique region. So the home's position can be represented as a vector of signs (for each road, whether it's positive or negative). Similarly for the university.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of roads that need to be crossed to get from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector. Because each step corresponds to crossing a road (i.e., changing the sign for that road), but how?\n\nWait, but when you cross a road, you change the sign of exactly one road. Because crossing a road changes your position from one side to the other. So, the difference between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector would be the number of roads where their signs differ. However, that's not directly the answer. Because each step allows you to cross one road, but moving from one block to another adjacent block requires that you cross exactly one road. However, the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed to reach the target block.\n\nBut how does that relate to the difference in the sign vectors?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the home's sign vector is S, and the university's is T. Let's say that the two vectors differ in k positions. Then, the minimal steps required would be k? No, that's not correct. Because if two regions differ in k roads, then you need to cross those k roads. But each crossing can only change one sign. However, maybe there's a path that requires fewer steps. For example, if two regions differ in two roads, but there's a way to cross one road and then another, but perhaps there's a way to get from one to the other via a different path.\n\nWait, but how can two regions differ in more than one road? Because each time you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road. So, the parity of the number of roads you cross would determine the difference. But maybe the minimal steps is the number of differing roads divided by something? Or maybe not.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose there are two roads. The home is in a region that is positive for both roads. The university is in a region that is negative for both roads. Then, the sign vectors differ in 2 positions. To get from home to university, you can cross road 1, then cross road 2. That's two steps. Alternatively, you could cross",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a plane divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving across a common border between two blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The plane is divided into regions (blocks) by infinite line roads. Each block can be uniquely identified by the sign of the result when evaluating the coordinates of a point (home or university) against each road equation.\n2. **Sign Vectors**: For each road, compute whether the home and university points lie on the positive or negative side of the road. This gives us two binary vectors representing the positions of the home and university relative to all roads.\n3. **Determine Differences**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by the number of roads where the signs of the home and university points differ. Each difference indicates a road that needs to be crossed to move from one block to another.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Compute sign vectors for home and university\n    home_signs = []\n    univ_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val_univ = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        home_signs.append(1 if val_home > 0 else -1)\n        univ_signs.append(1 if val_univ > 0 else -1)\n\n    # Count differing positions\n    diff = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, univ_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            diff += 1\n\n    print(diff // 2)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home and university, along with the equations of the roads.\n- **Sign Vectors Calculation**: For each road, we determine whether the home and university points lie on the positive or negative side of the road. This results in two binary vectors (sign vectors) for the home and university.\n- **Difference Calculation**: The number of differing positions between the two sign vectors is calculated. Each differing position indicates a road that needs to be crossed. Since crossing a road twice brings you back to the original block, the minimum number of steps is half the number of differing positions.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum steps required by leveraging the properties of sign vectors and their differences, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
