Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving through a common border between blocks. Each block is a region divided by the roads. \n\nFirst, I need to model the problem. Since each road is a line, the blocks are regions divided by these lines. The key here is that moving between blocks requires sharing a non-zero length border. So, two blocks are adjacent if they share a segment of a road (i.e., they are separated by exactly one road). But how do I model this?\n\nThe challenge is to represent each block as a node in a graph, and edges exist between nodes if they are adjacent. Then, find the shortest path from the home's block to the university's block. However, with n up to 300, the number of blocks can be huge. So, enumerating all blocks isn't feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another approach. Since each step corresponds to crossing a road, perhaps we can model the problem in terms of the roads. Let me think: each block can be represented by the set of roads that separate it from the home. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the parity of the number of roads that a point is on one side of. For example, for each road, a point is either on one side or the other. If you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road's equation. So, the position of a point relative to all roads can be represented as a binary vector (for each road, whether it's positive or negative). However, since the roads can be overlapping, but the blocks are regions divided by them, each block is uniquely determined by the signs of all the roads.\n\nBut how do I compute the number of steps? Because moving from one block to another requires crossing exactly one road. So, the minimum steps would be the minimal number of roads that separate the home block from the university block. Wait, no. Because each step crosses one road. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads that separate the home and university blocks. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of each block as a node, and edges between blocks that share a common border. Then, the problem is to find the shortest path between the two blocks. But again, how to model the blocks?\n\nAnother idea: For any two points (home and university), the minimal steps required is equal to the number of roads that separate them. Wait, no. Because if two points are separated by k roads, then the minimal steps would be k? Or maybe not. Let me think.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose there's one road. Home is on one side, university on the other. Then, you can cross directly, so steps is 1. If there are two roads, and the home and university are separated by both roads, then maybe you have to cross two roads, so steps is 2. But perhaps there's a way to cross one road first, then another. So the steps would be 2. But maybe the minimal steps is the number of roads separating the two points. How can I model this?\n\nWait, but how do I know which roads separate the home and university? For each road, check whether the home and university are on opposite sides. If they are, then that road is a separator. The minimal steps would be the minimal number of such roads that need to be crossed. But how to model this?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be modeled as a graph where each node represents the set of roads that a point has crossed. But that seems too abstract.\n\nWait, here's a different approach. Let's model the problem as a BFS where each state is the set of roads that have been crossed. But that's not feasible for n=300.\n\nAlternatively, consider that each block is defined by the sign of each road. For each road, the home point is on one side (say, + or -). Similarly for the university. The problem is to find the minimal number of roads that you need to cross to get from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration. Because each step crosses exactly one road, flipping its sign. So, the minimal steps would be the number of roads where the home and university have different signs. But wait, that's not necessarily correct. Because if two roads are crossed, their signs are flipped, but perhaps some roads are crossed multiple times. However, since the home and university are in fixed positions, the sign configuration for each road is fixed. So, the home's sign configuration is a vector of +1/-1 for each road. The university's is another vector. The minimal steps is the number of roads where the two vectors differ. Because each step flips exactly one road's sign, so to go from one configuration to another, you need to flip exactly the roads where they differ. But since each step flips one road,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a starting block (home) to a destination block (university) in a plane divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving through a common border between blocks, which corresponds to crossing a road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Problem**: The key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. If a point is on one side of a road, it can only move to the other side by crossing that road. Thus, the problem reduces to determining how many roads separate the home and university points.\n2. **Sign Configuration**: For each road, determine whether the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road. This can be checked using the sign of the linear equation representing the road.\n3. **Counting Differences**: The minimum number of steps required is the number of roads where the home and university points lie on opposite sides. This is because each such road must be crossed once to move from the home block to the university block.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Compute for home and university the sign for each road\n    home_signs = []\n    univ_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val_home = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val_univ = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        home_signs.append(1 if val_home > 0 else -1)\n        univ_signs.append(1 if val_univ > 0 else -1)\n    \n    # Count the number of differing signs\n    steps = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, univ_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            steps += 1\n    print(steps)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the coordinates of the home and university points, followed by the list of roads.\n2. **Sign Calculation**: For each road, calculate the value of the linear equation at the home and university points. This value determines which side of the road the point lies on.\n3. **Determine Steps**: By comparing the signs of these values for both points, we count how many roads separate the two points. Each such road represents a step needed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of roads.",
