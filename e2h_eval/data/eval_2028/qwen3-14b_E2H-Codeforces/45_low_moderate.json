There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a balanced bracket. But here, the structure isn't fixed. We need to arrange the matches in such a way that the winner plays as many games as possible, following the given rule.\n\nLet me look at the examples. For n=3, the output is 2. The winner plays two games. How does that work? Let's see: the first game is between two players, say 1 and 2. Suppose player 1 wins. Then, player 1 has played 1 game. The next game must be against player 3. Since player 3 hasn't played any games yet, the difference is 1, which is allowed. So player 1 plays two games. That's why the answer is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the answer is 2. Wait, but in a standard knockout, it's two games for the winner (since 4 players: first round two games, then final). But according to the note, the example says that the maximum is 2. So maybe the structure is different. Like, if you have four players, the optimal way is to have the winner play two games. But how?\n\nWait, the note says that for n=4, the answer is 2. Because if you pair (1,2) and (3,4), then the winners (say 1 and 3) play each other. So the winner (1) has played two games. But if you tried to make the winner play three games, that would require more players. But how?\n\nSo the question is, how to arrange the matches so that the winner plays as many games as possible. The rule is that when two players meet, their number of previous games can differ by at most one. \n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose the maximum number of games the winner can play is f(n). How to find f(n)?\n\nLet's think about the structure. For the winner to play as many games as possible, each time they play a match, they should be facing an opponent who has played as many games as possible. Because that way, the winner can accumulate more games.\n\nBut how does this relate to the number of players?\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a binary tree. Each game is a node, and the winner proceeds to the next round. However, the structure here might not be a balanced binary tree. For example, in the case of n=3, the winner plays two games. So the tree would have two levels. But how does that fit into the rules?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that each time the winner plays a game, they must have a new opponent. For the opponent to be eligible, the difference in the number of games they've played is at most one. So, suppose the winner has played k games so far. Then the opponent can have played either k-1, k, or k+1 games. But since the winner is trying to maximize their own games, perhaps the opponent is someone who has played k-1 games. Because then, after this match, the winner will have played k+1 games, and the opponent (if they lose) is out.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Maybe the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the Fibonacci sequence. Because each time, to get to the next level, you need to have enough players.\n\nLet me think. Let's imagine that for the winner to play m games, they need to have a certain number of players. Let's think of the minimal number of players required for the winner to play m games. Let's call this number S(m). Then, for the problem, given n, we need to find the maximum m where S(m) ≤ n.\n\nHow to compute S(m)? Let's think recursively. For the winner to play m games, they must have played m-1 games before the last match. So, in order to reach that, the winner must have faced an opponent who has played m-1 or m-2 games. Let's think of the structure:\n\nThe first game the winner plays is against someone who has played 0 games. Then, the winner has 1 game. To play a second game, they need to face someone who has played 0 or 1 games. Let's assume the optimal scenario where the opponent has played 1 game. Then, the winner would have 2 games. But how do we get that opponent?\n\nThis seems similar to the Fibonacci sequence. For",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule that two players can only compete if the difference in the number of games they have already played is at most one. \n\n### Approach\nThe key insight here is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using a Fibonacci-like sequence. This is because each time the winner plays a game, the number of players required to allow the winner to play an additional game follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the minimum number of players required for the winner to play `m` games is given by the Fibonacci sequence. \n\nWe use this approach:\n1. Precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to the point where the value exceeds the maximum possible input (10^18).\n2. For a given number of players `n`, find the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to `n` and determine the corresponding number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    \n    # Precompute Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18\n    fib = [1, 1]\n    while fib[-1] <= 10**18:\n        fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])\n    \n    # Find the maximum m such that fib[m] <= n\n    # The answer is the index m-1, since fib[0] = 1 corresponds to 1 game\n    # Wait, let's think again: the index in fib list starts from 0, but how does it map to the number of games?\n    # Let's re-express the logic.\n    # For m games, the minimal number of players is fib[m+1], perhaps? Let's think with examples.\n    # For m=1: needs 2 players (fib[2]=2)\n    # For m=2: needs 3 players (fib[3]=3)\n    # For m=3: needs 5 players (fib[4]=5)\n    # So the minimal number of players for m games is fib[m+1]\n    # So we need to find the maximum m such that fib[m+1] <= n\n    \n    # Let's adjust the code accordingly\n    max_games = 0\n    for i in range(len(fib)):\n        if fib[i] <= n:\n            max_games = i - 1\n        else:\n            break\n    print(max_games)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: We generate Fibonacci numbers up to a value greater than $10^{18}$ to handle the upper constraint of the input.\n2. **Finding Maximum Games**: For a given number of players `n`, we determine the maximum number of games the winner can play by finding the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to `n`. The index of this Fibonacci number gives us the number of games the winner can play, adjusted for the sequence offset.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using precomputed values, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper limits of the input constraints.",
