In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and we have to find the minimum draws required.\n\nFirst, let's think about what the possible scenarios are. For the initial three tiles, maybe they already form a mentsu. If so, the answer is 0. Otherwise, we need to find out how many more tiles are needed to form either a triplet or a sequence.\n\nLet me think about the approach. For each possible case, check if there's already a mentsu. If not, then determine the minimum draws required to form one.\n\nBut how do I check for possible mentsu in the current hand, or after adding some tiles?\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nCase 1: The current three tiles already form a mentsu. Then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: They don't. Then, we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the total tiles (original + added) contains at least one mentsu.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nFor example, in the third sample input: 3p, 9m, 2p. The current tiles don't form any mentsu. But by adding 1p or 4p, you can form a sequence with 2p, 3p, and 1p (or 2p,3p,4p). So the answer is 1.\n\nSo the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that the total tiles can form a triplet or a sequence.\n\nNow, how to model this?\n\nFirst, check if the original three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nIf not, then for each possible way to form a mentsu, compute how many tiles are needed to reach that state.\n\nThen take the minimum among all those possibilities.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCheck for existing mentsu. If exists, return 0.\n\nElse, find the minimal number of tiles to add to create a mentsu.\n\nBut how to check for possible ways to form a mentsu with the current tiles plus some added tiles?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches.\n\nFirst, let's think about the possible mentsu that can be formed. For each possible mentsu (triplet or sequence), calculate how many tiles are needed to form it, given the current tiles.\n\nThen, take the minimum of all these possibilities.\n\nBut how to generate all possible mentsu that can be formed with the current tiles plus some added tiles?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible triplet or sequence, compute how many tiles are missing from the current hand to form that triplet/sequence. Then, the minimal such value would be the answer.\n\nBut since the current hand has three tiles, and the mentsu requires three tiles, but when adding tiles, the total number of tiles in the hand is 3 + added. However, the mentsu can be formed by any subset of three tiles in the total hand. So, for example, if the current hand has two tiles of a triplet, then adding one tile would make a triplet. Similarly, for sequences.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to checking for all possible triplets and sequences, and for each, compute the number of tiles needed to complete that mentsu, then take the minimum.\n\nBut how to generate all possible triplets and sequences that could be formed with the current tiles plus some additions.\n\nLet's think about the steps:\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, for each possible triplet (all possible same tiles) and each possible sequence (three consecutive numbers in same suit), compute how many tiles are needed to get that mentsu.\n\nBut since the current tiles may already have some of the required tiles, we can compute for each possible mentsu the number of tiles that are missing.\n\nFor example, for a triplet of tile X, the current hand may have 0, 1, 2, or 3 of X. If it has 3, then it's already a triplet. If it has 2, then we need to add 1. If 1, add 2. If 0, add 3.\n\nBut wait, the triplet requires exactly three same tiles. So if the current hand has two of X, then adding one would make a triplet. So for each possible triplet (like 1m, 1m, 1m), the required number of tiles to add is max(0, 3 - count of X in current hand).\n\nSimilarly for sequences. For a sequence like 1m, 2m, 3m. How many tiles are needed? For example, if the current hand has 1m, 2m, then adding 3m would make a sequence. So the required number is 3 - number of tiles in the sequence that are already present.\n\nBut the problem is that the current hand may have some of the tiles in the sequence. So for each possible sequence, we need to check how many tiles are already present in the current hand. Then, the required number is 3 minus that count.\n\nBut how to generate all possible sequences and triplets?\n\nLet me think about generating all possible triplets and sequences.\n\nFor triplets:\n\nEach possible tile (1m, 2m, ..., 9m, 1p, etc.) can form a triplet. So for each tile type (like 1m), check how many tiles are needed to get three of them.\n\nFor sequences:\n\nEach sequence is three consecutive numbers in the same suit. So for each suit, and for each possible starting number (from 1 to 7, since 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9), there's a sequence. For example, for suit 'm', sequences are 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9. Each of these sequences can be checked.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet and sequence, compute how many tiles are needed to form it, given the current hand.\n\nThe minimal among all these is the answer.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping possibilities. For example, maybe there are multiple ways to form a triplet or sequence, and we need to find the minimal required tiles.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Check if the current hand already has a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\n2. Else, generate all possible triplets and sequences, compute the required number of tiles to form each, then take the minimum of all those numbers.\n\nBut how to check if the current hand already has a mentsu?\n\nWell, for the current three tiles, check if they form a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo, first step: check if the current three tiles form a triplet or sequence.\n\nHow?\n\nFor triplet: all three must be same tile.\n\nFor sequence: they must be three consecutive numbers in same suit.\n\nSo for example, if the three tiles are 1s, 2s, 3s → sequence. Or 2m, 2m, 2m → triplet.\n\nSo, for the initial check, we can check these two possibilities.\n\nIf either is true, then answer is 0.\n\nIf not, proceed to compute the minimal required tiles.\n\nNow, for the rest of the cases, we need to generate all possible triplets and sequences and find the minimal required tiles.\n\nBut how to generate all possible triplets and sequences?\n\nLet's think about the triplet possibilities. For each possible tile (like 1m, 2m, etc.), the triplet would require three of that tile. So for each tile in the possible set, we can calculate how many of them are already in the current hand. Then, the required tiles to add is 3 - count. For example, if current hand has two 1m, then required is 1. But if current hand has zero, then required is 3.\n\nBut since the current hand has three tiles, perhaps for some triplet, the current hand already has some of the tiles. So for example, if the current hand has two 1m and one other tile, then the required is 1.\n\nSo, for all possible triplet candidates, compute the required number of tiles to get three of them.\n\nSimilarly, for sequences. For each possible sequence (like 1m-2m-3m), check how many of those three tiles are already in the current hand. The required tiles is 3 minus that count. For example, if current hand has 1m and 2m, then required is 1 (add 3m). If current has 1m and 3m, then required is 1 (add 2m). If current has 1m, then required is 2 (add 2m and 3m). Etc.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nGenerate all possible triplet candidates and sequence candidates. For each candidate, compute the required number of tiles to form it. The minimal among all these is the answer.\n\nBut how to generate all possible candidates?\n\nFor triplets:\n\nThere are 9 * 3 = 27 possible tile types (each suit has 9 numbers). Each of these can be a triplet. For each, compute the required tiles.\n\nFor sequences:\n\nFor each suit, there are 7 possible sequences (since 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9). So for each suit, 7 sequences. Total 3*7=21 sequences.\n\nSo, in total, 27 + 21 = 48 possible candidates. For each, compute the required tiles.\n\nBut then, for each candidate, we need to compute how many of the required tiles are already present in the current hand.\n\nFor example, for a triplet of 1m, the count is the number of 1m tiles in the current hand. For a sequence of 1m, 2m, 3m, the count is the number of tiles in the current hand that are in {1m, 2m, 3m}.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nFirst, parse the input into three tiles.\n\nThen, check if the current three tiles form a triplet or sequence. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse, for all possible triplet candidates and sequence candidates, compute the required number of tiles needed to form that candidate, and find the minimal among all those numbers.\n\nBut how to check for the current three tiles forming a triplet or sequence.\n\nLet me think about that.\n\nFor the current three tiles, check if they are all same (triplet). For example, tiles are [a, a, a]. Or check if they are consecutive in same suit. For example, sorted numbers are x, x+1, x+2, same suit.\n\nSo, for the current three tiles:\n\nCheck if all three are same. If yes, then return 0.\n\nElse, check if they form a sequence. To check that:\n\n- All three must be same suit.\n\n- When sorted, their numbers are consecutive.\n\nSo, for example, tiles are 1s, 3s, 2s → sorted as 1,2,3 → consecutive. So it's a sequence.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\ncurrent_tiles = list of three tiles.\n\nCheck for triplet:\n\nif all three are same.\n\nCheck for sequence:\n\nif all suits are same, and sorted numbers are consecutive.\n\nIf either is true, return 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nOnce that is done, generate all possible triplet and sequence candidates.\n\nNow, for each possible triplet candidate (tile_type), compute how many tiles are needed to get three of them.\n\nFor example, the current hand has 1s, 2s, 3s. For triplet candidate 1s, the count is 1 (since there is one 1s in the hand). So required is 3 - 1 = 2. So to get a triplet of 1s, need to add two more 1s.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, the current hand has two 1s. Then required is 1.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet candidate, the required is max(0, 3 - count_in_hand).\n\nSimilarly, for each sequence candidate (three tiles), count how many of those three are present in the current hand. Then required is 3 - count.\n\nBut for the sequence candidate, the three tiles are the three consecutive numbers in the same suit.\n\nSo, for example, for the sequence 1m, 2m, 3m, the required is 3 minus the number of those three tiles that are present in the current hand.\n\nSo, for each possible sequence candidate, we need to check how many of the three tiles are already present in the current hand.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nFor all possible triplet candidates:\n\nfor each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n   for number in 1..9:\n\n       tile = str(number) + suit\n\n       count_in_hand = number of times tile appears in current_tiles\n\n       required = 3 - count_in_hand\n\n       add this required to the list of possible options.\n\nFor all possible sequence candidates:\n\nfor each suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n   for start_num in 1..7:\n\n       sequence_tiles = [start_num, start_num+1, start_num+2] with suit\n\n       count_in_hand = sum(1 for tile in current_tiles if tile is in sequence_tiles)\n\n       required = 3 - count_in_hand\n\n       add this required to the list of possible options.\n\nOnce all these are generated, the answer is the minimum of all those required numbers.\n\nBut wait, there's a problem here. Because the current hand may have more than three tiles. Wait, no. The current hand has exactly three tiles. So, for example, when considering a triplet candidate, the count_in_hand can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. For example, if the current hand has two of the tile, then required is 1. But when considering a sequence candidate, the count_in_hand can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. For example, if the current hand has two tiles that are part of the sequence, then required is 1.\n\nBut for example, if the current hand has two tiles of the same suit, but not consecutive. Like 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, for the sequence 1m,2m,3m: count_in_hand is 2 (the 1m and 2m). So required is 1 (add 3m). For the sequence 2m,3m,4m: count_in_hand is 2 (2m and 4m). So required is 1 (add 3m). So for this case, the minimal is 1.\n\nSo, the approach seems correct.\n\nOnce all possible candidates are considered, the minimal required is the answer.\n\nNow, the problem is that some candidates may require more than others, but the code will find the minimal.\n\nBut what about overlapping possibilities? For example, the same required number can come from different candidates. But we just need the minimal.\n\nSo, the code would generate all possible required numbers (for all triplets and sequences) and take the minimum.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead the three tiles.\n\nCheck if they already form a mentsu. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\n   generate all possible triplet and sequence candidates, compute required tiles for each.\n\n   the answer is the minimum of all those required values.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nLet's think about the code.\n\nFirst, the input is three strings. For example, input is given as a list of three strings, but in the sample input, it's written as ['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p'], but the actual input is a single line with three strings. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput: The only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from 1 to 9 and the second character is m, p or s.\n\nSo, the input is three strings separated by spaces. For example, in the sample input, the first case is '1s 2s 3s' — which would be the three tiles.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows the input as a list of three elements, but in reality, the input is three strings on a single line, separated by spaces.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\nBut this is probably a mistake in formatting. The actual input is three strings on one line. For example, for the first test case, the input is \"1s 2s 3s\", which is three tiles. The output is 0.\n\nSo, the code should read three strings from the input line. So, for example, the input is read as input().split(), which gives a list of three strings.\n\nSo, in Python, the code would be:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nWhich gives a list of three elements, each being a tile like '1s', '2p', etc.\n\nOnce we have the three tiles, the first step is to check if they form a mentsu.\n\nSo, let's code that.\n\nFirst, check if all three are same. For example, tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]. If yes, then return 0.\n\nElse, check if they form a sequence.\n\nTo check that:\n\nAll three must be same suit. So, check that the suit of each is same.\n\nThen, extract the numbers, sort them, and check if they are consecutive.\n\nFor example:\n\ntile1_num = int(tiles[0][0])\n\ntile2_num = int(tiles[1][0])\n\ntile3_num = int(tiles[2][0])\n\nsorted_nums = sorted([tile1_num, tile2_num, tile3_num])\n\nif sorted_nums[1] == sorted_nums[0] + 1 and sorted_nums[2] == sorted_nums[1] + 1:\n\n   then it's a sequence.\n\nIf either of the two conditions is true, then return 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nOnce that's done, generate all possible triplet and sequence candidates.\n\nNow, for generating all possible triplet candidates:\n\nWe can loop through each possible tile type. For each tile type (number and suit), count how many times it appears in the current tiles. Then, required is 3 - count.\n\nBut how to generate all possible tile types?\n\nFor each suit in ['m', 'p', 's'], and for each number from 1 to 9.\n\nSo, for example, for suit 'm', numbers 1-9.\n\nFor each of these, check how many are present in the current tiles.\n\nBut the current tiles are three elements. So, for example, for a given tile_type (e.g., '1m'), count_in_hand is the number of times it appears in the tiles list.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ntriplet_candidates = []\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    for num in range(1, 10):\n\n        tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n\n        count = tiles.count(tile)\n\n        required = 3 - count\n\n        triplet_candidates.append(required)\n\nSimilarly, for sequences:\n\nsequence_candidates = []\n\nfor suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n    for start_num in range(1, 8):  # 1 to 7 inclusive\n\n        # the sequence is start_num, start_num+1, start_num+2\n\n        # create the three tiles\n\n        seq_tiles = [f\"{start_num}{suit}\", f\"{start_num+1}{suit}\", f\"{start_num+2}{suit}\"]\n\n        # count how many of these are present in the current tiles\n\n        count = 0\n\n        for t in tiles:\n\n            if t in seq_tiles:\n\n                count += 1\n\n        required = 3 - count\n\n        sequence_candidates.append(required)\n\nOnce all triplet and sequence candidates are generated, collect all their required values and find the minimum.\n\nSo the overall answer is min(triplet_candidates + sequence_candidates).\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the required is negative? No, because for triplet_candidates, count can be up to 3. So 3 - count can be 0, 1, 2, 3. For example, if count is 3, required is 0. But in that case, the initial check would have detected that the current tiles already form a triplet, and the answer would have been 0. So in the code, when we reach this part, the current tiles do not form a mentsu. Therefore, for all candidates, required is at least 1?\n\nNo. Suppose the current tiles have two of a triplet. For example, the current tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m]. Then, the initial check would not have found a mentsu. But for the triplet candidate 1m, the count is 2, required is 1. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if the current tiles have three of a triplet? Then the initial check would have found that and returned 0. So in this part of the code, the required for that triplet candidate would be 0, but since the initial check passed, that's impossible.\n\nThus, the code for the initial check is correct.\n\nSo, the code proceeds to generate all possible required values, and the minimal among them is the answer.\n\nBut let's think about some examples.\n\nTake the third sample input: 3p, 9m, 2p.\n\nCurrent tiles: 3p, 9m, 2p.\n\nCheck for triplet: all three are different. So no.\n\nCheck for sequence: suits are p, m, p. Not all same. So no.\n\nSo proceed to generate all candidates.\n\nTriplet candidates:\n\nFor each tile type:\n\nFor example, for 3p: count is 1. required is 2. For 2p: count is 1, required 2. For 9m: count is 1, required 2. For other tiles, count is 0, required 3.\n\nSo, the minimal triplet required is 2.\n\nSequence candidates:\n\nFor each possible sequence.\n\nLooking for sequences in same suit.\n\nFor suit 'p':\n\npossible sequences are 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9.\n\nFor example, the sequence 2p,3p,4p. The current tiles have 2p and 3p. So count is 2. required is 1. Which is the case in the sample. So the minimal required is 1.\n\nSo, the code would find that 1 is the minimal required, hence output 1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: the third sample's answer is 1.\n\nSo the code works for this case.\n\nAnother example: input is 1s 2s 3s. The initial check finds that it is a sequence, returns 0.\n\nAnother example: input is 1m 1m 1p. Then, initial check: not a triplet (since not all same), not a sequence (different suits). So proceed.\n\nTriplet candidates: for 1m, count is 2, required 1. For 1p, count is 1, required 2. For others, higher. So minimal triplet is 1.\n\nSequence candidates: for example, for 1m, 2m, 3m: current has 1m, but not others. count is 1. required 2. For 1p, 2p, 3p: current has 1p. required 2. So the minimal between triplet and sequence is 1. So answer is 1.\n\nSo the code would return 1.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about cases where the required is 2?\n\nFor example, if the current tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, to form a triplet of 1m, need 1 more. To form a sequence 1m, 2m, 3m: need 1. So the minimal is 1.\n\nBut according to the code:\n\nFor the triplet candidate 1m, required is 3 - 2 = 1.\n\nFor the sequence 1m-2m-3m: count is 2 (1m and 2m), required is 1. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo code returns 1.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother example: current tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. So, for sequence 1-2-3: need 1 (3m). For sequence 2-3-4: need 1 (3m). For sequence 3-4-5: need 3 (3, 5, etc). So the minimal is 1. So code returns 1.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle this.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple possible candidates. For example, current tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, the code would generate for triplet 1m: required 1. For sequence 1m, 2m, 3m: required 1. So the minimal is 1.\n\nSo code returns 1.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement the initial check for existing mentsu.\n\nThen generate all possible triplet and sequence candidates, compute required, and take the minimum.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\nThen, check for triplet:\n\nif tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    check for sequence.\n\nTo check for sequence:\n\nsuits = [t[1] for t in tiles]\n\nif all same:\n\n    numbers = [int(t[0]) for t in tiles]\n\n    sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)\n\n    if sorted_numbers[1] == sorted_numbers[0]+1 and sorted_numbers[2] == sorted_numbers[1]+1:\n\n        print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    proceed.\n\nBut code-wise:\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # check triplet\n\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n\n        return True\n\n    # check sequence\n\n    suits = set(t[1] for t in tiles)\n\n    if len(suits) != 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n\n    if nums[1] == nums[0] +1 and nums[2] == nums[1] +1:\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nSo, if is_mentsu returns True, then output 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nOnce that is done, generate all possible triplet and sequence candidates.\n\nSo, code:\n\nif is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    # generate all possible candidates\n\n    min_required = float('inf')\n\n    # check triplets\n\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n\n            target_tile = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n\n            count = tiles.count(target_tile)\n\n            required = 3 - count\n\n            if required < min_required:\n\n                min_required = required\n\n    # check sequences\n\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n\n            seq_tiles = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n\n            count = 0\n\n            for t in tiles:\n\n                if t in seq_tiles:\n\n                    count +=1\n\n            required = 3 - count\n\n            if required < min_required:\n\n                min_required = required\n\n    print(min_required)\n\nWait, but in the code above, the min_required is initially set to infinity, and then updated for each candidate. So after checking all candidates, the min_required is the minimal required.\n\nBut what about the case where the required is 0? Well, since the initial check already passed, that can't happen. Because if there is a triplet or sequence in the current tiles, the initial check would have returned 0. So in this part of the code, all required values are >= 1?\n\nNot exactly. For example, suppose the current tiles are [1m, 1m, 1m]. Then, the initial check would have detected it, and output 0. So in this code, the else part is executed only when there is no mentsu. Hence, for any candidate, required can't be zero. Because, for example, if a triplet candidate has count 3, then required is 0. But that would imply that the current tiles have three of that tile, which would be a triplet, and the initial check would have passed. Hence, in this code, the required can't be zero. So, the code is safe.\n\nBut in code, for example, if the current tiles have two of a triplet, and the code is checking for that triplet, required is 1. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what about if the current tiles have two tiles of a triplet and one tile of another triplet? For example, tiles are [1m, 1m, 2m]. Then, for the triplet candidate 1m, required is 1. For the triplet candidate 2m, required is 2. But the code would take the minimal.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1: ['1s', '2s', '3s']\n\nIn the initial check, it's a sequence. So output 0.\n\nSample input 2: ['9m', '9m', '9m'] → triplet. Output 0.\n\nSample input 3: ['3p', '9m', '2p']\n\nInitial check: not triplet. Suits are p, m, p → not all same. So no sequence. Proceed.\n\nFor triplet candidates:\n\nFor 3p → count is 1 → required 2.\n\nFor 2p → count 1 → required 2.\n\nFor 9m → count 1 → required 2.\n\nOther tiles: count 0 → required 3. So the minimal triplet is 2.\n\nFor sequences:\n\nLooking for sequences in suit p.\n\nFor example, sequence 2p, 3p, 4p → current has 2p and 3p. count is 2 → required 1. So min_required becomes 1.\n\nHence, the code outputs 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: input is 1m 1m 2m → initial check: not triplet (only two 1m). Not sequence (suits same, numbers 1,1,2 → sorted is 1,1,2 → not consecutive. So no. So proceed.\n\nTriplet candidates:\n\nFor 1m: count is 2 → required 1.\n\nFor 2m: count is 1 → required 2.\n\nSequences:\n\nFor suit m, sequences:\n\nstart 1: 1,2,3 → current has 1, 1, 2 → count is 2 (two 1m and one 2m). So required is 1 (need 3m). So min_required is 1.\n\nThus, answer is 1.\n\nSo code returns 1.\n\nAnother example: input is 1m 3m 5m. No mentsu. What is the minimal required?\n\nPossible options:\n\nTriplet: for 1m, required 2 (current count 1). For 3m, required 2. For 5m, required 2. Or other triplets.\n\nSequences: for example, 1m, 2m, 3m → current has 1m and 3m. count is 2. required 1. Or 3m,4m,5m → current has 3m and 5m. required 1. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo code would find that.\n\nSo, code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut note that in the code, the initial check is done. Now, code:\n\nRead the input as tiles = input().split()\n\nThen, check for mentsu.\n\nBut in Python, the code for is_mentsu can be implemented as follows.\n\nBut how to code the initial check.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\ntiles = input().split()\n\ndef is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    # check triplet\n\n    if tiles[0] == tiles[1] == tiles[2]:\n\n        return True\n\n    # check sequence\n\n    suits = {t[1] for t in tiles}\n\n    if len(suits) != 1:\n\n        return False\n\n    nums = sorted([int(t[0]) for t in tiles])\n\n    if nums[1] == nums[0] + 1 and nums[2] == nums[1] + 1:\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nif is_mentsu(tiles):\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    min_required = float('inf')\n\n    # check triplets\n\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n        for num in range(1, 10):\n\n            target = f\"{num}{suit}\"\n\n            count = tiles.count(target)\n\n            required = 3 - count\n\n            if required < min_required:\n\n                min_required = required\n\n    # check sequences\n\n    for suit in ['m', 'p', 's']:\n\n        for start in range(1, 8):\n\n            seq_tiles = [f\"{start}{suit}\", f\"{start+1}{suit}\", f\"{start+2}{suit}\"]\n\n            cnt = 0\n\n            for t in tiles:\n\n                if t in seq_tiles:\n\n                    cnt += 1\n\n            required = 3 - cnt\n\n            if required < min_required:\n\n                min_required = required\n\n    print(min_required)\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the minimal required is 2? For example, if the current tiles have one tile of a triplet, and no possible sequences. Then, the code would return 2.\n\nBut let's think about the case where the current tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, the code would generate for the sequence 1m,2m,3m (required 1), and for 2m,3m,4m (required 1). So the answer is 1.\n\nBut if the current tiles are 1m, 2m, 5m. Then, the sequences:\n\nFor 1-2-3 → required 1 (add 3m).\n\nFor 2-3-4 → required 2 (add 3m and 4m).\n\nFor 3-4-5 → required 2 (add 3m and 4m).\n\nFor 4-5-6 → required 3 (add 4m, 5m, 6m? No, current has 5m. So for sequence 4-5-6, current has 5m. So count is 1. required 2. So the minimal is 1.\n\nThus, code returns 1.\n\nBut what about a case where the required is 2?\n\nLike, current tiles are 1m, 1m, 3m. Then, for the triplet 1m, required is 1 (add 1m). For sequences: for 1m, 2m, 3m → current has 1m and 3m. So required is 1 (add 2m). So answer is 1.\n\nSo code returns 1.\n\nAnother example: current tiles are 1m, 3m, 5m. So, for any sequence, the count is 1 (each sequence requires three consecutive numbers). For example, 1-2-3: current has 1m. required 2. 3-4-5: current has 3m and 5m. required 1 (add 4m). So answer is 1.\n\nThus, code returns 1.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut what about the case where the minimal is 2? For example, current tiles are 1m, 1p, 2p. Then, no mentsu. For triplet candidates, the minimal required is 2 (for example, to get triplet of 1p, need 2 more). For sequences: for suit p, 1-2-3 → current has 1p and 2p → required 1 (add 3p). So answer is 1.\n\nThus, code returns 1.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the current tiles are 1m, 1m, 2p. Then, for the triplet 1m, required is 1. For sequences: in suit m, 1-2-3 → current has two 1m. required 1 (add 2m). So answer is 1.\n\nThus, code returns 1.\n\nAnother edge case: current tiles are 1m, 1m, 1p. Then, for triplet 1m: required is 1. For triplet 1p: required 2. For sequences: for example, 1m, 2m, 3m: required 2 (add 2m and 3m). So the minimal is 1.\n\nThus, code returns 1.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nTherefore, this should be the correct solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra suited tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, we check if the current three tiles already form a valid mentsu.

The number of additional tiles needed to form a triplet is calculated as `3 - count`.\n3. **Sequence Check**: For each possible sequence (three consecutive numbers in the same suit), we count how many of those tiles are already present. The number of additional tiles needed is calculated as `3 - count`.\n4. **Determine Minimum Requirement**: By iterating through all possible triplets and sequences, we find the minimum number of tiles needed to complete any valid mentsu.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible ways to form a mentsu and determine the minimal number of tiles required.",
