The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the problem reduces to counting how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, for the keys, count how many are even and how many are odd. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, exactly. Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, and each odd chest can be paired with an even key. But since each key can be used once and each chest once, we take the min of each pair.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n   - For each a_i in the chests array, check if it's even or odd. Let's say even_chest = count of even numbers, odd_chest = count of odd numbers.\n\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n   - Similarly, even_key and odd_key.\n\n3. The answer is min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key).\n\nThat makes sense. Let me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\nChests: 9,14,6,2,11. Let's check their parity:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chest is 3 (14,6,2), odd_chest is 2 (9,11). \n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's see: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_key is 3 (8,4,20), odd_key is 1 (7). \n\nThen, min(even_chest=3, odd_key=1) is 1. min(odd_chest=2, even_key=3) is 2. Total 3, which matches the first example's output of 3. Correct.\n\nSecond example: \nChests are 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chest=5, odd_chest=0. Keys: 5 (odd). So odd_key=1, even_key=0. So min(5, 1) is 1, and min(0,0) is 0. Total 1. Which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chest is 1, odd_chest 0. Keys even_key=4, odd_key=0. So min(1,0) is 0, and min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this logic works. \n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\n- Read n and m.\n- Read the list of a_i's.\n- Read the list of b_j's.\n- Count even and odd in a and in b.\n- Compute the sum of min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nThat's straightforward. Now, implement this in Python.\n\nEdge cases to consider:\n\n- All chests even, all keys even: answer 0.\n- All chests odd, all keys odd: answer 0.\n- More even chests than odd keys, but some odd chests and even keys. Etc.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the next line as list of integers for a.\n\nThen read the next line as list of integers for b.\n\nCount even_a: sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0). Similarly for odd_a = n - even_a.\n\nSame for even_b and odd_b.\n\nThen compute the answer as min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nPrint that.\n\nYes. Now, code.\n\nBut wait, for the input, the user provided multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the input is given as per the problem. Wait, the sample input shows three different test cases. But the code needs to process a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as first line n and m, then second line the a_i's, third line the b_j's. So the code should read one test case. But in the sample input, there are three examples. But that's probably for the purpose of showing multiple test cases. However, the actual code needs to process one test case per run. Wait, no, the problem says that the input is given as per the problem. So the code should read from stdin, which for the programming competition problem would be a single test case. However, in the sample input given here, the user provided three examples. But perhaps that's just for illustration. The actual code should process one test case.\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first example input is:\n\n5 4\n\n9 14 6 2 11\n\n8 4 7 20\n\nWhich is one test case. The output is 3.\n\nThen the second example input is:\n\n5 1\n\n2 4 6 8 10\n\n5\n\nOutput is 1.\n\nThird example input is:\n\n1 4\n\n10\n\n20 30 40 50\n\nOutput 0.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. So the code should read from stdin, which for each run is one test case. So the code should read the first line as n and m, then the next line as a list of n numbers, then the next line as m numbers.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead n and m from input.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen read the next line as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute even_a, odd_a, even_b, odd_b.\n\nThen compute the answer.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be something like:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\n\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nans = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nWait, that's all. Let me test this code against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na: [9,14,6,2,11]. even_a is 3 (14,6,2). odd_a is 2.\n\nb: [8,4,7,20]. even_b is 3 (8,4,20), odd_b is 1 (7). \n\nmin(3,1) is 1. min(2,3) is 2. Total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\nn=5, m=1.\n\na is [2,4,6,8,10]. even_a=5. odd_a=0.\n\nb is [5]. even_b=0, odd_b=1.\n\nmin(5,1) is 1. min(0,0) is 0. Total 1. Correct.\n\nThird example: n=1, m=4.\n\na is [10]. even_a=1, odd_a=0.\n\nb is [20,30,40,50]. even_b=4, odd_b=0.\n\nso min(1,0) is 0. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where all chests are even and all keys are odd. Then even_a = n, odd_b = m. So min(n, m) is the answer.\n\nAnother case: chests have 0 even, but keys have some even. Then min(0, even_b) is 0, and min(odd_a, even_b) is min(odd_a, even_b). But if odd_a is 0, then 0.\n\nAnother case: n=0? But according to constraints, n and m are at least 1. So no.\n\nSo the code handles all cases.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. The condition for opening a chest is that the sum of the chest's number and the key's number must be odd. This means that each chest with an even number requires a key with an odd number, and each chest with an odd number requires a key with an even number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Match Pairs**: Use the counts to determine the maximum possible pairs:\n   - Even-numbered chests can be paired with odd-numbered keys.\n   - Odd-numbered chests can be paired with even-numbered keys.\n3. **Calculate Result**: The result is the sum of the minimum counts of the valid pairs from the above two categories.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_a = sum(1 for x in a if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_a = n - even_a\n\neven_b = sum(1 for x in b if x % 2 == 0)\nodd_b = m - even_b\n\nresult = min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of chests and keys, followed by the numbers on the chests and keys.\n2. **Counting Even and Odd Numbers**: We count how many numbers are even and odd in both the chests and keys lists.\n3. **Forming Valid Pairs**: \n   - The number of valid pairs between even chests and odd keys is determined by the smaller count of even chests and odd keys.\n   - Similarly, the number of valid pairs between odd chests and even keys is determined by the smaller count of odd chests and even keys.\n4. **Result Calculation**: Summing these two values gives the maximum number of chests that can be opened.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the necessary values and computes the result in linear time relative to the size of the input lists, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
