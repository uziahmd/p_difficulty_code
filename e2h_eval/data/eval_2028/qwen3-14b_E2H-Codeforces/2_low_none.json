Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must have the same character. Also, all other cells must have the same character, different from the diagonal's.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all elements not on the diagonals are the same, and that they are different from 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nFirst, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check that they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are the same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut wait, for the diagonals, there's an overlap in the middle cell when n is odd. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when checking, we need to make sure that all elements on both diagonals are same. So for each cell in the diagonals, check if they are same as the first diagonal element.\n\nBut how to collect all the diagonal elements?\n\nLet me think: for each row i, the main diagonal is (i, i). For the anti-diagonal, it's (i, n-1 -i). So for each cell (i,j), it is on a diagonal if j == i or j == n-1 -i.\n\nSo for all cells in the grid, check if they are on either diagonal. If they are, they must be equal to the first diagonal's character (say, the top-left corner's character). Wait, but maybe the first diagonal's character is not the same as the anti-diagonal's. Wait no, because the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letters. So all elements on both diagonals must be same. So for example, the first cell (0,0) is on the main diagonal, and (0, n-1) is on the anti-diagonal. So all elements on both diagonals must be same as each other.\n\nSo first, collect all the diagonal elements. Let me collect all the characters from both diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. If not, return NO.\n\nThen, collect all the non-diagonal elements. Check if they are all same, and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nSo for each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1 → it's on a diagonal.\n\nElse, it's non-diagonal.\n\nSo for all cells not on the diagonals, check that they are same as each other and not equal to the diagonal's character.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal elements? Well, since n is at least 3, for example n=3, the non-diagonal elements are the ones not on the diagonals. For 3x3 grid, the diagonals have 3 + 3 -1 = 5 elements (since the center is counted twice). So the non-diagonal elements are 9 -5 =4 elements. So for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal elements.\n\nSo the steps:\n\n1. Check that all diagonal elements are same. Let's call this d_char.\n\n2. Check that all non-diagonal elements are same, and that they are not equal to d_char.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, let's get the grid. Read n, then read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen:\n\nCollect all the diagonal elements. Let's take the first diagonal element (0,0) as the reference. Then check that every element on both diagonals is equal to this reference.\n\nWait, but what if the first diagonal element is different from the anti-diagonal's? For example, if the first cell is 'a', and the anti-diagonal's first cell (0, n-1) is 'b'. Then the diagonals are not same. So we need to check that all elements on both diagonals are same. So perhaps collect all the elements on both diagonals, and check that they are all the same.\n\nBut",
