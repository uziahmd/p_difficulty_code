Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two main things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All elements on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other elements must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all elements not on the diagonals are the same. Let's call this 'o_char'.\n3. Ensure that d_char != o_char.\n\nBut how do I check these conditions?\n\nFirst, let's think about how to iterate through the diagonals.\n\nFor the main diagonal, the positions are (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor the anti-diagonal, the positions are (i, n-1 -i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut since n is odd, the two diagonals intersect at the center cell. So that cell is part of both diagonals. So when checking, we need to make sure that all elements in both diagonals are the same. But since the center is part of both, it's covered once.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters from both diagonals. Then check that they are all the same.\n\nBut wait, for example, in a 3x3 grid, the main diagonal has positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). The anti-diagonal has (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So the center (1,1) is part of both. So when collecting all the diagonal elements, we need to collect all elements from both diagonals, but avoid duplicates? Or just check that all elements in the main diagonal are same as each other, and all elements in the anti-diagonal are same as each other, and that the main and anti-diagonal have the same character?\n\nWait, the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letters. So all elements on the main diagonal must be same as each other, all elements on the anti-diagonal must be same as each other, and also the main and anti-diagonal must have the same character. Because otherwise, for example, if main diagonal is 'x' and anti is 'y', then that's invalid.\n\nSo first, check that all elements on the main diagonal are same. Then check that all elements on the anti-diagonal are same. Then check that the main's character equals the anti's character.\n\nOnce that's done, then check all the non-diagonal elements. They must all be same, and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo how to check that?\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid, if it's not on either diagonal, check that it's equal to the 'o_char'.\n\nSo steps:\n\n- Read n and the grid.\n\n- Check diagonals:\n\n   - Collect all elements from main diagonal and check they are same.\n\n   - Collect all elements from anti-diagonal and check they are same.\n\n   - Check that the main and anti-diagonal elements are same.\n\n- Then, check all non-diagonal elements are same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect the diagonal elements?\n\nAlternatively, for the main diagonal, check that all elements are equal to the first element of the main diagonal. Similarly for the anti-diagonal. Then check that the first element of main and anti are same.\n\nBut what if the main diagonal has all same elements, but the anti has same elements but different from main?\n\nLike, for example, in a 3x3 grid, main diagonal is 'x', anti is 'y'. Then that's invalid.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nCheck that all elements on the main diagonal are same. Let's say the main_char is the first element of the main diagonal.\n\nCheck that all elements on the anti-diagonal are same. Let's say anti_char is the first element of the anti-diagonal.\n\nIf main_char != anti_char, then return NO.\n\nThen, check all non-diagonal elements are same and equal to some other_char, which is different from main_char.\n\nSo, how to check non-diagonal elements.\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1: it's on a",
