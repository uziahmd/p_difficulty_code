They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about determining which team skill levels can be the champion given the tournament structure and the string s that dictates the rules for each phase.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the tournament structure. So there are 2^n teams. Each phase halves the number of teams. For example, in the first phase, there are 2^{n-1} games. Then each subsequent phase has half as many games as the previous. The string s has n characters, each representing the rule for a phase. The i-th character (starting from 0?) determines whether in that phase, the higher or lower skill team wins.\n\nWait, the problem says: the i-th phase (the phase with 2^{n-i} games). So for example, if n is 3, then the first phase (i=1?) has 2^{3-1} = 4 games. Wait, but the string s has length n. So for each phase from 1 to n, the i-th character in the string s corresponds to that phase. Wait, the problem says \"the i-th phase (the phase with 2^{n-i} games)\".\n\nSo for example, when n is 3, the first phase (i=1) has 2^(3-1) = 4 games. Then the second phase (i=2) has 2^(3-2) = 2 games, and third phase (i=3) has 2^(3-3)=1 game. Which makes sense since each phase reduces the number of teams by half. So the phases go from the first (which is the earliest round) to the last (final match).\n\nNow, the key is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where the team with skill x wins the tournament according to the rules given by s.\n\nThe challenge is to model how the tournament proceeds based on the rules for each phase, and determine which x can be the champion.\n\nBut how do we model the tournament? Since the permutation p is arbitrary except that it's a permutation of 1 to 2^n, but the rules of each phase dictate how matches are decided. However, the problem is to find all x that can be the champion for some p.\n\nWait, but the permutation p defines the initial arrangement of teams. However, the problem says that the string s defines the rules for each phase. So during each phase, the way matches are decided depends on the phase's rule (s_i). For example, during phase i, when two teams meet, the one with higher or lower skill level (depending on s_i) wins.\n\nBut the problem is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion. So for each x, we need to check if there exists a way to arrange the initial positions of teams so that x can win all the required matches, considering the rules of each phase.\n\nBut how can we model this? Because the tournament structure is hierarchical. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a binary tree. Each match is a node, and the winner proceeds to the next round. But the structure of the tournament depends on the initial pairings. For example, in the first phase, the teams are paired as (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), etc. Then the winners of these pairs are paired again in the next phase, and so on.\n\nBut the initial arrangement of the teams in the bracket matters. For example, if x is to win the tournament, it must be placed in the bracket in such a way that it can win each of the rounds according to the rules of that phase.\n\nBut since the permutation p can be any possible permutation, we can choose the initial positions of the teams. However, the problem is to find all x such that there exists a permutation where x can reach the final by winning each of the rounds according to the rules.\n\nSo the approach might be to find for each x, the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have in order to win each round, given the rules of each phase.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as for x to be the champion, it must be able to pass through each round, and in each round, depending on the rule (s_i), it must be either the stronger or weaker team in its match.\n\nBut how do we model the rounds? Let's think of the tournament as having n rounds. For example, for n=3, there are 3 rounds. In the first round, each match is between two teams, and the winner proceeds to the second round. In the second round, the winners are paired again, and so on until the final.\n\nEach round corresponds to a phase. So for the i-th round (phase), the rule is determined by s[i-1] (assuming 0-based index). Wait, the string s is of length n, and the i-th phase (from 1 to n) corresponds to s_i? Or perhaps the first character of s is for the first phase. For example, in the sample input, for n=3 and s='101', the first phase (phase 1) uses s[0] which is '1' (higher skill wins), phase 2 uses s[1] which is '0' (lower skill wins), phase 3 uses s[2] which is '1'.\n\nSo for each x, to be the champion, it must win in each of the n rounds. Let's think about what constraints each round imposes on x's value.\n\nLet me think recursively. For example, in the first round (phase 1), x must be in a pair. Depending on the rule of that phase, x must be either the higher or lower skill in that pair. Then, in the next round, x must be paired with another winner from another pair, and again, depending on the phase's rule, x must be higher or lower than that opponent. And so on until the final round.\n\nBut how can we model the possible opponents that x may face in each round? Well, since the initial arrangement can be chosen, perhaps we can arrange the bracket in such a way that in each round, x faces opponents that are as weak as possible (if the rule requires x to be stronger) or as strong as possible (if the rule requires x to be weaker).\n\nWait, but the problem allows us to choose any permutation p. So the idea is that, for x to be able to reach the final, during each round, x must be able to win against its opponent, which depends on the rule for that round.\n\nSo for each round i (from 1 to n), during that round, x must be in a match where, according to the rule of that phase, x is the winner. How can we ensure that?\n\nFor example, in phase 1 (round 1), the rule is s[0]. If it's '1', then x must be the stronger of the two teams in its match. So, in that case, the other team in the match must have a skill less than x. Similarly, if the rule is '0', the other team must have a higher skill than x.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can arrange for x to be paired with the weakest possible opponents in the rounds where it needs to be stronger, or with the strongest possible opponents where it needs to be weaker.\n\nBut how do we model the constraints across all rounds?\n\nLet me think of it as for each round, the x must be able to pass through that round. Let's consider the rounds in order.\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose n=3, s is '101'. So:\n\nPhase 1 (round 1): higher skill wins. So x must be stronger than its opponent in this round.\n\nPhase 2 (round 2): lower skill wins. So x must be weaker than its opponent in this round.\n\nPhase 3 (round 3): higher skill wins. So x must be stronger than its opponent in this round.\n\nSo for x to be the champion, in round 1, x must be stronger than someone. In round 2, x must be weaker than someone. In round 3, x must be stronger than someone.\n\nBut how can that happen? Let's see.\n\nIn round 1, x must beat someone. So in the first round, x's opponent must have a lower skill than x.\n\nIn round 2, x must lose to someone? No, because in round 2, the rule is that the lower skill wins. So in that round, x's opponent must have higher skill than x. But wait, in that round, x is in a match. The rule says that the lower skill wins. So in that match, x must be the lower skill team, so that x can win. Wait, no: the rule says during phase i, in each match, the team with lower skill level wins if s_i is 0. So in phase 2, the rule is 0, meaning that in that match, the lower skill team wins. So x must be the lower skill team in that match, which would allow it to proceed.\n\nWait, but in that case, x would have to be weaker than the opponent in that round. But then, how does x proceed to the next round? Because the rule is that the lower skill team wins. So x's opponent in that round must be stronger than x. Then x wins that match because it's the lower skill team. Then, x proceeds to the next round.\n\nSo for each round, the rule determines whether x must be higher or lower than the opponent in that round's match.\n\nBut how can we model the constraints on x's skill level?\n\nLet's think of the process as x needing to pass through each round. For each round, there's a condition on x's skill relative to the opponent in that round. The question is, what are the constraints on x's value based on these conditions.\n\nBut since the opponents in each round can be chosen (as the initial arrangement can be set), we can choose the opponents in such a way that x can satisfy the conditions for each round.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each round, the number of teams is halved. So, for the first round, x is in a group of 2 teams. For the second round, x is in a group of 2 teams (the winners of two groups of 2). For the third round, x is in a group of 2 teams (winners of two groups of 4), etc.\n\nBut how can we model the possible minimum and maximum values that x can have to satisfy the conditions of each round?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model the constraints on x for each round. Let's think of for each round i (from 1 to n), what is the required condition for x to pass through that round.\n\nLet me think of the rounds as levels. For example, round 1 is the first level (the first phase), round 2 is the second level, etc.\n\nAt each level, the rule determines whether x needs to be the higher or lower skill in its match. Let's imagine that for each level, we can compute a lower bound and upper bound for x's value.\n\nFor example:\n\nLet's consider the first round (level 1). Suppose the rule is '1' (higher skill wins). Then, x must be higher than its opponent. Since we can choose the opponent, we can choose the weakest possible opponent. So, x can be any value as long as there exists at least one team with lower skill. But since x is part of the permutation, the minimal requirement is that there's at least one team with lower skill. Which is always true unless x is 1. Wait, but for the first round, x must be in a pair. So, in this case, for x to have an opponent with lower skill, x must not be the minimum possible value. But since the permutation can be arranged, perhaps we can arrange that x is paired with a team with lower skill. However, for x to be able to pass through this round, there must exist some team with lower skill. Which is possible unless x is 1.\n\nBut in this case, the problem is to find x such that there exists a permutation where x can win the tournament. So for x=1, in the first round, if the rule is '1', then x can't win because it's the lowest. So x=1 can't be the champion in that scenario.\n\nBut how do we model this for all rounds?\n\nLet me think of the constraints for each round. For each round i, the rule is s[i-1], and during that round, x must be either the higher or lower in its match. Let's model for each round the required condition on x's value relative to the number of teams that must be present in the bracket.\n\nAlternatively, think of the tournament as requiring x to win n matches. Each match is in a certain round. For each round, depending on the rule, x must be either the higher or lower in that match. But the opponents in each round depend on previous rounds.\n\nBut how can we model the possible opponents?\n\nPerhaps we can think of it as follows: For x to be able to reach the final, in each round, there must be enough teams that can be arranged to be in the bracket such that x can win each round.\n\nLet me think recursively. For example, in the first round, x must have an opponent. Depending on the rule, x must be higher or lower than that opponent. Let's say for the first round, the rule is '1' (higher wins). Then, x must be higher than that opponent. To maximize the chances, we can arrange that opponent to be the weakest possible (so that x can be as small as possible). However, in the next rounds, x will need to face other opponents. For example, in the second round, the rule is '0' (lower wins). So in that round, x must be lower than the opponent. Which means that the opponent must be stronger than x. But in order for x to reach that round, it must have passed the first round. So during the first round, x's opponent was weaker, then during the second round, x's opponent must be stronger. How can that be arranged?\n\nThis seems complex. Maybe there's a way to model the minimum and maximum possible values that x must have in order to satisfy all the constraints of the rounds.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each round, depending on the rule, we can compute a lower bound and upper bound on x's value. For example:\n\nLet's define for each round i (starting from 1 to n), the required condition. Let's consider the rounds in order.\n\nLet me think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the number of teams is 2^{n - (i-1)} }, but after each round, the number of teams is halved. Wait, the first round starts with 2^n teams and ends with 2^{n-1} teams. The second round starts with 2^{n-1} and ends with 2^{n-2}, etc.\n\nNow, for each round i, the rule is s[i-1]. Let's think of the required condition for x to pass through that round. For that, during that round, x must be in a match where it is the winner. The way to ensure that is to have x be either higher or lower than the opponent, depending on the rule.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, we can choose the opponents in each round. The key is to find for each round, what constraints on x's value are needed, considering the previous rounds.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each round i, we can determine the minimal and maximal possible value of x that can pass through that round, given the previous constraints.\n\nLet me try to model this as follows. For each round i, we can track the minimal and maximal possible value that x must have to pass through that round. Let me think of this as intervals.\n\nFor example, starting with round 1:\n\nIf the rule is '1' (higher wins), then x must be higher than its opponent. To allow x to have such an opponent, there must be at least one team with lower skill than x. Since the permutation can be arranged, this is possible as long as x is not the minimum value. However, the minimal value that x can have here is 2 (since there's at least one team with lower skill). But if the rule is '0' (lower wins), then x must be lower than its opponent, so x can be as high as possible as long as there's at least one team with higher skill. Which would be possible for x up to 2^n - 1.\n\nBut how do these constraints combine with the next rounds?\n\nLet me think recursively. For each round, the required condition depends on the rule and the previous rounds. Let me think of for each round, what is the minimal and maximal value that x can have, given the rules up to that round.\n\nLet me think of for each round i, the number of teams that x must have beaten so far, and the constraints on x's value.\n\nAnother idea comes from the fact that in order for x to reach the final, it must have passed through each of the n rounds. For each round, depending on the rule, x must have been either the strongest or the weakest in its bracket of that round.\n\nWait, maybe for each round, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have, given the rules up to that round.\n\nFor example, suppose that in the first round (i=1), the rule is '1' (higher wins). Then, x must be the higher in its match. So, in that round, x's opponent is weaker than x. Then, in the second round (i=2), the rule is '0' (lower wins). So x must be the lower in its match. Which implies that x's opponent in that round is stronger than x. But how can that happen? Because in the first round, x was stronger than someone, and in the second round, x is facing someone who was stronger than x.\n\nSo, for x to reach the second round, there must be someone stronger than x. That person must have come from another part of the bracket. But how can that be arranged?\n\nSo, for x to be able to pass through the second round, there must be a team stronger than x that can reach that round. But since the initial bracket can be arranged, we can arrange that x is in a part of the bracket where it can face such opponents in later rounds.\n\nBut how can we model the constraints for x across all rounds?\n\nPerhaps we can model for each round i, the required range of x's value based on the rules of the rounds up to i. For example, for each round i, we can compute a lower bound and upper bound for x's value.\n\nLet me try to think of this for each round. Let's imagine that for the i-th round, the rule is r_i (0 or 1). Let's process the rounds from first to last.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nlow and high: the minimum and maximum possible value x can have to pass through all rounds up to the current one.\n\nInitially, for the first round, depending on the rule, the constraints are:\n\nIf the rule is 1 (higher wins), then x must be higher than someone. So, the minimal x can be is 2 (since there's at least one team with lower value). But to allow for future rounds, perhaps we need more constraints. However, since the initial bracket can be arranged, perhaps the minimal and maximal for the first round are:\n\nIf rule is 1: x must be greater than some value. The minimal x can be is 1, but that's not possible. Wait, no. For x to be able to have an opponent with lower value, x must be at least 2. Because if x is 1, there's no team with lower value. So in this case, the minimal x can be is 2, and the maximum is 2^n.\n\nBut if the rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be lower than its opponent. So, x can be any value except the maximum. Because there must be at least one team with higher value. So x can be up to 2^n - 1.\n\nSo for the first round, the constraints are:\n\nif rule is 1: low = 2, high = 2^n\n\nif rule is 0: low = 1, high = 2^n - 1\n\nThen, moving to the second round. Let's think about what constraints apply here.\n\nIn the second round, the rule is r_2. For x to reach this round, it must have passed the first round. Now, in the second round, x must be in a match where it is either higher or lower than its opponent, depending on r_2.\n\nBut how does this affect the possible values of x?\n\nLet me think for each case.\n\nCase 1: r_1 is 1 (first round rule is higher wins). So x must be higher than its first round opponent. So, during the first round, x's opponent is weaker than x. Then, in the second round, x must be in a match where, based on r_2, it is either higher or lower than the opponent.\n\nBut what's the opponent in the second round? It's the winner of another match in the first round. So, for example, if r_2 is 0 (lower wins), then during the second round, x must be lower than its opponent. Which implies that the opponent must be stronger than x.\n\nBut how can that happen? Because during the first round, x was stronger than someone. But for the second round, the opponent must be stronger than x. So, there must be another team that is stronger than x, and that team must have passed through the first round.\n\nBut since we can arrange the initial bracket, perhaps we can arrange that in the first round, there's a team that is stronger than x, which then proceeds to the second round. Then, in the second round, x is matched against that team, and since the rule is 0 (lower wins), x is the lower and thus wins.\n\nSo for x to be able to pass the second round, there must be a team stronger than x. So x must be less than the maximum possible value. But how does this affect the current constraints?\n\nSo, combining the first and second rounds:\n\nAfter the first round, x has passed, and in the second round, x must be lower than its opponent. So x must be less than the opponent's value. But the opponent's value must have passed the first round.\n\nBut the opponent's value could be anything that passed the first round. So, for x to be able to find such an opponent, there must be at least one team that can pass the first round and is stronger than x. Which is possible as long as x is not the maximum value.\n\nBut how do we model this in terms of the constraints on x?\n\nLet me think of the second round's rule. For example, if the second round's rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be lower than its opponent. Therefore, in the second round, x's opponent must be stronger than x. But that opponent must have passed the first round. How did that opponent pass the first round? Well, during the first round, the rule was 1 (higher wins), so that opponent must have been stronger than their own first-round opponent.\n\nSo, for the second round, the opponent must have a value higher than x. But since the opponent passed the first round, which required them to be higher than someone else. But how does this affect the constraints on x's value?\n\nHmm, perhaps for the second round, the constraints are that x must be less than the maximum possible value that can pass the first round. But since the first round allows any value >= 2 (if rule was 1), then the maximum possible value that can pass the first round is 2^n.\n\nBut how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, think of for the second round, the constraints on x's value based on the rule of the second round.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each round i, the rule is r_i. We can model the constraints on x by considering the required relation between x and the possible opponents in that round. The opponents in that round are the winners of the previous rounds. Thus, for each round, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible values that x can have, given the previous constraints.\n\nThis seems similar to the concept of a segment tree or interval merging.\n\nLet me try to formalize this.\n\nLet’s assume that after processing rounds 1 to k, the possible values of x are constrained between [low_k, high_k]. Then, for round k+1, depending on the rule, we can compute new low and high.\n\nLet’s think for each step.\n\nInitially, for k=0 (before any rounds), the possible values of x are [1, 2^n].\n\nThen, for each round i from 1 to n:\n\n- The rule is r_i (0 or 1).\n- Based on the rule, we need to adjust the current [low, high] interval to find the new [low', high'].\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think for each case.\n\nCase 1: Current rule is 1 (higher wins in this round). So, in this round, x must be higher than its opponent. To ensure that, there must be an opponent in this round that is weaker than x. But since the opponent is the winner of the previous rounds, the opponent's value must be within the possible range of the previous rounds.\n\nWait, perhaps the opponent's value must be such that it can pass through all previous rounds. So for x to be able to win this round, there must be an opponent that is weaker than x and can reach this round.\n\nBut how can we model that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: For x to win this round (rule 1), x must be higher than the opponent. The opponent must have passed through all previous rounds. So, the opponent's value must be in the range [previous_low, previous_high]. So, to have an opponent weaker than x, x must be higher than the minimal possible value of the opponent. But since the opponent can be as low as possible, x must be higher than the minimal possible value of the opponent. However, since the opponent can be arranged to be as low as possible, the only constraint is that x is higher than the minimal possible value of the opponent. But the minimal possible value of the opponent is the previous_low. Wait, no. Because the opponent is someone who has passed through previous rounds. So, for example, after processing previous rounds, the opponent's value must be in [previous_low, previous_high]. To have an opponent weaker than x, there must be a value in [previous_low, previous_high] that is less than x. Which is possible if x > previous_low. Because even if previous_low is the minimal possible value for the opponent, if x is larger than that, then there exists an opponent (the one with value previous_low) that is weaker than x.\n\nBut then, for x to be able to have such an opponent, x must be greater than the minimal possible value of the opponent (previous_low). However, since the opponent can be as low as possible, but in reality, the opponent's value is constrained by previous rounds.\n\nWait, but the previous_low and previous_high represent the possible range of values that an opponent could have. So, if x is greater than previous_low, then there exists some value in [previous_low, previous_high] that is less than x. Hence, x can have an opponent weaker than it. Therefore, the new constraint is that x must be greater than previous_low. But also, the opponent can be as high as possible, but since x must be higher than that opponent, but that's not required. Wait, no. For the current round, x must be higher than its opponent. The opponent can be any value in [previous_low, previous_high], but x must be higher than that opponent. However, since we can choose the opponent (by arranging the bracket), we can choose the opponent to be the weakest possible (previous_low), which is the minimal possible. So x just needs to be higher than the minimal possible value of the opponent. But what about the maximum possible? Well, if x is higher than the maximum possible value of the opponent, then it's even better. But since we can arrange the opponent to be the weakest, x only needs to be higher than the minimal possible value of the opponent.\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that after processing previous rounds, the possible values of the opponent are in [a, b]. For x to be able to find an opponent in this range that is weaker than x, x must be greater than the minimal possible value of the opponent (a). Because there's at least one opponent (with value a) that is weaker than x. However, if x is less than or equal to a, then there's no such opponent. Therefore, for x to be able to have an opponent in this round (when the rule is 1), x must be greater than a.\n\nBut what about the upper bound? For example, x can be as large as possible (up to 2^n). But since the opponent's maximum value is b, x must be greater than the opponent. However, since we can arrange the opponent to be as small as possible, x doesn't need to be larger than b. So the only constraint is x > a.\n\nBut then, the new interval for x after this round would be [a + 1, ... ] ?\n\nBut wait, the previous interval [a, b] represents the possible values of the opponent. But x's value must be higher than the opponent's value. However, since the opponent's value can vary between a and b, but we can choose the opponent to be as small as possible (a), then x just needs to be greater than a. However, the x's value can be anything larger than a. But what about the upper bound? For example, if x is larger than b, then it's still okay. But since the opponent can be any value in [a, b], but we can choose the opponent to be the smallest, x can be anything larger than a.\n\nThus, for this case (rule is 1), the new constraints on x are that x must be greater than a. So the new low becomes a + 1, and the high remains the same as before (since x can be as high as possible, as long as it's larger than a).\n\nWait, but the previous high was the upper bound for the opponent. However, x can be as large as possible. So the new interval for x is [a+1, ... original_high? Or is there an upper limit?]\n\nNo, because the original_high is the upper bound for the opponent. But x can be larger than that. For example, if the opponent's maximum is b, x can be larger than b. But since the opponent is chosen to be the weakest possible (a), x can be anything larger than a. So the upper bound for x is not affected by this round's rule. Therefore, the new interval for x after this round would be [a+1, ... ] where the upper bound is the same as before? Or is there another constraint?\n\nWait, but the previous interval [a, b] represents the possible values of the opponent. But x is not constrained by the previous rounds. Wait, no. The previous interval [a, b] represents the constraints on x for the previous rounds. For example, after processing rounds 1 to k, the possible x's are in [a, b]. Now, for the next round (k+1), the rule is 1. So x must be greater than some value in [a, b]. Which requires that x > a. So the new interval for x is [a+1, b_upper], where b_upper is the previous upper bound. Wait, but what is the previous upper bound? Because the previous upper bound was for x's possible values before this round. So if the previous interval was [a_prev, b_prev], then after this round, the new interval is [a_prev + 1, b_prev]. Because x must be greater than a_prev (the minimal possible value of the opponent), and can be up to b_prev (but why? Because x can be as high as possible, but the previous upper bound was b_prev, which is the upper bound for x's value after previous rounds. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me re-express this:\n\nThe previous interval [low_prev, high_prev] represents the possible values of x that can pass through the previous rounds. Now, for the current round, the rule is 1 (higher wins). To pass this round, x must be higher than the opponent. The opponent is someone who has passed through the previous rounds. So the opponent's value is in [low_prev, high_prev]. Therefore, x must be greater than some value in [low_prev, high_prev]. The minimal value of the opponent is low_prev. So x must be greater than low_prev. Therefore, the new interval for x after this round is [low_prev + 1, high_prev]. Because x must be greater than low_prev, but can be up to high_prev (since there's no upper limit imposed by this round's rule).\n\nWait, but why can't x be higher than high_prev? Because high_prev is the upper bound for the opponent's value. But x can be higher than that. However, the previous upper bound was high_prev for x's value. But why is that? Because the previous rounds' constraints limited x to be within [low_prev, high_prev]. So, for example, if the previous rounds required x to be between 2 and 5, then the current round's rule being 1 requires x to be greater than the opponent's minimal value (low_prev=2). So x can be 3,4,5, or higher? But the previous high_prev was 5. So how can x be higher than 5?\n\nAh, here's the confusion. The previous interval [low_prev, high_prev] represents the possible values of x that can pass through the previous rounds. So if x is higher than high_prev, then it couldn't have passed through the previous rounds. Therefore, the current x's value is already constrained to [low_prev, high_prev]. So, in this case, the new interval is [low_prev + 1, high_prev].\n\nSimilarly, for the case where the current rule is 0 (lower wins), then x must be lower than the opponent. The opponent's value is in [low_prev, high_prev]. So, for x to be lower than the opponent, there must be an opponent in [low_prev, high_prev] that is higher than x. Which is possible if x < high_prev. Because there's at least one opponent (with value high_prev) that is higher than x. Therefore, the new interval for x is [low_prev, high_prev - 1].\n\nSo putting this together, the recurrence is:\n\nFor each round, given the previous interval [low, high], and the current rule r:\n\nif r == 1 (higher wins):\n\n   new_low = low + 1\n\n   new_high = high\n\nif r == 0 (lower wins):\n\n   new_low = low\n\n   new_high = high - 1\n\nBut wait, this seems too simplistic. Let me test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=3, s='101'\n\nWhich is for rounds 1, 2, 3:\n\nRound 1: rule is 1 (higher wins)\n\nRound 2: rule is 0 (lower wins)\n\nRound 3: rule is 1 (higher wins)\n\nLet's compute the intervals step by step.\n\nInitial interval: [1, 8] (since 2^3 = 8)\n\nRound 1: rule 1 → new_low = 1+1 = 2, new_high = 8 → [2,8]\n\nRound 2: rule 0 → new_low = 2, new_high = 8-1=7 → [2,7]\n\nRound 3: rule 1 → new_low = 2+1=3, new_high=7 → [3,7]\n\nSo the final interval is [3,7], which includes integers 3,4,5,6,7. But the sample output for this input is \"4 5 6 7\".\n\nWait, but according to this approach, the answer would be 3-7, but the sample output is 4-7. So there's a contradiction here. Which indicates that this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that the logic above is flawed. What's wrong here?\n\nLet's look at the sample input. For the first sample input, the output is 4 5 6 7. But according to the above approach, the interval would be [3,7], which includes 3. Why is 3 not in the output?\n\nLet me think about why 3 is not a valid answer.\n\nLet's imagine that x=3. According to the rules:\n\nRound 1: higher wins. So x must be higher than its opponent. So opponent must be less than 3. Possible, since there are teams 1 and 2.\n\nRound 2: lower wins. So x must be lower than its opponent. So opponent must be higher than 3. But how can x get to round 2? Because in round 2, the opponent is someone who has passed round 1. Let's think of the bracket arrangement.\n\nIn round 1, x=3 is paired with someone weaker (say 1 or 2). Suppose it's paired with 2. Then, x=3 wins (higher). Then in round 2, x=3 must be in a match against someone who has passed round 1. Let's say the opponent is 4. The rule for round 2 is lower wins. So x=3 is lower than 4, so x wins. Then, in round 3, the rule is higher wins. So x must be higher than the opponent. The opponent is the winner of another part of the bracket. Let's say that the other bracket has someone like 5. Then, x=3 must be higher than 5, which is impossible. So x=3 can't win the final round.\n\nAh! So the previous approach didn't account for the fact that the opponent in the next rounds must also be able to pass through their own rounds. So the previous logic only considered the current round's constraints, but not the future rounds. Therefore, the approach is incomplete.\n\nThis suggests that the recurrence I thought of earlier is not sufficient. Because the new",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can be the champion in a playoff tournament given specific rules for each round. The tournament structure and rules dictate how teams progress through each phase, and we must find all possible skill levels that can win under these conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of $2^n$ teams and proceeds through $n$ rounds. Each round halves the number of teams until only one champion remains.\n2. **Rules for Each Round**: Each round has a rule (either '0' or '1') indicating whether the team with the lower or higher skill level wins.\n3. **Constraints on Skill Levels**: For each round, depending on the rule, the current champion must either be the higher or lower skilled team compared to its opponent. We need to determine valid ranges for the skill level of the champion considering all rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    total_teams = 2 ** n\n    low = 1\n    high = total_teams\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if s[i] == '1':\n            # Higher wins in this round\n            # Need x > previous_low\n            low = low + 1\n        else:\n            # Lower wins in this round\n            # Need x < previous_high\n            high = high - 1\n    \n    result = list(range(low, high + 1))\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the full range of possible skill levels from 1 to $2^n$.\n2. **Iterate Through Rounds**: For each round, adjust the valid range of skill levels based on the rule for that round:\n   - If the rule is '1' (higher skill wins), the lower bound of the valid range is increased by 1.\n   - If the rule is '0' (lower skill wins), the upper bound of the valid range is decreased by 1.\n3. **Determine Valid Ranges**: After processing all rounds, the valid skill levels that can be champions are those within the final adjusted range.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible skill levels by adjusting bounds iteratively according to the rules of each round, ensuring we consider all constraints imposed by the tournament structure.",
