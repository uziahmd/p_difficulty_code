Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum radius d for the lanterns so that the entire street is covered. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The street is from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up a segment from (ai - d) to (ai + d). We need to find the minimal d such that all points from 0 to l are covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. So the key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's sort the lantern positions first. Because if they are sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. Also, I need to consider the ends of the street. For example, the first lantern might not be at 0, so the area from 0 to the first lantern's position minus d needs to be covered. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nWait, right. So after sorting the lanterns, the steps could be:\n\n1. Check the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern. The required d must cover this distance. For example, if the first lantern is at position a, then the distance from 0 to a is a. The lantern's coverage must reach 0, so the radius needs to be at least a. Because the lantern's leftmost point is a - d. To reach 0, a - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a. Wait, no. Wait, the lantern's coverage is from a - d to a + d. So for 0 to be covered, 0 must be within [a -d, a +d]. So the maximum of (a - 0) and (d) ... Wait, no. Let me think: the distance between 0 and the lantern is a. So the lantern's coverage must reach 0, which requires that d ≥ a. Because the lantern's light extends a distance d from itself. So if the lantern is at a, then the left end of its coverage is a - d. To cover 0, a - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a. Similarly, for the end of the street, the last lantern's position is say b. Then l must be within [b -d, b +d]. So l - b ≤d → d ≥ l -b.\n\nSo for the first lantern, the distance from 0 to it is a[0], so d must be at least a[0]. Similarly for the last lantern, the distance from it to l is l - a[-1], so d must be at least that. Then, between consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap between them is (a[i] - a[i-1]). For that gap, the required d would be half of that. Because imagine two lanterns at positions x and y (x < y). The middle point between them is (x + y)/2. The distance from each lantern to that middle point is (y -x)/2. So the minimal d needed for that gap is (y -x)/2. Because if you have d equal to that, then the coverage of the two lanterns will meet exactly at the middle point. If there's a larger gap, then that would require a larger d.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\n- Sort the lantern positions in ascending order.\n- Compute the maximum between:\n   a) the first lantern's position (since 0 to a[0] must be covered)\n   b) the distance from the last lantern to l (l - a[-1])\n   c) the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by 2.\n\nThen, the minimal d is the maximum of these values.\n\nWait, but wait. Let me take the example given.\n\nIn the second sample input: 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5. So sorted, they are [2,5]. The first lantern is at 2, so the distance from 0 is 2. The last lantern is at 5, which is l=5. So the distance from last lantern to l is 0. Then the gap between the two lanterns is 5-2=3. Divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum of 2, 0, 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input is 7 15, with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. Then:\n\nThe first lantern is at 0, so the distance from 0 is 0. The last lantern is",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the minimum light radius $ d $ required for lanterns to illuminate the entire street, we can follow a structured approach based on analyzing the gaps between lantern positions and their distances from the ends of the street.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\n1. **Input Parsing**: Read the number of lanterns $ n $, the length of the street $ l $, and the list of lantern positions.\n\n2. **Sorting**: Sort the lantern positions in ascending order.
