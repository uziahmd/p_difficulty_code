Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each covers a distance up to d from their position. \n\nFirst, I should think about how to model this problem. The key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because if there's a big gap between two lanterns, the middle of that gap would require the largest d. Also, don't forget the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern isn't at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position divided by two might be a candidate for d. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions. Because if they're not sorted, the gaps between consecutive ones can't be properly calculated. So first, I need to sort the array of ai.\n\n2. After sorting, check the first lantern. The distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is a certain value. The required d for that part would be (a[0] - 0) / 2. Because the lantern's coverage needs to reach from 0 up to a[0], so the radius needs to cover half of that distance. Wait, no. Wait, if the first lantern is at position x, then the leftmost point it can cover is x - d. To cover 0, x - d must be ≤ 0. So d must be ≥ x. But wait, that's not right. Let me think again. Suppose the first lantern is at position a. The left end of the street is 0. The lantern's coverage extends from a - d to a + d. So to cover 0, we need a - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a. But that's only if the lantern is at a. But if there's another lantern closer to 0, but maybe not. Wait, if the first lantern is at a, then the leftmost point that's not covered by any lantern would be 0 if the lantern's coverage doesn't reach there. So for the first lantern, the distance from 0 to a is a. The required d for that part is a, because the lantern's coverage must reach 0. Wait, no. Because the lantern's coverage is a radius d. So the leftmost point covered by the lantern is a - d. To cover 0, we need a - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a. But then, if the lantern is at a, then the coverage extends to a -d. So if d is a, then the left end is covered. But that would mean that the radius is a. However, maybe there's a better way. Wait, suppose the first lantern is at position a. Then the maximum distance from the lantern to the left end (0) is a. So the required d must be at least a. But if there's another lantern to the left of a, then that's not the case. But since we sorted the array, the first lantern is the leftmost one. So for the left end, the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0]. So the required d for that part is a[0], because the lantern's coverage has to reach 0. Similarly, for the right end, the distance between the last lantern and l is l - a[-1]. So the required d for that part is l - a[-1].\n\nBut then, between two consecutive lanterns, say at positions x and y (x < y), the maximum distance between them is y - x. The worst case is the midpoint between them. Because the coverage of the first lantern reaches up to x + d, and the coverage of the second starts at y - d. The gap between these two is (y - x) - 2d. For the entire street to be covered, this gap must be ≤ 0. So (y - x) - 2d ≤ 0 → d ≥ (y - x)/2. So for each pair of consecutive lanterns, the required d is (y - x)/2. \n\nSo the overall minimal d is the maximum between the initial part (a[0]), the final part (l - a[-1]), and the maximum of (y - x)/2 for all consecutive pairs.\n\nWait, but wait: for example, if the first lantern is at position 0, then the initial part is 0. So the required d for that part is 0. Similarly for the last lantern being at l.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial distance: a[0] - 0. The required d for that part is a[0] (since the lantern's coverage",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius `d` such that all points on a street of length `l` are illuminated by at least one lantern. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each lantern illuminates a segment of the street within a distance `d` from its position.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Ends of the Street**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances determine the required radius to cover the ends of the street.\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the maximum gap between them. The required radius to cover this gap is half the size of the gap, as the worst-case point in the gap is the midpoint.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    max_d = 0.0\n    \n    # Check the left end\n    max_d = max(max_d, a[0] - 0.0)\n    \n    # Check the right end\n    max_d = max(max_d, l - a[-1])\n    \n    # Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    \n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting Lantern Positions**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **End Coverage Check**: The distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street are checked to ensure these ends are covered.\n3. **Gap Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the maximum gap is determined. The required radius to cover this gap is half the gap size, as the midpoint of the gap will be the farthest point from either lantern.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all critical points where the illumination might be insufficient, thus determining the minimum radius `d` required to illuminate the entire street.",
