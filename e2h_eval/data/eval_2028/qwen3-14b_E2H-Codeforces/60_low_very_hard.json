            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Morse Code\n\nIn Morse code, an letter of English alphabet is represented as a string of some length from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where after each addition of a 0 or 1 to the string S, I have to compute the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented by some substring of S in Morse code. The tricky part is that some Morse code strings are invalid (like the four given ones), and each valid one corresponds to exactly one letter. So the problem reduces to counting all possible substrings of S that form valid Morse code sequences, but considering that each such substring can be part of multiple sequences when combined with others.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the question says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So for example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings are:\n\n\"1\" (valid)\n\"1\" (the second character, same as before)\n\"1\" (third)\n\"11\" (first two)\n\"11\" (second and third)\n\"111\" (all three)\n\nEach of these substrings represents a valid Morse code string, except if they are among the four invalid ones. But in this case, \"1\", \"11\", \"111\" are all valid. So each of those substrings contributes one sequence. But then, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters\", which would be the count of all possible ways to split the string into valid Morse code sequences. Or wait, no. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the note.\n\nIn the first sample, after appending three '1's, S is \"111\". The answer is 7. The explanation says that the possible sequences are T, M, O, TT, TM, MT, TTT. Wait, how does that count?\n\nEach of these sequences corresponds to a way of splitting the string into valid Morse code parts. For example, the entire string \"111\" can be considered as one letter (O), or split into \"1\" and \"11\" (T and M), or \"11\" and \"1\" (M and T), or \"1\" \"1\" \"1\" (T T T). But the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\"\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe it's not about splitting the entire string into valid codes, but rather counting all possible substrings of S that are valid Morse code representations. Each such substring corresponds to exactly one letter, so each such occurrence is a sequence of one letter. Then, the total number would be the count of all valid substrings. But in the first example, the sample input gives after three '1's, the output is 7. Let's count the number of valid substrings.\n\nThe substrings of \"111\" are:\n\nLength 1: 3 substrings (\"1\", \"1\", \"1\") → all valid. So 3.\n\nLength 2: \"11\", \"11\" → both valid. So 2 more.\n\nLength 3: \"111\" → valid. So 1.\n\nTotal 3+2+1=6. But the sample output is 7. Hmm, so this suggests that my initial understanding is wrong.\n\nWait the sample explanation lists 7 sequences. How does that happen? Let me look again. The explanation says:\n\n\"T\" (translates into \"1\"), \"M\" (translates into \"11\"), \"O\" (translates into \"111\"), \"TT\" (translates into \"11\"), \"TM\" (translates into \"111\"), \"MT\" (translates into \"111\"), \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\"). \n\nSo here, the sequences are sequences of letters, each of which is represented by a substring of S. For example, \"TT\" is two letters, each represented by \"1\" (so their concatenation is \"11\", which is a substring of S). Similarly, \"TM\" is \"1\" + \"11\" = \"111\" which is a substring. So the problem is counting all possible sequences of letters (i.e., any number of letters, each represented by a valid Morse code) such that the concatenation of their Morse codes is a substring of S. \n\nAh! That's a different problem. So the answer is not just the count of valid substrings, but the number of ways to split some substring of S into valid Morse code sequences. For example, for the substring \"11\", there are two possibilities: it can be split as a single \"11\" (M), or as two \"1\"s (T and T). Hence, contributing two to the total count. \n\nSo the problem is to count all possible ways to split any substring of S into valid",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of a dynamically growing binary string `S` in Morse code. Each modification to `S` appends either a '0' (dot) or '1' (dash), and after each modification, we need to compute the count of valid sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity**: First, identify which Morse code strings (of lengths 1 to 4) are valid. The invalid strings are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a dynamic programming approach to keep track of valid Morse code substrings as the string `S` grows.\n3. **Substrings and Valid Sequences**: For each new character added to `S`, check all possible suffixes ending at the current position to see if they form valid Morse code strings. Maintain a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending at position `i`.\n4. **Efficient Updates**: After each addition, update the DP array considering all valid Morse code substrings ending at the new position and sum up the counts from previous positions.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\n# Precompute the set of invalid Morse codes\ninvalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    operations = input[1:m+1]\n    \n    S = []\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)  # dp[i] is the number of valid sequences ending at position i-1\n    total = 0\n    \n    for i in range(m):\n        c = operations[i]\n        S.append(c)\n        n = len(S)\n        # Check all possible substrings ending at position n-1\n        # We look back up to 4 characters\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if n - l < 0:\n                continue\n            substr = ''.join(S[n-l:n])\n            if substr in invalid:\n                continue\n            # If the substring is valid, add to dp[n]\n            if l == 1:\n                dp[n] = (dp[n] + 1) % MOD\n            else:\n                dp[n] = (dp[n] + dp[n - l] + 1) % MOD\n        # The total is the sum of all dp[1..n]\n        total = (total + dp[n]) % MOD\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations and the sequence of operations.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: `dp[i]` keeps track of the number of valid sequences ending at the i-th position in the string `S`.\n3. **Checking Valid Substrings**: For each new character added to `S`, check all possible substrings ending at the current position with lengths 1 to 4. If a substring is valid (not in the invalid set), update the DP array.\n4. **Updating Total Count**: After processing each character, the total number of valid sequences is updated by summing up the values in the DP array up to the current length of `S`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of valid sequences after each modification, leveraging dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations. The solution efficiently handles the constraints and ensures results are computed modulo $10^9 + 7$.",
