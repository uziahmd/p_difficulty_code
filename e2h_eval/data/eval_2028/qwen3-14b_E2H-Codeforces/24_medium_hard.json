She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about Luba closing tabs in her browser as quickly as possible. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to leave only the tabs from l to r inclusive open. \n\nFirst, let me understand the problem thoroughly. So, there are n tabs, and the mouse is at position pos. She needs to close all tabs outside [l, r]. Each second, she can move left or right (but within the current a and b, which are the min and max of the unclosed tabs), or close tabs to the left or right of the current cursor position. \n\nThe key here is to find the optimal sequence of moves and closes to minimize time. Let's think about what needs to be done. \n\nLet me consider the cases where the current tabs that need to be kept are already in the correct state. For example, if l=1 and r=n, then no tabs need to be closed. So the answer is 0. Also, if the current position is already such that all tabs outside [l, r] are already closed, then no steps are needed. \n\nBut in general, we need to close tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. \n\nBut how do we model the process? Let's think about the steps required. \n\nFirst, the initial state has all tabs open. So, the initial a is 1 and b is n. \n\nBut when closing tabs, the a and b change. For example, if you close all tabs to the left of the current cursor, then the new a becomes the current cursor's position. Similarly for closing to the right. \n\nBut the problem is that the order of closing and moving affects the steps. \n\nLet me think about the necessary steps. To close all tabs outside [l, r], we need to perform two operations: closing all tabs to the left of l, and closing all tabs to the right of r. However, these operations can be done in any order, but the movement steps required depend on the order. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to do it optimally. For example, if we can close both sides with minimal movement. \n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. \n\nCase 1: The current position is already within [l, r]. Then, perhaps we can first close the left side (if needed) and then the right side, or vice versa. \n\nBut how to model the steps. \n\nFor example, suppose we need to close tabs to the left of l. To do that, we need to move the cursor to l, then close all tabs to the left. Similarly, to close the tabs to the right of r, we need to move to r and close them. \n\nBut maybe there's a way to do it more efficiently. \n\nLet me take the first example given: input is 6 3 2 4. So n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. The output is 5. \n\nThe steps given in the note are:\n\nMove to tab 2 (from 3, takes 1 second). Then close all tabs to the left (which is tab 1). Then move to tab 3 (takes 1 sec?), then to tab 4 (another second?), then close tabs to the right. \n\nWait, how many steps? Let me count:\n\n- Moving from 3 to 2: 1 sec.\n- Close left: 1 sec. Now the a is 2, b is 6. \nThen, move from 2 to 3: 1 sec. Then move to 4: 1 sec. Then close right: 1 sec. Total steps: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. \n\nYes. So the total steps are 5. \n\nSo the idea is that, to close the left part (tabs before l), we need to reach l, then close. Similarly for the right part (tabs after r), reach r, then close. \n\nBut what if the initial position is already in the correct area?\n\nAnother example: input is 6 3 1 3. Output is 1. Because she can just close all tabs to the right (since current position is 3, and closing right would close tabs 4-6. So that's one step. \n\nSo the approach seems to be: \n\nWe need to determine whether we need to close tabs on the left (if l > 1) and on the right (if r < n). \n\nBut how to calculate the minimal steps for each scenario. \n\nLet me think about the steps required for each case.\n\nLet me first consider that the required region is [l, r]. \n\nIf l == 1 and r == n: nothing to do. Answer is 0. \n\nElse, there are two possibilities: \n\n- Close left and close right. \n\nBut the order might affect the steps. \n\nFor example, suppose we need to close left and right. Let's say we have to reach l, close left, then reach r, close right. Or reach r first, then l. Which is better?\n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps is determined by the positions of the current pos relative to l and r. \n\nLet me think: \n\nSuppose we need to close the left part (tabs before l) and the right part (tabs after r). \n\nIn order to close the left part, we need to move to l, then close. \n\nIn order to close the right part, we need to move to r, then close. \n\nBut the movement steps depend on the initial position, and the order in which we do these operations. \n\nBut once we close the left part, the a becomes l, and the b is still n. So when moving to r, the movement is from the current position (after closing left) to r. \n\nSimilarly, if we first close the right part, then the movement to l is easier. \n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps is to choose the order that requires less movement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal approach is to first close the left part, then the right part, or vice versa, and compute the minimal steps between the two options. \n\nBut how to model the movement steps for each scenario. \n\nLet me think of the two scenarios:\n\nScenario A: Close left first, then close right. \n\nScenario B: Close right first, then close left. \n\nWhich one is better? \n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the initial position is pos, and l and r are such that l < pos < r. \n\nIn scenario A: \n\n- Move to l: steps needed is |pos - l|. \n\n- Close left (1 sec). \n\n- Now, the current position is l. Then, need to move to r. Since after closing left, the a is l, and the b is n. So moving from l to r takes (r - l) steps. Then close right (1 sec). \n\nTotal steps: |pos - l| + 1 (close left) + (r - l) steps to move to r + 1 (close right) = |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2. \n\nIn scenario B: \n\n- Move to r: steps needed is |pos - r|. \n\n- Close right (1 sec). \n\n- Then move to l: since after closing right, the a is 1, and the b is r. So moving from r to l takes (r - l) steps. Then close left (1 sec). \n\nTotal steps: |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2. \n\nSo the minimal between the two scenarios is min( |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2, |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2 ). \n\nBut wait, in both scenarios, the (r - l) is same. So the difference is between |pos - l| and |pos - r|. \n\nSo which one is better depends on whether pos is closer to l or r. \n\nBut this is only if we need to close both left and right. \n\nBut what if the initial position is already in the [l, r] range? For example, pos is between l and r. \n\nBut there's another possibility: maybe we can close both left and right in a single step. Like, if the current position is already at l, then closing left (but if l is 1, then no need to close left). \n\nWait, but perhaps there's a better way. \n\nBut maybe the general approach is to consider the following steps:\n\nIf we need to close tabs on the left (i.e., l > 1), then we need to reach l, and close left. \n\nSimilarly, if we need to close tabs on the right (r < n), then reach r and close right. \n\nBut the movement steps to reach l and r depends on the current position and the order in which we perform the operations. \n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps can be calculated as follows:\n\nCalculate the steps required to reach l (if needed) and then steps to reach r (if needed). But also, if we can do some steps in a smarter way. \n\nBut let's think of the cases:\n\nCase 1: l == 1 and r == n. No steps needed. Answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: l == 1, but r < n. So need to close right. \n\nSo steps: move to r (from pos), then close. \n\nBut how many steps? \n\nThe movement steps is |pos - r|, then 1 sec for closing. \n\nSo total is |pos - r| + 1.\n\nCase 3: r == n and l > 1. Need to close left. Steps: move to l, then close. So |pos - l| + 1.\n\nCase 4: l > 1 and r < n. Need to close both left and right. \n\nNow, the question is whether to close left first or right first. \n\nAs discussed earlier, the minimal steps would be the minimum between:\n\nOption 1: Close left first, then close right. \n\nSteps: move to l (|pos - l| steps) + 1 (close left) + move from l to r (r - l steps) + 1 (close right). \n\nTotal: |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nOption 2: Close right first, then close left. \n\nSteps: move to r (|pos - r| steps) + 1 (close right) + move from r to l (r - l steps) + 1 (close left). \n\nTotal: |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nSo the minimal between these two options. \n\nBut wait, why is the movement from l to r (r - l) steps? Because you can move one step at a time. \n\nBut what if the current position is already at l? Then moving to r would take (r - l) steps. \n\nSo the total steps for option 1 is |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2. \n\nBut what about the steps required to move after closing left? \n\nOnce you close the left, the a is l. So the movement from l to r is possible. \n\nSo the movement steps are (r - l) steps. \n\nBut what if the initial position is already in [l, r]? For example, if pos is in between l and r. \n\nBut then, the movement steps for option 1 would be |pos - l| steps to reach l, then (r - l) steps to reach r. \n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can reach l, then close left, then move to r (which is in the same range). \n\nBut perhaps there's another approach. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the movement steps are additive. \n\nBut perhaps there's another scenario. What if after closing left, the current position is l. Then moving to r takes (r - l) steps. \n\nBut what if after closing left, we can directly close the right? Wait, no. Because to close the right, the current position must be at r. \n\nSo, the steps are: \n\n- move to l (steps 1)\n\n- close left (step 2)\n\n- move to r (steps 3 ... )\n\n- close right (step 4)\n\nSo, the total steps for option 1 is (steps to move to l) + 1 (close left) + (steps to move to r) + 1 (close right). \n\nBut steps to move to r is (r - l) steps, since after closing left, the a is l, and the b is n. So you can move from l to r. \n\nSo the total steps is |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2. \n\nSimilarly for the other option. \n\nSo the minimal of the two options. \n\nBut wait, there's another possibility. What if we can close both left and right in one operation? For example, if the current position is at l, and r is the same as the current position. But that's not possible unless l=r. \n\nBut in general, no. \n\nBut let's think about another possibility. Suppose that the current position is already at l. Then, we can close the left (if needed) and then move to r. \n\nBut that's already considered in the above calculation. \n\nNow, what if l is equal to r? Then, we need to close tabs to the left of l (if l>1) and to the right of r (if r <n). \n\nBut for example, if l = r = 3, and n=6. Then, we need to close tabs 1-2 and 4-6. \n\nSo, the steps would be to move to 3 (if not already there), then close left and right. But how? \n\nWait, if you are at 3, you can close all tabs to the left (which would close 1-2) and then close all tabs to the right (which would close 4-6). But each of these operations takes 1 second. So, if you are already at 3, then you can do both operations. \n\nSo, the steps would be: 1 (close left) + 1 (close right) = 2 seconds. \n\nBut how to get to 3? \n\nSo, in this case, if the initial pos is not 3, then the steps to reach 3 is |pos -3|, then 2 steps for closing. \n\nBut according to our previous formula, for l=3 and r=3, the steps would be (for case where both left and right need to be closed):\n\nOption 1: |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2 → since r - l = 0, this is |pos - l| + 2. \n\nSame for option 2. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nSo, the formula seems to hold. \n\nSo, putting it all together, here's the plan:\n\nCheck if the current [l, r] is already the entire range. If yes, answer is 0. \n\nElse, check whether we need to close left (i.e., l > 1) and/or right (r < n). \n\nIf only left needs to be closed: steps are the steps to reach l, then close left. \n\nIf only right needs to be closed: steps are steps to reach r, then close right. \n\nIf both need to be closed: then choose between the two options (close left first or right first) and take the minimal steps. \n\nBut wait, there's another possibility. For example, if the current position is already in the [l, r] range. \n\nSuppose l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then, to close left and right, we can move to l (2 steps?), but perhaps there's a better way. \n\nWait, but according to the formula, the steps would be |3-2| + (4-2) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which matches the first example. \n\nSo the formula works. \n\nBut what about when the current position is already at l? \n\nFor example, l=2, r=4, pos=2. Then, steps for option 1: 0 (steps to reach l) + 2 + 2 = 4. \n\nWhich would be: close left (1 sec), then move to r (4-2=2 steps), close right (1 sec). Total 4 steps. \n\nBut what if after closing left, you can close right? \n\nNo, because you have to be at r to close right. \n\nSo, the movement steps are needed. \n\nSo the formula holds. \n\nNow, let's think about how to code this. \n\nFirst, we need to check if the current l and r already cover all tabs. That is, l == 1 and r == n. If so, output 0. \n\nElse, we need to determine whether we need to close left (left_close = l > 1) and/or right (right_close = r < n). \n\nIf left_close and right_close: then compute the two options and take the minimum. \n\nIf only left_close: steps are |pos - l| + 1. \n\nIf only right_close: steps are |pos - r| + 1. \n\nWait, but why? Because once you reach l, you can close left. So that's |pos - l| steps to move, then 1 step to close. \n\nBut what if you can close left without moving? For example, if pos is already at l, then steps is 0 + 1 = 1. \n\nYes. \n\nBut what if l is 1? Then, you don't need to close left. \n\nSo, the code logic would be:\n\nCompute the steps based on the required closings. \n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r. \n\nif l == 1 and r == n: print 0. \n\nelse:\n\n    left_close = (l > 1)\n\n    right_close = (r < n)\n\n    if left_close and right_close:\n\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n\n        ans = min(option1, option2)\n\n    elif left_close:\n\n        ans = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    elif right_close:\n\n        ans = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # impossible, since l and r are within 1..n, but the first condition checks if l=1 and r=n. \n\n        # So this case can't happen. \n\n    print(ans)\n\nWait, but wait. What if the current position is already in the [l, r] range, and we need to close left and right? \n\nBut the formula for option1 and option2 is correct. \n\nBut let's test the sample inputs. \n\nFirst sample input: 6 3 2 4. \n\nn=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4. \n\nleft_close is l=2>1 → yes. right_close is r=4 <6 → yes. \n\noption1: |3-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. \n\noption2: |3-4| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. \n\nso min is 5. Which matches the first sample. \n\nSecond sample input: 6 3 1 3. \n\nl=1, r=3. So left_close is l=1, so no. right_close is 3 <6 → yes. So ans is |3 - 3| + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches the sample. \n\nThird sample input: 5 2 1 5. l=1 and r=5. So the first condition is true. Output is 0. Which matches. \n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=3. \n\nSo l=2, r=3. So left_close is l=2>1 → yes. right_close is 3 <5 → yes. \n\noption1: |2-2| + (3-2) + 2 → 0 + 1 + 2 = 3. \n\noption2: |2-3| + (3-2) + 2 → 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. \n\nso min is 3. \n\nWhat's the actual steps? \n\nClose left first: \n\nAlready at l=2. Close left (tabs 1). 1 sec. Then move to r=3 (1 step). Close right (tabs 4-5). 1 sec. Total steps: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Which is correct. \n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=5, l=2, r=3. \n\nleft_close and right_close. \n\noption1: |5-2| + (3-2) + 2 → 3 + 1 + 2 = 6. \n\noption2: |5-3| + (3-2) + 2 → 2 + 1 + 2 = 5. \n\nWhich is better. \n\nSo steps for option2: move to r=3 (steps 2), close right (1 sec). Now, the current position is 3. Then move to l=2 (steps 1), close left (1 sec). Total steps: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5. \n\nYes. \n\nBut according to the formula, option2 is 5 steps. \n\nSo the code seems to handle that. \n\nBut what about when the initial position is already in the [l, r] range? \n\nFor example, n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4. \n\nleft_close is 2>1 → yes. right_close is 4 <5 → yes. \n\noption1: |3-2| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. \n\noption2: |3-4| + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. \n\nSo the answer is 5. \n\nBut let's see: \n\nOption1: move to 2 (steps 1), close left (1 sec). Then move to 4 (steps 2), close right (1 sec). Total steps 1+1+2+1=5. Correct. \n\nAnother scenario: pos is already at l. \n\nn=5, pos=2, l=2, r=4. \n\noption1: 0 + (4-2) + 2 → 0 + 2 + 2 =4. \n\nsteps: close left (1 sec), move to 4 (steps 2), close right (1 sec). 1+2+1=4 steps. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother case: when the current pos is outside the [l, r] range. \n\nFor example, n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. \n\nleft_close is l=2>1 → yes. right_close is r=3<5 → yes. \n\noption1: |1-2| + (3-2) + 2 → 1 + 1 + 2 =4. \n\noption2: |1-3| + (3-2) + 2 → 2 +1 +2 =5. \n\nso min is 4. \n\nHow? \n\nMove to 2 (steps 1), close left (tabs 1). Then move to 3 (steps 1), close right (tabs 4-5). So 1+1+1+1 =4 steps. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother case: when l=1 and r <n. \n\nFor example, n=5, pos=3, l=1, r=3. \n\nSo left_close is l=1, no. right_close is yes. \n\nans is |3 - 3| +1 = 0 +1 =1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother case: l=3, r=5, n=5. So l=3, r=5. \n\nleft_close is l=3>1 → yes. right_close is r=5 ==n → no. \n\nso ans is |pos - l| + 1. \n\nBut what if pos is 3? then 0 +1 =1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nSo this seems to handle all cases. \n\nBut wait, what if the initial pos is already in the [l, r] range, but we need to close left and right. \n\nLike, for example, pos=3, l=2, r=4. \n\nThen, the code gives 5 steps. Which is correct. \n\nBut what about if the pos is in the [l, r] range, but after closing left and right, but the steps are optimized. \n\nBut the code's logic seems to capture that. \n\nSo, the code seems to work. \n\nNow, let's think about edge cases. \n\nEdge case 1: l=1 and r=n. Output is 0. \n\nEdge case 2: l=1, r= n-1. So need to close right. \n\npos is n. steps: |n - r| + 1. \n\nr is n-1. So |n - (n-1)| = 1. So steps is 1+1=2. \n\nBut how? \n\nMove from pos=n to r =n-1 (1 step). Then close right (1 step). So total 2 steps. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother edge case: l=1, r=1. So need to close all tabs except 1. \n\nSo, if n=5, pos=3. \n\nleft_close is l=1, no. right_close is r=1 <5 → yes. \n\nsteps: |3 - 1| + 1 = 2 +1 =3. \n\nWhich is: move from 3 to 1 (steps 2), then close right (tabs 2-5). So total 3 steps. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother edge case: l=2, r=2. n=5. \n\nSo need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 3-5). \n\nSo steps: \n\noption1: |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2 → |pos -2| + 0 + 2. \n\noption2: |pos - r| + 0 +2 → same as option1. \n\nSo min is same. \n\nIf pos is 2, then steps is 0 + 0 + 2 = 2 steps. \n\nWhich is correct: close left (1 sec) and close right (1 sec). \n\nBut how? \n\nAt position 2, close left (tabs 1) → 1 sec. Then close right (tabs 3-5) → 1 sec. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code works. \n\nAnother edge case: l=1, r=2. n=5. pos=5. \n\nNeed to close right (tabs 3-5). \n\nsteps: |5-2| +1 = 3 +1 =4. \n\nWhich is: move from 5 to 2 (steps 3), then close right (1 sec). \n\nYes. \n\nSo, the code seems to handle all these cases. \n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nWe need to read four integers: n, pos, l, r. \n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n: print 0. \n\nElse, check left_close and right_close. \n\nBut what about when l=1, but r <n. So need to close right. \n\nSo, the code is as follows. \n\nBut wait, what if l=1 and r is less than n? Then, the left does not need to be closed. \n\nBut what if the current position is to the right of r? For example, pos is 5, and r is 3. Then, to close the right, you need to move to r (3) and close. \n\nSo, the code for the 'only right' case is |pos - r| + 1. \n\nSimilarly for the 'only left' case. \n\nThus, the code can be written as follows. \n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input line. Split into n, pos, l, r. \n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the input is given as a single line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r. \n\nWait, but in the example given, the input is three lines? Or is that a mistake?\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe example shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nBut that seems to indicate that the code should read multiple test cases. But the problem says \"the only line of input\". \n\nWait, the problem says: \n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r. \n\nBut the example shows three lines of input. That's confusing. \n\nWait, perhaps the example is showing multiple test cases, but the actual input is one line. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. Let me recheck the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\nSo, the input is a single line. The example shows three test cases, but that's probably because the user is providing multiple examples. \n\nBut the code should read one line of input, split into four integers. \n\nSo, the code will read a single line, split into four integers. \n\nBut in the sample input given, the user provided three test cases, but that's probably for the purpose of showing the outputs. \n\nSo, the code should read one line, and output one integer. \n\nSo, the code should be written as follows. \n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the input line. Split into four integers. \n\nThen compute the answer as per the logic. \n\nSo, the code:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_close = l > 1\n    right_close = r < n\n    if left_close and right_close:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n    elif left_close:\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    elif right_close:\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n    else:\n        # This case should not happen since l and r are not covering the entire range\n        print(0)\n\nWait, but what if l=1 and r <n? Then left_close is false (since l=1), and right_close is true. So code would go to the elif right_close. \n\nYes. \n\nBut let's test the sample input. \n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4 → output 5. \n\nWhich is handled by the code. \n\nSample 2: 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3 <6. So left_close is false, right_close is true. So steps: |3-3| +1 = 1 → correct. \n\nSample 3: 5 2 1 5 → l=1, r=5, which is same as n. So output 0. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=2, l=2, r=3. \n\nleft_close is l=2>1 → yes. right_close is r=3 <5 → yes. \n\noption1: |2-2| + (3-2) + 2 → 0 + 1 + 2 =3. \n\noption2: |2-3| + 1 + 2 → 1 + 1 + 2 =4. \n\nso min is 3. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=2, r=3. \n\nleft_close and right_close. \n\noption1: |5-2| + (3-2) + 2 → 3 + 1 + 2 = 6. \n\noption2: |5-3| + (3-2) + 2 → 2 + 1 + 2 =5. \n\nso answer is 5. \n\nSo code returns 5. \n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. \n\nleft_close is true, right_close is true. \n\noption1: |1-2| + (3-2) + 2 → 1 + 1 + 2 =4. \n\noption2: |1-3| + (3-2) + 2 → 2 + 1 +2 =5. \n\nso answer is 4. \n\nYes. \n\nAnother test case: when l=1, r=2, n=5, pos=5. \n\nOnly right_close. \n\nsteps: |5-2| +1 = 3+1=4. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nBut what if the pos is already at r? For example, pos=2, l=1, r=2. \n\nThen, right_close is r=2 <5. So steps: |2-2| +1 = 1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nAnother case: l=3, r=3, n=5. \n\nSo need to close left (tabs 1-2) and right (tabs 4-5). \n\npos is 3. \n\noption1: |3-3| + (3-3) + 2 → 0 + 0 +2 =2. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nSo the code works. \n\nBut wait, what if the initial pos is already in the [l, r] range, but after closing left and right, but the steps are calculated correctly. \n\nYes. \n\nSo, this seems to handle all the cases. \n\nNow, what about when l=1 and r= n-1? For example, n=5, l=1, r=4. \n\nThen, the code will check that l is 1 and r is not n. So, right_close is true. \n\nSo steps: |pos - r| + 1. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nSo, I think this code is correct. \n\nNow, let's write the Python code accordingly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] while efficiently moving the mouse cursor and closing tabs.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no action is needed, so the result is 0.\n2. **Determine Closing Needs**: Check if tabs need to be closed on the left (l > 1) and/or on the right (r < n).\n3. **Calculate Steps**:\n   - **Both Left and Right Close Needed**: Calculate the minimum steps required by considering two scenarios: closing left first then right, or closing right first then left.\n   - **Only Left Close Needed**: Calculate steps to move to the left boundary and close tabs.\n   - **Only Right Close Needed**: Calculate steps to move to the right boundary and close tabs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_close = l > 1\n    right_close = r < n\n    if left_close and right_close:\n        option1 = abs(pos - l) + (r - l) + 2\n        option2 = abs(pos - r) + (r - l) + 2\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n    elif left_close:\n        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)\n    elif right_close:\n        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)\n    else:\n        print(0)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] spans the entire range of tabs, no operations are needed.\n- **Closing Tabs on Both Ends**: When both ends need closing, we evaluate the optimal path by considering both possible orders (left first or right first) and take the minimum steps required.\n- **Single Side Closing**: If only one side needs closing, compute the steps required to move the cursor to the respective boundary and perform the closing operation.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimal steps required by leveraging direct movement and closing operations, considering all edge cases and optimal paths.",
