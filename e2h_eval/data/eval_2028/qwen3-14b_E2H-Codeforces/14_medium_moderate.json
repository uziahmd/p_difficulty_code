He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m zeros. For example, in the sample input where m=1, the output is 5,6,7,8,9. Wait, but why? Let's check:\n\nFor 5! = 120 → 1 zero. 6! is 720 → 1 zero. Similarly up to 9! which is 362880 → 1 zero. So all these numbers from 5 to 9 have exactly one trailing zero. So the count is 5 numbers.\n\nBut how do I find the range of n's that produce exactly m zeros?\n\nThe approach I need is to find the lower and upper bounds of n where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. But how?\n\nFirst, I need to find the minimal n such that the count of zeros is m. Then find the maximal n where the count is m. Then all numbers between them (inclusive) would be the possible n's. However, there's a catch here. Because sometimes, there might be no n that gives exactly m zeros. For example, if m is 5, maybe there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Wait, let me think. Let's see:\n\nFor example, let's compute the number of zeros for some numbers.\n\nn=24: 24/5 =4.8 → floor 4. 24/25=0.96 → 0. Total 4 zeros.\n\nn=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, 25/125=0. Total 5+1=6 zeros. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Hence, for m=5, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the problem is that for some m, there are no n's. So the first step is to check whether there exists any n that gives exactly m zeros. If there is, then find the range of n's.\n\nSo how can I find the possible n's?\n\nFirst, I need to find the minimal n where the count of zeros is m. Then find the maximal n where the count is m. Then the numbers between them (inclusive) would be the answer. However, the problem is that for some m, there may be no such n. So how do I check that?\n\nBut how to find the minimal and maximal n for a given m?\n\nLet me think about binary search. Since the count of zeros increases as n increases, but not strictly. For example, when n increases by 1, the count can increase by 0 or 1 or more. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, the count increases by 1. But when it's a multiple of 25, it increases by 2, etc.\n\nSo for a given m, the possible n's that have exactly m zeros would be in a range. Let's think of it as follows: find the smallest n where the count is m, and then find the largest n where the count is m. Then, if such n exists, the numbers between them (inclusive) would be the answer. But how to find these n's?\n\nBut how do I find the minimal and maximal n for a given m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, there is either 0, 1, or 5 numbers? Wait, no. For example, in the sample input, m=1, there are 5 numbers. But for other m's, perhaps there are 0 or 1 numbers. Wait, let's think. Let me take m=6. For example:\n\nn=25 gives 6 zeros. What about n=26, 27, 28, 29? Each of these would have 6 zeros. Because when you add 26, the count of zeros is same as 25. So for m=6, the numbers 25,26,27,28,29 would be valid. So that's 5 numbers again. Wait, but why?\n\nBecause when you go from 24 to 25, the count increases by 2 (from 4 to 6). So for m=5, there's no solution. But for m=6, there are 5 numbers (25-29). So for m=6, the answer is 5 numbers. So the pattern seems that for certain m's, there are 5 numbers, and for others, none.\n\nSo the key is to find the lower and upper bounds for n where the count of zeros is m. How can we find that?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nFirst, find the minimal n where the count of zeros is m. Then check if the count for that n is m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the maximum n where the count is m. Then the numbers from min_n to max_n are the possible answers.\n\nBut how to find min_n and max_n?\n\nWell, for the minimal n, we can perform a binary search. For example, the count of zeros for a given n is a non-decreasing function. So for a given m, we can find the smallest n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if count_zeros(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. But if yes, then we need to find the maximum n where count_zeros(n) is m.\n\nWait, but how to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) equals m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal n is the first occurrence where the count is m, and the maximal n is the last occurrence where the count is m. So the steps could be:\n\n1. Find the lower bound of n where count_zeros(n) = m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) = m. Then find the maximal n such that count_zeros(n) = m. If such n exists, then the answer is the list of numbers from min_n to max_n. The count of numbers is max_n - min_n + 1.\n\nBut how to find min_n and max_n?\n\nLet me think of binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) equals m. But since the count_zeros is non-decreasing, perhaps we can find the first occurrence of m in the count_zeros function.\n\nBut perhaps the way to approach this is to find the lower and upper bounds for the possible n's.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For a given m, the minimal n that gives count_zeros(n) >= m is found via binary search. Then, if count_zeros(n) is not equal to m, then there is no solution. Otherwise, the minimal n is the first occurrence. Then, the maximal n is the first occurrence of count_zeros(n) = m + 1 minus 1. Because once the count increases beyond m, the numbers before that would have count m.\n\nWait, for example, in the case where m=1. The minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m is 5. The count_zeros(5) is 1. Then, the next value where count_zeros increases is at n=25. So for m=1, the maximal n is 24? No, wait. Because count_zeros(24) is 4. So that's not correct. Hmm, maybe that approach isn't right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum n with count_zeros(n) = m is the largest n where count_zeros(n) = m. How to find that?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m + 1 minus 1. Let's test this.\n\nTake m=1. The minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m+1=2 is 10. Because count_zeros(10) is 2. So the maximum n for m=1 is 10-1=9. Which matches the sample input. So that works.\n\nAnother example: m=6. The minimal n where count_zeros(n) is 6 is 25. The next m is 7. The minimal n where count_zeros(n) =7 is 25 + ... Well, let's compute count_zeros(25) = 6. count_zeros(26) is 6, ..., count_zeros(29) is 6. Then count_zeros(30) is 7 (since 30/5=6, 30/25=1, total 7). So the minimal n for m=7 is 25? No, wait. The minimal n where count_zeros(n) is 7 is 25? No. Wait, count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) is 7 is 25 + something. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) = 6. count_zeros(26) is 6, count_zeros(27) 6, count_zeros(28) 6, count_zeros(29) 6, count_zeros(30) = 7. So the minimal n for m=7 is 30. So the maximum n for m=6 is 29. Which is 30-1=29. So that approach works.\n\nSo the idea is: For a given m, find the minimal n_low where count_zeros(n_low) = m. Then find the minimal n_high where count_zeros(n_high) = m+1. Then the maximum n for m is n_high -1. Then, if n_low is found, the numbers from n_low to n_high-1 are the possible n's.\n\nBut how to find n_low and n_high?\n\nWell, for n_low, we can find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) = m. But perhaps it's easier to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, return 0. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nWait, here's a plan:\n\nFor a given m, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this n_min. Then check if count_zeros(n_min) is equal to m. If not, then there are no solutions. Else, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Let's call this n_max. Then the maximum n for m is n_max -1. So the numbers from n_min to n_max -1 are the possible n's. The count is (n_max -1) - n_min + 1 = n_max - n_min.\n\nBut how to find n_min and n_max?\n\nThis suggests using binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this lower_n.\n\n2. Check if count_zeros(lower_n) == m. If not, return 0.\n\n3. Else, compute the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Call this upper_n.\n\n4. The maximum n for m is upper_n -1.\n\n5. Then the answer is all integers from lower_n to upper_n -1, inclusive.\n\nSo the number of such integers is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nBut how to compute count_zeros(n)?\n\nThe count_zeros function is straightforward. For a given n, we can compute it as:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the binary search part. For example, to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nWhat is the possible range for n? Well, for m, the minimal n is m*5, but that's not precise. For example, m=1, the minimal n is 5. For m=5, the minimal n is 25 (but count_zeros(25) is 6, which is more than 5. So in that case, there's no solution.)\n\nBut for binary search, the lower bound can be 0, and upper bound can be 5*m. Because for example, for m=1, 5*1=5. For m=6, 5*6=30. count_zeros(30) is 7. So perhaps the upper bound needs to be higher. Wait, but for m, the maximum possible n that could have exactly m zeros is 5*m. Because for example, the count_zeros(5m) is m + m//5 + m//25 + ... which is larger than m. So perhaps the upper bound for binary search is 5*m. Wait, but in the case where m is 6, the upper_n is 29. Which is less than 5*6=30. So that seems okay.\n\nBut perhaps the upper bound for binary search should be 5*m. Or even 5*m + 1. Because for the binary search to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m, we need to have a high enough upper bound.\n\nBut how to choose the upper limit for binary search?\n\nLet me think: For any m, the number of trailing zeros in (5m)! is at least m. Because 5m /5 = m, and higher terms add more. So the upper bound can be 5*m. So for binary search, the upper limit can be 5*m.\n\nBut perhaps even 5*m is not enough. Let me take m=1. 5*1=5. The count_zeros(5) is 1. So that's correct. For m=2, 5*2=10. count_zeros(10) is 2. So that's correct. For m=5, 5*5=25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Which is larger than 5. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25? But then, the count_zeros(25) is 6, which is larger than 5. So for m=5, the check would fail, hence no solution.\n\nSo the binary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=m would work.\n\nSo the binary search steps for finding the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m:\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = 5*m.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid = (low + high) // 2.\n\n   if count_zeros(mid) >= m:\n\n      high = mid\n\n   else:\n\n      low = mid + 1.\n\nAt the end, low is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nOnce we have that, we check if count_zeros(low) == m. If not, return 0. Otherwise, proceed to find the upper_n for m+1.\n\nSimilarly, for the upper_n, we can perform the same binary search for m+1.\n\nOnce we have upper_n, then the maximum n for m is upper_n -1.\n\nSo the list of n's is from lower_n to upper_n -1.\n\nBut what if upper_n is such that count_zeros(upper_n) is m+1? Then upper_n -1 would have count_zeros(upper_n -1) = m.\n\nSo the numbers between lower_n and upper_n -1 would all have exactly m zeros.\n\nSo the number of such n is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nBut wait, let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample input m=1.\n\nlower_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1. That is 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\nThen, for m+1=2, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=2. That is 10. So upper_n is 10. So the maximum n for m=1 is 10-1=9. The numbers from 5 to 9: 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnother example: m=6.\n\nlower_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n)>=6. Let's compute:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 6. So lower_n is 25. Then upper_n is minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7. For m+1=7, the minimal n is 25? No. Because count_zeros(25) is 6. So the binary search would find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7. Let's compute for 25: 6. 26: 6. 27:6. 28:6. 29:6. 30: 7. So the minimal n is 30. So upper_n is 30. Then the maximum n for m=6 is 30-1=29. So the range is 25-29, which is 5 numbers. So the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, the edge cases. For example, m=0. But according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nAnother edge case is when m=5. Let's compute lower_n for m=5.\n\nbinary search for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(24) = 4 (24//5=4, 24//25=0. Total 4). count_zeros(25) is 6. So the minimal n is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6 which is greater than 5. So the check fails, so there are no solutions. So output is 0.\n\nAnother example: m=6. As discussed, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code logic seems solid.\n\nNow, the steps for the code:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute lower_n via binary search for m.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(lower_n) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, compute upper_n via binary search for m+1.\n\nThen the numbers are from lower_n to upper_n -1.\n\nThe count is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nIf that count is zero, then output 0. But how?\n\nWait, upper_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So upper_n could be lower_n, but only if count_zeros(lower_n) is m+1. But since lower_n was found for m, and count_zeros(lower_n) is m, then upper_n must be higher than lower_n. Because for m+1, the minimal n is higher than the minimal n for m. Unless m is such that there's a jump.\n\nBut in any case, the code should handle it.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, code for count_zeros(n):\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\nNow, for the binary search functions.\n\nImplement a helper function to find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\nBut wait, for very large targets, like 1e5, 5*target could be 5e5. But for Python, that's manageable.\n\nBut for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. The binary search would be O(log(5e5)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce we have that, proceed:\n\nFor the given m:\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    upper_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    numbers = list(range(lower_n, upper_n))\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but the numbers are from lower_n to upper_n -1, inclusive. So the list is [lower_n, upper_n -1]. So the range is from lower_n to upper_n -1. So the length is upper_n - lower_n.\n\nSo in code, the numbers are range(lower_n, upper_n). Because in Python, range(a, b) includes a, a+1,..., b-1.\n\nYes. So for example, lower_n=5, upper_n=10 → range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9 → 5 elements.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(1) → returns 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\nupper_n = find_min_n(2) → returns 10. So numbers are range(5,10) → 5,6,7,8,9. Output is 5 followed by the numbers. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample input 2: m=5.\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(5). Let's see:\n\nfor target=5, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5.\n\nLet me compute:\n\ncount_zeros(24) = 4, count_zeros(25)=6. So the binary search would find 25 as the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6 !=5. So output is 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: m=6.\n\nlower_n is find_min_n(6) → 25. count_zeros(25)=6. Then upper_n is find_min_n(7) → 30. So numbers from 25 to 29 → 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, code structure:\n\nRead m from input. But note that the input is given as a list, like ['1', '5']? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the input is given as a single integer m. The example shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer m. But the example shows that the input is given as ['1', '5'], but that's probably a mistake. Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nAh, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nBut the original problem's input is a single integer m. But the sample input shows two cases. Wait, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nLooking back:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as ['1', '5'], and the output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']. Which suggests that the input is multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the input is a single integer m. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, the original problem statement says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer. But the sample input shows two lines, perhaps the user made a mistake. But looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe first sample input is m=1, output is 5 followed by the numbers. The second sample input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut the way the sample is presented is that the input is given as a list of inputs, and the output is a list of outputs. So perhaps the actual problem requires handling multiple test cases. But the original problem says that the input is a single integer. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\nSo the input is a single integer. However, the sample input shows two cases. But perhaps the sample is written in a way that the input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code should process a single test case.\n\nBut the original problem's sample input and output may be in the form of multiple test cases. For example, the first sample input is m=1, and output is the first line. The second sample input is m=5, output is 0.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the user is to read a single m from the input, and output the answer for that m. Therefore, the sample input and output is perhaps presented as two separate test cases, but the code should process one m per run.\n\nBut the code provided by the user should read from stdin and output to stdout. So in the code, the input is read as a single integer. However, in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, perhaps indicating that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is a single integer.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem's sample input is:\n\nInput\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in formatting. Perhaps the actual input is a single line, and the sample input is two separate test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single integer. So perhaps the code should read a single integer m from the input.\n\nAssuming that the code is supposed to handle a single m. Then the code should read m from stdin, process it, and output the required answer.\n\nSo in the sample input, perhaps the first case is m=1 and the second is m=5. So the code is supposed to read one m at a time.\n\nTherefore, in the code, we can read m from input as:\n\nm = int(input())\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of two elements, which may be a mistake. So assuming that the code is supposed to read a single m.\n\nThus, the code will be:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute lower_n = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    upper_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    numbers = list(range(lower_n, upper_n))\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, for m=1, the output is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\". So first line is the count, then the numbers. So in code, the first print is len(numbers), then the numbers.\n\nBut when the count is zero, print 0. So for example, for m=5, the code would print 0.\n\nBut in the code, when count_zeros(lower_n) != m, then print 0. But in that case, what about the second line? For example, if the answer is zero, then we should print 0. But the problem says that the output is first print k, then print the numbers. So when k is zero, we print 0 and nothing else.\n\nSo in code:\n\nif the count is zero, print 0. Else, print k followed by the numbers.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead m.\n\nCompute lower_n.\n\nif count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    upper_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    k = upper_n - lower_n\n\n    print(k)\n\n    if k >0:\n\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower_n, upper_n))))\n\n    else:\n\n        print()\n\nWait, but when k is zero, that's impossible because upper_n is the minimal n where count_zeros >= m+1, and lower_n is the minimal for m. Since count_zeros(lower_n) is m, and upper_n is the minimal for m+1, then upper_n must be >= lower_n +1. Because count_zeros(lower_n) is m, and count_zeros(upper_n) is >= m+1. So upper_n - lower_n is at least 1? Or not?\n\nWait, suppose m is 6. lower_n is 25, upper_n is 30. So upper_n - lower_n is 5. Which is correct.\n\nBut suppose for some m, the upper_n is lower_n. For example, if m is such that count_zeros(lower_n) is m, and count_zeros(lower_n) is also m+1. But that's impossible. Because if count_zeros(lower_n) is m, then for m+1, the minimal n is at least lower_n. But if count_zeros(lower_n) is m, then for m+1, the minimal n is the first n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. Which is possibly lower_n if count_zeros(lower_n) is m+1. But that would mean that count_zeros(lower_n) is m and m+1 at the same time, which is impossible.\n\nThus, upper_n must be >= lower_n. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, if m=6, lower_n=25. count_zeros(25) is 6. Now, for m+1=7, the minimal n is 30. So upper_n is 30. So upper_n - lower_n is 5.\n\nBut suppose m=6 and for some reason, the minimal n for m+1 is 25. That would mean that count_zeros(25) is >=7. But count_zeros(25) is 6. So that's not possible.\n\nThus, upper_n is always >= lower_n. So upper_n - lower_n is >=0. But when is it zero? Only if count_zeros(lower_n) is m, and count_zeros(lower_n) is also >=m+1. Which implies that m is <= count_zeros(lower_n) >= m+1. Which implies that count_zeros(lower_n) is m+1. Which would mean that the original check (count_zeros(lower_n) == m) would be false. Which would have been caught earlier. Thus, in the else clause, upper_n - lower_n is >=1.\n\nBut wait, in the else clause, we have count_zeros(lower_n) == m. So upper_n is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So for upper_n, count_zeros(upper_n) >= m+1. But what about count_zeros(lower_n) is m. So the upper_n must be >= lower_n. So upper_n - lower_n is >=0.\n\nBut can it be zero?\n\nOnly if count_zeros(lower_n) >= m+1. But since count_zeros(lower_n) is exactly m, that can't happen. Thus, upper_n must be > lower_n. Hence, upper_n - lower_n is >=1. So the code can safely generate the numbers.\n\nThus, the code for the else part is:\n\nprint(k)\n\nprint the numbers.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut in Python, when you have to print the numbers, for example, for the sample input, the code would generate a list of numbers from lower_n to upper_n -1, which is range(lower_n, upper_n).\n\nBut for the code, in Python, the code would be:\n\nprint(len(numbers))\n\nprint(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nBut numbers is range(lower_n, upper_n), which is a generator. So converting to a list.\n\nBut in code:\n\nnumbers = list(range(lower_n, upper_n))\n\nBut for m=1, upper_n is 10. So range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9 → len 5. Correct.\n\nSo the code:\n\nBut now, the code for find_min_n.\n\nBut for m=0, but the problem says m starts from 1. So no problem.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut also, note that for m=0, but the problem says m ≥1.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n //5\n        count +=n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid +1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.read())\n    lower_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        upper_n = find_min_n(m+1)\n        k = upper_n - lower_n\n        print(k)\n        print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower_n, upper_n))))\n\nBut wait, for the case when k is zero? But earlier analysis says that it can't be. But for example, if m is such that lower_n is found, but upper_n is lower_n. But that's not possible. So the code can proceed.\n\nBut let's test for m=6. upper_n is 30. lower_n is 25. k is 5. So the code outputs 5 and the numbers.\n\nBut what about when upper_n is lower_n +1? For example, if m is such that there's only one number. Like m=2?\n\nWait, for m=2. Let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(2) is 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. Then find_min_n(3) is 15. Because count_zeros(15) is 3 (15//5=3, 15//25=0 → total 3). So upper_n is 15. So the numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. Which is 5 numbers. Because 10! has 2 zeros, and 14! has 2 zeros. 15! has 3 zeros.\n\nSo the code returns 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: m=24. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(99) = 99//5=19, 99//25=3, 99//125=0 → total 22.\n\ncount_zeros(100) = 20 + 4 = 24. So for m=24, lower_n is 100. Then upper_n is find_min_n(25). Let's compute count_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(100) is 24. For m+1=25, find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=25. Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(100) is 24. count_zeros(101) is 24. ... count_zeros(104) is 24. count_zeros(105) is 105//5=21, 105//25=4, 105//125=0. Total 25. So upper_n is 105. So the numbers are 100, 101, 102, 103, 104. So 5 numbers again.\n\nThus, the code seems to work.\n\nBut what about when m is 25?\n\nlower_n = find_min_n(25). Let's compute:\n\nThe minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=25.\n\ncount_zeros(105) is 25. So lower_n is 105. count_zeros(105) is 25. So proceed. upper_n is find_min_n(26). Let's compute count_zeros(105) is 25. count_zeros(106) is 25. ... count_zeros(109) is 25. count_zeros(110) is 110//5=22, 110//25=4, 110//125=0 → 26. So upper_n is 110. So the numbers are 105-109 (5 numbers). So code returns 5 numbers.\n\nThus, the code seems to work.\n\nNow, the code for the main function.\n\nBut in the code above, the code for main() uses sys.stdin.read(). But if the input is read as a single integer, that's correct. For example, when the input is '1', then m is 1.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as ['1', '5'], but that's probably a mistake. Assuming that the code is supposed to read one m per run",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros are formed in factorials and efficiently finding the range of values for $ n $ that meet the criteria.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5 in a factorial, making the count of 5s the limiting factor.\n\n2. **Binary Search for Efficient Range Finding**: To efficiently find the range of $ n $ values that produce exactly $ m $ trailing zeros, we use binary search. This helps in quickly determining the minimum value $ n $ such that $ n! $ has at least $ m $ trailing zeros and the minimum value $ n $ such that $ n! $ has at least $ m+1 $ trailing zeros.\n\n3. **Range Calculation**: Using the results from the binary searches, we determine the range of $ n $ values that result in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. If no such $ n $ exists, we return 0.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n > 0:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.read())\n    lower_n = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(lower_n) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        upper_n = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        k = upper_n - lower_n\n        print(k)\n        if k > 0:\n            print(' '.join(map(str, range(lower_n, upper_n))))\n        else:\n            print()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros(n)**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5 and summing the quotients.\n\n2. **find_min_n(target)**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that $ n! $ has at least `target` trailing zeros. The search range is from 0 to $ 5 \\times \\text{target} $, which is a safe upper bound based on the properties of trailing zeros in factorials.\n\n3. **main()**: This function reads the input value $ m $, determines the valid range of $ n $ values using the helper functions, and prints the count of such values followed by the values themselves. If no valid $ n $ exists, it prints 0.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation using binary search, making it suitable even for large values of $ m $ up to 100,000.",
