He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times the number 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. The formula for the number of trailing zeros in n! is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division results in zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where the count of trailing zeros equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that give exactly m trailing zeros. But how do I find them?\n\nFirst, I need to find the possible n's such that the trailing zero count is exactly m. Let's think about how the trailing zero count increases. For example, when n increases by 1, the trailing zero count either stays the same or increases by 1 or more. Wait, no. For example, when n is a multiple of 5, then the count increases by 1. But if it's a multiple of 25, then it increases by 2 (since 25 contributes two 5s). So the count can jump by more than 1. Which means that for certain m values, there may be no n's that produce exactly that count. For example, if m is 5, then maybe there's a range of n's that produce exactly 5 zeros. But if there's a jump from 4 to 6, then m=5 would have no solutions.\n\nWait, but the sample input says for m=1, the answer is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let's check why. The trailing zeros for 5! is 1. For 6! it's also 1 (since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1). Similarly for 7,8,9. Then 10! is 2 zeros. So between 5 and 9, the count is 1. So there are 5 numbers. So the idea is that for some m, there are multiple n's that result in exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to find those n's?\n\nThe approach I need to take is:\n\n1. Find the minimum n such that the number of trailing zeros is exactly m. Then check if there are other numbers after that which also have the same count.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, there could be 0, 1, or 5 numbers (probably not 5, but depends). Wait, in the sample, m=1, there are 5 numbers. How?\n\nBecause the trailing zeros function is non-decreasing. So for each m, the possible n's that give exactly m zeros form a contiguous range. So if there exists at least one n with exactly m zeros, then there will be a range of numbers from a lower bound to upper bound. But how long is that range?\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose that for some n, the trailing zero count is m. Then for n+1, the count can either stay the same (if n+1 is not divisible by 5) or increase by 1 (if it's divisible by 5 but not by higher powers), etc. So the count increases by 1 or more. So if there is a range of numbers where the count is m, then the next number after that range will have count m + k, where k is the number of 5s added.\n\nSo, for example, if there's a number n where the count is m, and the next number (n+1) increases the count by 1, then the next number after that would have m+1. So the range of n's that have exactly m zeros would be from some lower bound to upper bound. But how to find that?\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is:\n\n- For a given m, find the minimal n such that the count is >= m. Then check if that count is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal and maximal n's that have exactly m zeros.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, find the smallest n where the count is m. Then check how many consecutive numbers after that have the same count.\n\nBut how to find the smallest n where count is m?\n\nThis seems like a binary search problem. Because the count of trailing zeros is a non-decreasing function. So for example, for m, we can perform a binary search to find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) = m. But wait, maybe there's no n with count_zeros(n) equal to m. For example, if m is 5, but the count jumps from 4 to 6. Then there's no solution.\n\nSo first, I need to check whether there exists any n such that count_zeros(n) = m. If there is, then find the range of n's that satisfy that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. For a given m, find the minimal n_low such that count_zeros(n_low) = m. Then find the maximal n_high such that count_zeros(n_high) = m. Then the numbers between n_low and n_high (inclusive) are the possible n's. The count is n_high - n_low + 1.\n\nBut how to find n_low and n_high?\n\nAlternatively, since the count_zeros(n) increases as n increases, for each m, there can be a range of n's where count_zeros(n) = m. The length of that range depends on how the count increases.\n\nBut how to find that range?\n\nAnother approach: For a given m, the numbers n that have exactly m trailing zeros are those where count_zeros(n) = m and count_zeros(n+1) > m. Or, if n is the maximum such number.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to find the numbers is:\n\nFind the first n where count_zeros(n) = m. Then find the first n where count_zeros(n) = m+1. Then the numbers between the first and the second minus one are the ones that have exactly m zeros.\n\nFor example, if the first occurrence of m is at n_start, and the first occurrence of m+1 is at n_end, then the numbers from n_start to n_end - 1 have exactly m zeros. So the count would be n_end - n_start.\n\nBut how to find these n_start and n_end?\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because between n_start and n_end - 1, the count is m. Because once you reach n_end, the count increases to m+1. So the numbers from n_start to n_end - 1 would all have exactly m zeros.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor a given m, find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) = m. Let's call this n_start.\n\nThen find the smallest n where count_zeros(n) = m+1. Call this n_end.\n\nIf there is no n_end (i.e., m+1 is not achievable), then the numbers from n_start onwards would have count_zeros(n) >= m. But since the count_zeros(n) is non-decreasing, once it reaches m, it can't go back. So if there's no n_end, then the numbers from n_start onwards would have count_zeros(n) = m? No, because for example, if m is 5 and there's a number n where count_zeros(n) = 5, but then for n+1, count_zeros(n+1) could be 5 (if n+1 is not divisible by 5) or higher. So for example, if n is 24, count_zeros(24) is 4. Then 25 gives count_zeros(25) = 6. So between 25 and 29, the count is 6. So for m=5, there are no solutions.\n\nSo, the approach would be:\n\nCheck if there exists any n where count_zeros(n) = m. If yes, then find the numbers between n_start and n_end - 1.\n\nBut how to check if such n exists?\n\nWell, for example, if the minimal n for which count_zeros(n) >= m is x, and count_zeros(x) is not equal to m, then there's no solution.\n\nSo the steps for solving the problem:\n\nGiven m, first find the minimal n such that count_zeros(n) >= m. Let's call this x. Then check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the minimal y such that count_zeros(y) >= m+1. Then the numbers from x to y-1 are the solutions.\n\nSo the number of solutions is y - x.\n\nBut how to compute x and y?\n\nWe can use binary search for this.\n\nNow, the key is to implement a function that counts the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nLet me code that function first.\n\nFunction count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n >=5:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, for binary search, to find the minimal x where count_zeros(x) >= m.\n\nSimilarly for m+1.\n\nOnce we find x and y, then if count_zeros(x) == m, then the answer is y - x numbers, from x to y-1 inclusive.\n\nBut what if y is not found? Like, for m+1, there's no n where count_zeros(n) = m+1. Well, since m can be up to 1e5, but for any m, there's a n that gives count_zeros(n) = m+1. Wait, no. For example, if m is very large, but the count_zeros(n) can be m+1. Well, for any m, there exists n such that count_zeros(n) is m+1. Because for example, n = 5*(m+1) would have count_zeros(n) >= m+1. So the binary search for y would find that.\n\nBut perhaps I need to handle cases where m is such that there's no n with count_zeros(n) = m. For example, m=5, but the count_zeros(n) jumps from 4 to 6. So in that case, when we find x (the minimal n where count_zeros(x) >= m) is 25, but count_zeros(25) is 6, which is larger than m. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nFind x = the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m.\n\nCheck if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, output 0.\n\nElse, find y = minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= m+1.\n\nThen the answer is the numbers from x to y-1, inclusive. The count is y -x.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    ... as before ...\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    # find the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >= target.\n\n    # binary search between low and high.\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target  # since count_zeros(5*target) is at least target.\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid + 1\n\n    return low\n\nBut wait, what's the upper bound for binary search? Because for a target m, the minimal n that gives count_zeros(n) >= m is at most 5*m. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is m + floor(m/5) + ... which is definitely >= m. So using 5*m as the upper bound is safe.\n\nSo for example, for m=1, the minimal n is 5. For m=5, the minimal n is 25? Let's see:\n\ncount_zeros(25) is 25//5 + 25//25 = 5 + 1 =6. So for target=5, the minimal n is 25? No. Because for n=24, count_zeros(24) is 24//5=4 + 24//25=0 =4. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25. But count_zeros(25) is 6. So in this case, the target is 5, but the minimal n is 25, but count_zeros(25) is 6. So there is no n with exactly 5 zeros. Hence, the answer is 0.\n\nSo in this case, the code would return x=25, check count_zeros(x) == m? 6 ==5? No. So output 0.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFor the given m, compute x = find_min_n(m). Check if count_zeros(x) == m. If not, output 0. Else, compute y = find_min_n(m+1). Then the answer is the numbers from x to y-1. The count is y -x.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input m=1:\n\nx is find_min_n(1). Let's see. The minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=1 is 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So yes. Then y is find_min_n(2). What is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=2? That's 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9 (y-1=10-1=9). So 5,6,7,8,9. Which is 5 numbers. Correct.\n\nAnother example, m=5. x is find_min_n(5) = 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So since 6 !=5, output 0.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nCompute x = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute y = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthen the numbers are x, x+1,..., y-1.\n\nso the count is y -x.\n\nBut how to handle when m is 0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle m=0.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement the count_zeros function.\n\nImplement find_min_n function.\n\nBut in Python, for the binary search, we need to handle the upper limit.\n\nNow, for m=1e5, 5*m is 5e5. So the binary search for each find_min_n would take log2(5e5) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nSo code outline:\n\nRead m from input.\n\nif m is 0, but according to problem statement, m is at least 1.\n\nSo proceed.\n\nCompute x = find_min_n(m).\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m: output 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute y = find_min_n(m+1).\n\nthen the answer is the list [x, x+1, ..., y-1].\n\nSo the number of elements is y -x.\n\nBut how to generate that list?\n\nBut for m=1, y is 10. So the numbers from 5 to 9, which is 5 numbers.\n\nSo the code would generate that list.\n\nNow, the code for the problem:\n\nBut first, note that for m=0, but the problem says m starts from 1. So no need to handle.\n\nBut let's test for m=5, which gives 0.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut first, code for find_min_n:\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n >=5:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\nBut what if the target is very large? For example, m=1e5. Then 5*m is 5e5. But for that, the binary search would take O(log(5e5)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce we have x and y, then the numbers are from x to y-1.\n\nBut what if y is infinity? No, since for m+1, the find_min_n would find a value.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead m.\n\nx = find_min_n(m)\n\nif count_zeros(x) != m:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    y = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n    numbers = list(range(x, y))\n\n    print(len(numbers))\n\n    print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nWait, but range(x, y) is from x to y-1. So yes.\n\nBut for example, if x is 5, y is 10, then range(5,10) is 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nBut let's test for the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: m=1.\n\nx = find_min_n(1) is 5. count_zeros(5) is 1. So proceed.\n\ny = find_min_n(2). Let's see:\n\nfind_min_n(2) is looking for the first n where count_zeros(n) >=2.\n\nLet's compute:\n\nfor n=5: count is 1. Not enough.\n\nn=10: count_zeros(10) is 2. So the minimal is 10. So y=10. So numbers are range(5,10) → 5,6,7,8,9. Which is correct.\n\nSample output is 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nAnother sample input is m=5. Let's see:\n\nx = find_min_n(5). Let's compute.\n\nWhat is the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5?\n\nLet's compute for n=20: count_zeros(20) is 4 (20//5=4, 20//25=0. total 4). n=25: 25//5=5, 25//25=1 → total 6. So the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=5 is 25? Because for n=24, count_zeros is 4+0=4. So the binary search would find 25. Then check count_zeros(25) is 6, which is not equal to 5. So output 0. Which matches the sample's second case.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about m=6?\n\nFor m=6, x is find_min_n(6). Let's see:\n\nLooking for the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=6.\n\nAt n=25, count is 6. So x=25. count_zeros(x)=6. Then y is find_min_n(7). Let's see:\n\nWhat's the minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=7?\n\nn=25: 6. n=26: 6. ... n=29: 6. n=30: 30//5=6, 30//25=1 → 7. So y is 30. So numbers from 25 to 29. Which is 5 numbers. So the output is 5 numbers: 25,26,27,28,29.\n\nSo for m=6, the answer is 5 numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother test case: m=2.\n\nfind_min_n(2) is 10. count_zeros(10) is 2. Then find_min_n(3) is 15. Because count_zeros(15) is 3. So numbers from 10 to 14. Which is 5 numbers. Let's check:\n\n10! → 2 zeros.\n\n11! → same.\n\n12! → same.\n\n13! → same.\n\n14! → same.\n\n15! → 3 zeros. So yes. So 5 numbers.\n\nSo code works.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut what about when m is 0? According to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead m from input. But the input is given as a list, like in the sample input, which is ['1', '5']? Wait, no. Wait the original problem says that the input is a single integer m. But the sample input shows for example, input is ['1', '5']? Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nIn the example:\n\nInput:\n\n['1', '5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\nWait, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Because the problem says the input is an integer m. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases. For example, for m=1, the output is 5 followed by the numbers. For m=5, output is 0. So the code needs to read a single integer m from input.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is a single integer m. So perhaps the sample input is written as two separate test cases. But the actual code needs to read one line of input, which is m.\n\nSo the code should read m as input. So in Python, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef count_zeros(n):\n\n    count = 0\n\n    while n >=5:\n\n        n = n //5\n\n        count +=n\n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = 5 * target\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n\n            high = mid\n\n        else:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n\n    m = int(input().strip())\n\n    x = find_min_n(m)\n\n    if count_zeros(x) != m:\n\n        print(0)\n\n    else:\n\n        y = find_min_n(m+1)\n\n        numbers = list(range(x, y))\n\n        print(len(numbers))\n\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nBut wait, the sample input for m=1 outputs \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\". So the first line is the count, then the numbers. But in the code above, the code prints len(numbers), then the numbers. So for the sample input, len(numbers) is 5, then the numbers. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example's output is '5\\n5 6 7 8 9'. So the code is correct.\n\nBut for the case where the numbers are empty (like m=5), the code prints 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for the case where the numbers are non-empty, the code prints len(numbers) and then the numbers. However, in the sample input, the output is \"5\\n5 6 7 8 9\", which is the count followed by the numbers. So the code is correct.\n\nBut what about when the numbers list is empty? For example, when m=5, the code prints 0. Which is correct.\n\nBut in the code, when the numbers list is non-empty, the code prints len(numbers) and then the numbers. However, the problem says that the output must first print k (the number of values) and then print the k integers in increasing order. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing for m=5:\n\nx = find_min_n(5) → returns 25. count_zeros(25) is 6. So 6 !=5. So print 0. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: m=6. The code returns 5 numbers.\n\nBut let's check for m=6:\n\nx = find_min_n(6). Let's compute:\n\nThe minimal n where count_zeros(n) >=6.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=25: count_zeros(25) = 6. So x is 25. Then y is find_min_n(7). Let's compute that.\n\nfind_min_n(7) is looking for the first n where count_zeros(n) >=7.\n\nn=25: count is 6. n=26: same. n=29: same. n=30: count_zeros(30) is 30//5=6 + 30//25=1 → 7. So y=30. So numbers are 25,26,27,28,29. Which is 5 numbers. So code outputs 5 followed by those numbers.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about m=0? Well, according to the problem statement, m is between 1 and 1e5, so it's not required.\n\nNow, what about m=2?\n\nx is 10. y is 15. numbers from 10 to 14. So 5 numbers. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: m=100000. How does the code handle it?\n\nBut the code uses 5*target as high. For m=1e5, 5*target is 5e5. But the binary search would take O( log(5e5) ) steps, which is manageable.\n\nNow, code seems correct. But let's think about possible errors.\n\nWhat if the find_min_n returns a value where count_zeros is larger than m, but there's no n with count_zeros(n) = m. For example, m=5, as discussed. The code correctly returns 0.\n\nAnother possible error: when m is such that there are multiple ranges. But according to the logic, the code finds the first occurrence of m and the first occurrence of m+1, and the numbers between them are all m. So that's correct.\n\nAnother possible error: when m is the maximum possible. For example, for m=1e5, but the code would handle it.\n\nAnother possible error is when the find_min_n returns a value that is higher than 5*target. Wait, no. Because the high is set to 5*target. So for example, if the target is m, then the high is 5*m. But for some m, the minimal n could be higher than 5*m? No. Because for n=5*m, count_zeros(n) is at least m. Because count_zeros(5m) = floor(5m/5) + floor(5m/25) + ... = m + floor(m/5) + ... which is >= m. So the minimal n is <=5m. So the binary search is correct.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code needs to read from stdin and write to stdout. Also, note that in some cases, when the numbers list is empty, the code outputs 0. Otherwise, outputs the count and the numbers.\n\nBut in the sample input, when m=5, the output is 0. Which is correct.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of positive integers $ n $ such that the factorial of $ n $ ends with exactly $ m $ trailing zeros. The solution involves understanding how trailing zeros in factorials are formed and efficiently searching for valid values of $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Trailing Zeros**: The number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to $ n $. This is because there are usually more factors of 2 than 5, so the count of trailing zeros is determined by the count of 5s.\n2. **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the smallest $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least $ m $, we use binary search. This helps us quickly narrow down the range of possible values for $ n $.\n3. **Range Determination**: Once we find the smallest $ n $ (let's call it $ x $) where the count of trailing zeros is exactly $ m $, we then find the smallest $ n $ (let's call it $ y $) where the count of trailing zeros is $ m+1 $. The valid values of $ n $ that result in exactly $ m $ trailing zeros lie between $ x $ and $ y-1 $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef count_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n = n // 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n\ndef find_min_n(target):\n    low = 0\n    high = 5 * target\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if count_zeros(mid) >= target:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    return low\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    m = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    x = find_min_n(m)\n    if count_zeros(x) != m:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        y = find_min_n(m + 1)\n        numbers = list(range(x, y))\n        print(len(numbers))\n        print(' '.join(map(str, numbers)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **count_zeros Function**: This function calculates the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ by repeatedly dividing $ n $ by 5 and summing the quotients.\n2. **find_min_n Function**: This function uses binary search to find the smallest integer $ n $ such that the number of trailing zeros in $ n! $ is at least the target value. The upper bound for the binary search is set to $ 5 \\times \\text{target} $, which ensures we cover all possible values.\n3. **Main Function**: The main function reads the input $ m $, determines the smallest $ n $ (x) where the trailing zeros count is exactly $ m $, and checks if such an $ n $ exists. If it does, it finds the next smallest $ n $ (y) where the trailing zeros count is $ m+1 $. The valid values of $ n $ are then printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the possible values using binary search and ensures correctness by leveraging the properties of trailing zeros in factorials.",
