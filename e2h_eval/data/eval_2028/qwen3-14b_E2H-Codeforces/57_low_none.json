His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on the given points from two tours. The key here is that the teacher knows Vasya's total is at least x, but we need to consider all possible combinations of a_i and b_j (with i and j being any indices) such that a_i + b_j >= x. But wait, no—actually, the problem says that there exists some i and j where a_i + b_j >= x. But for the purposes of calculating the best and worst possible positions, we need to consider all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) that could be Vasya's scores, as long as their sum is at least x. But how do we model this?\n\nWait, the problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But the teacher has the results of the first and second tours, but they are not linked. So, each participant has a score in the first tour and a score in the second tour. However, the problem says that the teacher needs to find the best and worst possible positions that Vasya could have, considering that his total is at least x. But how does that work? Because Vasya's actual scores are a_i and b_j for some i and j. But since the teacher doesn't know which ones, we need to consider all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j >= x. Then, for each such pair, compute the possible rank Vasya could have. Then, the best possible rank is the minimum possible rank across all possible valid pairs, and the worst possible is the maximum.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think. For the best possible rank, we want to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that when we add them, their sum is as high as possible. Because then, Vasya's total would be higher than others, leading to a better rank. Conversely, for the worst possible rank, we want to choose a pair where his total is as low as possible (but still >=x), and arrange other participants' totals in a way that maximizes his rank.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the participants are sorted by their total points. If two people have the same total, the jury can assign their ranks in any way. So for the best possible rank, we want to maximize the number of people that have a total less than Vasya's. For the worst possible rank, we want to minimize that number, but considering that others with same total could be placed before or after him.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\nWe need to select a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x, and then find the minimal possible rank that Vasya can have. To get the best possible rank, we should choose the maximum possible total for Vasya. Because if he has the highest possible total, then he can be ranked first. However, there might be other participants with the same total. But since the jury can arrange the ranks, in that case, he can be placed first.\n\nSo the best possible rank is 1 if there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum s, such that s is the maximum possible. But even if others have the same sum, the jury can assign him first place. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1 if there exists at least one pair that gives a sum >=x. But according to the input constraints, it's guaranteed that there is such a pair.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya's total is at least x. So the teacher knows that there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. So the best possible rank is 1, because if Vasya's total is the maximum possible, then he can be first. Unless there are others with the same total. But even then, the jury can assign him first place.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. Wait, but that's not always true. For example, suppose that all participants have a total of 2, and x is 2. Then Vasya's total is 2. Then the best possible rank is 1 (since the jury can assign him first place). But the worst possible rank is n, since they can put him last. So in the first example, the output is 1 5.\n\nBut what if there are some participants with higher totals than Vasya's possible total? For example, suppose that the maximum possible sum for Vasya is 10, but there are some participants whose sum is 11. Then, even if Vasya's sum is 10, he can't be first. So the best possible rank",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his scores from two tours. The solution involves analyzing the possible combinations of scores from both tours and determining how these combinations affect his rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank, we consider the maximum possible score Vasya could have achieved. If Vasya's score is the highest, he can be ranked first. This is because the jury can assign ranks arbitrarily for participants with the same total score.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To find the worst possible rank, we consider the minimum possible score Vasya could have while still meeting the minimum requirement `x`. We then count how many participants could have a higher or equal score than Vasya in the worst-case scenario.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    line1 = input[idx].split()\n    n, x = int(line1[0]), int(line1[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Best place is always 1 if there's at least one valid pair\n    best = 1\n    \n    # For worst place, we need to consider all possible a_i + b_j >= x\n    # To find the worst possible rank, we need to find the minimal sum s >= x that Vasya can have\n    # Then count how many participants have sum > s, plus how many have sum == s (since in worst case they are before him)\n    \n    # Find all possible sums >= x\n    # But since a and b are unsorted, we need to find the minimal possible sum s that is >=x\n    # However, to get the worst possible rank, we want the minimal s >=x such that there exists a_i and b_j where a_i + b_j = s\n    # Because if s is as small as possible, then more people can have higher or equal sums\n    \n    # So first, find the minimal possible s >=x\n    # To find that, we can sort a and b, and for each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x\n    # Then collect all possible s values and find the minimal one\n    \n    # Sort b\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    min_s = float('inf')\n    for ai in a:\n        # Find the smallest bj such that ai + bj >= x\n        # Using binary search on b_sorted\n        low = 0\n        high = len(b_sorted)\n        while low < high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            if ai + b_sorted[mid] >= x:\n                high = mid\n            else:\n                low = mid + 1\n        if low < len(b_sorted):\n            s = ai + b_sorted[low]\n            if s < min_s:\n                min_s = s\n        else:\n            # No such bj found, but input guarantees existence\n            pass\n    \n    # Now, find how many participants have sum > min_s, and how many have sum == min_s\n    # To compute this, we need to consider all possible pairs of a_i and b_j, and count how many have sum > min_s and sum == min_s\n    \n    # But since n can be up to 1e5, we need an efficient way to calculate this\n    \n    # First, sort a and b\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # For each a_i, find the number of b_j where a_i + b_j > min_s\n    # Also, count the number of pairs where a_i + b_j == min_s\n    \n    # Precompute the total counts\n    count_gt = 0\n    count_eq = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each a_i\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        target = min_s - ai\n        # Find the number of b_j > target\n        # Since b_sorted is sorted, use bisect_right\n        idx_b = bisect.bisect_right(b_sorted, target)\n        count_gt += len(b_sorted) - idx_b\n        \n        # Also check if there are elements equal to target\n        if ai + b_sorted[idx_b - 1] == min_s:\n            count_eq += 1\n    \n    # Now, the worst possible rank is count_gt + 1 (since all those with higher sum are before him, and in worst case, all with same sum are before him)\n    # But wait, count_eq counts the number of pairs (ai, bj) that equal min_s. However, for each a_i, we might have multiple b_j's that equal to target.\n    # Wait, the above approach is not correct. Let me think again.\n    \n    # Actually, the number of participants is n. Each participant has a unique a_i and b_j? No, the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but the data is given in arbitrary order. So for each participant, their first tour score is a_i and second tour score is b_j, but the problem does not link them. However, in reality, each participant has exactly one a_i and one b_j. But for the problem, we are considering all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) as possible candidates for Vasya's scores. However, the actual participants are n in number, each with a_i and b_j. But the problem states that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but they are not linked. Therefore, when considering the possible other participants' total scores, we need to consider all possible pairs of (a_i, b_j), except for the one that is Vasya's. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each participant has exactly one a and one b. But the problem allows us to choose any pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya, as long as there exists at least one such pair with sum >=x. However, when considering other participants, their scores are fixed. Wait, no. The problem is that the teacher has the list of all a_i (first tour scores) and all b_j (second tour scores), but doesn't know which a_i belongs to which b_j. So, for the purpose of calculating the worst possible rank, we need to assume that each participant has a unique a_i and b_j (but the pairing is unknown). But the problem allows us to arrange the pairings in any way that would lead to the worst possible rank for Vasya.\n\n    # However, the problem says that Vasya is present in the Olympiad, so there exists at least one i and j such that a_i + b_j >=x. But for the purposes of computing the worst possible rank, we can choose any pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya that satisfies a_i + b_j >=x, and then assume that the other participants are paired in a way that maximizes the number of participants with a higher or equal total.\n\n    # Therefore, to compute the worst possible rank, we should choose a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya with the minimal possible sum s (>=x), and then count how many participants can have a sum greater than s. Additionally, for those participants who have the same sum s, they can be placed before Vasya in the worst case.\n\n    # So, the steps are:\n    # 1. Find the minimal s >=x that can be formed by some a_i + b_j.\n    # 2. Count the number of pairs (a_p, b_q) where a_p + b_q > s. Let's call this count_gt.\n    # 3. Count the number of pairs (a_p, b_q) where a_p + b_q == s. Let's call this count_eq.\n    # 4. Then, the worst possible rank is count_gt + 1 (because all those with higher sum are before him, and in worst case, all with same sum are also before him).\n\n    # However, the problem is that the total number of participants is n, and each participant has exactly one a and one b. But in the current approach, we are counting all possible pairs (a_i, b_j), which is n^2 pairs. That's impossible for n=1e5.\n\n    # So this approach is not feasible. Need to find another way.\n\n    # Let me re-examine the problem statement. The note in the second example shows that for the worst case, the teacher can arrange the pairings of a and b such that Vasya's score is as low as possible, but others have higher or equal scores.\n\n    # Therefore, the worst case for Vasya is when his total is as low as possible (s_min), and the other participants are paired such that as many as possible have a higher or equal total.\n\n    # But how can we model this?\n\n    # Let's think differently. For the worst possible rank, we need to maximize the number of participants that have a total score >= s, where s is the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have (>=x).\n\n    # However, since the pairings are arbitrary, we can arrange the pairings such that for each participant, their a_i and b_j are chosen to maximize the number of participants with total >= s.\n\n    # To find the maximum number of participants that can have a total >= s, we can pair a_i with b_j in a way that maximizes the number of a_i + b_j >= s.\n\n    # But how?\n\n    # Let me think about this: To maximize the number of participants with total >= s, we can pair the largest a_i with the largest b_j, etc.\n\n    # Alternatively, for a given s, the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >= s can be found using a two-pointer approach.\n\n    # So, the plan is:\n\n    # 1. Find the minimal s such that there exists a_i + b_j >=x. Let's call this s_min.\n    # 2. For s_min, compute the maximum number of participants that can have a_i + b_j >= s_min. Let's call this max_count.\n    # 3. Then, the worst possible rank for Vasya is max_count + 1. Because in the worst case, all those max_count participants are placed before him, and he is placed after them.\n\n    # However, this approach may not be accurate. Let's see:\n\n    # Suppose s_min is the minimal sum that Vasya can have. Then, the maximum number of participants that can have a total >= s_min is max_count. Then, Vasya's rank could be as bad as max_count + 1. But if Vasya's sum is exactly s_min, and there are max_count participants with >= s_min, then his rank is max_count + 1.\n\n    # However, this requires that we can pair the a and b arrays to achieve this max_count. \n\n    # So, the steps for the worst case are:\n\n    # 1. Find s_min, the minimal possible sum >=x that Vasya can have.\n    # 2. Compute the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j >= s_min. This is done using two pointers.\n    # 3. The worst rank is this number + 1.\n\n    # Let's implement this.\n\n    # First, find s_min as before.\n\n    # Now, to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= s_min.\n\n    # To do this, we sort a in ascending order, and b in descending order. Then, use two pointers to count the maximum number of pairs.\n\n    # Wait, here's a standard approach for maximum number of pairs with sum >= target:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order, b in ascending order. Then, use two pointers: i starts at 0 (beginning of a), j starts at n-1 (end of b). For each a[i], if a[i] + b[j] >= target, then we can take this pair, increment i and decrement j. Otherwise, increment i.\n\n    # This gives the maximum number of pairs with sum >= target.\n\n    # So let's implement this.\n\n    # So, here's the plan:\n\n    # After finding s_min, sort a and b in ascending order.\n\n    # Use two pointers to count the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >= s_min.\n\n    # This count is max_pairs.\n\n    # Then, the worst possible rank is max_pairs + 1.\n\n    # Wait, but why? Because if there are max_pairs participants with sum >= s_min, then Vasya could be one of them. In the worst case, all those max_pairs participants are placed before him, making his rank max_pairs + 1.\n\n    # However, if Vasya is part of the max_pairs, then the actual number of participants with sum >= s_min is max_pairs, including Vasya. So the worst rank would be max_pairs (if all others are placed before him) or max_pairs + 1? No, it depends.\n\n    # Let me think: suppose that the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= s_min is m. Then, if Vasya is one of them, then there are m participants with sum >= s_min. The worst case is that all of them are placed before him, so his rank is m + 1. But that's only if m participants have sum >= s_min, and Vasya is one of them.\n\n    # However, the way we compute m is the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >= s_min. So in this scenario, Vasya's pair is included in those m pairs. Thus, the worst possible rank is m + 1?\n\n    # Or is it m? Because if there are m participants with sum >= s_min, then the worst possible rank is m if Vasya is placed last among them. But the problem says that when participants have the same sum, the jury can assign the ranks in any way. So, if there are m participants with sum >= s_min, and Vasya is one of them, the worst possible rank is m.\n\n    # Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's take an example.\n\n    # Example 1:\n\n    # All participants have a_i = 1 and b_j = 1. x = 2. s_min is 2.\n\n    # The maximum number of pairs with sum >= 2 is 5 (all of them). So the worst possible rank would be 5, which matches the sample output.\n\n    # Another example: if there are 3 participants with sum >= s_min (say 3), then the worst possible rank is 3 (if they are all placed before him).\n\n    # So the formula is: worst_rank = max_pairs.\n\n    # So the previous approach was incorrect. The worst_rank is max_pairs.\n\n    # So the steps are:\n\n    # 1. Find s_min (the minimal sum that Vasya can have >=x).\n    # 2. Compute max_pairs, the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= s_min.\n    # 3. The worst possible rank is max_pairs.\n\n    # But how to compute max_pairs?\n\n    # Let's proceed with the two-pointer approach.\n\n    # So, the code for max_pairs:\n\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n\n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    max_pairs = 0\n\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] >= s_min:\n            max_pairs += 1\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n    # This will give the maximum number of pairs with sum >= s_min.\n\n    # So the worst possible rank is max_pairs.\n\n    # However, in the first sample input:\n\n    # n=5, x=2, a=[1,1,1,1,1], b=[1,1,1,1,1]\n\n    # s_min is 2.\n\n    # max_pairs is 5 (each pair adds to 2). So worst_rank is 5.\n\n    # Which matches the sample.\n\n    # In the second sample input:\n\n    # n=6, x=7, a=[4,3,5,6,4,4], b=[8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\n    # Let's find s_min.\n\n    # For each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=7.\n\n    # Let's sort b: [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\n    # For a_i = 4: find the smallest b_j >= 3 (7-4=3). The first b_j >=3 is 3. So sum is 4+3=7.\n\n    # Similarly for other a_i's.\n\n    # So the minimal s_min is 7.\n\n    # Now compute max_pairs for s_min=7.\n\n    # a_sorted = [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n    # b_sorted = [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\n    # i=0 (3), j=5 (8): 3+8=11 >=7 → count=1, i=1, j=4 (6)\n    # a[1]=4 +6=10 >=7 → count=2, i=2, j=3 (4)\n    # a[2]=4 +4=8 >=7 → count=3, i=3, j=2 (4)\n    # a[3]=4 +4=8 >=7 → count=4, i=4, j=1 (3)\n    # a[4]=5 +3=8 >=7 → count=5, i=5, j=0 (0)\n    # a[5]=6 +0=6 <7 → i=6, loop ends.\n\n    # So max_pairs is 5. So worst_rank is 5, which matches the sample.\n\n    # So the formula seems to work.\n\n    # Now, putting it all together.\n\n    # So, the steps are:\n\n    # 1.

However, for each a_i, we might have multiple b_j's that equal to target.\n    # Wait, the above approach is not correct. Let me think again.\n    \n    # Actually, the number of participants is n. Each participant has a unique a_i and b_j? No, the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but the data is given in arbitrary order. So for each participant, their first tour score is a_i and second tour score is b_j, but the problem does not link them. However, in reality, each participant has exactly one a_i and one b_j. But for the problem, we are considering all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) as possible candidates for Vasya's scores. However, the actual participants are n in number, each with a_i and b_j. But the problem states that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but they are not linked. Therefore, when considering the possible other participants' total scores, we need to consider all possible pairs of (a_i, b_j), except for the one that is Vasya's. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because each participant has exactly one a and one b. But the problem allows us to choose any pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya, as long as there exists at least one such pair with sum >=x. However, when considering other participants, their scores are fixed. Wait, no. The problem is that the teacher has the list of all a_i (first tour scores) and all b_j (second tour scores), but doesn't know which a_i belongs to which b_j. So, for the purpose of calculating the worst possible rank, we need to assume that each participant has a unique a_i and b_j (but the pairing is unknown). But the problem allows us to arrange the pairings in any way that would lead to the worst possible rank for Vasya.\n\n    # However, the problem says that Vasya is present in the Olympiad, so there exists at least one i and j such that a_i + b_j >=x. But for the purposes of computing the worst possible rank, we can choose any pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya that satisfies a_i + b_j >=x, and then assume that the other participants are paired in a way that maximizes the number of participants with a higher or equal total.\n\n    # Therefore, to compute the worst possible rank, we should choose a pair (a_i, b_j) for Vasya with the minimal possible sum s (>=x), and then count how many participants can have a sum greater than s. Additionally, for those participants who have the same sum s, they can be placed before Vasya in the worst case.\n\n    # So, the steps are:\n    # 1. Find the minimal s >=x that can be formed by some a_i + b_j.\n    # 2. Count the number of pairs (a_p, b_q) where a_p + b_q > s. Let's call this count_gt.\n    # 3. Count the number of pairs (a_p, b_q) where a_p + b_q == s. Let's call this count_eq.\n    # 4. Then, the worst possible rank is count_gt + 1 (because all those with higher sum are before him, and in worst case, all with same sum are also before him).\n\n    # However, the problem is that the total number of participants is n, and each participant has exactly one a and one b. But in the current approach, we are counting all possible pairs (a_i, b_j), which is n^2 pairs. That's impossible for n=1e5.\n\n    # So this approach is not feasible. Need to find another way.\n\n    # Let me re-examine the problem statement. The note in the second example shows that for the worst case, the teacher can arrange the pairings of a and b such that Vasya's score is as low as possible, but others have higher or equal scores.\n\n    # Therefore, the worst case for Vasya is when his total is as low as possible (s_min), and the other participants are paired such that as many as possible have a higher or equal total.\n\n    # But how can we model this?\n\n    # Let's think differently. For the worst possible rank, we need to maximize the number of participants that have a total score >= s, where s is the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have (>=x).\n\n    # However, since the pairings are arbitrary, we can arrange the pairings such that for each participant, their a_i and b_j are chosen to maximize the number of participants with total >= s.\n\n    # To find the maximum number of participants that can have a total >= s, we can pair a_i with b_j in a way that maximizes the number of a_i + b_j >= s.\n\n    # But how?\n\n    # Let me think about this: To maximize the number of participants with total >= s, we can pair the largest a_i with the largest b_j, etc.\n\n    # Alternatively, for a given s, the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >= s can be found using a two-pointer approach.\n\n    # So, the plan is:\n\n    # 1. Find the minimal s such that there exists a_i + b_j >=x. Let's call this s_min.\n    # 2. For s_min, compute the maximum number of participants that can have a_i + b_j >= s_min. Let's call this max_count.\n    # 3. Then, the worst possible rank for Vasya is max_count + 1. Because in the worst case, all those max_count participants are placed before him, and he is placed after them.\n\n    # However, this approach may not be accurate. Let's see:\n\n    # Suppose s_min is the minimal sum that Vasya can have. Then, the maximum number of participants that can have a total >= s_min is max_count. Then, Vasya's rank could be as bad as max_count + 1. But if Vasya's sum is exactly s_min, and there are max_count participants with >= s_min, then his rank is max_count + 1.\n\n    # However, this requires that we can pair the a and b arrays to achieve this max_count. \n\n    # So, the steps for the worst case are:\n\n    # 1. Find s_min, the minimal possible sum >=x that Vasya can have.\n    # 2. Compute the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j >= s_min. This is done using two pointers.\n    # 3. The worst rank is this number + 1.\n\n    # Let's implement this.\n\n    # First, find s_min as before.\n\n    # Now, to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= s_min.\n\n    # To do this, we sort a in ascending order, and b in descending order. Then, use two pointers to count the maximum number of pairs.\n\n    # Wait, here's a standard approach for maximum number of pairs with sum >= target:\n\n    # Sort a in ascending order, b in ascending order. Then, use two pointers: i starts at 0 (beginning of a), j starts at n-1 (end of b). For each a[i], if a[i] + b[j] >= target, then we can take this pair, increment i and decrement j. Otherwise, increment i.\n\n    # This gives the maximum number of pairs with sum >= target.\n\n    # So let's implement this.\n\n    # So, here's the plan:\n\n    # After finding s_min, sort a and b in ascending order.\n\n    # Use two pointers to count the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >= s_min.\n\n    # This count is max_pairs.\n\n    # Then, the worst possible rank is max_pairs + 1.\n\n    # Wait, but why? Because if there are max_pairs participants with sum >= s_min, then Vasya could be one of them. In the worst case, all those max_pairs participants are placed before him, making his rank max_pairs + 1.\n\n    # However, if Vasya is part of the max_pairs, then the actual number of participants with sum >= s_min is max_pairs, including Vasya. So the worst rank would be max_pairs (if all others are placed before him) or max_pairs + 1? No, it depends.\n\n    # Let me think: suppose that the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= s_min is m. Then, if Vasya is one of them, then there are m participants with sum >= s_min. The worst case is that all of them are placed before him, so his rank is m + 1. But that's only if m participants have sum >= s_min, and Vasya is one of them.\n\n    # However, the way we compute m is the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >= s_min. So in this scenario, Vasya's pair is included in those m pairs. Thus, the worst possible rank is m + 1?\n\n    # Or is it m? Because if there are m participants with sum >= s_min, then the worst possible rank is m if Vasya is placed last among them. But the problem says that when participants have the same sum, the jury can assign the ranks in any way. So, if there are m participants with sum >= s_min, and Vasya is one of them, the worst possible rank is m.\n\n    # Wait, this is getting complicated. Let's take an example.\n\n    # Example 1:\n\n    # All participants have a_i = 1 and b_j = 1. x = 2. s_min is 2.\n\n    # The maximum number of pairs with sum >= 2 is 5 (all of them). So the worst possible rank would be 5, which matches the sample output.\n\n    # Another example: if there are 3 participants with sum >= s_min (say 3), then the worst possible rank is 3 (if they are all placed before him).\n\n    # So the formula is: worst_rank = max_pairs.\n\n    # So the previous approach was incorrect. The worst_rank is max_pairs.\n\n    # So the steps are:\n\n    # 1. Find s_min (the minimal sum that Vasya can have >=x).\n    # 2. Compute max_pairs, the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= s_min.\n    # 3. The worst possible rank is max_pairs.\n\n    # But how to compute max_pairs?\n\n    # Let's proceed with the two-pointer approach.\n\n    # So, the code for max_pairs:\n\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n\n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    max_pairs = 0\n\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] >= s_min:\n            max_pairs += 1\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n\n    # This will give the maximum number of pairs with sum >= s_min.\n\n    # So the worst possible rank is max_pairs.\n\n    # However, in the first sample input:\n\n    # n=5, x=2, a=[1,1,1,1,1], b=[1,1,1,1,1]\n\n    # s_min is 2.\n\n    # max_pairs is 5 (each pair adds to 2). So worst_rank is 5.\n\n    # Which matches the sample.\n\n    # In the second sample input:\n\n    # n=6, x=7, a=[4,3,5,6,4,4], b=[8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\n    # Let's find s_min.\n\n    # For each a_i, find the smallest b_j such that a_i + b_j >=7.\n\n    # Let's sort b: [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\n    # For a_i = 4: find the smallest b_j >= 3 (7-4=3). The first b_j >=3 is 3. So sum is 4+3=7.\n\n    # Similarly for other a_i's.\n\n    # So the minimal s_min is 7.\n\n    # Now compute max_pairs for s_min=7.\n\n    # a_sorted = [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n    # b_sorted = [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\n    # i=0 (3), j=5 (8): 3+8=11 >=7 → count=1, i=1, j=4 (6)\n    # a[1]=4 +6=10 >=7 → count=2, i=2, j=3 (4)\n    # a[2]=4 +4=8 >=7 → count=3, i=3, j=2 (4)\n    # a[3]=4 +4=8 >=7 → count=4, i=4, j=1 (3)\n    # a[4]=5 +3=8 >=7 → count=5, i=5, j=0 (0)\n    # a[5]=6 +0=6 <7 → i=6, loop ends.\n\n    # So max_pairs is 5.
