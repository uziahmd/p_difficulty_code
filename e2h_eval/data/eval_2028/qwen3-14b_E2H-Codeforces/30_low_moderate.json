Before each turn players determine who will make the next move. Each player should make exactly n moves. On it's turn i-th player takes the leftmost digit of A and appends it to his or her number Si. After that this leftmost digit is erased from A. Initially the numbers of both players (S1 and S2) are «empty». Leading zeroes in numbers A, S1, S2 are allowed. In the end of the game the first player gets S1 dollars, and the second gets S2 dollars.One day Homer and Marge came to play the game. They managed to know the number A beforehand. They want to find such sequence of their moves that both of them makes exactly n moves and which maximizes their total prize. Help them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 18). The second line contains integer A consisting of exactly 2n digits. This number can have leading zeroes.\n\n## Output\nOutput the line of 2n characters «H» and «M» — the sequence of moves of Homer and Marge, which gives them maximum possible total prize. Each player must make exactly n moves. If there are several solutions, output any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2\\n1234', '2\\n9911']\n\n### Output\n['HHMM', 'HMHM']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo the problem is about Homer and Marge playing a game where they take digits from a number A. The number A has 2n digits. Each player takes turns taking the leftmost digit, appending it to their own number. Each makes exactly n moves. The goal is to maximize the total sum of S1 (Homer's number) and S2 (Marge's number). And I have to output the sequence of moves (H or M) that achieves this maximum total. If there are multiple solutions, any is acceptable.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to find the optimal sequence of choices between Homer and Marge, such that when they take digits, the total of their numbers is maximized. But how do I model this?\n\nLet me think about the approach. Since n can be up to 18, which makes 2n=36 digits. The total number of possible sequences is C(2n, n), which for n=18 is 36 choose 18 = around 9 billion. That's way too big for a brute-force approach. So we need a dynamic programming approach here.\n\nWait, but what's the state here? Let's think: At any point in time, the number of digits taken by Homer and Marge depends on how many moves each has made. For example, suppose after some steps, Homer has taken h moves, and Marge has taken m moves. Since the total moves is h + m = k, where k ranges from 0 to 2n. But since each must take exactly n moves, the state can be represented by the number of moves each has made so far. However, since the total moves is h + m, and each can't exceed n, the state is (h, m), but since h + m = current step count, maybe it's sufficient to track h and m, but given that h + m = k, perhaps we can represent the state as (h, m) where h is the number of moves Homer has made, m is the number of moves Marge has made. But since each move is either H or M, the state transitions would be based on choosing H or M, provided that the counts don't exceed n.\n\nBut the key thing is that for each state (h, m), we can decide whether to take H or M next. However, the decision depends on which choice leads to a higher total sum. But how do we compute that?\n\nBut the problem is that the digits are being taken from the front of A. So, the current position in A depends on how many digits have been taken so far. For example, if h + m digits have been taken, then the next digit to take is the (h + m + 1)-th digit of the original A.\n\nSo, the state for dynamic programming would be (h, m) — the number of moves Homer and Marge have made so far. The current position in the string A is h + m digits into the string. Because each move takes one digit from the front. So, for example, if the original A is \"1234\", and after two moves, the first two digits have been taken, so the remaining digits are \"34\".\n\nSo, for each state (h, m), the next digit is at position (h + m) in the original string. Then, when we choose to take H or M, we add that digit to their respective numbers. But how do we compute the total sum?\n\nWait, the total sum is the value of S1 plus the value of S2. But S1 is the number formed by the digits that Homer took, and similarly for S2. However, since each digit is added to the end of their respective numbers, the value of S1 is the sum of digit_i * 10^{n - 1 - pos}, where pos is the order in which Homer took the digits. Wait, but the digits are added in order. For example, if Homer takes digits in order d1, d2, ..., dn, then S1 is d1 * 10^{n-1} + d2 * 10^{n-2} + ... + dn * 10^0.\n\nBut when building the DP, how do we track the contribution of each digit to the total sum? Because the position of the digit in the player's number affects its value. For example, if Homer takes a digit early in his sequence, it contributes more to the total than a digit taken later.\n\nThis complicates things because the DP state would need to track not only how many digits each has taken, but also the current value of their numbers. However, with n up to 18, the numbers can be up to 1e18, which is way too big to track in the DP state.\n\nSo,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the optimal sequence of moves for Homer and Marge such that the sum of their numbers is maximized. The challenge lies in efficiently exploring the possible sequences of moves given the constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) with Memoization**: We use a memoization-based approach to explore all possible sequences of moves while keeping track of the maximum total sum achievable from each state.\n2. **State Representation**: The state is represented by the number of moves each player has made so far (Homer's moves `h` and Marge's moves `m`). The current position in the string A can be derived as `h + m`.\n3. **Recursive Decision Making**: For each state, we decide whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit based on which choice leads to a higher total sum. This decision is made recursively, with memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n4. **Memoization Cache**: We use a dictionary to cache results of subproblems to optimize performance.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport functools\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    length = 2 * n\n\n    # Precompute the digits as integers\n    digits = [int(c) for c in A]\n\n    @functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)\n    def dp(h, m):\n        # Current position in the digits array\n        pos = h + m\n        if h == n and m == n:\n            return (0, \"\")\n        # Determine who can move next\n        # Homer can move if h < n\n        # Marge can move if m < n\n        options = []\n        if h < n:\n            # Homer takes the next digit\n            digit = digits[pos]\n            next_h = h + 1\n            next_m = m\n            # Calculate the contribution to the total sum\n            # The digit is added to Homer's number, which will be multiplied by 10^(n - next_h) when the number is formed\n            # But since we are maximizing the sum, we can think of the contribution as digit * 10^{(n - next_h)} + ... etc.\n            # However, since the actual value depends on future digits, we need to track the current contribution\n            # But since we can't track the exact value due to size, we instead consider the future choices recursively\n            # So, the contribution of this digit to the total is digit * (10 ** (n - next_h)) + ...

It uses memoization to avoid redundant calculations.\n- **Recursive Decision Making**: At each step, the function decides whether Homer or Marge should take the next digit based on which choice leads to a higher total sum. The contribution of each digit to the total sum is calculated considering its position in the respective player's number.\n- **Efficiency**: By using memoization and considering the constraints (n up to 18), the solution efficiently explores all possible sequences of moves without redundant computations, ensuring optimal performance.",
