Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the task is to process a string S that's being built step by step by appending 0s and 1s. After each addition, we need to find the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code. But there are some forbidden Morse codes: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So any substring that matches one of these four is invalid and shouldn't be counted.\n\nHmm. The key here is that each valid Morse code string (of length 1-4, not in the forbidden list) represents a unique letter. So for every substring of S, we need to check if it's a valid Morse code. But since the same Morse code can appear multiple times as substrings, each occurrence counts as a separate sequence. For example, if the string is \"11\", then the substrings \"1\" (twice) and \"11\" (once). Each of those that are valid contributes to the count.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently? Because for each step, the string grows by one character, and we need to consider all possible substrings ending at the current position. Because m can be up to 3000, a brute-force approach checking all substrings after each step would be O(m^2) in the worst case, which for m=3000 would be around 9 million operations. That's manageable, but we need to optimize the checking part.\n\nLet me think: for each new character added, we can look back and consider all possible substrings that end at the current position. For example, when the string is length k, after adding the k-th character, we can check substrings of length 1, 2, 3, 4 that end at position k. Because any longer substring would have been considered in previous steps.\n\nWait, but the total number of possible substrings to check for each step is up to 4. Because for each step, the new character can form substrings of length 1, 2, 3, 4 ending at that position. So for each step, we can check those 4 possibilities. If the substring is longer than 4, then we can't consider it because Morse codes are only up to 4 characters long. So, for example, when the string is of length 5, the new character added can be part of substrings of length 1 (the last character), 2 (last two), 3 (last three), 4 (last four). Any longer substrings would have their start before the previous steps.\n\nSo the idea is: after each step, for the current string S, we look at all possible substrings ending at the current position with lengths 1 to 4 (but not exceeding the length of S). For each such substring, we check if it is a valid Morse code (i.e., not in the forbidden list and has length between 1 and 4). For each valid substring, we add 1 to the total count. But wait, how do we account for overlapping possibilities?\n\nWait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So each valid substring contributes exactly one to the count. However, different substrings can represent the same Morse code, but they are considered as separate sequences. For example, if the string is \"11\", then the first '1' is a valid code, the second '1' is also valid, and the substring \"11\" is also valid. So the total count would be 3.\n\nSo the approach is to track, after each step, the number of valid substrings in the entire string. But how to compute this incrementally?\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Suppose that after each step, we can keep track of the number of valid substrings. When we add a new character, we can check for all possible substrings ending at this new position. For each of these substrings (length 1-4), we check if they are valid. Then, the total count increases by the number of valid substrings found in this step.\n\nBut how do we check those substrings? For example, when adding the i-th character, we can check the last 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters. Let's see:\n\nFor example, for the current string S of length l, after adding the new character, the length is l+1. For the new position (l+1), check substrings of length 1 (S[-1:]), length 2 (S[-2:]), etc., up to 4, but only if the length allows. For each of these substrings, check if they are valid. Each valid one contributes 1 to the total.\n\nBut the problem is that the same substring can be counted multiple times. Wait, no. Each valid substring is counted once for each occurrence in the entire string. So, for example, if S is \"111\", then the substrings are:\n\nLength 1: \"1\" (positions 1, 2, 3)\nLength 2: \"11\" (positions 1-2, 2-3)\nLength 3: \"111\" (positions 1-3)\nEach of these is a valid code (assuming none are forbidden). So the total count is 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. But according to the sample input, when S is \"111\", the answer is 7. Wait, the sample says after 3 steps, the output is 7. Let me check:\n\nIn the first sample input, after 3 steps, S is \"111\". The sample explanation lists 7 sequences. Let me count:\n\nThe substrings:\n\nAll possible substrings:\n\nLength 1: 3 substrings (\"1\", \"1\", \"1\") → each valid → 3.\n\nLength 2: \"11\" (positions 1-2), \"11\" (positions 2-3) → each valid → 2.\n\nLength 3: \"111\" → valid → 1.\n\nTotal is 3+2+1=6. But the sample says 7. Oh, wait, the sample explanation lists 7 entries. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\nThe sequences are:\n\n\"T\" (1), \"M\" (11), \"O\" (111), \"TT\" (11), \"TM\" (111), \"MT\" (111), \"TTT\" (111). That's 7. So how does that map to the substrings?\n\nAh, because each occurrence of a valid Morse code is considered as a separate sequence. So the substrings are:\n\nEach occurrence of a valid code is counted as a separate sequence. For example, the substring \"1\" (first character) is one sequence. The same code \"1\" again (second character) is another. So the count is the number of valid substrings, not the number of distinct Morse codes.\n\nSo for the sample, the total number of valid substrings is 3 (from length 1) + 2 (from length 2) + 1 (from length 3) = 6. But sample says 7. Wait, what's the discrepancy here?\n\nWait the sample explanation lists 7 sequences, but according to the substrings, why?\n\nWait maybe I'm missing some substrings. Let me list all possible substrings of \"111\".\n\nAll possible substrings:\n\nPositions 1: \"1\"\n\nPositions 2: \"1\"\n\nPositions 3: \"1\"\n\nPositions 1-2: \"11\"\n\nPositions 1-3: \"111\"\n\nPositions 2-3: \"11\"\n\nSo that's 3+2+1=6 substrings. But according to the sample explanation, there are 7 sequences. Oh, wait! Oh, the sample explanation includes sequences of multiple letters. For example, \"TT\" is two letters, which corresponds to the substring \"11\" (since each T is \"1\"). But the substring \"11\" is considered as a single sequence (the code for M) but also as two Ts. Wait, no. Wait the problem says that each sequence of letters is represented by some substring of S in Morse code. So, for example, the sequence \"TT\" is represented by the substring \"11\", which is the code for M. But according to the problem statement, the sequences of letters are the ones that correspond to some substring. So each substring that is a valid code contributes exactly one sequence. But the sample explanation seems to count both the individual letters and the combinations. So why is the count 7?\n\nWait in the sample explanation, they list:\n\n\"T\" (code 1) → 1\n\n\"M\" (code 11) → 1\n\n\"O\" (code 111) → 1\n\n\"TT\" (code 11) → 1\n\n\"TM\" (code 111) → 1\n\n\"MT\" (code 111) → 1\n\n\"TTT\" (code 111) → 1\n\nThat's 7 entries. But according to the substrings, the code \"11\" appears twice (positions 1-2 and 2-3). So each of those is a separate occurrence of the code \"11\" (which is M). But according to the problem, each occurrence is counted as a separate sequence. Wait, but the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So each valid substring is a sequence of letters. For example, the substring \"1\" is a single letter. The substring \"11\" is a single letter (M), but also, the sequence of two letters T and T would be represented by the same code. However, the problem says that each sequence of letters is represented by some substring. So the way the problem counts is that each valid substring corresponds to exactly one sequence of letters. So for example, the substring \"11\" can be interpreted as a single letter (M), or as two Ts (each T is \"1\"). But according to the problem statement, the mapping is that each Morse code string (valid) corresponds to exactly one letter. Therefore, the sequences of letters are determined by the Morse code strings. So the sequence \"TT\" is a sequence of two letters, which would correspond to the concatenation of their Morse codes, which is \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\". However, the substring \"11\" is a valid code (M), so the sequence \"TT\" is not considered here. Because the problem says that each sequence of letters is represented by a substring. So for example, the sequence \"TT\" would correspond to the Morse code \"11\", which is a valid code. But that code is already used for the letter M. However, the problem says that each Morse code string (except forbidden) corresponds to exactly one letter. Therefore, the sequence of letters must be such that their concatenated Morse codes form a substring of S. Therefore, the problem is not about splitting the substring into parts, but about considering each substring as a single Morse code. Thus, the count is the number of valid substrings, each of which represents a single letter. So the sample explanation seems to have a misunderstanding. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the note says: \"All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code.\" So for example, the substring \"11\" can be considered as either the letter M (if it's a single letter) or as two Ts (if the sequence is two letters). But according to the problem's note, the answer counts all possible sequences. How?\n\nAh, no. Wait the problem says that the sequences of letters are represented with some substring of S. So for example, the sequence \"T\" is represented by the substring \"1\". The sequence \"TT\" is represented by the substring \"11\". The sequence \"TM\" is represented by the substring \"111\" (since T is \"1\", M is \"11\", concatenated as \"1\"+\"11\" = \"111\"). But the substring \"111\" is also the code for O. So each occurrence of a valid substring is considered as a single letter (the one corresponding to its code) or as a sequence of letters whose codes concatenate to that substring. But how does that work?\n\nWait no. The problem statement says that each letter is represented as a Morse code. So a sequence of letters would be represented by the concatenation of their Morse codes. For example, the sequence \"TT\" would be represented by the Morse code \"1\"+\"1\" = \"11\". Therefore, the substring \"11\" can represent two different sequences: either the single letter M, or the two-letter sequence TT. However, according to the problem statement, the question is to count all possible non-empty sequences of letters that can be represented by some substring of S. So for each substring of S that is a valid Morse code (i.e., not forbidden), it can be interpreted as a single letter, and also as sequences of letters whose concatenated codes form that substring. But how do you count all possibilities?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, the note in the problem says that for the sample input, after S is \"111\", the answer is 7. According to the note, the sequences are:\n\nT (code 1)\n\nM (code 11)\n\nO (code 111)\n\nTT (code 11)\n\nTM (code 111)\n\nMT (code 111)\n\nTTT (code 111)\n\nSo the count is 7. But according to this, each valid substring contributes multiple sequences. For example, the substring \"11\" (which is valid) can be interpreted as the single letter M (counted once) or as two Ts (counted once). Similarly, the substring \"111\" can be interpreted as O (single letter), TM, MT, TTT (three sequences). So each valid substring contributes multiple sequences, depending on how it can be split into valid Morse codes.\n\nBut that changes everything. Now the problem becomes more complex than just counting the number of valid substrings. Because each valid substring can be split into multiple ways into sequences of letters, and each of those splits contributes to the count.\n\nSo the original understanding was incorrect. The actual problem requires us to count all possible sequences of letters whose concatenated Morse codes form a substring of S. For example, the substring \"11\" can be split as \"1\" + \"1\" (two letters) or as \"11\" (one letter). So each of these splits contributes to the count. Therefore, the total number of sequences is the number of ways to split all possible substrings into valid Morse codes.\n\nThis makes the problem significantly more challenging.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each substring of S, compute the number of ways to split it into valid Morse codes (each part is a valid code, i.e., not forbidden and length 1-4). Then sum all these numbers across all substrings.\n\nFor example, the sample input where S is \"111\". Let's take all substrings:\n\nSubstring \"1\": can be split as [1] → 1 way.\n\nSubstring \"1\" (second character): same → 1 way.\n\nSubstring \"1\" (third character): same → 1 way.\n\nSubstring \"11\": can be split as [11] (1 way) or [1, 1] (another way). Total 2 ways.\n\nSubstring \"11\" (second and third characters): same as above, 2 ways.\n\nSubstring \"111\": can be split as [111] (1 way), [1, 11] (1 way), [11, 1] (another way), [1, 1, 1] (another way). Total 4 ways.\n\nThen, the sum is 3*1 + 2*2 + 1*4 = 3 +4 +4 = 11? But according to the sample explanation, the answer is 7. Hmm, this suggests that my understanding is still incorrect.\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the answer is 7. So perhaps my analysis is wrong. Let's re-examine the note.\n\nThe note says that for S = \"111\", the sequences are:\n\nT (code 1) → one way.\n\nM (code 11) → one way.\n\nO (code 111) → one way.\n\nTT (code 11) → one way.\n\nTM (code 111) → one way.\n\nMT (code 111) → one way.\n\nTTT (code 111) → one way.\n\nTotal of 7. So how does that align with the substrings?\n\nEach of these sequences corresponds to a certain way of splitting a substring into Morse codes. For example:\n\n- The sequence T (one letter) corresponds to the substring \"1\" (split as [1]).\n\n- The sequence M (one letter) corresponds to the substring \"11\" (split as [11]).\n\n- The sequence O (one letter) corresponds to the substring \"111\" (split as [111]).\n\n- The sequence TT (two letters) corresponds to the substring \"11\" (split as [1, 1]).\n\n- The sequence TM (two letters) corresponds to the substring \"111\" (split as [1, 11]).\n\n- The sequence MT (two letters) corresponds to the substring \"111\" (split as [11, 1]).\n\n- The sequence TTT (three letters) corresponds to the substring \"111\" (split as [1, 1, 1]).\n\nSo the total number of sequences is 7. Which suggests that each valid split of a substring into valid Morse codes contributes exactly one to the count. So the problem is to count, for all substrings of S, the number of ways to split them into valid Morse codes (each part is a valid code, i.e., not forbidden and length between 1 and 4).\n\nTherefore, the problem is similar to the classic \"number of ways to decode a string\" problem, but applied to all substrings of S.\n\nSo the approach now is: for each substring of S, compute the number of ways to split it into valid Morse codes, and sum all these numbers across all substrings.\n\nThis complicates things, but perhaps we can model it with dynamic programming.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. For the entire string S, the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible substrings of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse codes.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me consider that for each position i in the string S, we can track the number of ways to split the substring ending at i. But since we have to consider all substrings, perhaps we can use dynamic programming for each possible substring.\n\nAlternatively, for each step, when we append a new character to S, we can compute the new contributions to the total count. This seems promising.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming. Let's define dp[i] as the number of ways to split the first i characters of S into valid Morse codes. Then, the total number of sequences for the entire string would be the sum of dp[i] for all i from 1 to len(S). But wait, no. Because dp[i] counts the number of ways to split the entire first i characters. However, the problem requires considering all possible substrings. So this approach might not directly help.\n\nBut perhaps, for each position j in the string, we can track the number of ways to split the substring ending at j, of various lengths. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose that for each position i in S (after adding the i-th character), we want to calculate the number of ways to split all substrings that end at i. For example, for the current character, the substrings ending at i could be of length 1, 2, 3, or 4 (if possible). For each of these lengths l (1<=l<=4), we can check if the substring of length l ending at i is a valid Morse code. If it is, then the number of ways to split that substring is equal to 1 (if l is 1) plus the sum of the ways to split the previous parts. Wait, this sounds like the standard decoding problem.\n\nFor example, let's say we have a substring ending at position i with length l. Let's denote this substring as s. If s is valid, then the number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring s[0..i-l] (if any) multiplied by 1 (since s is a valid code). But since we're considering substrings, not the entire string, perhaps we need to track for each possible end position and for each possible length, the number of ways to split that particular substring.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps we can use a dynamic programming approach where for each position i, we track the number of ways to split all substrings ending at i.\n\nLet me formalize this. Let's define dp[i] as the total number of ways to split all substrings that end at position i. Then, for each i, we can look back up to 4 positions (since the maximum length of a valid Morse code is 4). For each possible length l (1 to 4), if the substring ending at i with length l is valid, then the number of ways to split that substring is equal to 1 (if l=1) plus the sum of the ways to split the substrings that end at i-l and have certain lengths. Wait, no. For example, if the current substring is of length l, then it can be split into the current code (valid) and any splits of the preceding part. But the preceding part is the substring ending at i-l. So for example, if the current substring is of length l, then the number of ways for this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i-l (if any) plus 1 (if the current code is valid and l=1). No, that's not correct.\n\nActually, the number of ways to split the substring ending at i with length l is equal to the number of ways to split the substring up to i - l, and then add the current code. For example, if the substring of length l is valid, then the number of ways for that substring is equal to the number of ways to split the part before it (i-l) plus 1 (if there's no part before it). Wait, this is similar to the standard decoding problem where dp[i] represents the number of ways to decode the first i characters. In that case, dp[i] = dp[i-1] * (if the current single digit is valid) + dp[i-2] * (if the current two digits are valid).\n\nSo for our problem, for each position i, we can compute the number of ways to split the entire string up to i. But we need to sum all possible substrings, not just the entire string. However, perhaps we can find a way to accumulate the total number of sequences by maintaining a running total.\n\nLet me think again. For the entire string S, the total number of sequences is the sum for all substrings s of S of the number of ways to split s into valid Morse codes.\n\nNow, suppose that after adding the i-th character, we want to calculate the contribution of all new substrings that end at i. These substrings can be of length 1, 2, 3, or 4. For each of these lengths l (1<=l<=4), if the substring s of length l ending at i is valid, then the number of ways to split s is equal to the number of ways to split the part before s (i.e., the substring ending at i-l) multiplied by 1 (for the current code). However, if the part before s is empty (i.e., l = i), then it's 1 way (the current code itself). \n\nSo, for example, if we have a substring s of length l ending at position i, and it's valid, then the number of ways for this substring is dp_prev, where dp_prev is the number of ways to split the substring ending at i-l. But since we need to consider all possible substrings, not just the entire string, perhaps we need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, for each position i, we can track for all possible lengths l (up to 4) the number of ways to split the substring ending at i of length l. Let's define a dp array where dp[i][l] is the number of ways to split the substring ending at position i with length l. But since l can be up to 4, this is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps even better: for each position i, we can compute the number of ways to split all substrings ending at i. Let's define a variable ways[i], which is the total number of ways for all substrings ending at i. To compute ways[i], we can look back at the previous positions. For example, for the current position i, we can check all possible l (1-4), and for each l, if the substring of length l ending at i is valid, then the number of ways for that substring is 1 (if l=1) or the sum of the ways for the previous positions. Wait, no. For example, if the substring of length l is valid, then the number of ways to split it is equal to the number of ways to split the substring that ends at i-l (if any) plus 1 (if l=1). Or more accurately, if the current substring of length l is valid, then the number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the substring ending at i-l (call it prev_ways) plus 1 if there's no previous part. Wait, I think this is similar to the standard decoding problem.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the current substring is of length l. If l=1, then it's valid, so the number of ways is 1 (just itself). If l=2, and the substring is valid, then the number of ways is the number of ways to split the substring ending at i-2 (if any) plus 1 (if the entire substring is considered as a single code). Wait, no. For example, the substring of length 2 can be split as a single code (if valid) or as two single codes (if each is valid). But the number of ways for the substring is the sum of the possibilities. \n\nWait, no. The number of ways to split the substring of length l is the sum of the possibilities. For example, if the substring is of length 2 and valid, then the number of ways is:\n\n- 1 way (split as the entire code) plus the number of ways to split the first character (if it's valid) multiplied by the number of ways to split the second character (if valid). Wait, no. Because splitting into two parts would require that the first part is a valid code and the second part is a valid code. So the total number of ways for the substring of length l is equal to the sum of the ways to split the first part (of length k) multiplied by the ways to split the remaining part (of length l -k), for all valid k.\n\nBut this seems recursive and complicated. However, for our problem, the maximum length of the code is 4. So for each possible l (1-4), we can check if the current substring of length l is valid. If it is, then the number of ways for this substring is equal to 1 (if l is 1) plus the sum of the ways for the previous substrings that can be combined with this current code.\n\nAlternatively, using dynamic programming where dp[i] is the total number of ways to split all substrings ending at position i. Then, for each i, we can look back up to 4 positions and see if the current substring is valid. If it is, then we add to dp[i] the value of dp[i-l] (if i-l >=0) plus 1 (if i-l is 0, meaning the substring starts at the beginning).\n\nWait, let's think of dp[i] as the total number of ways to split all substrings that end at position i. Then, for each i, we can consider all possible l (1-4) such that the substring of length l ending at i is valid. For each such l, the number of ways contributed by this substring is equal to (dp[i-l] + 1) if i-l is 0 (meaning the entire substring is from 1 to i). Or more accurately, if the substring of length l is valid, then the number of ways to split this substring is equal to the number of ways to split the part before it (i-l) plus 1. Wait, no. The number of ways to split the substring of length l ending at i is equal to the number of ways to split the part before the current code (i-l) multiplied by 1 (since the current code is valid). For example, if there are x ways to split the part before, then adding the current code gives x ways. Additionally, if the current code is valid and the part before is empty (i-l =0), then there is 1 way (the current code itself). \n\nSo, for each l in 1-4, if the current substring of length l is valid, then the contribution to dp[i] is (dp[i-l] if i-l >=0 else 1). \n\nBut dp[i] represents the total number of ways for all substrings ending at i. So for each valid l, we add the contribution of the substring of length l ending at i. \n\nThis seems promising. Let's formalize this.\n\nLet dp[i] be the total number of ways to split all substrings ending at position i. Initially, dp[0] = 0 (assuming positions start at 1). For each i from 1 to m:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{l=1 to 4} [ (if substring ending at i of length l is valid) then (dp[i-l] if i-l >=0 else 1) ]\n\nBut then, the total answer after each step is the sum of dp[1], dp[2], ..., dp[i].\n\nBecause dp[i] represents the total number of ways for all substrings ending at position i. So for example, when i=3 and the string is \"111\", dp[3] would be the sum of the contributions from substrings of length 1, 2, 3 ending at 3. Each of those substrings contributes their own number of ways.\n\nLet's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: m=3, and the string is \"111\".\n\nLet's compute dp step by step.\n\nInitially, dp[0] = 0.\n\nStep 1: append '1', so S is \"1\".\n\ni=1:\n\nCheck l=1: substring \"1\" is valid. Since i-l = 0, contribution is 1. So dp[1] = 1.\n\nTotal sum is 1 → matches the first line of the sample output.\n\nStep 2: append '1', S is \"11\".\n\ni=2:\n\nCheck l=1: substring \"1\" (last character) is valid. i-l = 2-1=1 ≥0. dp[1] = 1. So contribution is 1.\n\nCheck l=2: substring \"11\" is valid. i-l = 0 → contribution is 1. So total dp[2] = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nTotal sum is 1 (dp[1]) + 2 (dp[2]) = 3 → matches the second line of the sample output.\n\nStep 3: append '1', S is \"111\".\n\ni=3:\n\nCheck l=1: substring \"1\" → valid. i-l = 3-1=2. dp[2] = 2 → contribution 2.\n\nCheck l=2: substring \"11\" (positions 2-3) → valid. i-l = 3-2=1. dp[1] = 1 → contribution 1.\n\nCheck l=3: substring \"111\" → valid. i-l = 0 → contribution 1.\n\nSo dp[3] = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.\n\nTotal sum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 → which matches the sample output of 7. So this seems correct.\n\nYes! So the approach is:\n\n- Maintain a dp array where dp[i] is the total number of ways for all substrings ending at position i.\n\n- For each new character added (i-th position), check for l=1 to 4 whether the substring of length l ending at i is valid. For each such l, add (dp[i-l] if i-l >=0 else 1) to dp[i].\n\n- The total answer after each step is the sum of dp[1] to dp[i].\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nBut how to check if the substring of length l ending at i is valid. We need to store the current string S as we build it. For each step, we can build the string, and for each l in 1-4, check if the last l characters form a valid code.\n\nBut since the forbidden codes are known, we can precompute a set of forbidden strings. The forbidden strings are \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\". So for any substring of length 1-4, if it is not in the forbidden set, it is valid.\n\nWait, but the valid codes are those of length 1-4, not in the forbidden list. So for example, a substring of length 5 is not considered. But since we are checking l=1-4, we can safely check.\n\nSo for each l in 1-4, if the current length of S is >= l, then take the last l characters, check if it's in the forbidden set. If not, then it's valid.\n\nThus, during processing, for each i-th step (i ranges from 1 to m), we have a string S of length i. For each l in 1-4, if i >= l, we check the substring S[i-l:i] (assuming 0-based or 1-based indices). For example, in Python, S is built as a list, and for the current i-th character (after appending), the current string is S[:i]. So for l in 1-4, if i >= l, then the substring is S[i-l:i].\n\nOnce we have that, we can check if the substring is in the forbidden set. If it is not, then it's valid, and we can add the contribution to dp[i].\n\nNow, the problem requires that after each modification, we output the total sum of dp[1] to dp[i].\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the forbidden set as a set of strings.\n\n- Initialize a dp array, with dp[0] = 0.\n\n- For each step from 1 to m:\n\n   - Append the new character (0 or 1) to the current string.\n\n   - Initialize dp[i] = 0.\n\n   - For l in 1 to 4:\n\n      - if i >= l:\n\n         - substr = current string's last l characters (i-l to i)\n\n         - if substr not in forbidden:\n\n             - if i - l >= 0:\n\n                 - dp[i] += dp[i - l]\n\n             - else:\n\n                 - dp[i] += 1\n\n             - take modulo 1e9+7.\n\n   - After computing dp[i], compute the total sum as sum(dp[1..i]) mod MOD.\n\n   - Output this total sum.\n\nBut wait, for each step, the current string is of length i. So for i-th step (1-based?), yes.\n\nBut how to manage the current string? We can build it as a list, appending each character as we go.\n\nNow, considering that m can be up to 3000, and for each step, we check up to 4 possibilities, this would be O(4m) operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for each l, we need to get the substring of length l ending at current position. For example, in Python, if S is a list, then for step i (current length is i), the substring for l is ''.join(S[i-l:i]).\n\nBut for m=3000, this is manageable.\n\nNow, the forbidden set is {'0011', '0101', '1110', '1111'}.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead m, then read m lines of '0' or '1'.\n\nInitialize S as a list.\n\nInitialize dp as a list of size m+1 (since steps are 1-based?), with dp[0] = 0.\n\ntotal_sum is initially 0.\n\nFor each step from 1 to m:\n\n   append the current character to S.\n\n   current_dp = 0\n\n   for l in 1..4:\n\n       if len(S) >= l:\n\n           substr = ''.join(S[-l:])  # last l characters\n\n           if substr not in forbidden:\n\n               if (i - l) >= 0:\n\n                   current_dp += dp[i - l]\n\n               else:\n\n                   current_dp += 1\n\n               current_dp %= MOD\n\n   dp[i] = current_dp\n\n   total_sum += dp[i]\n\n   total_sum %= MOD\n\n   print(total_sum)\n\nWait, but the i-th step corresponds to the current length being i. So for the first step, i=1, and the current string has length 1.\n\nBut in the code above, for the i-th step, the current string is of length i. So for each l in 1..4, we check if i >= l. Then, substr is the last l characters.\n\nBut in Python, for S being a list, S[-l:] would give the last l elements.\n\nBut for example, when i=3 and l=3, S[-3:] is the entire string.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nMOD = 10**",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing string in Morse code. Each modification to the string appends either a dot ('0') or a dash ('1'), and after each modification, we must compute the count of valid Morse code sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Forbidden Morse Codes**: There are four specific Morse code strings that are invalid: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**: Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the total number of valid sequences ending at the i-th position of the string.\n3. **Substring Validity Check**: For each new character added to the string, check all possible substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at the current position. If a substring is valid (i.e., not in the forbidden set), update the DP array accordingly.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, use modulo $10^9 + 7$ to keep numbers manageable.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    commands = input[1:m+1]\n    \n    forbidden = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    \n    S = []\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)  # dp[0] is unused\n    total = 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        S.append(commands[i-1])\n        current_dp = 0\n        for l in range(1, 5):\n            if i >= l:\n                substr = ''.join(S[-l:])\n                if substr not in forbidden:\n                    if i - l >= 0:\n                        current_dp += dp[i - l]\n                    else:\n                        current_dp += 1\n                    current_dp %= MOD\n        dp[i] = current_dp\n        total = (total + current_dp) % MOD\n        print(total)\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations `m` and the sequence of operations.\n2. **Forbidden Set**: A set of invalid Morse codes is defined for quick lookup.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array tracks the number of valid sequences ending at each position. For each new character added to the string, we check all possible substrings of lengths 1 to 4 ending at that position.\n4. **Substring Validity Check**: For each valid substring (not in the forbidden set), we update the DP value based on previous valid sequences.\n5. **Total Count**: After processing each character, the total number of valid sequences is updated and printed modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required counts using dynamic programming and ensures that we handle large numbers using modulo operations, providing an optimal solution for the given constraints.",
