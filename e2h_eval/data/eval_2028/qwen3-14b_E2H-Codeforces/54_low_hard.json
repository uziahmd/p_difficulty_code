Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about finding three vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand how the angles in a regular polygon work. Let me think. In a regular n-gon, each interior angle is (n-2)*180/n degrees. But wait, that's the angle of the polygon itself. However, the problem here is about angles formed by three vertices, where the vertex is the middle one. \n\nWait, for example, in a triangle (n=3), the only possible angle you can form is the internal angle of 60 degrees. For a square, if you take three consecutive vertices, like 1,2,3, then the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But if you take vertices 1,2,4, then the angle at 2 would be 45 degrees. Oh right, because the square's diagonals split the 90-degree angles into 45s. So the angle depends on how many steps apart the other vertices are from the middle one.\n\nSo the key is to find, for each possible middle vertex v2, what possible angles can be formed by selecting v1 and v3 such that they are k steps away from v2. Wait, but since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle depends on the number of sides between the points. \n\nLet me think about how to calculate the angle for a given configuration. Suppose we have a regular n-gon. Let's pick a vertex v2. Then, suppose that v1 is k steps clockwise from v2, and v3 is m steps counter-clockwise from v2. Or maybe it's symmetric. Wait, perhaps the angle depends on the number of edges between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. But since the polygon is regular, the actual positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2 will determine the angle.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the angle is formed with v2 as the vertex, and v1 and v3 lying on the sides. So for example, when you pick v1 and v3 such that they are adjacent to v2, the angle is the internal angle of the polygon. But if they are further away, the angle changes.\n\nWait, perhaps the angle depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v2 and between v2 and v3. Let me think of the regular polygon as being inscribed in a circle. The central angles would be important here. \n\nFor example, consider a regular n-gon. Each vertex is spaced around a circle. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. Now, when you select three points v1, v2, v3, with v2 as the middle point, the angle at v2 depends on the arc lengths between v1 and v2, and between v2 and v3. \n\nBut since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 can be determined based on the number of steps between the points. Let me think: For example, if there are k steps between v1 and v2, and m steps between v2 and v3, but since the polygon is convex and the points are arranged in order, perhaps the angle depends on the number of edges between v1 and v2 along the perimeter. \n\nWait, but in the case where v1 and v3 are both adjacent to v2, then the angle is the internal angle of the polygon. But if v1 is one step away from v2, and v3 is two steps away, then the angle would be different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle at v2 is determined by the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. For example, if you fix v2, then the angle depends on how many vertices lie between v1 and v3. Let me think again.\n\nLet me recall that in a regular polygon, the measure of an angle formed by three vertices with the middle vertex being v2 can be calculated. Suppose that between v1 and v3, there are k vertices. Then, the angle at v2 would be (k * 180 / n) degrees? Or maybe something else?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the regular polygon is inscribed in a circle, the angle at v2 would be half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3. Because the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended at the center is twice that of the angle subtended at the circumference. \n\nWait, yes! If v1 and v3 are points on the circle, then the angle at v2 would be half the measure of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Wait, no. Wait, the angle at v2 is formed by the lines v",
    "response": "To solve the problem of finding three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon that form an angle as close as possible to a given angle `a`, we need to understand how angles are formed between three points on a regular polygon.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n1. **Regular Polygon and Circumscribed Circle**:\n   - A regular n-gon can be inscribed in a circle.\n   - The central angle between two adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{360^\\circ}{n} $.\n\n2. **Inscribed Angle Theorem**:\n   - The angle at a vertex $ v_2 $ formed by two other vertices $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $ depends on the arc length between $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $.\n   - If there are $ k $ edges between $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $ (not including $ v_2 $), the angle at $ v_2 $ is:\n     $$\n     \\theta = \\frac{(k-1) \\cdot 180^\\circ}{n}\n     $$\n\n3. **Optimal Angle Selection**:\n   - For each vertex $ v_2 $, we try different values of $ k $ (number of steps between $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $) to compute the angle and compare it with the target angle $ a $.\n   - We track the minimum absolute difference $ |\\theta - a| $ and find the best configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Efficient Approach\n\n- Since the polygon is symmetric, we only need to consider one vertex as the center (say, vertex 1), and compute all possible angles for that vertex.\n- We then rotate the configuration around the polygon to get all valid solutions.\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. Compute the angle for each possible number of steps $ k $ (from 2 to $ n-1 $) for a fixed vertex (e.g., vertex 1).\n2. For each $ k $, compute the angle $ \\theta = \\frac{(k-1) \\cdot 180}{n} $.\n3. Track the configuration with the smallest difference from the target angle `a`.\n4. Rotate the found configuration around the polygon to generate all valid outputs.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().strip().split()\n    n = int(data[0])\n    a = int(data[1])\n\n    min_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 2  # default value\n\n    # Iterate over possible k values (steps between v1 and v3)\n    for k in range(2, n):\n        angle = ((k - 1) * 180) / n\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n\n    # Now find the best triplet based on best_k\n    v2 = 1\n    if best_k <= n - 2:\n        v1 = v2 + 1\n        v3 = v2 + best_k\n    else:\n        v1 = v2 + 1\n        v3 = v2 + best_k - n\n\n    # Ensure v3 does not exceed n\n    v3 %= n\n    if v3 == 0:\n        v3 = n\n\n    # Output the triplet\n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Example Execution\n\nFor input:\n\n```\n4 67\n```\n\nThe code will:\n- Try all possible values of `k` (2 to 3).\n- Calculate the corresponding angles: 45° and 90°.\n- Since 45° is closer to 67° than 90°, it chooses `k = 2`.\n- It then generates the output: `2 1 3` (or any rotation of this).\n\n---\n\nThis approach ensures efficiency by leveraging the symmetry of the regular polygon and avoids unnecessary computations, making it suitable even for large values of `n` up to $ 10^5 $.",
