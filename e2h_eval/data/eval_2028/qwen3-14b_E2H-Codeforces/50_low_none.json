    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem is about finding the sum of d(1,n) for all good trees. Let me first understand what a good tree is.\n\nSo, a good tree has edges with weights 1 or -1. And for each vertex i, the product of the edge weights of all edges incident to i must be -1. Oh right, because each edge is connected to two vertices. So for every vertex, the product of the edges connected to it is -1. \n\nWait, how does that affect the structure of the tree? Let's think about it. For example, in a tree with n=2, there's only one edge between 1 and 2. For each vertex, the product of their edges is the weight of that edge. So for vertex 1, the product is w, and for vertex 2, it's also w. Both must equal -1. Therefore, the edge must be -1. Hence, the only good tree is that edge, and d(1,2) is -1, which matches the first example.\n\nNow for n=1, but the input constraints say n is positive. But when n=1, there are no edges. But then for the single vertex, there are no edges, so the product of the edges (which is an empty product) is 1. But the condition requires it to be -1. So for n=1, there are zero good trees. Hence, the answer for n=1 is 0, which matches the second example where input is 1 and output is 0.\n\nSo, the problem is to compute the sum over all good trees of d(1,n), modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many good trees there are, and then find the sum of d(1,n) for them. But maybe there's a way to compute the sum directly without enumerating all possibilities, given the constraints.\n\nLet me think about the conditions for a tree to be good. Each vertex has the product of its incident edges equal to -1. Let me denote the edges as variables. Let me consider the product for each vertex. For each vertex i, the product of its adjacent edges is -1.\n\nBut since each edge is between two vertices, the product of all edges incident to vertex i is -1. Let me think about the product of all such products for all vertices. Let's see: each edge is counted twice, once for each endpoint. So the product of all vertex products would be (-1)^n. But also, each edge is multiplied twice. So the product of all vertex products equals (product of edges)^2. Therefore, (product of edges)^2 = (-1)^n. Therefore, product of edges must be ±1, but squared is (-1)^n. So (-1)^n must be 1, because (product of edges)^2 is always 1. Wait, that implies that (-1)^n must be 1. Which implies that n must be even. Otherwise, there's a contradiction. \n\nWait, that suggests that when n is odd, there are no good trees. Because if n is odd, then (-1)^n = -1, but the left side is (product of edges)^2 which is 1. So 1 = -1 mod 2? No, impossible. Therefore, for odd n ≥1, there are no good trees. Except for n=1? Wait n=1, the product of all vertex products is just the product for the single vertex. Which is supposed to be -1. But the product of edges is 1 (since there are no edges). So the product of all vertex products is -1. Which would be (product of edges)^2 = 1. But -1 = 1? No, which is impossible. Therefore, for n=1, there are no good trees. So for any odd n, there are no good trees. Hence, the answer is 0 when n is odd.\n\nWait, but in the sample input for n=2 (even), there is 1 good tree. For n=4, the sample output is 998244343, which is -10 mod MOD. So for even n, there are some good trees, but for odd n, none.\n\nSo first, if n is odd, the answer is zero. So the first check is: if n is 1 or any other odd, output zero.\n\nBut wait, what about n=3? Let's see. For n=3, the product of all vertex products is (-1)^3 = -1. But the product of edges squared is (product of edges)^2 = 1. So -1 = 1? Impossible. Therefore, no good trees. So for all odd n ≥1, the answer is 0.\n\nTherefore, the",

No.\n    \n    # Another approach: Since the constraints for a good tree are that for each vertex, the product of its incident edges is -1. Let's think about the implications.\n    \n    # Each edge is between two vertices. Let's denote the edges as variables w_e ∈ {1, -1}.\n    # For each vertex i, product_{e incident to i} w_e = -1.\n    \n    # Let's take the product over all vertices. As earlier, this gives (product of edges)^2 = (-1)^n.\n    # Which implies that n must be even.\n    \n    # Now, for even n, how many good trees are there?\n    \n    # Let's think of the tree structure. The number of trees is n^{n-2}, but with edge weights.\n    # However, the constraints on the edge weights may reduce this number.\n    \n    # Let's consider that the tree is arbitrary in structure, but the edge weights are constrained.\n    \n    # Let's suppose that the tree is fixed. How many valid assignments of edge weights are there?\n    \n    # For a given tree structure, the constraints are that for each vertex, the product of its incident edges is -1.\n    \n    # Let's consider that each edge is a variable w_e ∈ {1, -1}.\n    \n    # Let me think of this as a system of equations. Each equation is the product of edges incident to vertex i equals -1.\n    \n    # Let me take the product of all these equations. As before, the left-hand side becomes product of (product of edges incident to i) for all i. Each edge appears twice, once for each endpoint. Therefore, the product is (product of w_e)^2. The right-hand side is (-1)^n. Therefore, (product of w_e)^2 = (-1)^n. Since n is even, this is 1. So this condition is satisfied.\n    \n    # Now, for a tree, the system of equations is over-constrained? Or not?\n    \n    # Let's consider that the equations are not all independent. For example, if we take the product of all equations for all vertices except one, then the product would be (product of edges)^{2} / product of edges incident to the last vertex. But I'm not sure.\n    \n    # Let me think for a tree with n vertices. There are n equations (one per vertex), but they are not independent. Because the product of all equations is (product of edges)^2 = (-1)^n. So if n is even, this holds. So the system has solutions only if the product of all equations is compatible, which it is for even n. But how many solutions are there?\n    \n    # Let me think of the equations. For a tree, the number of edges is n-1. The number of variables is n-1. However, the equations are not all independent. For example, the product of all equations (each being product of edges around vertex i equals -1) gives (product of edges)^2 = (-1)^n. Which for even n is 1. So the system of equations is consistent, and the number of solutions is 2^{k}, where k is the number of independent variables.\n    \n    # For a tree, the number of independent equations is n-1. Because if we have n equations, but the product of them is 1 (for even n), so there's one dependency. So the rank is n-1. But since each equation is multiplicative, it's more complex.\n    \n    # Alternatively, think of the system as follows. For each edge, we can assign a value. However, the product around each vertex must be -1. Let's think of the tree as rooted at some node. Let's say we pick a root, and assign values to the edges in a way that satisfies the constraints.\n    \n    # Let's consider that for a tree, the constraints form a system where we can assign values to all edges except one, and the last one is determined by the constraints. However, this may not always be possible, but for a tree, maybe it is.\n    \n    # For example, take a star-shaped tree with root 1 connected to nodes 2, 3, ..., n. Then for the root, the product of its edges is w_12 * w_13 * ... * w_1n = -1. For each leaf node i (say, node 2), the product of its edges is w_12 = -1. Similarly for node 3, w_13 = -1, etc. So for each leaf, the edge from the root must be -1. Then the product for the root is (-1)^{n-1}. This must equal -1. So (-1)^{n-1} = -1 → n-1 must be odd → n even. Which it is. So this is valid. Hence, in this case, there is exactly one assignment of edge weights that works. So for this particular tree, there is exactly one valid weight assignment.\n    \n    # So for any tree, the number of valid weight assignments is 1? Or 2^{something}? Wait in this example, it's 1. But what if the tree is different?\n    \n    # Let's take a simple case of n=4. Suppose the tree is a chain 1-2-3-4. Let's try to assign weights.\n    \n    # The constraints are:\n    # For vertex 1: w_12 = -1\n    # For vertex 2: w_12 * w_23 = -1 → (-1)*w_23 = -1 → w_23 = 1\n    # For vertex 3: w_23 * w_34 = -1 → 1 * w_34 = -1 → w_34 = -1\n    # For vertex 4: w_34 = -1 → satisfies.\n    \n    # So there is exactly one valid assignment for this tree. Hence, for this tree, the number of valid weightings is 1.\n    \n    # So perhaps for any tree, there is exactly one valid weighting that satisfies the conditions. If that is true, then the total number of good trees is the number of trees multiplied by 1, i.e., n^{n-2}.\n    \n    # But wait in the sample for n=4, the note says there are 16 good trees. For n=4, Cayley's formula says there are 4^{2} = 16 trees. So for each tree, there is exactly one valid weighting. Hence, the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} for even n. That matches with the sample for n=4: 16 good trees.\n    \n    # So the number of good trees is n^{n-2} when n is even, and 0 otherwise.\n    \n    # Now, the problem asks for the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees. Since each good tree corresponds to exactly one tree structure with exactly one weighting, the sum is equal to the sum of d(1,n) for all possible tree structures, where each tree has its unique weighting.\n    \n    # So now the problem reduces to: for each tree structure, compute d(1,n) under its unique weighting, and sum over all trees.\n    \n    # The question now is: what is the sum of d(1,n) across all tree structures, with each tree having its unique weighting?\n    \n    # Let's think about what d(1,n) represents. It's the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to n in the tree. Since each tree has a unique weighting, we need to find for each tree, what is the sum of the weights on the path from 1 to n, and then sum that over all trees.\n    \n    # How can we compute this sum efficiently?\n    \n    # Let's think about the properties of the weighting. For any tree, the weighting is uniquely determined by the constraints. For example, in the star-shaped tree, the edges from the center to leaves are all -1. The path from 1 to n is a single edge (if n is a leaf), so d(1,n) is -1.\n    \n    # In the chain example, the path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-3-4, with weights -1, 1, -1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1.\n    \n    # Wait, but in the sample for n=4, the sum was -10. Let's see: for 16 trees, the sum was -10. So if each tree contributes -1, the sum would be -16, which is not the case. So clearly, the contribution varies depending on the tree structure.\n    \n    # So we need to find the average contribution of d(1,n) across all trees, multiplied by the number of trees (n^{n-2}).\n    \n    # But how to find this average?\n    \n    # Let's think about the unique weighting for a given tree. For any tree, the weights are determined by the constraints. Let's think about the constraints again.\n    \n    # For any tree, the weighting is uniquely determined. How?\n    \n    # Let's consider building the tree as a rooted tree, with root at node 1. For each node, we can assign the weight of the edge from its parent to it. The constraint for the root is that the product of its incident edges equals -1. For non-root nodes, their constraint is that the product of their incident edges equals -1. But since each non-root node has exactly one parent (in the rooted tree), the other edges are to children. But how does this help?\n    \n    # Alternatively, let's consider that for any tree, the weighting is determined by choosing an arbitrary spanning tree and assigning weights such that for each node, the product of its incident edges is -1.\n    \n    # Perhaps there's a clever way to model this. Let me think of the weighting as follows: for each edge, its weight is determined by the product of the constraints of the nodes it connects.\n    \n    # But perhaps a better approach is to think recursively. For a tree, the weight of each edge can be determined based on the constraints of the nodes.\n    \n    # Let's imagine that we have a tree, and we want to determine the weights of the edges. Let's pick a root (say node 1). For each node, we can assign the weight of the edge from its parent to it. For example, for the root, it has no parent. So the product of all edges incident to the root must be -1. For each child of the root, the edge weight is chosen such that the product for the child is satisfied, and so on.\n    \n    # Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a tree rooted at node 1. For each node u, let's denote the edge from u to its parent as e. The weight of this edge will be determined based on the constraints.\n    \n    # For the root node (node 1), the product of all edges incident to it must be -1. These edges are all the edges connecting node 1 to its children. Let's say node 1 has degree d. The product of the weights of these edges is -1. For each child v of node 1, the edge from 1 to v has weight w. The constraint for node v is that the product of its incident edges (including the edge to its parent, 1) times the product of the edges to its children must be -1. But this seems complex.\n    \n    # Maybe there's a pattern. Let's think about the unique weighting for a tree. For any tree, the product of the weights of the edges on any path from the root to a leaf is -1^{depth}? Not sure.\n    \n    # Alternatively, let's think about the product of the weights around each node. For node u, the product of all incident edges is -1. This includes the edge from u to its parent (if any) and all edges to its children. Let's assume that the tree is rooted at node 1. For each node u, let's denote the weight of the edge from u to its parent as w_u. Then, the product of the weights of all edges incident to u is w_u * product of weights of edges from u to its children. This must be -1. So, product of weights of edges from u to its children = -1 / w_u.\n    \n    # But how to determine w_u? Let's think recursively. Starting from the root node 1, which has no parent. Its product of incident edges is the product of the weights of edges to its children. This product must be -1. So, for the root, the product of the weights of its edges to its children is -1. Now, for each child v of the root, the product of its incident edges includes the edge to its parent (w_v) and the product of its edges to its children. This must be -1. So:\n\n    # w_v * (product of edges from v to its children) = -1.\n\n    # But from the root's perspective, the product of edges from the root to its children is -1. For each child v, the product of edges from v to its children is -1 / w_v. So, for the root's child v, the product of its edges to its children is -1 / w_v.\n\n    # This suggests that the weight of the edge from the root to v is chosen such that the product of the edges from v to its children is determined. But how is w_v determined?\n\n    # It seems that the weights are determined recursively. For example, for the root, the product of its edges to children is -1. For each child v, the weight of the edge from the root to v (w_v) can be chosen freely, but the product of the edges from v to its children is -1 / w_v. But then, for the next level, the same logic applies.\n\n    # However, this suggests that there is some degree of freedom in choosing the weights. But earlier examples suggest that for certain trees, there is exactly one valid weighting. This contradiction implies that my reasoning is flawed.\n\n    # Let's go back to the earlier example of a star-shaped tree with n=4. Root is 1, connected to nodes 2, 3, 4. The product of edges for node 1 is w_12 * w_13 * w_14 = -1. For each leaf node (say node 2), the product of its incident edges is w_12 = -1. Similarly for nodes 3 and 4. Thus, w_12 = w_13 = w_14 = -1. Substituting into the root's equation: (-1)^3 = -1, which is correct. So there's exactly one solution. So in this case, the weights are uniquely determined.\n\n    # Let's take another example: a chain of 4 nodes 1-2-3-4. Root is 1. The edge from 1 to 2 has weight w_2. Node 2 has children (node 3). The product of incident edges for node 2 is w_2 * w_3 (edge to node 3) = -1. For node 3, the product of its incident edges is w_3 * w_4 (edge to node 4) = -1. For node 4, the product of its incident edges is w_4 = -1. So solving from the bottom up:\n\n    # w_4 = -1.\n    # For node 3: w_3 * w_4 = -1 → w_3 * (-1) = -1 → w_3 = 1.\n    # For node 2: w_2 * w_3 = -1 → w_2 * 1 = -1 → w_2 = -1.\n    # For node 1: the product of its incident edges is w_2 = -1, which satisfies the condition for node 1.\n\n    # So again, the weights are uniquely determined.\n\n    # So it seems that for any tree, there is exactly one valid weighting. Hence, the number of good trees is n^{n-2} for even n, and 0 otherwise.\n\n    # Now, the challenge is to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all such trees.\n\n    # Let's think about d(1,n) for a given tree. It's the sum of the weights along the unique path from 1 to n. Let's call this path P.\n\n    # How can we find the expected value of this sum across all trees, and multiply by the number of trees?\n\n    # Let's think about the contribution of each edge to the total sum. For each edge e, how many times does it appear in the path from 1 to n in all possible trees? And what is its weight in those trees?\n\n    # But the weight of each edge depends on the tree's structure and its unique weighting. This seems complex.\n\n    # However, perhaps there's a symmetry or pattern that can be exploited.\n\n    # Let's consider the following observation: for any tree, the path from 1 to n is a unique simple path. The sum of the weights along this path is d(1,n). But the weighting of the edges is determined uniquely by the constraints.\n\n    # Let's think about the entire tree. For any tree, the product of the weights along the path from 1 to n is equal to the product of the weights of all edges on that path. But how does this relate to the constraints?\n\n    # Let's consider the product of the weights of all edges incident to node 1. This product is -1. The edges incident to node 1 include the edges on the path from 1 to n, and possibly other edges (if node 1 has multiple children).\n\n    # This seems too vague. Let's think differently.\n\n    # Let's consider the unique weighting for any tree. The constraints imply that for every node, the product of its incident edges is -1. Let's take the product of all these constraints for all nodes. This gives (product of all edges)^2 = (-1)^n. Since n is even, this is 1. So this is consistent.\n\n    # Now, let's consider the product of the weights along the path from 1 to n. Let's denote this product as P. What is P?\n\n    # Let's think about the product of the weights of all edges in the tree. Let's denote this as Q. We know that Q^2 = 1. So Q = ±1.\n\n    # However, the product of the weights along the path from 1 to n is P. How does this relate to Q?\n\n    # Not sure. Let's think about the tree as a whole. For each node, the product of its incident edges is -1. So for the entire tree, the product of all these products is (-1)^n. Which is equal to Q^2, as discussed earlier.\n\n    # Now, for the path from 1 to n, let's consider the product of the weights along this path. Let's call it P. Also, consider the product of the weights of all edges not on this path. Let's call it R. Then Q = P * R.\n\n    # But I don't know how to use this.\n\n    # Let's try to find a relationship between P and the constraints. For example, consider the product of the weights around the nodes on the path from 1 to n.\n\n    # Let's take node 1. Its incident edges include the first edge on the path to n, and possibly other edges. The product of all its incident edges is -1. Similarly for other nodes on the path.\n\n    # This seems too vague again. Let's try to find a pattern from the samples.\n\n    # For n=2, there is one good tree, and d(1,2) = -1. So sum is -1.\n\n    # For n=4, the sum is -10. Let's think about what this might represent.\n\n    # Let's consider that for each tree, the contribution is the sum of the weights on the path from 1 to n. Let's think about the expected value of this sum across all trees.\n\n    # Let's consider that for each edge in the tree, its contribution to the sum depends on whether it lies on the path from 1 to n in the tree.\n\n    # But since each tree is considered, and for each tree, the path from 1 to n is unique, it's challenging to find a direct formula.\n\n    # However, let's consider the following: for any tree, the path from 1 to n is a unique path. Let's consider the contribution of each edge to the sum across all trees.\n\n    # Let's consider the number of trees in which a particular edge e is on the path from 1 to n. Let's call this count C(e). For each such tree, the weight of edge e is either 1 or -1, depending on the constraints. But how to find the sum of the weights of e across all trees where it is on the path?\n\n    # This seems complex, but perhaps there's a symmetry. For example, for each edge e, the number of trees where it is on the path from 1 to n is the same for all edges, and the average weight of e in such trees is zero.\n\n    # But this might not be the case.\n\n    # Let's think about the total sum of d(1,n) across all trees. Let's denote this as S.\n\n    # For each tree T, let P(T) be the path from 1 to n, and let W(T) be the sum of weights on P(T). Then S = sum_T W(T).\n\n    # Now, let's consider that for each edge e, let's compute the contribution to S from e. That is, for all trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, add the weight of e in that tree.\n\n    # So S = sum_e [sum_{trees T where e is on P(T)} w_e(T)].\n\n    # Now, if we can compute for each edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, and the average weight of e in those trees, then we can compute S.\n\n    # But how?\n\n    # First, let's find the number of trees where a particular edge e is on the path from 1 to n.\n\n    # Let's fix an edge between nodes u and v. How many trees include this edge and have it on the path from 1 to n?\n\n    # To count this, we can think about the number of trees where the edge e is present, and it lies on the path from 1 to n.\n\n    # For any tree, the number of trees containing edge e is (n-1)^{n-3} * 2^{n-1} / ...? No, this is not helpful.\n\n    # Wait, the total number of trees is n^{n-2} (from Cayley's formula). For any particular pair of nodes u and v, the number of trees that contain the edge between u and v is n^{n-3} * 2. Wait, no, the number of labeled trees on n nodes that contain a specific edge is n^{n-3} * 1 (since for each tree, the number of trees containing a specific edge is n^{n-3} * 1, because adding the edge to a tree on n-1 nodes).\n\n    # Actually, the number of trees containing a specific edge uv is (n-1)^{n-3} * 1? No, according to Cayley's formula, the number of trees containing a specific edge is n^{n-3} * 1. Because if you fix an edge, you can think of it as merging the two components. So for any edge uv, the number of trees containing it is n^{n-3} * 1.\n\n    # But how many of these trees have the edge uv on the path from 1 to n?\n\n    # For a given edge e = uv, the number of trees containing e where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of trees containing e multiplied by the probability that e is on the path from 1 to n in a random tree containing e.\n\n    # In a random tree containing e, what is the probability that e is on the path from 1 to n?\n\n    # This is equivalent to asking: in a tree containing e, what is the probability that the path from 1 to n passes through e?\n\n    # This is a classic problem. For a tree, the number of paths from 1 to n is 1, and the number of trees containing e is fixed. But how to calculate the probability?\n\n    # Let's consider that in any tree, the path from 1 to n is unique. For the edge e = uv to be on this path, the nodes 1 and n must be in different subtrees when the edge e is removed. So, when we remove e, the tree splits into two subtrees. One subtree contains node 1, and the other contains node n. Or vice versa.\n\n    # So, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of ways to choose a tree where e is present, and 1 and n are in different subtrees when e is removed.\n\n    # To count this, let's think of the edge e as connecting two subtrees. Let's say that one subtree has k nodes, and the other has n-k nodes. For the edge e to be on the path from 1 to n, one of the subtrees must contain 1, and the other must contain n. So, for the edge e to be on the path from 1 to n, it must be that 1 is in one subtree and n is in the other.\n\n    # The number of such trees is equal to the number of ways to choose a tree where e is present and 1 and n are in different components when e is removed. This is equal to the number of trees where e is present multiplied by the probability that 1 and n are in different components when e is removed.\n\n    # But how to calculate this? For a given edge e, the number of trees where e is present and 1 and n are in different components when e is removed is equal to the number of ways to build a tree where one component has 1 and the other has n. This can be calculated using the formula: if we split the tree into two parts, one containing 1 and the other containing n, then the number of such trees is (k^{k-2} * (n-k)^{n-k-2}) * 1), where k is the size of the component containing 1, and (n-k) is the size of the component containing n. But since e is fixed, this is not directly applicable.\n\n    # Alternatively, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of trees containing e multiplied by the probability that in a random tree containing e, the path from 1 to n goes through e.\n\n    # This probability is equal to the probability that 1 and n are in different subtrees when e is removed. Let's think of this as follows: when we remove e, the tree splits into two subtrees. Let's say one subtree has size a and the other has size b, where a + b = n. The probability that 1 is in one subtree and n is in the other is 2 * (a * b) / (n * (n-1)) )? Not sure.\n\n    # This seems complicated. Let's instead recall that for any edge e in a random tree, the probability that it lies on the path between two specific nodes u and v is 2/(n). This is a known result. Wait, for two distinct nodes u and v, the number of trees where the edge e is on the path from u to v is (number of trees containing e) * probability that e is on the path. But I'm not sure about the exact value.\n\n    # However, let's consider that for any two distinct nodes u and v, the number of trees where the edge e is on the path from u to v is (n-2) * n^{n-4}. But I'm not sure.\n\n    # Let's think differently. For the problem at hand, we need to find the sum over all trees of d(1,n). Let's think about the contribution of each edge to this sum.\n\n    # For a given edge e, let's calculate the total contribution of e to all good trees. This is equal to the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n multiplied by the expected value of the weight of e in such trees.\n\n    # If we can find this for each edge, we can sum over all edges to get the total sum S.\n\n    # Let's denote that for each edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is C_e, and the average weight of e in such trees is w_e_avg. Then, the contribution of e is C_e * w_e_avg.\n\n    # Now, what is w_e_avg? For each tree where e is on the path from 1 to n, the weight of e is determined by the constraints. But how?\n\n    # Recall that for any tree, the weight of each edge is uniquely determined by the constraints. Let's think about how the weight of e is determined.\n\n    # Let's consider the tree as a rooted tree at node 1. For any edge e = uv, let's assume u is the parent of v. Then, the weight of e is determined based on the constraints of the nodes.\n\n    # But this is getting too abstract. Let's think about the overall contribution of all edges. \n\n    # Let's consider the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees. For each good tree, d(1,n) is the sum of the weights on the path from 1 to n. Let's denote this path as P. So, the sum over all trees is the sum over all trees of the sum of the weights on P, which is the same as the sum over all edges of the number of trees where the edge is on P multiplied by the weight of the edge in those trees.\n\n    # Now, let's think about the total sum S. For each tree, the sum of weights on P is d(1,n). So S = sum_{trees} d(1,n).\n\n    # Let's consider the average value of d(1,n) across all good trees, multiplied by the number of good trees. Let's denote the number of good trees as T = n^{n-2} for even n.\n\n    # Let's think about the average value of d(1,n). For each edge e, what is the contribution to this average?\n\n    # Let's denote that for each edge e, the probability that it is on the path from 1 to n in a random good tree is p_e. And the expected value of the weight of e in such cases is w_e.\n\n    # Then, the average value of d(1,n) is sum_e p_e * w_e.\n\n    # Multiplying by T gives the total sum S = T * sum_e p_e * w_e.\n\n    # Now, the question is: what is p_e and w_e?\n\n    # Let's think about p_e. For a random good tree, the probability that edge e is on the path from 1 to n is the same as the probability that it is on the path in a random tree (since the weighting doesn't affect the structure of the tree). So p_e is the same as in a random tree, which is 2/n for any edge e not involving 1 or n? Or is it different?\n\n    # This is a critical point. For a random labeled tree, the probability that a particular edge e is on the path from 1 to n is 2/(n). This is a well-known result. For example, in a random tree, the number of trees where the edge e is on the path from 1 to n is 2 * n^{n-3} (since there are n^{n-2} trees in total, and each edge is in 2 * n^{n-3} trees). Wait, let me verify.\n\n    # The total number of trees is n^{n-2}. For a fixed edge e, the number of trees containing e is n^{n-3} * 2? No, it's n^{n-3} * 1. Because when you fix an edge, the number of trees containing it is n^{n-3} (from the formula for the number of trees containing a specific edge).\n\n    # Now, for a fixed edge e, how many of these trees have e on the path from 1 to n?\n\n    # Let's say the edge connects nodes u and v. For the edge to be on the path from 1 to n, one of u or v must be in the subtree containing 1, and the other must be in the subtree containing n. This is similar to the concept of a bridge between two parts of the tree.\n\n    # The number of such trees is equal to the number of ways to connect the two subtrees such that 1 is in one and n is in the other. This is equal to the number of ways to choose a tree where e is present and 1 and n are in different subtrees when e is removed.\n\n    # To calculate this, we can use the fact that for any edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is (number of trees containing e) * (probability that in a random tree containing e, 1 and n are in different subtrees when e is removed).\n\n    # Let's denote that when we remove e, the tree splits into two subtrees. Let's say one subtree has k nodes, and the other has (n-k) nodes. The probability that 1 is in one subtree and n is in the other is (k * (n-k)) / (C(n,2)) ? No, that's not correct.\n\n    # Actually, for a random tree containing e, the probability that 1 and n are in different subtrees when e is removed is 2/(n) * (n-2) ? Not sure.\n\n    # Alternatively, for any tree containing e, the probability that 1 and n are in different subtrees is 2/(n) * (n-1)/something. This is getting too stuck.\n\n    # Let's return to the sample for n=2. For n=2, there is only one tree, and the edge is on the path. So the contribution is -1. For n=4, the sum is -10.\n\n    # Let's consider the contribution of each edge in the sum S. For n=4, there are 4^{2} = 16 good trees. Let's assume that each edge is on the path from 1 to 4 in some number of trees.\n\n    # Let's think about the number of edges in the tree. For a tree with n nodes, there are n-1 edges. For n=4, there are 3 edges per tree.\n\n    # Let's say that for each edge, the number of trees where it is on the path from 1 to 4 is C. Then, the total contribution from all edges is 3*C * w_avg, where w_avg is the average weight of the edge in those cases.\n\n    # But for n=4, the total sum is -10. Let's see: if each edge contributes -10/3, but this is not an integer. So this suggests that the assumption is wrong.\n\n    # Alternatively, let's think about the average value of d(1,n) for all good trees. For n=4, it is -10 / 16 = -5/8.\n\n    # But how to generalize this?\n\n    # Let's think about the contribution of each edge to the sum S. Let's assume that for each edge e, the number of trees where it is on the path from 1 to n is C_e, and the average weight of e in those trees is w_e_avg.\n\n    # For n=2, there is one edge, and C_e = 1, w_e_avg = -1. So S = 1 * -1 = -1, which matches.\n\n    # For n=4, let's say that each of the 3 edges contributes to S. Let's assume that for each edge, C_e is 2, and the average weight is -1. Then total contribution would be 3 * 2 * -1 = -6, which is less than -10. So this is not correct.\n\n    # Another approach: let's think about the sum S for even n. Let's assume that for each tree, the sum d(1,n) is -1 * (number of edges on the path from 1 to n). But this is not true, as seen in the n=4 example.\n\n    # Alternatively, let's think about the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees as - (number of good trees) * (number of edges on the path from 1 to n in a random tree). But this is also not clear.\n\n    # Let's think back to the constraints on the weighting. For any tree, the product of the weights of all edges incident to a node is -1. For the root node (1), this means that the product of all its incident edges is -1. For the leaf node n, this means that the product of its incident edges is -1. The path from 1 to n is a single path, and the product of the weights along this path is related to the constraints of the nodes on the path.\n\n    # Let's consider the product of the weights along the path from 1 to n. Let's denote this product as P. For each node on the path, the product of its incident edges is -1. Let's consider the product of these products for all nodes on the path.\n\n    # For example, let's say the path has k nodes. The product of the products for these nodes is (-1)^k. On the other hand, each edge on the path is counted twice (once for each endpoint), and the edges not on the path are counted once (for the nodes on the path). This seems complex.\n\n    # Let's consider a simple case: n=4, and the path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-3-4. The product of the weights on this path is w_12 * w_23 * w_34. The product of the incident edges for node 1 is w_12 = -1. For node 2, it's w_12 * w_23 = -1 → w_23 = 1. For node 3, it's w_23 * w_34 = -1 → w_34 = -1. For node 4, it's w_34 = -1. So the product of the path is -1 * 1 * -1 = 1. \n\n    # Now, the sum d(1,4) is -1 + 1 -1 = -1. So for this tree, the contribution is -1.\n\n    # Let's take another tree for n=4, say 1-2-4, 1-3-4. The path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-4 or 1-3-4, but in this case, it's a tree with 1 connected to 2 and 3, and 2 connected to 4, 3 connected to 4. The path from 1 to 4 could be 1-2-4 or 1-3-4. Wait, but in a tree, there is only one path. So for this tree, the path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-4 or 1-3-4? No, it depends on the structure. Let's say the tree is 1-2-4 and 1-3-4. Then the path from 1 to 4 is either 1-2-4 or 1-3-4, but this is not a tree. It would have cycles. So this is not a valid tree.\n\n    # Let's take a tree where the path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-4. The other edge is 1-3. Let's calculate the weights.\n\n    # For node 1: incident edges are w_12 and w_13. Their product is -1.\n\n    # For node 2: incident edges are w_12 and w_24. Product is -1.\n\n    # For node 4: incident edge is w_24. Product is -1 → w_24 = -1.\n\n    # For node 2: w_12 * w_24 = -1 → w_12 * (-1) = -1 → w_12 = 1.\n\n    # For node 1: w_12 * w_13 = -1 → 1 * w_13 = -1 → w_13 = -1.\n\n    # So the path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-4, with weights 1 and -1. Sum is 1 + (-1) = 0. So this tree contributes 0.\n\n    # So for this tree, the contribution is 0. Hence, the sum S for n=4 is not simply -1 per tree.\n\n    # This suggests that the contribution varies depending on the structure of the tree. Hence, it's challenging to find a direct formula.\n\n    # Let's try to find a pattern from the samples.\n\n    # For n=2, S = -1 = -1 * 1.\n\n    # For n=4, S = -10 = -1 * 10.\n\n    # Let's see what 10 is in terms of n.

No, not matching.\n\n    # Alternative: for n=2, the sum is -1 = -1 * 1.\n\n    # For n=4, the sum is -10 = -1 * 10. Let's see if 10 is (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) / 2. For n=4, 3*2*1/2 = 3, no.\n\n    # Let's think about the sample for n=4. There are 16 good trees. The sum is -10. Let's see what -10 is in terms of n. It is - (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) / 3? For n=4, 3*2*1 / 3 = 2, no. Not matching.\n\n    # Another approach: let's think about the contribution of each edge in the sum S. For a given edge e, the number of trees where it is on the path from 1 to n is C_e, and the average weight of e in those trees is w_e_avg.\n\n    # For n=2, there is one edge, C_e = 1, w_e_avg = -1. Contribution is -1.\n\n    # For n=4, let's assume that each of the 3 edges in a tree contributes to the sum. Let's say that for each edge, C_e is 4 (since there are 16 trees, and 4 trees for each edge?), and w_e_avg is -0.5. Then total contribution would be 3 * 4 * -0.5 = -6, which is less than -10.\n\n    # This is getting too stuck. Let's try to find a pattern from the sample.\n\n    # For n=2, the answer is -1 = -1 * 1.\n\n    # For n=4, the answer is -10 = -1 * 10.\n\n    # Let's see if 10 is 2 * 5, or 5 * 2. For n=4, 5 is (n^2 - 1)/3 = (16-1)/3 = 5. Yes! For n=2, (4-1)/3 = 1, which matches. So for n=2, it's -1 * 1 = -1. For n=4, it's -1 * 10 = -10.\n\n    # Let's check this hypothesis. For n=2, (n^2 -1)/3 = (4-1)/3 = 1. For n=4, (16-1)/3 = 5. But 5 * 2 = 10. So the formula could be - (n^2 -1)/3 * 2.\n\n    # But for n=2, this would give - (3/3)*2 = -2, which is not the sample. So this is incorrect.\n\n    # Another observation: for n=2, the sum is -1 = -1 * 1.\n\n    # For n=4, the sum is -10 = -1 * 10.\n\n    # Let's see if 10 is (n-1) * (n-2) * ... ?

No, 4+1 is 5.\n\n    # Alternatively, 10 = 4 * 2 + 2. Not sure.\n\n    # Let's think about the number of good trees for even n. It is n^{n-2}. For n=2, it is 1.

But 10 is not related to 16.\n\n    # This is not helping. Let's think about the sum S for even n.\n\n    # Let's consider that for any good tree, the sum d(1,n) is -1 * (number of edges on the path from 1 to n). But this is not true for n=4, where some trees contribute 0.\n\n    # Another idea: for any good tree, the sum d(1,n) is -1. But this is not true for n=4, as seen in the example where the contribution was 0.\n\n    # This suggests that the sum is not uniform across all trees.\n\n    # Given the time constraints, I'll refer back to the sample for n=4 and try to find a pattern.\n\n    # Sample for n=4: sum is -10. Let's see what -10 is in terms of n.\n\n    # For n=4, the number of good trees is 16. The sum is -10.

No.\n\n    # Let's think about the number of edges on the path from 1 to n in a random tree. For a random tree, the length of the path from 1 to n is a random variable. For n=4, the average length is 2. For example, in a tree with 4 nodes, the path from 1 to 4 can be length 2 (like 1-2-4) or length 3 (like 1-2-3-4). The average length is (number of trees with path length 2 * 2 + number with length 3 * 3) / total trees.\n\n    # For n=4, there are 4^{2} = 16 trees. Let's calculate how many have path length 2 and how many have path length 3.\n\n    # The number of trees where the path from 1 to 4 has length 2: this is the number of trees where 1 and 4 are connected via a single intermediate node.

The number of such trees is 2 * (number of ways to connect the remaining nodes).\n\n    # This is getting too complex, but let's assume that for n=4, the average length is 2.5. Then, if the average weight is -1, the average contribution would be -2.5, leading to total sum of -2.5 * 16 = -40, which is not the sample.\n\n    # At this point, I'm stuck and need to find a different approach.\n\n    # Let's think about the constraints again. For any good tree, the product of the weights of all edges incident to a node is -1. This implies that for each node, the number of -1 edges incident to it is odd.\n\n    # Let's consider the sum d(1,n). It is the sum of the weights on the path from 1 to n.

As before, the left-hand side becomes product of (product of edges incident to i) for all i. Each edge appears twice, once for each endpoint. Therefore, the product is (product of w_e)^2. The right-hand side is (-1)^n. Therefore, (product of w_e)^2 = (-1)^n. Since n is even, this is 1. So this condition is satisfied.\n    \n    # Now, for a tree, the system of equations is over-constrained? Or not?\n    \n    # Let's consider that the equations are not all independent. For example, if we take the product of all equations for all vertices except one, then the product would be (product of edges)^{2} / product of edges incident to the last vertex. But I'm not sure.\n    \n    # Let me think for a tree with n vertices. There are n equations (one per vertex), but they are not independent. Because the product of all equations is (product of edges)^2 = (-1)^n. So if n is even, this holds. So the system has solutions only if the product of all equations is compatible, which it is for even n. But how many solutions are there?\n    \n    # Let me think of the equations. For a tree, the number of edges is n-1. The number of variables is n-1. However, the equations are not all independent. For example, the product of all equations (each being product of edges around vertex i equals -1) gives (product of edges)^2 = (-1)^n. Which for even n is 1. So the system of equations is consistent, and the number of solutions is 2^{k}, where k is the number of independent variables.\n    \n    # For a tree, the number of independent equations is n-1. Because if we have n equations, but the product of them is 1 (for even n), so there's one dependency. So the rank is n-1. But since each equation is multiplicative, it's more complex.\n    \n    # Alternatively, think of the system as follows. For each edge, we can assign a value. However, the product around each vertex must be -1. Let's think of the tree as rooted at some node. Let's say we pick a root, and assign values to the edges in a way that satisfies the constraints.\n    \n    # Let's consider that for a tree, the constraints form a system where we can assign values to all edges except one, and the last one is determined by the constraints. However, this may not always be possible, but for a tree, maybe it is.\n    \n    # For example, take a star-shaped tree with root 1 connected to nodes 2, 3, ..., n. Then for the root, the product of its edges is w_12 * w_13 * ... * w_1n = -1. For each leaf node i (say, node 2), the product of its edges is w_12 = -1. Similarly for node 3, w_13 = -1, etc. So for each leaf, the edge from the root must be -1. Then the product for the root is (-1)^{n-1}. This must equal -1. So (-1)^{n-1} = -1 → n-1 must be odd → n even. Which it is. So this is valid. Hence, in this case, there is exactly one assignment of edge weights that works. So for this particular tree, there is exactly one valid weight assignment.\n    \n    # So for any tree, the number of valid weight assignments is 1? Or 2^{something}? Wait in this example, it's 1. But what if the tree is different?\n    \n    # Let's take a simple case of n=4. Suppose the tree is a chain 1-2-3-4. Let's try to assign weights.\n    \n    # The constraints are:\n    # For vertex 1: w_12 = -1\n    # For vertex 2: w_12 * w_23 = -1 → (-1)*w_23 = -1 → w_23 = 1\n    # For vertex 3: w_23 * w_34 = -1 → 1 * w_34 = -1 → w_34 = -1\n    # For vertex 4: w_34 = -1 → satisfies.\n    \n    # So there is exactly one valid assignment for this tree. Hence, for this tree, the number of valid weightings is 1.\n    \n    # So perhaps for any tree, there is exactly one valid weighting that satisfies the conditions. If that is true, then the total number of good trees is the number of trees multiplied by 1, i.e., n^{n-2}.\n    \n    # But wait in the sample for n=4, the note says there are 16 good trees. For n=4, Cayley's formula says there are 4^{2} = 16 trees. So for each tree, there is exactly one valid weighting. Hence, the total number of good trees is n^{n-2} for even n. That matches with the sample for n=4: 16 good trees.\n    \n    # So the number of good trees is n^{n-2} when n is even, and 0 otherwise.\n    \n    # Now, the problem asks for the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees. Since each good tree corresponds to exactly one tree structure with exactly one weighting, the sum is equal to the sum of d(1,n) for all possible tree structures, where each tree has its unique weighting.\n    \n    # So now the problem reduces to: for each tree structure, compute d(1,n) under its unique weighting, and sum over all trees.\n    \n    # The question now is: what is the sum of d(1,n) across all tree structures, with each tree having its unique weighting?\n    \n    # Let's think about what d(1,n) represents. It's the sum of the weights along the path from 1 to n in the tree. Since each tree has a unique weighting, we need to find for each tree, what is the sum of the weights on the path from 1 to n, and then sum that over all trees.\n    \n    # How can we compute this sum efficiently?\n    \n    # Let's think about the properties of the weighting. For any tree, the weighting is uniquely determined by the constraints. For example, in the star-shaped tree, the edges from the center to leaves are all -1. The path from 1 to n is a single edge (if n is a leaf), so d(1,n) is -1.\n    \n    # In the chain example, the path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-3-4, with weights -1, 1, -1. Sum is -1+1-1 = -1.\n    \n    # Wait, but in the sample for n=4, the sum was -10. Let's see: for 16 trees, the sum was -10. So if each tree contributes -1, the sum would be -16, which is not the case. So clearly, the contribution varies depending on the tree structure.\n    \n    # So we need to find the average contribution of d(1,n) across all trees, multiplied by the number of trees (n^{n-2}).\n    \n    # But how to find this average?\n    \n    # Let's think about the unique weighting for a given tree. For any tree, the weights are determined by the constraints. Let's think about the constraints again.\n    \n    # For any tree, the weighting is uniquely determined. How?\n    \n    # Let's consider building the tree as a rooted tree, with root at node 1. For each node, we can assign the weight of the edge from its parent to it. The constraint for the root is that the product of its incident edges equals -1. For non-root nodes, their constraint is that the product of their incident edges equals -1. But since each non-root node has exactly one parent (in the rooted tree), the other edges are to children. But how does this help?\n    \n    # Alternatively, let's consider that for any tree, the weighting is determined by choosing an arbitrary spanning tree and assigning weights such that for each node, the product of its incident edges is -1.\n    \n    # Perhaps there's a clever way to model this. Let me think of the weighting as follows: for each edge, its weight is determined by the product of the constraints of the nodes it connects.\n    \n    # But perhaps a better approach is to think recursively. For a tree, the weight of each edge can be determined based on the constraints of the nodes.\n    \n    # Let's imagine that we have a tree, and we want to determine the weights of the edges. Let's pick a root (say node 1). For each node, we can assign the weight of the edge from its parent to it. For example, for the root, it has no parent. So the product of all edges incident to the root must be -1. For each child of the root, the edge weight is chosen such that the product for the child is satisfied, and so on.\n    \n    # Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a tree rooted at node 1. For each node u, let's denote the edge from u to its parent as e. The weight of this edge will be determined based on the constraints.\n    \n    # For the root node (node 1), the product of all edges incident to it must be -1. These edges are all the edges connecting node 1 to its children. Let's say node 1 has degree d. The product of the weights of these edges is -1. For each child v of node 1, the edge from 1 to v has weight w. The constraint for node v is that the product of its incident edges (including the edge to its parent, 1) times the product of the edges to its children must be -1. But this seems complex.\n    \n    # Maybe there's a pattern. Let's think about the unique weighting for a tree. For any tree, the product of the weights of the edges on any path from the root to a leaf is -1^{depth}? Not sure.\n    \n    # Alternatively, let's think about the product of the weights around each node. For node u, the product of all incident edges is -1. This includes the edge from u to its parent (if any) and all edges to its children. Let's assume that the tree is rooted at node 1. For each node u, let's denote the weight of the edge from u to its parent as w_u. Then, the product of the weights of all edges incident to u is w_u * product of weights of edges from u to its children. This must be -1. So, product of weights of edges from u to its children = -1 / w_u.\n    \n    # But how to determine w_u? Let's think recursively. Starting from the root node 1, which has no parent. Its product of incident edges is the product of the weights of edges to its children. This product must be -1. So, for the root, the product of the weights of its edges to its children is -1. Now, for each child v of the root, the product of its incident edges includes the edge to its parent (w_v) and the product of its edges to its children. This must be -1. So:\n\n    # w_v * (product of edges from v to its children) = -1.\n\n    # But from the root's perspective, the product of edges from the root to its children is -1. For each child v, the product of edges from v to its children is -1 / w_v. So, for the root's child v, the product of its edges to its children is -1 / w_v.\n\n    # This suggests that the weight of the edge from the root to v is chosen such that the product of the edges from v to its children is determined. But how is w_v determined?\n\n    # It seems that the weights are determined recursively. For example, for the root, the product of its edges to children is -1. For each child v, the weight of the edge from the root to v (w_v) can be chosen freely, but the product of the edges from v to its children is -1 / w_v. But then, for the next level, the same logic applies.\n\n    # However, this suggests that there is some degree of freedom in choosing the weights. But earlier examples suggest that for certain trees, there is exactly one valid weighting. This contradiction implies that my reasoning is flawed.\n\n    # Let's go back to the earlier example of a star-shaped tree with n=4. Root is 1, connected to nodes 2, 3, 4. The product of edges for node 1 is w_12 * w_13 * w_14 = -1. For each leaf node (say node 2), the product of its incident edges is w_12 = -1. Similarly for nodes 3 and 4. Thus, w_12 = w_13 = w_14 = -1. Substituting into the root's equation: (-1)^3 = -1, which is correct. So there's exactly one solution. So in this case, the weights are uniquely determined.\n\n    # Let's take another example: a chain of 4 nodes 1-2-3-4. Root is 1. The edge from 1 to 2 has weight w_2. Node 2 has children (node 3). The product of incident edges for node 2 is w_2 * w_3 (edge to node 3) = -1. For node 3, the product of its incident edges is w_3 * w_4 (edge to node 4) = -1. For node 4, the product of its incident edges is w_4 = -1. So solving from the bottom up:\n\n    # w_4 = -1.\n    # For node 3: w_3 * w_4 = -1 → w_3 * (-1) = -1 → w_3 = 1.\n    # For node 2: w_2 * w_3 = -1 → w_2 * 1 = -1 → w_2 = -1.\n    # For node 1: the product of its incident edges is w_2 = -1, which satisfies the condition for node 1.\n\n    # So again, the weights are uniquely determined.\n\n    # So it seems that for any tree, there is exactly one valid weighting. Hence, the number of good trees is n^{n-2} for even n, and 0 otherwise.\n\n    # Now, the challenge is to compute the sum of d(1,n) over all such trees.\n\n    # Let's think about d(1,n) for a given tree. It's the sum of the weights along the unique path from 1 to n. Let's call this path P.\n\n    # How can we find the expected value of this sum across all trees, and multiply by the number of trees?\n\n    # Let's think about the contribution of each edge to the total sum. For each edge e, how many times does it appear in the path from 1 to n in all possible trees? And what is its weight in those trees?\n\n    # But the weight of each edge depends on the tree's structure and its unique weighting. This seems complex.\n\n    # However, perhaps there's a symmetry or pattern that can be exploited.\n\n    # Let's consider the following observation: for any tree, the path from 1 to n is a unique simple path. The sum of the weights along this path is d(1,n). But the weighting of the edges is determined uniquely by the constraints.\n\n    # Let's think about the entire tree. For any tree, the product of the weights along the path from 1 to n is equal to the product of the weights of all edges on that path. But how does this relate to the constraints?\n\n    # Let's consider the product of the weights of all edges incident to node 1. This product is -1. The edges incident to node 1 include the edges on the path from 1 to n, and possibly other edges (if node 1 has multiple children).\n\n    # This seems too vague. Let's think differently.\n\n    # Let's consider the unique weighting for any tree. The constraints imply that for every node, the product of its incident edges is -1. Let's take the product of all these constraints for all nodes. This gives (product of all edges)^2 = (-1)^n. Since n is even, this is 1. So this is consistent.\n\n    # Now, let's consider the product of the weights along the path from 1 to n. Let's denote this product as P. What is P?\n\n    # Let's think about the product of the weights of all edges in the tree. Let's denote this as Q. We know that Q^2 = 1. So Q = ±1.\n\n    # However, the product of the weights along the path from 1 to n is P. How does this relate to Q?\n\n    # Not sure. Let's think about the tree as a whole. For each node, the product of its incident edges is -1. So for the entire tree, the product of all these products is (-1)^n. Which is equal to Q^2, as discussed earlier.\n\n    # Now, for the path from 1 to n, let's consider the product of the weights along this path. Let's call it P. Also, consider the product of the weights of all edges not on this path. Let's call it R. Then Q = P * R.\n\n    # But I don't know how to use this.\n\n    # Let's try to find a relationship between P and the constraints. For example, consider the product of the weights around the nodes on the path from 1 to n.\n\n    # Let's take node 1. Its incident edges include the first edge on the path to n, and possibly other edges. The product of all its incident edges is -1. Similarly for other nodes on the path.\n\n    # This seems too vague again. Let's try to find a pattern from the samples.\n\n    # For n=2, there is one good tree, and d(1,2) = -1. So sum is -1.\n\n    # For n=4, the sum is -10. Let's think about what this might represent.\n\n    # Let's consider that for each tree, the contribution is the sum of the weights on the path from 1 to n. Let's think about the expected value of this sum across all trees.\n\n    # Let's consider that for each edge in the tree, its contribution to the sum depends on whether it lies on the path from 1 to n in the tree.\n\n    # But since each tree is considered, and for each tree, the path from 1 to n is unique, it's challenging to find a direct formula.\n\n    # However, let's consider the following: for any tree, the path from 1 to n is a unique path. Let's consider the contribution of each edge to the sum across all trees.\n\n    # Let's consider the number of trees in which a particular edge e is on the path from 1 to n. Let's call this count C(e). For each such tree, the weight of edge e is either 1 or -1, depending on the constraints. But how to find the sum of the weights of e across all trees where it is on the path?\n\n    # This seems complex, but perhaps there's a symmetry. For example, for each edge e, the number of trees where it is on the path from 1 to n is the same for all edges, and the average weight of e in such trees is zero.\n\n    # But this might not be the case.\n\n    # Let's think about the total sum of d(1,n) across all trees. Let's denote this as S.\n\n    # For each tree T, let P(T) be the path from 1 to n, and let W(T) be the sum of weights on P(T). Then S = sum_T W(T).\n\n    # Now, let's consider that for each edge e, let's compute the contribution to S from e. That is, for all trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, add the weight of e in that tree.\n\n    # So S = sum_e [sum_{trees T where e is on P(T)} w_e(T)].\n\n    # Now, if we can compute for each edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n, and the average weight of e in those trees, then we can compute S.\n\n    # But how?\n\n    # First, let's find the number of trees where a particular edge e is on the path from 1 to n.\n\n    # Let's fix an edge between nodes u and v. How many trees include this edge and have it on the path from 1 to n?\n\n    # To count this, we can think about the number of trees where the edge e is present, and it lies on the path from 1 to n.\n\n    # For any tree, the number of trees containing edge e is (n-1)^{n-3} * 2^{n-1} / ...? No, this is not helpful.\n\n    # Wait, the total number of trees is n^{n-2} (from Cayley's formula). For any particular pair of nodes u and v, the number of trees that contain the edge between u and v is n^{n-3} * 2. Wait, no, the number of labeled trees on n nodes that contain a specific edge is n^{n-3} * 1 (since for each tree, the number of trees containing a specific edge is n^{n-3} * 1, because adding the edge to a tree on n-1 nodes).\n\n    # Actually, the number of trees containing a specific edge uv is (n-1)^{n-3} * 1? No, according to Cayley's formula, the number of trees containing a specific edge is n^{n-3} * 1. Because if you fix an edge, you can think of it as merging the two components. So for any edge uv, the number of trees containing it is n^{n-3} * 1.\n\n    # But how many of these trees have the edge uv on the path from 1 to n?\n\n    # For a given edge e = uv, the number of trees containing e where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of trees containing e multiplied by the probability that e is on the path from 1 to n in a random tree containing e.\n\n    # In a random tree containing e, what is the probability that e is on the path from 1 to n?\n\n    # This is equivalent to asking: in a tree containing e, what is the probability that the path from 1 to n passes through e?\n\n    # This is a classic problem. For a tree, the number of paths from 1 to n is 1, and the number of trees containing e is fixed. But how to calculate the probability?\n\n    # Let's consider that in any tree, the path from 1 to n is unique. For the edge e = uv to be on this path, the nodes 1 and n must be in different subtrees when the edge e is removed. So, when we remove e, the tree splits into two subtrees. One subtree contains node 1, and the other contains node n. Or vice versa.\n\n    # So, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of ways to choose a tree where e is present, and 1 and n are in different subtrees when e is removed.\n\n    # To count this, let's think of the edge e as connecting two subtrees. Let's say that one subtree has k nodes, and the other has n-k nodes. For the edge e to be on the path from 1 to n, one of the subtrees must contain 1, and the other must contain n. So, for the edge e to be on the path from 1 to n, it must be that 1 is in one subtree and n is in the other.\n\n    # The number of such trees is equal to the number of ways to choose a tree where e is present and 1 and n are in different components when e is removed. This is equal to the number of trees where e is present multiplied by the probability that 1 and n are in different components when e is removed.\n\n    # But how to calculate this? For a given edge e, the number of trees where e is present and 1 and n are in different components when e is removed is equal to the number of ways to build a tree where one component has 1 and the other has n. This can be calculated using the formula: if we split the tree into two parts, one containing 1 and the other containing n, then the number of such trees is (k^{k-2} * (n-k)^{n-k-2}) * 1), where k is the size of the component containing 1, and (n-k) is the size of the component containing n. But since e is fixed, this is not directly applicable.\n\n    # Alternatively, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is equal to the number of trees containing e multiplied by the probability that in a random tree containing e, the path from 1 to n goes through e.\n\n    # This probability is equal to the probability that 1 and n are in different subtrees when e is removed. Let's think of this as follows: when we remove e, the tree splits into two subtrees. Let's say one subtree has size a and the other has size b, where a + b = n. The probability that 1 is in one subtree and n is in the other is 2 * (a * b) / (n * (n-1)) )? Not sure.\n\n    # This seems complicated. Let's instead recall that for any edge e in a random tree, the probability that it lies on the path between two specific nodes u and v is 2/(n). This is a known result. Wait, for two distinct nodes u and v, the number of trees where the edge e is on the path from u to v is (number of trees containing e) * probability that e is on the path. But I'm not sure about the exact value.\n\n    # However, let's consider that for any two distinct nodes u and v, the number of trees where the edge e is on the path from u to v is (n-2) * n^{n-4}. But I'm not sure.\n\n    # Let's think differently. For the problem at hand, we need to find the sum over all trees of d(1,n). Let's think about the contribution of each edge to this sum.\n\n    # For a given edge e, let's calculate the total contribution of e to all good trees. This is equal to the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n multiplied by the expected value of the weight of e in such trees.\n\n    # If we can find this for each edge, we can sum over all edges to get the total sum S.\n\n    # Let's denote that for each edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is C_e, and the average weight of e in such trees is w_e_avg. Then, the contribution of e is C_e * w_e_avg.\n\n    # Now, what is w_e_avg? For each tree where e is on the path from 1 to n, the weight of e is determined by the constraints. But how?\n\n    # Recall that for any tree, the weight of each edge is uniquely determined by the constraints. Let's think about how the weight of e is determined.\n\n    # Let's consider the tree as a rooted tree at node 1. For any edge e = uv, let's assume u is the parent of v. Then, the weight of e is determined based on the constraints of the nodes.\n\n    # But this is getting too abstract. Let's think about the overall contribution of all edges. \n\n    # Let's consider the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees. For each good tree, d(1,n) is the sum of the weights on the path from 1 to n. Let's denote this path as P. So, the sum over all trees is the sum over all trees of the sum of the weights on P, which is the same as the sum over all edges of the number of trees where the edge is on P multiplied by the weight of the edge in those trees.\n\n    # Now, let's think about the total sum S. For each tree, the sum of weights on P is d(1,n). So S = sum_{trees} d(1,n).\n\n    # Let's consider the average value of d(1,n) across all good trees, multiplied by the number of good trees. Let's denote the number of good trees as T = n^{n-2} for even n.\n\n    # Let's think about the average value of d(1,n). For each edge e, what is the contribution to this average?\n\n    # Let's denote that for each edge e, the probability that it is on the path from 1 to n in a random good tree is p_e. And the expected value of the weight of e in such cases is w_e.\n\n    # Then, the average value of d(1,n) is sum_e p_e * w_e.\n\n    # Multiplying by T gives the total sum S = T * sum_e p_e * w_e.\n\n    # Now, the question is: what is p_e and w_e?\n\n    # Let's think about p_e. For a random good tree, the probability that edge e is on the path from 1 to n is the same as the probability that it is on the path in a random tree (since the weighting doesn't affect the structure of the tree). So p_e is the same as in a random tree, which is 2/n for any edge e not involving 1 or n? Or is it different?\n\n    # This is a critical point. For a random labeled tree, the probability that a particular edge e is on the path from 1 to n is 2/(n). This is a well-known result. For example, in a random tree, the number of trees where the edge e is on the path from 1 to n is 2 * n^{n-3} (since there are n^{n-2} trees in total, and each edge is in 2 * n^{n-3} trees). Wait, let me verify.\n\n    # The total number of trees is n^{n-2}. For a fixed edge e, the number of trees containing e is n^{n-3} * 2? No, it's n^{n-3} * 1. Because when you fix an edge, the number of trees containing it is n^{n-3} (from the formula for the number of trees containing a specific edge).\n\n    # Now, for a fixed edge e, how many of these trees have e on the path from 1 to n?\n\n    # Let's say the edge connects nodes u and v. For the edge to be on the path from 1 to n, one of u or v must be in the subtree containing 1, and the other must be in the subtree containing n. This is similar to the concept of a bridge between two parts of the tree.\n\n    # The number of such trees is equal to the number of ways to connect the two subtrees such that 1 is in one and n is in the other. This is equal to the number of ways to choose a tree where e is present and 1 and n are in different subtrees when e is removed.\n\n    # To calculate this, we can use the fact that for any edge e, the number of trees where e is on the path from 1 to n is (number of trees containing e) * (probability that in a random tree containing e, 1 and n are in different subtrees when e is removed).\n\n    # Let's denote that when we remove e, the tree splits into two subtrees. Let's say one subtree has k nodes, and the other has (n-k) nodes. The probability that 1 is in one subtree and n is in the other is (k * (n-k)) / (C(n,2)) ? No, that's not correct.\n\n    # Actually, for a random tree containing e, the probability that 1 and n are in different subtrees when e is removed is 2/(n) * (n-2) ? Not sure.\n\n    # Alternatively, for any tree containing e, the probability that 1 and n are in different subtrees is 2/(n) * (n-1)/something. This is getting too stuck.\n\n    # Let's return to the sample for n=2. For n=2, there is only one tree, and the edge is on the path. So the contribution is -1. For n=4, the sum is -10.\n\n    # Let's consider the contribution of each edge in the sum S. For n=4, there are 4^{2} = 16 good trees. Let's assume that each edge is on the path from 1 to 4 in some number of trees.\n\n    # Let's think about the number of edges in the tree. For a tree with n nodes, there are n-1 edges. For n=4, there are 3 edges per tree.\n\n    # Let's say that for each edge, the number of trees where it is on the path from 1 to 4 is C. Then, the total contribution from all edges is 3*C * w_avg, where w_avg is the average weight of the edge in those cases.\n\n    # But for n=4, the total sum is -10. Let's see: if each edge contributes -10/3, but this is not an integer. So this suggests that the assumption is wrong.\n\n    # Alternatively, let's think about the average value of d(1,n) for all good trees. For n=4, it is -10 / 16 = -5/8.\n\n    # But how to generalize this?\n\n    # Let's think about the contribution of each edge to the sum S. Let's assume that for each edge e, the number of trees where it is on the path from 1 to n is C_e, and the average weight of e in those trees is w_e_avg.\n\n    # For n=2, there is one edge, and C_e = 1, w_e_avg = -1. So S = 1 * -1 = -1, which matches.\n\n    # For n=4, let's say that each of the 3 edges contributes to S. Let's assume that for each edge, C_e is 2, and the average weight is -1. Then total contribution would be 3 * 2 * -1 = -6, which is less than -10. So this is not correct.\n\n    # Another approach: let's think about the sum S for even n. Let's assume that for each tree, the sum d(1,n) is -1 * (number of edges on the path from 1 to n). But this is not true, as seen in the n=4 example.\n\n    # Alternatively, let's think about the sum of d(1,n) over all good trees as - (number of good trees) * (number of edges on the path from 1 to n in a random tree). But this is also not clear.\n\n    # Let's think back to the constraints on the weighting. For any tree, the product of the weights of all edges incident to a node is -1. For the root node (1), this means that the product of all its incident edges is -1. For the leaf node n, this means that the product of its incident edges is -1. The path from 1 to n is a single path, and the product of the weights along this path is related to the constraints of the nodes on the path.\n\n    # Let's consider the product of the weights along the path from 1 to n. Let's denote this product as P. For each node on the path, the product of its incident edges is -1. Let's consider the product of these products for all nodes on the path.\n\n    # For example, let's say the path has k nodes. The product of the products for these nodes is (-1)^k. On the other hand, each edge on the path is counted twice (once for each endpoint), and the edges not on the path are counted once (for the nodes on the path). This seems complex.\n\n    # Let's consider a simple case: n=4, and the path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-3-4. The product of the weights on this path is w_12 * w_23 * w_34. The product of the incident edges for node 1 is w_12 = -1. For node 2, it's w_12 * w_23 = -1 → w_23 = 1. For node 3, it's w_23 * w_34 = -1 → w_34 = -1. For node 4, it's w_34 = -1. So the product of the path is -1 * 1 * -1 = 1. \n\n    # Now, the sum d(1,4) is -1 + 1 -1 = -1. So for this tree, the contribution is -1.\n\n    # Let's take another tree for n=4, say 1-2-4, 1-3-4. The path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-4 or 1-3-4, but in this case, it's a tree with 1 connected to 2 and 3, and 2 connected to 4, 3 connected to 4. The path from 1 to 4 could be 1-2-4 or 1-3-4. Wait, but in a tree, there is only one path. So for this tree, the path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-4 or 1-3-4? No, it depends on the structure. Let's say the tree is 1-2-4 and 1-3-4. Then the path from 1 to 4 is either 1-2-4 or 1-3-4, but this is not a tree. It would have cycles. So this is not a valid tree.\n\n    # Let's take a tree where the path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-4. The other edge is 1-3. Let's calculate the weights.\n\n    # For node 1: incident edges are w_12 and w_13. Their product is -1.\n\n    # For node 2: incident edges are w_12 and w_24. Product is -1.\n\n    # For node 4: incident edge is w_24. Product is -1 → w_24 = -1.\n\n    # For node 2: w_12 * w_24 = -1 → w_12 * (-1) = -1 → w_12 = 1.\n\n    # For node 1: w_12 * w_13 = -1 → 1 * w_13 = -1 → w_13 = -1.\n\n    # So the path from 1 to 4 is 1-2-4, with weights 1 and -1. Sum is 1 + (-1) = 0. So this tree contributes 0.\n\n    # So for this tree, the contribution is 0. Hence, the sum S for n=4 is not simply -1 per tree.\n\n    # This suggests that the contribution varies depending on the structure of the tree. Hence, it's challenging to find a direct formula.\n\n    # Let's try to find a pattern from the samples.\n\n    # For n=2, S = -1 = -1 * 1.\n\n    # For n=4, S = -10 = -1 * 10.\n\n    # Let's see what 10 is in terms of n. For n=4, 10 = 4 * 2 + 2. Or 10 = 4 * 2 + 2. Not sure.\n\n    # Let's think about the sum for n=2 and n=4. For n=2, it's -1. For n=4, it's -10. Let's see if there's a pattern like S = - (n-1) * (n-2) * ... ?\n\n    # For n=2: -1 = -1 * 1.\n\n    # For n=4: -10 = - (4-1) * (4-2) = -3 * 2 = -6. No, not matching.\n\n    # Alternative: for n=2, the sum is -1 = -1 * 1.\n\n    # For n=4, the sum is -10 = -1 * 10. Let's see if 10 is (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) / 2. For n=4, 3*2*1/2 = 3, no.\n\n    # Let's think about the sample for n=4. There are 16 good trees. The sum is -10. Let's see what -10 is in terms of n. It is - (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) / 3? For n=4, 3*2*1 / 3 = 2, no. Not matching.\n\n    # Another approach: let's think about the contribution of each edge in the sum S. For a given edge e, the number of trees where it is on the path from 1 to n is C_e, and the average weight of e in those trees is w_e_avg.\n\n    # For n=2, there is one edge, C_e = 1, w_e_avg = -1. Contribution is -1.\n\n    # For n=4, let's assume that each of the 3 edges in a tree contributes to the sum. Let's say that for each edge, C_e is 4 (since there are 16 trees, and 4 trees for each edge?), and w_e_avg is -0.5. Then total contribution would be 3 * 4 * -0.5 = -6, which is less than -10.\n\n    # This is getting too stuck. Let's try to find a pattern from the sample.\n\n    # For n=2, the answer is -1 = -1 * 1.\n\n    # For n=4, the answer is -10 = -1 * 10.\n\n    # Let's see if 10 is 2 * 5, or 5 * 2. For n=4, 5 is (n^2 - 1)/3 = (16-1)/3 = 5. Yes! For n=2, (4-1)/3 = 1, which matches. So for n=2, it's -1 * 1 = -1. For n=4, it's -1 * 10 = -10.\n\n    # Let's check this hypothesis. For n=2, (n^2 -1)/3 = (4-1)/3 = 1. For n=4, (16-1)/3 = 5. But 5 * 2 = 10. So the formula could be - (n^2 -1)/3 * 2.\n\n    # But for n=2, this would give - (3/3)*2 = -2, which is not the sample.

No, 4+1 is 5.\n\n    # Alternatively, 10 = 4 * 2 + 2. Not sure.\n\n    # Let's think about the number of good trees for even n. It is n^{n-2}. For n=2, it is 1. For n=4, it is 16.\n\n    # For n=2, the sum is -1 = -1 * 1 = -1 * (n^{n-2}).\n\n    # For n=4, the sum is -10 = -10 * 1 = -10 * (n^{n-2} / 16). But 10 is not related to 16.\n\n    # This is not helping. Let's think about the sum S for even n.\n\n    # Let's consider that for any good tree, the sum d(1,n) is -1 * (number of edges on the path from 1 to n). But this is not true for n=4, where some trees contribute 0.\n\n    # Another idea: for any good tree, the sum d(1,n) is -1. But this is not true for n=4, as seen in the example where the contribution was 0.\n\n    # This suggests that the sum is not uniform across all trees.\n\n    # Given the time constraints, I'll refer back to the sample for n=4 and try to find a pattern.\n\n    # Sample for n=4: sum is -10. Let's see what -10 is in terms of n.\n\n    # For n=4, the number of good trees is 16. The sum is -10. So the average is -10/16 = -5/8.\n\n    # Let's see if this average can be expressed as - (n-1)/2^{n-1} or something similar. For n=4, (4-1)/2^{3} = 3/8. -3/8 is not -5/8. No.\n\n    # Let's think about the number of edges on the path from 1 to n in a random tree. For a random tree, the length of the path from 1 to n is a random variable. For n=4, the average length is 2. For example, in a tree with 4 nodes, the path from 1 to 4 can be length 2 (like 1-2-4) or length 3 (like 1-2-3-4). The average length is (number of trees with path length 2 * 2 + number with length 3 * 3) / total trees.\n\n    # For n=4, there are 4^{2} = 16 trees. Let's calculate how many have path length 2 and how many have path length 3.\n\n    # The number of trees where the path from 1 to 4 has length 2: this is the number of trees where 1 and 4 are connected via a single intermediate node. Let's say the intermediate node is 2 or 3.\n\n    # For example, the tree could be 1-2-4, 1-3-4, or 1-2-3-4 (no, that has length 3).\n\n    # Wait, for a path of length 2, 1 and 4 are connected directly through one other node. The number of such trees is 2 * (number of ways to connect the remaining nodes).\n\n    # This is getting too complex, but let's assume that for n=4, the average length is 2.5. Then, if the average weight is -1, the average contribution would be -2.5, leading to total sum of -2.5 * 16 = -40, which is not the sample.\n\n    # At this point, I'm stuck and need to find a different approach.\n\n    # Let's think about the constraints again. For any good tree, the product of the weights of all edges incident to a node is -1. This implies that for each node, the number of -1 edges incident to it is odd.\n\n    # Let's consider the sum d(1,n). It is the sum of the weights on the path from 1 to n. Let's denote this path as P.\n\n    # Now, let's consider the product of the weights of all edges on P. Let's call this product P_prod.\n\n    # For each node on the path P, the product of its incident edges is -1. Let's consider the product of these products for all nodes on P.\n\n    # Each edge on P is incident to two nodes on P, and each edge not on P is incident to one node on P and one node not on P.\n\n    # The product of the products for all nodes on P is (-1)^k, where k is the number of nodes on P. This product is equal to (product of P_prod^2) * (product of weights of edges not on P and incident to nodes on P).\n\n    # This seems too complex.\n\n    # Given the time constraints, I'll refer to the sample for n=4 and try to find a pattern.
