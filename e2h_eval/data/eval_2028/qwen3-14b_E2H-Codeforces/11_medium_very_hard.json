A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible number based on the constraints of each resource.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each friend needs nl milliliters of drink per toast. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl ml? Or per friend? Wait the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" Oh right. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends has their own nl.\n\nSimilarly, each toast requires one slice per friend. So for one toast, n slices are needed. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the resources available:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml. How many toasts can this support? Let's say total toasts is t. Then total drink needed is t * n * nl. So the maximum t based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, since each toast requires per friend, so yes.\n\nFor the limes: each lime is cut into d slices. So total slices available is c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So maximum t based on limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: total available is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So maximum t based on salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink: 4*5 = 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml. Wait, because per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which matches the example's note where they said 20/3=6 toasts. Wait wait, no. Wait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 ml per friend. So for each toast, 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222... which would be 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Wait that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". Oh wait, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So per toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. But in the example, the input is nl=3. So per toast, 3 * 3 = 9 ml. But the note says that 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait that would imply that per toast, 3 ml is used. Which would be per friend. So maybe the note is considering per toast per friend. So the total number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts, so total drink is t * n * nl. But perhaps the note is calculating the total possible toasts as (total drink) / (per toast per friend drink) ?\n\nWait the note says: \"Overall the friends have 4*5=20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20/3=6 toasts.\" So according to that, each toast requires 3 ml. But how?\n\nAh! Maybe the problem is that the note is considering per toast per friend. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. But if you have t toasts, then total drink is t * n * nl. So the maximum t is (total_drink) / (n * nl). But the note says 20 / 3 = 6. Which would be (total_drink) / (nl) divided by n? Or perhaps the note is wrong? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So the 6 comes from 20 / 3. Which suggests that the drink allows for 6 toasts. But according to the calculation, if each toast requires 3 * 3 = 9 ml, then 20 / 9 is 2.222, which would be 2. So why does the note say 6?\n\nThis is a critical point. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So if there are t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts. So for each friend, they need t * nl ml. For all friends, total drink needed is n * t * nl.\n\nBut in the note, the total drink is 20 ml. So n=3, nl=3. So total drink needed for t toasts is 3 * t * 3 = 9t. So 9t <= 20 → t ≤ 2.222, so 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Which implies that the total drink is 20, and 20 / (something) =6.\n\nSo what's the something? 20 / 6 = 3.333. So maybe the per toast per friend is 3.333? Which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the note is wrong? Or maybe I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So the 6 comes from drink. So how is that calculated? Let me check the note's explanation again.\n\nIn the note, the drink is 4*5=20 ml. The example input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. The note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. So 20 divided by 3 equals 6. So that suggests that per toast, the total drink required is 3 ml. Which would be per toast, not per friend. But how?\n\nAh! Maybe the problem is that the per toast is per friend. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, the total drink is n * nl. But in the note, the calculation is 20 / 3 = 6. Which would be 20 divided by (nl) equals 6. So that would be 20 / 3 = 6. So that would mean that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be per toast, not per friend. Which contradicts the problem statement.\n\nWait the problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So for each toast, each friend uses nl. So for one toast, total is n * nl. So for t toasts, it's t * n * nl.\n\nBut in the note, the example says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 20/(nl) = t. So that would imply that the total drink is t * nl. Which would be that per toast, the total drink is nl. Which would be per toast, not per friend. So this is conflicting.\n\nSo perhaps the problem statement is different. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. Therefore, for one toast, total drink is n * nl. For t toasts, total is t * n * nl. So the maximum t based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nBut in the note, the example shows that with 20 ml, and nl=3, the drink allows 6 toasts. Which would be 20/(3) = 6.666. So that would be 6 toasts. But according to the formula above, it's 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222, so 2 toasts. Which is different.\n\nSo why is the note's calculation different? That suggests that there's a misunderstanding here. Let me re-examine the note.\n\nIn the note, the example says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. But why? Because the problem says that each toast requires per friend nl. So for each toast, each friend needs nl. So for one toast, all friends together need n * nl. So for t toasts, the total is t * n * nl. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nBut according to the note, the calculation is (k*l) divided by nl. Which would be 20 / 3 = 6.666. So the note's approach is to divide by nl, not by (n * nl). Which suggests that perhaps the problem statement is different. Maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total per toast is nl. Like, for each toast, the total is nl, not per friend. But that would contradict the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for each toast, each friend needs nl. So for one toast, the total is n * nl. But the note says that the drink allows for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be 20 / (nl) = 6.666. Which suggests that the total per toast is nl. So for example, for each toast, the total drink is nl. Which would be that per toast, all friends together use nl. But that would be per toast, not per friend.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me recheck the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for each toast, each friend needs these. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for example, if there are 3 friends and one toast, each of them uses 3 ml, so total is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So the total drink is 3 * 3 * t, where t is the number of toasts.\n\nBut according to the note, the total drink is 20 ml. So 3 * 3 * t <= 20 → 9t <= 20 → t = 2. But the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which is 20 / 3 = 6. So that suggests that the total drink needed is 3 * t. Which would be per toast, each friend uses 1 ml. But the problem says that each friend uses nl=3 ml per toast. So this seems contradictory.\n\nWait maybe the problem statement is written differently. Let me recheck the problem statement once again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend consumes nl ml. So for one toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend drinks t * nl ml. So total for all friends is n * t * nl ml.\n\nSo the total drink available is k * l. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nIn the first example, the input is n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. n * nl is 3 * 3 = 9. So 20//9 is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2. However, the note says that the drink allows for 20/3=6 toasts. Which suggests that the calculation was done as (k*l) // nl. Which would be 20//3 = 6. But that would be incorrect according to the problem statement.\n\nBut according to the note, the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So the 6 comes from drink. But according to our calculation, the drink allows for 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which suggests that the problem's actual calculation is (k*l) // nl, and then divided by n. Or perhaps that the drink allows for (k*l) // nl toasts per friend, and then divided by n.\n\nWait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So the 6 is the drink's capacity. So how is that 6 calculated?\n\nIf the drink is 20 ml, and each toast requires per friend nl=3 ml, then for each toast, the total drink is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 = 2.222. So the drink allows for 2 toasts. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So how?\n\nAh! Wait maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per person, but the total per toast is nl. Like, for example, for each toast, the entire group uses nl milliliters. That would make sense if the note's calculation is correct. But that would be a misunderstanding of the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the note is wrong. But that's unlikely. So perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nLet me re-express the note's explanation. The note says:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nSo according to this, the drink allows for 6 toasts. Then, divided by 3 friends, gives 2. But that seems to suggest that each toast requires 3 ml of drink in total, not per friend. But then, if each toast requires 3 ml in total, then for 6 toasts, it's 6 * 3 = 18 ml, which is within 20. But then, how does that relate to the per friend requirement?\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me think again. The problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, each friend has one toast, requiring nl ml. So for one toast, the total is n * nl ml. For example, if there are 3 friends, each toast requires 3 * nl ml. So for the first example, nl is 3. So per toast, total is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. With 20 ml, you can do 2 toasts (2*9=18 ml). But the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts, which would require 6 * 9 = 54 ml, which is more than 20. So this is impossible.\n\nSo why does the note say that the drink allows for 6 toasts? This suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the way the problem is being interpreted. Perhaps the problem is that the per toast is per friend. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. But the total number of toasts per friend is t. So each friend makes t toasts. So for each friend, total drink is t * nl. For all friends, it's n * t * nl. Which is the same as before.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which would be t=6. So the total drink is n * t * nl = 3 * 6 * 3 = 54 ml. But the available is 20. That's impossible.\n\nSo the only way the note's explanation makes sense is if the calculation is:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k*l) // nl. Then, since each toast is per friend, the total number of toasts per friend is drink_toasts // n.\n\nIn the example, drink_toasts = 20 // 3 = 6. Then, divided by n=3, gives 2. Which is the answer. But that would mean that the drink_toasts is the total number of toasts per friend, but that's not matching the problem statement.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the drink is sufficient for t toasts, where each toast requires nl ml per person, and each person makes t toasts. So total drink is n * t * nl. So solving for t gives t = (k*l) / (n * nl). But since t has to be integer, it's floor division. \n\nBut in the note, the example says that the drink allows for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be (k*l) / nl = 20/3 = 6.666, floored to 6. Then, divided by n=3, gives 2. So that's the approach. But why?\n\nThis suggests that the initial approach was wrong. Instead of calculating the maximum t as (k*l) // (n * nl), it's (k*l) // nl, then divided by n. But that would be equivalent to (k*l) // (n * nl) ?\n\nWait, let me compute 20 // 3 = 6. Then 6 // 3 = 2. Which is the same as 20 // (3 * 3) = 20 // 9 = 2. So the two approaches give the same result. \n\nSo perhaps the note is explaining it in terms of total toasts per friend. For example, the total amount of drink allows for 6 toasts per friend, but since there are 3 friends, the total number of toasts that can be made is 6 / 3 = 2. But that's a bit confusing.\n\nBut regardless, the calculation seems to be that for each resource, we calculate the maximum number of toasts that can be made, and then take the minimum of those numbers. But how to calculate those numbers.\n\nLet me think again. The key is to find the maximum t such that:\n\n- Total drink >= t * n * nl\n- Total lime slices >= t * n\n- Total salt >= t * n * np\n\nSo for each resource, the maximum t is:\n\ndrink_t = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_t = (c * d) // n \n\nsalt_t = p // (n * np)\n\nThen the answer is min(drink_t, lime_t, salt_t)\n\nIn the first example:\n\ndrink_t = 20 / (3 * 3) = 20 /9 = 2.222 → 2\n\nlime_t = (10 * 8) // 3 → 80//3 = 26.666 → 26\n\nsalt_t = 100 // (3*1) → 100//3 = 33.333 → 33.\n\nSo min(2, 26, 33) is 2. Which matches the sample output. So this seems correct.\n\nBut the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts, which is the value of (k*l) // nl = 20//3=6. Which is not the same as drink_t. But the note's explanation is wrong? Or perhaps the note is using a different approach.\n\nBut the sample output is correct with the calculation I have. So perhaps the note's explanation is wrong. Or perhaps the note is explaining the drink_t as the total toasts per friend, but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is considering the total number of toasts possible if each toast is made by all friends. For example, for the drink, the total number of toasts possible is 20 / (3) = 6, which would be the number of toasts that can be made if each toast requires 3 ml of drink in total. But that would be a different scenario.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the correct calculation is the one I have. And the sample output aligns with that. So I should proceed with that.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCalculate for each of the three resources, the maximum number of toasts possible, then take the minimum of those three numbers.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l\n\nmax_toasts_by_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nCompute total_lime_slices = c * d\n\nmax_toasts_by_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n\nCompute max_toasts_by_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThe answer is min of those three values.\n\nLet me check the first example:\n\nSample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total_drink = 20.\n\nn * nl = 3 * 3 =9. 20//9 =2.\n\ntotal_lime_slices = 10 * 8 = 80. 80//3 = 26.666 → 26.\n\nsalt: p=100, n * np=3*1=3 → 100//3=33. So min(2, 26, 33) is 2. Correct.\n\nThe note's explanation says that the drink allows for 6 toasts, which is 20//3=6. But according to the correct calculation, that's not the case. But the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. So the note is taking 6, which is (k*l)//nl, then dividing by n. Which gives 6//3=2. Which is the same as the correct calculation. Because (k*l) // (n * nl) is equal to ((k*l) // nl) // n ?\n\nNo, not exactly. For example, 20//3 =6, 6//3=2. Which is the same as 20//9=2. So in this case, it's the same. But is this always true?\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me take a case where (k*l) is not divisible by nl. For example, suppose k*l = 10, nl =3, n=3.\n\nThen (k*l) // (n * nl) = 10 // (3*3) = 10//9=1.\n\nBut ((k*l) // nl) //n = (10//3) //3 = 3//3=1. Same result.\n\nAnother example: k*l= 14, nl=3, n=3. \n\n(k*l) // (n*nl) =14//9=1.\n\n(k*l//nl)=14//3=4. 4//3=1. Same result.\n\nAnother example: k*l= 9, nl=3, n=3. 9//9=1. (9//3)=3//3=1. Same.\n\nAnother example: k*l= 10, nl=3, n=2. \n\ndrink_t = 10/(2*3)=10/6=1.666 →1.\n\n(k*l//nl) is 10//3=3. 3//2=1.5 →1. Same result.\n\nSo in general, (k*l) // (n * nl) is equal to ((k*l) // nl) // n ?\n\nYes. Because (a // b) // c = a // (b * c) ?\n\nNot exactly. For example, let a=7, b=2, c=3. \n\na//b =3, then //c is 1. a//(b*c) is 7//6=1. Same.\n\nAnother example: a=8, b=2, c=3. 8//2=4, 4//3=1. 8//6=1. Same.\n\nAnother example: a=5, b=2, c=3. 5//2=2, 2//3=0. 5//6=0. Same.\n\nSo yes, in general, (a // b) // c = a // (b * c). So the two approaches are equivalent.\n\nTherefore, the note's explanation is correct in the sense that they compute (k*l) // nl = 20//3=6, then divide by n=3 to get 2. Which is the same as (k*l) // (n * nl) = 20//9=2.\n\nSo the note's explanation is just breaking it down into steps, but the calculation is the same.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nWe need to read the input as integers. The input is a single line with 9 integers.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nRead n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\nmax_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nPrint(result)\n\nBut wait, what if any of the denominators are zero? But according to the input constraints, all numbers are at least 1. So no division by zero.\n\nLet me check the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → outputs 2.\n\nWhich is as computed.\n\nSecond example input: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink = 100 * 10 = 1000.\n\nn * nl = 5 *4 =20. 1000//20 = 50.\n\ntotal_lime_slices = 1 *19 =19. max_lime = 19//5 =3 (since 19//5 is 3.8 → 3).\n\nsalt: p=90, n * np =5*3=15 → 90//15=6. So min(50,3,6) is 3. Which matches the sample output of '3'.\n\nThird example input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink = 1,000,000.\n\nn * nl = 10 * 50 =500 → 1e6 // 500 = 2000.\n\ntotal_lime_slices = 25 *23 = 575. max_lime = 575 // 10 = 57.5 → 57.\n\nsalt: p=1, n * np =10 *1 =10 → 1//10 =0. So min(2000,57,0) is 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nThen compute the variables as discussed.\n\nSo:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\n\nmax_lime = total_lime // n\n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nWait, but what if n * nl is zero? But according to the problem statement, all inputs are at least 1. So n >=1, nl >=1. So n * nl >=1. Similarly for other denominators.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting the first example:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → code computes:\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20. n * nl =3*3=9. 20//9=2.\n\ntotal_lime =10*8=80. 80//3=26.\n\nmax_salt = 100 // (3*1) = 33. min(2, 26, 33) → 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: the third sample input:\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink=1,000,000. n * nl=10 *50=500 → 1e6//500=2000.\n\ntotal_lime =25 *23=575 → 575//10=57.5 → 57.\n\nsalt: p=1, n * np =10*1=10 → 1//10=0. So min(2000,57,0) is 0. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend. The solution involves calculating the maximum number of toasts possible based on each resource and then taking the minimum of these values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Drink Available**: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n2. **Determine Maximum Toasts by Drink**: Divide the total drink by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Calculate Total Lime Slices Available**: Multiply the number of limes by the number of slices per lime.\n4. **Determine Maximum Toasts by Limes**: Divide the total lime slices by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n5. **Calculate Maximum Toasts by Salt**: Divide the total salt by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n6. **Determine Result**: The result is the minimum value among the maximum toasts possible from each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntotal_lime = c * d\nmax_lime = total_lime // n\nmax_salt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles (`k`) by the volume per bottle (`l`).\n- **Max Toasts by Drink**: The maximum number of toasts possible based on the drink is determined by dividing the total drink by the product of the number of friends (`n`) and the drink required per toast per friend (`nl`).\n- **Total Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is obtained by multiplying the number of limes (`c`) by the number of slices per lime (`d`).\n- **Max Toasts by Limes**: This is calculated by dividing the total lime slices by the number of slices required per toast for all friends (`n`).\n- **Max Toasts by Salt**: This is determined by dividing the total salt (`p`) by the product of the number of friends (`n`) and the salt required per toast per friend (`np`).\n- **Result Calculation**: The final result is the minimum of the three values calculated above, ensuring that all resources are sufficient for the number of toasts each friend can make.",
