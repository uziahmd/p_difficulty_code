A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all of them make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, no. Wait, each friend needs nl milliliters of drink per toast. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl milliliters. Because each of the n friends has nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl.\n\nSimilarly, each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices are needed. Because each friend uses one slice. And since there are c limes, each cut into d slices, total slices available is c * d. So the number of toasts possible from the lime slices is (c*d) // n. Because each toast needs n slices.\n\nFor the salt, each toast requires n * np grams. Because each of the n friends uses np grams. So total salt per toast is n * np. The total available is p grams. So the number of toasts possible from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the drink: total drink available is k * l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So the number of toasts possible from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values: drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts.\n\nWait, yes. Because each toast requires all three resources. So the maximum number of toasts possible is the minimum of the three possible values.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate total_drink = k * l. Then drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl).\n\nCalculate total_lime_slices = c * d. lime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n.\n\nCalculate salt_toasts = p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts).\n\nWait, but let me check the example.\n\nFirst example input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So for one toast, 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, so floor is 2. Which matches the example's drink_toasts of 6? Wait wait, in the note they said that 20 /3 =6. Wait, what's that?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. But according to my calculation, it's 20/(n * nl) = 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222... which would be 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. Wait why?\n\nOh wait, maybe I have a misunderstanding here. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for each toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink required is n * nl. So for the first example, n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. Total drink is 4*5=20. 20 /9 is 2.222, which would give 2 toasts. But according to the note, the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Wait that suggests that perhaps I have the formula wrong.\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 =6 toasts. But why divided by 3? Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nAh! Oh no! Wait, perhaps the problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for each toast, each friend has nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. But in the note, the example says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would imply that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml, not 3*3. So what's the correct way?\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough for 20 / 3 =6 toasts\". Let me look at the note again. The note says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait wait, why is the drink_toasts 6? Because 20 / 3 =6. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires each friend to have nl ml. So per toast, total is n * nl. So for the first sample, nl is 3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which is 2. But according to the note, it's 20/3 =6. So why?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the note is considering the per toast per friend, but the problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as possible, provided they all drink the same amount. So perhaps the number of toasts per friend is t. So each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl ml. So total drink required is n * t * nl.\n\nBut the total drink available is k * l. So n * t * nl ≤ k * l → t ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl). So the maximum t is floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) )\n\nBut in the note, the sample input has n=3, k=4, l=5, nl=3. So k*l is 20, n * nl is 3*3=9. 20/9 is 2.222, so floor is 2. But according to the note, the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which would be if the total drink is divided by nl, not by n * nl. So why is that?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. But how?\n\nAh! Maybe the note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\nAh! So each friend makes t toasts. For each toast, they need nl ml. So per friend, total drink is t * nl. For all friends, total drink is n * t * nl.\n\nSo the total drink available is k*l. So n * t * nl ≤ k*l → t ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl). So the maximum t is floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) )\n\nBut in the note, the sample says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be if the total drink is divided by nl, not by n * nl. So why?\n\nWait in the note, the sample says that the drink is 20 ml. For each toast, the friends need 3 ml. So 20 /3 =6. But that would be if each toast requires 3 ml total. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires each friend to have nl ml. So for each toast, the total is n * nl. So for 3 friends, each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20 /9 = 2.222, which would be 2. But the note says 6. So why?\n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the problem. Let me re-examine the note.\n\nThe note says: \"the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, so the note is taking the drink toasts as 6, then dividing by 3 (number of friends) to get 2. But that seems odd. Why would the drink toasts be 6?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the note is wrong. Or perhaps the problem is that the note is considering the number of toasts per friend. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think about the note's example. The sample input is:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo total drink is 4*5=20 ml.\n\nEach toast requires each friend to have nl=3 ml. So for one toast, each friend has 3 ml. So for one toast, total drink is 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So for t toasts, total drink is 9*t. Which must be ≤ 20. So t can be 2 (since 9*2=18 ≤20, 9*3=27>20). So the maximum t is 2. Which is the sample's output.\n\nBut according to the note, they say that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would be if per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be the case if each toast requires 1 ml per friend. But that's not the case. So why does the note say that?\n\nWait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. So that implies that the drink_toasts is 6, then divided by 3 (number of friends) gives 2. Which suggests that the initial calculation was the total possible toasts for all friends combined, and then divided by the number of friends to get per friend.\n\nBut that seems wrong. Let me think again.\n\nMaybe the note is wrong? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the note is calculating the total number of toasts that can be made in total (for all friends), and then divides by the number of friends to get the number per friend. But that would be the case if the resources are calculated per toast for all friends.\n\nWait, let's think about the problem again. The question is: How many toasts can each friend make? So each friend makes t toasts. So for each friend, t toasts. So for all friends, total toasts is t * n. Because each of the n friends makes t toasts.\n\nWait no. No. Each toast is made by all friends. Like, if they make one toast, each friend has one toast. So the number of toasts is t. Each friend makes t toasts. So the total number of toasts is t. Not multiplied by n. So the resources are calculated based on t toasts.\n\nSo for example, for the drink: each toast requires n * nl ml. Because for each toast, each of the n friends has nl ml. So for t toasts, total drink is t * n * nl.\n\nSo the drink_toasts is (k*l) // (n * nl). For the first sample, that is 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222 → 2.\n\nBut according to the note, the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be if per toast, the total drink required is nl, not n * nl. So perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for each toast, each friend has nl ml. So for each toast, the total drink is nl * n. But the note says that for the first sample, the drink allows for 20 / 3 =6 toasts. Which would be if each toast requires 3 ml total. Which would be nl =3, but for one toast, total drink is 3 ml. That would be the case if nl is the total per toast, not per friend. But the problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast.\n\nSo perhaps the note is wrong? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. But the total number of toasts is t. So each friend makes t toasts. So the total drink per friend is t * nl. For all friends, total drink is n * t * nl. Which is the same as before.\n\nSo in the first sample, the total drink is 20. So 20 = n * t * nl → 3 * t * 3 = 9t → t = 20 /9 = 2.222. So floor is 2. Which is the sample output. But according to the note, the drink is enough for 20/3 =6 toasts. Which would be if the total drink is 20 = t * nl, implying that t is 20/3 =6.666, which would be 6. But that would be the case if the drink per toast is nl, not per friend.\n\nSo why does the note say that?\n\nLooking back at the note's explanation:\n\n\"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait why 20 /3? Because each toast requires 3 ml. So maybe the note is assuming that per toast, the total drink is nl, not per friend. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the note is wrong. Or perhaps I have misread the problem.\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\nAh! So each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for each toast, per friend, nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. For t toasts, total drink is t * n * nl.\n\nBut in the note, they say that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would be if t * n * nl = 20 → t = 20/(n * nl) → 20/(3*3) = 2.222. But that's not 6. So why does the note say 6?\n\nWait maybe the note is referring to the total number of toasts that can be made for all friends combined, but that doesn't make sense. For example, if each friend makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts is t, not multiplied by n.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the note is considering that each toast is per friend. Like, if each friend makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts across all friends is n * t. But that would be the case if each toast is per person. But that's not how toasting works. Usually, a toast is made by all friends together. So each toast is a single event, and each friend participates in it. So for each toast, each friend has some amount of drink.\n\nSo the problem says that the friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. So the number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend drinks t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl.\n\nSo the note's explanation must have an error. But according to the sample input, the output is 2, which is the minimum between 2 (drink), 80 (lime) and 100 (salt) divided by 3 (number of friends)? No, the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So according to that, the drink_toasts is 6, then divided by 3 gives 2. So how is that 6 computed?\n\nIf the drink_toasts is computed as total_drink / nl, then 20 /3 =6.666, which would be 6. Then, divided by 3 (number of friends) gives 2. That would match the note.\n\nBut why would that be the case?\n\nAh! Maybe the problem is that the note is considering the total number of toasts that can be made for all friends, and then dividing by the number of friends. But that would be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the note is wrong. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nLet me look at the sample input and output again.\n\nSample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSample output is 2.\n\nAccording to the note's explanation:\n\ndrink_toasts = 20 /3 =6. lime_toasts = 10*8 =80. salt_toasts = 100/1=100. Then min(6, 80, 100) is 6. Divided by 3 (number of friends) gives 2. Which is the correct output.\n\nBut why is drink_toasts 6?\n\nBecause the drink_toasts is calculated as (total_drink) / nl. Which would be 20 /3 =6.666, floored to 6. But why?\n\nThat would imply that the total number of toasts (t) is calculated as (total_drink) / (nl) → t = total_drink / nl. But that would be the case if each toast requires nl ml per friend, but the total number of toasts is t, and each toast is per friend. Which is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each toast requires nl ml per friend, and the total number of toasts per friend is t. So for each friend, they have t toasts, each requiring nl ml. So per friend, total drink is t * nl. For all friends, total drink is n * t * nl. So the maximum t is floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) ). Which for the first sample is 20/(3*3) = 2.222 → 2. But the note says it's 6, which is 20/3 =6.666 → 6. Which would be the case if the formula is (k*l) / nl → 20/3 =6.666 → 6. Then, divide by n (3) → 2. Which is the sample output.\n\nSo the note is saying that the drink_toasts is 6, then divided by 3 gives 2. But why?\n\nAh! This suggests that the drink_toasts is calculated as (total_drink) / (nl) → which is the total number of toasts that could be made if each toast required nl ml per friend, but without considering the number of friends. Then, the actual number of toasts per friend is drink_toasts / n.\n\nBut that seems to be the case in the note. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the note is wrong. But given that the sample output is 2, and according to the note's calculation, we have to arrive at that.\n\nSo what is the correct way to compute the number of toasts per friend?\n\nLet me think of the problem again.\n\nEach toast requires:\n\n- For each friend, nl ml of drink. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl.\n\n- For each friend, one slice of lime. So for one toast, total slices needed is n.\n\n- For each friend, np grams of salt. So for one toast, total salt needed is n * np.\n\nSo, the number of toasts possible is limited by:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nlime_toasts = (c*d) // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nIn the first sample:\n\ndrink_toasts = 20 / (3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222 → 2.\n\nlime_toasts = 10 * 8 = 80 slices. 80 / 3 = 26.666 → 26.\n\nsalt_toasts = 100 / (3 * 1) = 33.333 → 33.\n\nMinimum is 2 → answer 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut according to the note, they calculate drink_toasts as 20/3 =6, lime_toasts as 80, salt_toasts as 100, then min is 6, divided by 3 gives 2. Which is the same answer. So why is there a discrepancy in the calculation?\n\nAh! Because the note is wrong. Or perhaps the note is using a different approach. But the sample output is correct.\n\nBut according to the correct calculation, the answer is min(2, 26, 33) = 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut according to the note's calculation, it's min(6, 80, 100) =6, then divided by 3 gives 2. Which is the same answer. So why is that?\n\nBecause the note is calculating the drink_toasts as (k*l) / nl, which is 20/3 =6.666, then divided by n (number of friends) gives 2.222, which is floored to 2.\n\nSo perhaps the correct way is to calculate for each resource:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k*l) // (nl) // n ?\n\nNo, because that would be 20//3=6, then 6//3=2. Which is the same as the note's approach.\n\nBut why?\n\nLet me think: the total drink is k*l. Each toast requires for each friend nl ml. So per toast, total drink is n * nl. So the number of toasts is total_drink // (n * nl). Which is the same as (total_drink // nl) // n ?\n\nYes, because (a // b) // c is equal to a // (b*c) when a, b, c are positive integers.\n\nFor example, 20//3 =6, 6//3=2. 20// (3*3) = 20//9=2.\n\nYes, so both approaches are equivalent.\n\nSo the note's approach is to calculate for each resource:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k*l) // nl // n.\n\nlime_toasts = (c*d) // n // 1 (since each toast needs n slices, so total slices is c*d, and number of toasts is (c*d) // n).\n\nsalt_toasts = p // np // n.\n\nWait, no. For the salt, each toast needs n * np grams. So p // (n * np) is the same as (p // np) // n ?\n\nYes, because p // (n * np) is same as (p // np) // n.\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\ndrink_toasts is 20//3=6, then divided by 3 gives 2.\n\nWhich is the same as 20//(3*3) = 2.\n\nSo the note is calculating drink_toasts as (k*l) // nl, then dividing by n. Which is the same as (k*l) // (nl * n).\n\nSo the three possible toasts are:\n\ndrink_toasts = (k*l) // (nl * n)\n\nlime_toasts = (c*d) // n\n\nsalt_toasts = p // (np * n)\n\nSo the answer is min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts).\n\nBut according to the note's explanation, the drink_toasts is (k*l) // nl, then divided by n. Which is the same as the correct approach.\n\nSo the correct way is to compute each of the three resources' limits, and take the minimum.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_limit = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nlime_slices = c * d\n\nlime_limit = lime_slices // n\n\nsalt_limit = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes.\n\nNow let's test this with the first sample.\n\nSample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\ntotal_drink =4*5=20.\n\ndrink_limit = 20/(3*3) = 20//9 = 2.\n\nlime_slices = 10*8=80. lime_limit = 80//3 =26.\n\nsalt_limit = 100/(3*1) = 33.333 → 33.\n\nmin(2,26,33) → 2. Correct.\n\nIn the note's explanation, they said that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. But according to this approach, drink_limit is 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, then divided by 3 (friends) gives 2. So the note's approach is equivalent.\n\nBut according to the code, the drink_limit is 2, which is the correct value. So the code is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\nSample input 2: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nLet me compute:\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000.\n\ndrink_limit = 1000/(5*4) = 1000/(20)=50.\n\nlime_slices = 1 *19=19. lime_limit = 19//5 =3.\n\nsalt_limit = 90/(5*3) = 90/(15) =6.\n\nmin(50,3,6) → 3. Which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink is 1,000,000.\n\ndrink_limit: 1,000,000 / (10 *50) = 1e6 / 500 = 2000.\n\nlime_slices: 25 *23 = 575. lime_limit: 575 //10 =57.\n\nsalt_limit: 1/(10 *1) = 0.1 → 0.\n\nso min(2000, 57, 0) → 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo the code needs to read the input, compute these three values, take the minimum, and output.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nThen compute the three limits.\n\nNow, for the input, the first line is a list of integers. For example, in the first example, the input is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'.\n\nSo the code can read the input line, split into parts, and convert to integers.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts, and assign variables.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ndrink_limit = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nlime_limit = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt_limit = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if any of the denominators are zero? Well, according to the problem statement, all inputs are positive integers. So n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np are all ≥1. So no division by zero.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nLet me check the third sample input:\n\nInput: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1\n\nn=10, nl=50. So drink_limit = (1000*1000) // (10 *50) = 1,000,000 // 500 = 2000.\n\nlime_limit: 25 *23 = 575 // 10 → 57.\n\nsalt_limit: 1 // (10 *1) → 0.\n\nSo min is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when one of the limits is zero. For example, if p is less than n * np, then salt_limit is zero. So the answer is zero.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a certain amount of salt per friend. The solution involves calculating the maximum possible toasts based on each resource and then taking the minimum of these values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Drink Available**: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n2. **Determine Drink Limit**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available drink, considering each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend.\n3. **Calculate Total Lime Slices Available**: Multiply the number of limes by the number of slices per lime.\n4. **Determine Lime Limit**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available lime slices, considering each toast requires a slice per friend.\n5. **Determine Salt Limit**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available salt, considering each toast requires a specific amount of salt per friend.\n6. **Result Calculation**: The answer is the minimum of the three limits calculated from the drink, lime slices, and salt.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntotal_drink = k * l\ndrink_limit = total_drink // (n * nl)\nlime_limit = (c * d) // n\nsalt_limit = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink_limit, lime_limit, salt_limit))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles (`k`) by the milliliters per bottle (`l`).\n- **Drink Limit**: This is determined by dividing the total drink by the product of the number of friends (`n`) and the milliliters needed per toast per friend (`nl`).\n- **Lime Limit**: The total number of lime slices is calculated by multiplying the number of limes (`c`) by the slices per lime (`d`). This total is then divided by the number of friends (`n`) to determine how many toasts can be made with the available slices.\n- **Salt Limit**: This is determined by dividing the total salt (`p`) by the product of the number of friends (`n`) and the grams of salt needed per toast per friend (`np`).\n- **Result**: The minimum value among the drink limit, lime limit, and salt limit gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all resources are sufficient.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the constraints for each resource and ensures the solution is optimal and handles all edge cases as specified.",
