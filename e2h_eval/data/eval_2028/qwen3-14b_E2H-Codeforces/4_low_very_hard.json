The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Nikephoros and Polycarpus play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Their moves are determined by their sequences A and B, which they cycle through. I have to find out how many times each of them gets pinched (i.e., loses a round).\n\nThe input is n, then the two sequences A and B. The output is two numbers: the number of losses for Nikephoros and Polycarpus respectively.\n\nFirst, let's think about how to model their moves. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to find out what move each player makes. Since their sequences are cyclic, the move for Nikephoros in round i is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly for Polycarpus, it's B[i % k], where k is the length of B.\n\nBut n can be up to 2e9, so iterating through each round one by one is impossible. That would take O(n) time, which is way too slow. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the challenge is to compute the number of rounds where Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses, without simulating each round individually.\n\nLet me think about the possible patterns. Since the sequences repeat, maybe there's a cycle that repeats after some length. For example, the combined sequence of A and B might have a certain period. Let's think about the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles. So the pattern of their moves will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\nSo if I can compute the number of losses in one full cycle of LCM(m, k) rounds, then I can calculate how many full cycles there are in n rounds, multiply by the losses per cycle, and then add the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nYes! That seems manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call this period_length.\n\n2. For each round in 0 to period_length - 1, determine the moves of A and B, and count how many times each player loses. Let's call these counts per_cycle_nik (Nikephoros's losses) and per_cycle_poly (Polycarpus's losses).\n\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // period_length.\n\n4. The remaining rounds are rem = n % period_length.\n\n5. The total losses would be total_cycles * per_cycle_nik + losses_in_remaining_rounds_nik, and similarly for Polycarpus.\n\nBut how to compute the losses in the first period_length rounds? Well, since period_length could be up to LCM(1000, 1000) = 1,000,000. So for each of the 1e6 rounds, we can compute the moves and check who loses. That's acceptable since 1e6 is manageable even with O(1e6) operations.\n\nWait, but for m and k up to 1000, LCM(m, k) can be up to 1000*1000 = 1e6. So yes, that's acceptable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCompute the LCM of m and k. Then simulate all rounds in one period (up to 1e6 rounds), count the number of losses for each player in that period. Then multiply by the number of full periods in n rounds, and then add the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the main steps are:\n\n- Calculate the LCM of m and k.\n\n- Simulate for each of the LCM rounds, compute the moves, and count the losses.\n\nBut how to compute the LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a, b) = a*b / GCD(a, b). So I need to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but that returns the absolute value. However, since m and k are positive integers, we can compute GCD(m, k) using math.gcd.\n\nWait, in Python 3.5+, math.gcd exists, but it returns the greatest common divisor of two numbers. So for m and k, compute GCD, then LCM is (m*k) // GCD.\n\nBut what if m or k is zero? Well, the problem says m and k are at least 1, so no problem.\n\nSo once I have the LCM, let's proceed.\n\nNow, for each round in the period, I need to find the moves of A and B.\n\nFor example, for round i (starting from 0?), the move for Nikephoros is A[i % m], and for Polycarpus is B[i % k].\n\nThen, for each pair",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over a large number of rounds, given that each player follows a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results without simulating each round individually due to the potentially enormous number of rounds (up to 2 billion).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Patterns**: Both players use cyclic sequences for their moves. The key insight is that the combined pattern of moves will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences. This LCM period allows us to break down the problem into manageable parts.\n2. **Simulating One Period**: Calculate the number of losses for each player over one full period (LCM of the sequence lengths). This involves checking each round within this period to determine the outcome.\n3. **Scaling Up**: Using the results from one period, compute the total number of losses for the entire number of rounds by considering how many full periods fit into the total rounds and then handle any remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    gcd_val = math.gcd(m, k)\n    lcm = (m * k) // gcd_val\n    \n    # Precompute the number of losses in one LCM period\n    nik_losses = 0\n    poly_losses = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a_move = A[a_idx]\n        b_move = B[b_idx]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        # Determine who wins\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus loses\n            poly_losses += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n            nik_losses += 1\n    \n    # Total number of full cycles and remaining rounds\n    total_cycles = n // lcm\n    rem = n % lcm\n    \n    # Compute total losses from full cycles\n    total_nik = total_cycles * nik_losses\n    total_poly = total_cycles * poly_losses\n    \n    # Compute losses from remaining rounds\n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_idx = i % m\n        b_idx = i % k\n        a_move = A[a_idx]\n        b_move = B[b_idx]\n        \n        if a_move == b_move:\n            continue\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins\n            poly_losses += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins\n            nik_losses += 1\n    \n    total_nik += nik_losses\n    total_poly += poly_losses\n    \n    print(f\"{total_nik} {total_poly}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the move sequences is computed to determine the period after which the move patterns repeat.\n3. **Simulating One Period**: For each round within one LCM period, we determine the moves of both players and count the losses for each player.\n4. **Scaling to Total Rounds**: The number of full periods within the total rounds is calculated, and the losses from these periods are scaled up. Any remaining rounds after the full periods are processed separately to ensure all rounds are accounted for.\n5. **Output**: The total number of losses for each player is printed as the result. \n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the repeating pattern of moves, ensuring the solution is both optimal and correct.",
