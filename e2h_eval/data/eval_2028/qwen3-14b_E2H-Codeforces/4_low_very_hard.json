The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about simulating a rock-paper-scissors game between two players over n rounds. Each player has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. For each round, we need to determine who wins and count the number of times each player gets pinched (i.e., loses a round). The challenge is to compute this efficiently given that n can be as large as 2e9, which is way too big for a brute-force simulation.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. Each character is R, S, or P. The sequences are cyclic, meaning after the end, they start again from the beginning.\n\nThe output is two integers: the number of times Nikephoros (the first player) lost (so his red spots) and Polycarpus (second player) lost.\n\nConstraints: n can be up to 2e9, so any O(n) solution is impossible. So, we need to find a pattern or cycle that can be computed in O(m*k) time or similar.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe key idea here is that the sequences A and B repeat periodically. So, the combination of moves for each round depends on the position in their respective sequences. Let's think about the moves for each round i (starting from 0 or 1? Well, the first round would be the first element of each sequence.)\n\nFor each round, the move of Nikephoros is A[i % m], and Polycarpus is B[i % k]. Then, we need to check who wins each round.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, simulating each round is impossible. So, we need to find a way to calculate the total number of wins for each player over all n rounds by finding cycles in the pattern of wins.\n\nLet me think about the possible cycles. Since the sequences A and B have lengths m and k, the combined cycle length would be LCM(m, k). Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, and the pattern of moves will repeat.\n\nSo, for example, if m=3 and k=2, LCM(3,2)=6. So every 6 rounds, the pattern of moves between the two players repeats.\n\nTherefore, the total number of rounds can be divided into two parts: the number of full cycles of LCM(m,k) and the remaining rounds.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length.\n\n2. For each round in 0 to cycle_length-1, compute whether Nikephoros wins, loses, or draw. Then, count for each of these how many times they occur in one full cycle.\n\n3. Multiply the counts by the number of full cycles (total_rounds = n // cycle_length), then add the counts from the remaining rounds (n % cycle_length).\n\nBut how do I compute the counts for each cycle?\n\nYes, but for each round in the cycle, we can precompute the outcome. Then, for the entire n rounds, we can compute the total number of wins for each player by multiplying the number of full cycles by the per-cycle counts, plus the counts from the partial cycle.\n\nBut how to compute the per-cycle counts?\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\nCompute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it L.\n\nCompute for each of the L rounds, what the outcome is. For each of these rounds, we can compute the moves of A and B, compare them, and record if Nikephoros wins, loses, or draw.\n\nThen, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // L.\n\nThe remaining rounds are rem = n % L.\n\nSo, the total number of wins for Nikephoros is (number of times he wins in one cycle) * total_cycles + number of times he wins in the first rem rounds of the cycle.\n\nSame for Polycarpus.\n\nBut how to compute the number of wins in one cycle?\n\nYes, but for each of the L rounds, we can process once. Since m and k are up to 1000, LCM(m, k) could be up to 1e6 (since 1000 and 1000 have LCM 1e6). So for L up to 1e6, even for n up to 2e9, the processing of the cycle is manageable.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nCalculate the LCM of m and k.\n\nThen, simulate for each of the L rounds (from 0 to L-1):\n\n- For round i, get A's move as A[i % m], B's move as B[i % k].\n\nCompare the two moves",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of times each player loses in a game of rock-paper-scissors over a large number of rounds, given that each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The challenge is to efficiently compute the result without simulating each round individually due to the potentially enormous number of rounds.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Game Rules**: Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. If both players choose the same item, it's a draw.\n2. **Cyclic Sequences**: Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. This means their move sequences repeat after a certain number of rounds.\n3. **Cycle Detection**: The combined cycle length of both players' sequences is determined by the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of their sequences. This LCM gives the number of rounds after which both sequences realign to their starting positions.\n4. **Simulation within One Cycle**: By simulating the game for one full cycle (determined by the LCM), we can count the number of wins for each player within this cycle.\n5. **Scaling Up**: Using the counts from one cycle, we can compute the total number of wins for the entire number of rounds by considering the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    A = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    B = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    # Compute LCM of m and k\n    lcm = m * k // math.gcd(m, k)\n    \n    # Precompute the results for one cycle\n    nikephoros_wins = 0\n    polycarpus_wins = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        # Determine the outcome\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n            polycarpus_wins += 1\n        else:\n            # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n            nikephoros_wins += 1\n    \n    total_cycles = n // lcm\n    remainder = n % lcm\n    \n    total_nik = nikephoros_wins * total_cycles\n    total_pol = polycarpus_wins * total_cycles\n    \n    # Now process the remainder rounds\n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            total_pol += 1\n        else:\n            total_nik += 1\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_pol)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, including the number of rounds and the move sequences for both players.\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences is calculated to determine the length of one full cycle of both sequences.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within the cycle length, the moves of both players are determined, and the outcome of each round is recorded.\n4. **Scaling Results**: The number of full cycles and remaining rounds are computed. The results from one cycle are multiplied by the number of full cycles, and the remaining rounds are processed individually to get the final counts of losses for each player.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the periodic nature of the sequences, ensuring that the solution is computed in a feasible time frame.",
