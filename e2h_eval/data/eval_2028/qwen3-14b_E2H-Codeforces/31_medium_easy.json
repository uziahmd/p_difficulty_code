Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have a sum, and we need to balance that sum by adding some cards. Each card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need the minimal number of cards to reach a total sum of zero.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the current sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. The goal is to make the total sum zero. So, the sum of the new cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of cards needed to sum up to T, where each card can contribute between -x and x. But since we can choose any numbers, how do we find the minimal count?\n\nLet me think. For example, if T is 0, then no cards are needed. Otherwise, what's the minimal number of cards?\n\nEach card can contribute at most x (if positive) or at least -x (if negative). So, for the target T, the minimal number of cards would be determined by how much we can cover with each card.\n\nLet me think of it as follows: The maximum possible contribution per card is x. So, the minimal number of cards required is the ceiling of |T| / x. But wait, because each card can contribute up to x. For example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then 5 / 2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because two cards can contribute 2 + 2 = 4, which is less than 5. So, three cards: 2+2+1=5. But wait, but each card can be any value between -x and x. So, for example, if T is positive, then we can take as many x as possible, and then one card for the remainder.\n\nBut wait, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), right? Because each card can contribute up to x towards the target. Let me check some examples.\n\nIn the first sample input, the sum of the found cards is -1 + 1 + 2 = 2. So T is -2. The absolute value is 2. x is 2. So 2 / 2 = 1. So the answer is 1. Which matches the example.\n\nIn the second example, the sum is -2 + (-2) = -4. T is 4. x is 3. So 4 / 3 is 1.333, so ceiling is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo yes, the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ), but only when T is not zero. If T is zero, then zero cards are needed.\n\nWait, but what if T is zero? Then the answer is zero. So the steps are:\n\nCalculate the sum S of the found cards. Then T is -S. If T is zero, return 0. Else, compute the minimal number of cards as ceil( |T| / x ). But how to compute that in Python?\n\nBut wait, how to compute the ceiling of division. For example, in Python, 5 / 2 is 2.5, but how to get the ceiling. Well, for positive integers a and b, the ceiling of a / b is equal to (a + b - 1) // b. So for example, 5 + 2 -1 =6, divided by 2 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo for |T| divided by x, the minimal number of cards is (abs(T) + x - 1) // x.\n\nBut let's make sure. Let's take T=4, x=3. (4 +3-1)/3 =6/3=2. Correct. For T=2, x=2: (2+2-1)/2=3/2=1. Correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nSo the steps for the solution are:\n\n1. Read n and x, then read the list of numbers.\n\n2. Compute the sum S of the list.\n\n3. Compute T = -S.\n\n4. If T is 0, output 0.\n\n5. Else, compute the minimal number of cards as (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then the answer is zero. So that's the case.\n\nLet me test some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, x=1, and the number is 1. Sum is 1. T is -1. So |T|=1. (1 +1-1)//1 =1. So answer is 1. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother case: T=0. Then answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: T=3, x=3. Then 3/3=1. So 1 card.\n\nWhat if T is negative? Well, since we take absolute value, it doesn't matter. Because T is -S, but the absolute value is |T|.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nsum_s = sum of the list.\n\nt = -sum_s\n\nif t == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print( (abs(t) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nWait, but what if x is 0? No, the input constraints say x >=1. Because in the input description, x is given as 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000. So no division by zero here.\n\nSo this seems straightforward.\n\nLet me check the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. T is -2. So abs(t) is 2. (2 +2-1)//2 = (3)//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond example input:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4. T is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose sum is 5, x is 2. Then T is -5. abs(t) is 5. (5 +2-1)/2 =6/2=3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: sum is 0. Then output 0.\n\nAnother case: sum is 3, x is 5. Then T is -3. So abs(t) is 3. (3 +5-1)/5 =7/5=1.4 → floor is 1. So 1 card. Which is correct, since one card of -3 is allowed (since x is 5, and -3 is within -5 to 5).\n\nYes, so that's correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead the input. The first line has two integers n and x. The second line has n integers.\n\nIn Python, we can read the first line as input().split(), then process into integers.\n\nThen compute the sum of the list.\n\nThen compute T = -sum.\n\nIf T is zero, output 0.\n\nElse, compute (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nSo the code would be something like:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ns = sum(nums)\n\nt = -s\n\nif t == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    print( (abs(t) + x -1 ) // x )\n\nWait, but what about when x is larger than the absolute value of T?\n\nLike, say T is 3, x is 5. Then (3 +5-1)//5 = 7//5=1. Which is correct. So one card.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: T is 0. So output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nLet me check the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n3 2\n\n-1 1 2 → sum is 2. t is -2. So abs(t) is 2. (2 +2-1)//2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 3\n\n-2 -2 → sum is -4. t is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 =6/3=2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1 and the number is 0. Then sum is 0. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: input is 1 1 and the number is 1. sum is 1. t is -1. (1 +1-1)//1 =1. So output 1.\n\nAnother case: sum is 5, x is 3. T is -5. abs(t)=5. (5 +3-1)/3 =7//3=2. So 2 cards. For example, 3 + (-2) = 1? Wait, no. Wait, the sum of the new cards must be T, which is -5. So the new cards need to sum to -5. So for example, two cards: -3 and -2. Sum is -5. So yes, two cards. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nTherefore, this approach should solve the problem.\n",
