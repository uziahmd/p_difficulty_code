    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since x ≤ y ≤ z, the key condition here is x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in order x ≤ y ≤ z, the sum of the two smaller sides (x + y) must be greater than the largest side z. Otherwise, it's a degenerate triangle.\n\nSo the main task is to count all triples (x, y, z) where x is between A and B, y is between B and C (since x ≤ B ≤ y), and z is between C and D. Also, the condition x + y > z must hold. But how do I efficiently compute this?\n\nFirst, let's think about the ranges. For each x in [A, B], and y in [B, C], we need to find the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x + y. But since z has to be ≥ C, the valid z values are those between max(C, ... ) and min(D, x + y - 1). Wait, because z must be at least C and also less than x + y. So for each (x, y), the number of valid z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y - 1) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nBut considering that x can be up to B and y up to C, x + y can be as large as B + C. However, z can be up to D. So for each (x, y), the upper bound for z is min(D, x + y - 1). But since z must be ≥ C, the lower bound is C. So the number of valid z is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) when x + y -1 >= C. Otherwise, zero.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C] of the count of z's for that (x, y).\n\nBut the problem is that B and C could be up to 5e5, so iterating over all x and y would be O(B*C), which in worst case is (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow. We need a smarter approach.\n\nSo, the brute force approach is not feasible. Let's think about how to optimize this.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. The variables x and y are such that x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. Also, since x ≤ B ≤ y, then x ≤ y. So for each (x, y), we have x ≤ y. Then, the triangle inequality requires x + y > z. Since z ≥ C, the minimal possible value of z is C. Therefore, for each (x, y), the minimal required is that x + y > C. Otherwise, even the smallest z (which is C) would make x + y ≤ z, which would not satisfy the triangle condition. So for a given (x, y), if x + y <= C, there are zero valid z's. Otherwise, the valid z's are from C to min(D, x + y - 1). The count is min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1, but only if that's positive.\n\nSo, the first thing is to find for each (x, y) where x + y > C, then compute the count of z's. Now, the question is how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem: For all pairs (x, y) with A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, and x + y > C, compute the number of z in [C, D] such that z < x + y. Which is equivalent to z can be from C to (x + y - 1), but not exceeding D. So the count is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) = max(0, min(D - C + 1, x + y - 1 - C + 1)) ?\n\nWait, let's compute it properly. The number of integers between a and b inclusive is b - a + 1. So if the valid range for z is [C, upper], where upper is min(D, x + y -1). So the count is upper - C + 1 if upper >= C, else zero. So upper is min(D, x + y -1). So the count is:\n\nif x + y -1 >= C → upper = min(D, x + y -1). Then the count is upper - C + 1.\n\nBut how can we compute this sum over all x and y?\n\nLet me think about the sum as:\n\nTotal = sum_{x=A}^B sum_{y=B}^C [ if x + y > C then (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) else 0 ]\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me split the problem into two parts. For each (x, y), the term depends on x + y. Let me denote s = x + y. So for s > C, we have:\n\nif s - 1 >= C → which is s >= C + 1. So for s >= C + 1, the upper bound is min(D, s - 1). So the contribution is min(D, s-1) - C + 1 = min(D - C + 1, s - 1 - C + 1) = min(D - C + 1, s - C). Because min(D, s-1) - C + 1 = (s-1 - C + 1) if s-1 <= D → s - C. Or D - C + 1 if s-1 >= D.\n\nSo for each (x, y), the contribution is:\n\nif x + y > C:\n\nthen:\n\nif x + y - 1 >= D → contribution is D - C + 1\n\nelse → contribution is (x + y - 1 - C + 1) = x + y - C\n\nSo the total contribution for (x, y) is:\n\nmax(0, min(D - C + 1, x + y - C )) if x + y > C.\n\nSo the problem reduces to calculating for all (x, y) in their ranges, where x + y > C, the value of min(D - C + 1, x + y - C) and summing all those values.\n\nNow, how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\nLet’s define for x in [A, B], y in [B, C], and x + y > C.\n\nLet’s denote S = x + y.\n\nWe need to compute sum over all x,y (with x + y > C) of min(K, S - C), where K = D - C + 1.\n\nNote that K is a constant for the problem.\n\nSo, the problem becomes:\n\nCompute sum_{x, y} [ if S > C then min(K, S - C) else 0 ].\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of it as:\n\nTotal = sum_{x, y} [ min(K, max(0, S - C)) ] where S = x + y, and x ranges from A to B, y ranges from B to C.\n\nBut how to compute this sum?\n\nLet me consider that for each x, y can vary between B and C. Let's fix x and find the valid y's for which x + y > C, and then compute the sum for those y's.\n\nFor a fixed x, the condition x + y > C → y > C - x. Since y is an integer, this is y ≥ (C - x + 1). But y must also be ≥ B, and ≤ C.\n\nSo for each x, the lower bound for y is max(B, C - x + 1). Let me call this lower_y. The upper bound for y is C. So the valid y's are from lower_y to C, inclusive. If lower_y > C, then there are no valid y's for this x.\n\nOnce we have the valid y's for x, then for each y in that range, we can compute S = x + y, and then compute min(K, S - C) = min(K, (x + y) - C).\n\nBut S - C = x + y - C = (x - (C - y)). Wait, perhaps not helpful. Let me think of it as (x + y) - C = (x + y) - C. Since for y ≥ (C - x + 1), x + y ≥ C + 1.\n\nSo for each x, the y ranges from lower_y to C, and for each such y, the value added is min(K, x + y - C).\n\nBut x + y - C = (x - (C - y)) ?\n\nAlternatively, for fixed x, and varying y, the term x + y - C can be rewritten as (x - (C - y)) ?\n\nNot sure. Let me think of x as fixed, and for varying y. Let me denote for fixed x, the term x + y - C is equal to (x - C) + y. So for each x, the term is (x - C) + y. So for varying y, this is linear in y.\n\nBut how can I compute the sum over y of min(K, (x - C) + y) ?\n\nLet me think for fixed x. Let me denote a = x - C. Then for each y in [lower_y, C], the term is min(K, a + y).\n\nSo the sum over y is sum_{y = y_low to C} min(K, a + y).\n\nBut a + y = (x + y) - C.\n\nSo for each x, we need to compute this sum.\n\nNow, the question is: How to compute this sum efficiently for each x?\n\nLet me think about the possible values of a + y.\n\nLet me denote for fixed x, the lower bound of y is y_low = max(B, C - x + 1). The upper bound is y_high = C.\n\nSo for y in [y_low, y_high], we have a + y = (x - C) + y. Let me call this value t. So t = (x - C) + y.\n\nBut since y ranges from y_low to C, t ranges from (x - C) + y_low to (x - C) + C = x.\n\nSo the minimum value of t is (x - C) + y_low, and maximum is x.\n\nBut how does that help?\n\nThe min(K, t) function can be broken into two parts: when t <= K, then it's t, else K.\n\nSo the sum can be split into two parts: the sum over y where t <= K, and the sum over y where t > K.\n\nBut how to find the threshold y where t = K.\n\nLet me find for which y values a + y ≤ K. That is, y ≤ K - a.\n\nBut a = x - C. So:\n\ny ≤ K - (x - C) = K + C - x.\n\nSo for each x, the threshold is y_threshold = K + C - x.\n\nBut y can be up to y_high = C.\n\nSo for y in [y_low, y_high], the sum is:\n\nsum_{y in [y_low, y_high]} min(K, a + y) = sum_{y in [y_low, y_min]} (a + y) + sum_{y in [y_min + 1, y_high]} K, where y_min is the minimum between y_high and (K + C - x).\n\nWait, but y_min is the maximum between y_low and (the value where a + y <= K). Wait, perhaps I should find the value of y where a + y = K. Let's solve for y:\n\na + y = K → y = K - a = K - (x - C) = K + C - x.\n\nSo for y ≤ (K + C - x), the term is (a + y), otherwise K.\n\nSo, for each x, we can compute y_split = K + C - x.\n\nThen, within the y range [y_low, y_high], the values of y that are ≤ y_split contribute (a + y), and those above contribute K.\n\nBut y_split may be outside of [y_low, y_high]. So we need to find the overlap between [y_low, y_high] and (-infinite, y_split].\n\nSo, the actual y values contributing to the first part are from y_low to y_upper, where y_upper is min(y_high, y_split).\n\nIf y_upper < y_low, then all terms are K (but that would be if y_split < y_low, meaning that for all y in [y_low, y_high], a + y > K. So the sum would be K * (y_high - y_low + 1)).\n\nOtherwise, the sum is sum_{y_low to y_upper} (a + y) + sum_{y_upper+1 to y_high} K.\n\nSo the steps for each x are:\n\n1. Compute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1).\n\n   If y_low > C → no contribution for this x.\n\n   Else:\n\n2. Compute y_split = K + C - x.\n\n3. Compute y_upper = min(y_high, y_split) = min(C, y_split).\n\n   The first part is from y_low to y_upper.\n\n   The second part is from y_upper + 1 to y_high.\n\n   So, the sum is:\n\n   part1 = sum_{y = y_low to y_upper} (a + y) \n\n   part2 = K * (number of terms in the second part)\n\n   total for x is part1 + part2.\n\nNow, how to compute part1 and part2 quickly?\n\nFor part1:\n\nsum_{y = y_low to y_upper} (a + y) = sum_{y} a + sum_{y} y = a*(count) + sum(y from y_low to y_upper).\n\nSimilarly, sum(y) can be computed with arithmetic series formula.\n\ncount = y_upper - y_low + 1.\n\nsum(y) = (y_low + y_upper) * count / 2.\n\nSimilarly for part2: the number of terms is max(0, y_high - (y_upper + 1) + 1) = max(0, y_high - y_upper).\n\nSo, putting this together, for each x, we can compute the contribution in O(1) time.\n\nNow, the problem is to loop through all x in [A, B], compute for each x the contribution, and sum them all.\n\nWhat's the time complexity? O(B - A + 1) = O(5e5) steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Precompute K = D - C + 1.\n\n- For each x in [A, B]:\n\n   Compute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1).\n\n   if y_low > C → continue (no contribution)\n\n   else:\n\n      y_high = C.\n\n      a = x - C.\n\n      y_split = K + C - x → which is K + C - x = (D - C + 1) + C - x = D + 1 - x.\n\n      So y_split = D + 1 - x.\n\n      Now, compute y_upper = min(y_high, y_split) = min(C, D + 1 -x).\n\n      Now, check if y_upper >= y_low. If not, then all terms are in part2. Else:\n\n         compute part1 and part2.\n\nSo let's proceed with that.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4 → A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nSo K = D - C + 1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2.\n\nFor x in [1, 2].\n\nLet's take x=1:\n\ny_low = max(B=2, C -x +1 = 3 -1 +1 =3). So max(2,3)=3. y_high is 3.\n\nSo y ranges from 3 to 3.\n\ny_split = D +1 -x =4+1-1=4. min(3,4) is 3. So y_upper=3.\n\nWhich is >= y_low (3). So part1 is sum from y=3 to 3 of (a + y).\n\na = x - C = 1 -3 = -2.\n\nSo a + y = -2 +3 =1. So part1 is 1.\n\npart2: y_upper +1 is 4, which is > y_high (3), so part2 is 0.\n\nTotal for x=1 is 1.\n\nNow, for x=2:\n\ny_low = max(B=2, C -x +1 =3 -2 +1 =2). So y_low is 2. y_high is 3.\n\na = 2 -3 = -1.\n\ny_split = D +1 -x =4+1-2=3. min(3,3) is 3. So y_upper is 3.\n\nSo part1: sum from y=2 to 3 of (a + y) → a is -1.\n\nFor y=2: -1 +2 =1.\n\ny=3: -1 +3=2. Sum is 1+2=3.\n\npart2: y_upper+1=4 > y_high=3 → 0.\n\nTotal for x=2 is 3.\n\nSo overall sum is 1 + 3 =4. Which matches the first sample output. So this seems correct.\n\nAnother sample: input '1 2 2 5' → output is 3.\n\nLet me check:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nK = D - C +1 =5-2+1=4.\n\nFor x in [1, 2].\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low is max(B=2, C -x +1 = 2 -1 +1 =2). So y_low=2. y_high is 2.\n\ny_split = D +1 -x =5+1 -1=5. min(2,5) is 2. So y_upper=2.\n\na = x - C =1-2=-1.\n\nsum from y=2 to 2: a + y =-1 +2=1. part1 is 1. part2 is 0. total 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low is max(2, C -x +1= 2-2+1=1). So max(2,1)=2. y_high is 2.\n\ny_split =5+1 -2=4. min(2,4) is 2. part1 is sum from 2 to 2 of a + y.\n\na = 2-2=0. a + y =0 + 2=2. part1 is 2. part2 is 0. total 2.\n\nTotal sum is 1 +2=3. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output 1.\n\nA=B=C=D=500000.\n\nK = D - C +1 = 500000 - 500000 +1 =1.\n\nFor x in [A, B] = [500000, 500000]. Only x=500000.\n\ny_low is max(B=500000, C -x +1 =500000 -500000 +1=1) → 500000.\n\ny_high = C=500000. So y ranges from 500000 to 500000.\n\ny_split = D +1 -x =500000 +1 -500000 =1. min(500000,1) is 1. So y_upper is 1. But y_low is 500000. Since 1 < 500000, part1 is zero, and part2 is K multiplied by (y_high - y_upper) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-calculate:\n\ny_upper = min(y_high, y_split) = min(500000, 1) = 1. Since y_upper (1) < y_low (500000), then all terms are in part2.\n\nSo part2 is K multiplied by the number of terms, which is y_high - y_low + 1 = 500000 -500000 +1 =1. So part2 is 1*1=1. So total sum is 1. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nSo the approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, the code needs to implement this.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   compute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   if y_low > C → continue.\n\n   else:\n\n      y_high = C\n\n      a = x - C\n\n      y_split = D + 1 - x\n\n      y_upper = min(y_high, y_split)\n\n      if y_upper < y_low:\n\n          # all terms are in part2\n\n          count_terms = y_high - y_low + 1\n\n          total += K * count_terms\n\n      else:\n\n          # compute part1 and part2\n\n          # part1: from y_low to y_upper\n\n          count_part1 = y_upper - y_low + 1\n\n          sum_y_part1 = (y_low + y_upper) * count_part1 // 2\n\n          part1 = a * count_part1 + sum_y_part1\n\n          # part2: from y_upper +1 to y_high\n\n          count_part2 = y_high - (y_upper + 1) + 1 = y_high - y_upper - 1 +1 = y_high - y_upper\n\n          if count_part2 <0:\n\n              count_part2 =0\n\n          part2 = K * count_part2\n\n          total += part1 + part2\n\nSo, this is the code.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for part2, the count_part2 is y_high - y_upper.\n\nBecause the number of terms from y_upper +1 to y_high is y_high - (y_upper +1) + 1 = y_high - y_upper.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, we need to loop x in range A to B inclusive. But if A and B are up to 5e5, then this loop is O(5e5) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, looping from A to B can be done with for x in range(A, B+1).\n\nBut for cases where A and B are 5e5, this is 5e5 iterations, which is manageable.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase when C -x +1 is less than B. For example, when x is large enough that C -x +1 ≤ B. Then y_low is B.\n\nAnother edge case is when D is very small. For example, if D < C, but according to the input constraints, C ≤ D, so D can't be less than C. So K is always ≥ 1.\n\nWait, input says that A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So C ≤ D. So K = D - C + 1 ≥ 1.\n\nSo, code can proceed.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut let's also think about possible integer overflows, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily big.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input. The input is multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is four integers on the first line. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input says:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the input is one line with four integers. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers on the first line. For example, the first sample input is '1 2 3 4', and the output is '4'.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three examples. But that's probably for the user to test, but the actual code should read one line of input, process it, and output the answer.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nSo the code must read a single line of input, split into four integers, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines. Oh, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. For example, perhaps in the sample input, the user provided three test cases, but the actual code should read one line per test case. However, the problem says that the input is four integers. So perhaps the sample input is written as multiple lines for the purpose of showing examples, but in reality, the code should read one line of input.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the example section, the input is given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWhich suggests that there are multiple test cases. But the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers...\n\nSo this is conflicting. But looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe problem says that the input is four integers. But the sample input shows three lines. So perhaps the problem is that the sample input is given with multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem statement may have been ambiguous.\n\nBut looking back at the original problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D...\n\nSo the code should read one line of input, and output one line of output.\n\nBut the sample input shows three lines. Which is confusing. However, in the problem's sample input, the user probably pasted multiple test cases. But in reality, the code should read one line of input. For example, the first sample input is '1 2 3 4' and the output is '4'.\n\nTherefore, the code should read one line of input, split into four integers, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nThus, the code will be:\n\nRead A, B, C, D from input.\n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   compute y_low = max(B, C -x + 1)\n\n   if y_low > C:\n\n       continue\n\n   else:\n\n      y_high = C\n\n      a = x - C\n\n      y_split = D + 1 -x\n\n      y_upper = min(y_high, y_split)\n\n      if y_upper < y_low:\n\n          count_terms = y_high - y_low + 1\n\n          total += K * count_terms\n\n      else:\n\n          count_part1 = y_upper - y_low + 1\n\n          sum_y_part1 = (y_low + y_upper) * count_part1 // 2\n\n          part1 = a * count_part1 + sum_y_part1\n\n          count_part2 = y_high - y_upper\n\n          part2 = K * count_part2\n\n          total += part1 + part2\n\nPrint(total)\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut let's test for some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: A = B = C = D = 1.\n\nThen K = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.\n\nx can be 1.\n\ny_low = max(1, 1 -1 +1) = max(1, 1) = 1. y_high is 1.\n\na = 1-1 =0.\n\ny_split = 1 +1 -1 = 1. y_upper is min(1, 1) =1.\n\nso part1:\n\ncount_part1 = 1 -1 +1 =1.\n\nsum_y_part1 = (1 +1)*1//2 = 1.\n\npart1 = 0 * 1 + 1 =1.\n\ncount_part2 = 1 -1 =0 → part2 is 0.\n\ntotal is 1. Which is correct. The triangle is (1,1,1).\n\nEdge case 2: A=1, B=1, C=2, D=2.\n\nSo K = 2 - 2 +1 =1.\n\nx can be 1.\n\ny_low = max(1, 2 -1 +1) = max(1, 2) =2. y_high is 2. So y_low is 2 <= 2.\n\ny_split = D +1 -x = 2 +1 -1 =2.\n\ny_upper = min(2, 2) =2.\n\ncount_part1 = 1.\n\nsum_y_part1 = (2 + 2)*1//2 = 2.\n\na is 1 -2 = -1.\n\npart1 = -1 * 1 + 2 = 1.\n\ncount_part2 = 2 -2 =0 → part2 is 0.\n\nTotal is 1. Which corresponds to (x=1, y=2, z must be between 2 and min(2, 1+2-1=2). So z can be 2. So 1 triangle. Correct.\n\nAnother case: A=1, B=3, C=3, D=3. So K=3-3+1=1.\n\nFor x in 1, 2, 3.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max(3, 3-1 +1=3) → 3. y_high=3.\n\ny_split = 3 +1 -1 =3. y_upper=3.\n\na=1-3=-2.\n\nsum part1: count_part1 =1, sum_y_part1 =3. part1 = -2 *1 +3 =1. part2 0. total +=1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(3, 3-2+1=2) →3. y_high=3.\n\ny_split=3+1-2=2. y_upper is min(3, 2) =2. which is less than y_low (3). So count_terms is 3-3 +1=1. part is 1*1=1. total +=1 → total 2.\n\nx=3:\n\ny_low = max(3, 3-3+1=1) →3. y_high=3.\n\ny_split =3+1 -3=1. y_upper=1 <3. count_terms is 1. part is 1*1=1. total +=1 → total 3.\n\nSo total is 3. What's the actual triangles?\n\nEach x is 1, 2, 3. y is 3. z is 3.\n\nCheck x + y > z → x +3 >3 → x>0. Which is always true. So for each x, z can be 3. So three triangles: (1,3,3), (2,3,3), (3,3,3). So yes, total 3. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in Python, for large ranges (like 5e5), looping with for x in range(A, B+1) may be slow. However, given that 5e5 is manageable in Python, perhaps.\n\nBut let's think: for A=1 and B=5e5, the loop runs 5e5 times. Each iteration is O(1) operations. So in Python, that's acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input line as four integers.\n\nA, B, C, D = map(int, input().split())\n\nCompute K = D - C + 1.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor x in range(A, B+1):\n\n    y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n    if y_low > C:\n\n        continue\n\n    y_high = C\n\n    a = x - C\n\n    y_split = D + 1 - x\n\n    y_upper = min(y_high, y_split)\n\n    if y_upper < y_low:\n\n        count_terms = y_high - y_low + 1\n\n        total += K * count_terms\n\n    else:\n\n        count_part1 = y_upper - y_low + 1\n\n        sum_y_part1 = (y_low + y_upper) * count_part1 // 2\n\n        part1 = a * count_part1 + sum_y_part1\n\n        count_part2 = y_high - y_upper\n\n        part2 = K * count_part2\n\n        total += part1 + part2\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut let's test this code with the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4 → output 4.\n\nAs discussed earlier, code returns 4.\n\nSample 2: input 1 2 2 5 → output 3. As discussed, code returns 3.\n\nSample 3: input 500000 500000 500000 500000 → output 1. Which code returns 1.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nAnother test case: when x + y is larger than D. For example, A=1, B=2, C=3, D=3. Then K = 3-3+1=1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3 -2 +1 =2) →2. y_high=3.\n\ny_split = D +1 -x =3+1-2=2. y_upper = min(3, 2) =2.\n\nso part1: from 2 to 2. count_part1 =1. sum_y_part1 is 2. a = 2-3 =-1. part1 = -1 *1 +2=1. count_part2 =3 -2 =1. part2 =1 *1=1. total for x=2 is 1+1=2.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3 -1 +1 =3). So y_low=3. y_high=3.\n\ny_split =3+1 -1=3. y_upper=3.\n\ncount_part1 =1. sum_y_part1 is 3. a =1-3=-2. part1 =-2*1 +3=1. count_part2=3-3=0. total +=1. So overall total is 1+2=3?\n\nWait, what is the actual count?\n\nFor x=1, y=3. z must be between 3 and 3. x + y =4. z can be up to min(3, 4-1=3). So z=3. So contribution is 1.\n\nFor x=2, y ranges from 2 to 3.\n\nFor y=2:\n\nx + y =4. z must be between 3 and min(3, 4-1=3). So z=3. contribution is 1.\n\nFor y=3: x + y =5. z can be up to min(3, 5-1=4) →3. So contribution is 1. So for x=2, total contribution is 1+1=2. So overall total is 1+2=3.\n\nBut according to the code, for x=2:\n\ncount_part1 is 1 (y_upper=2). part1 is -1 *1 + 2 = 1. count_part2 is 3-2=1. part2 is 1*1=1. So total for x=2 is 1 +1=2. So code returns 1+2=3. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ such that $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. The key condition for a non-degenerate triangle is that the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side. Given the constraints, an efficient approach is required to handle large input values.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: For a triangle with sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ where $x \\leq y \\leq z$, the triangle is non-degenerate if $x + y > z$.\n2. **Range Analysis**: We iterate over possible values of $x$ and $y$ within their respective ranges and determine valid $z$ values that satisfy the triangle inequality.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For each $x$, we compute the valid range of $y$ values and then determine the valid $z$ values efficiently using arithmetic series and min/max functions to avoid unnecessary iterations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    A = int(input[0])\n    B = int(input[1])\n    C = int(input[2])\n    D = int(input[3])\n    \n    K = D - C + 1\n    total = 0\n    \n    for x in range(A, B + 1):\n        y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n        if y_low > C:\n            continue\n        y_high = C\n        a = x - C\n        y_split = D + 1 - x\n        y_upper = min(y_high, y_split)\n        \n        if y_upper < y_low:\n            count_terms = y_high - y_low + 1\n            total += K * count_terms\n        else:\n            count_part1 = y_upper - y_low + 1\n            sum_y_part1 = (y_low + y_upper) * count_part1 // 2\n            part1 = a * count_part1 + sum_y_part1\n            count_part2 = y_high - y_upper\n            part2 = K * count_part2\n            total += part1 + part2\n    \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input values are read and parsed into integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n2. **Constant Calculation**: $K$ is computed as $D - C + 1$, representing the maximum number of valid $z$ values for any given $x$ and $y$.\n3. **Iterating Over Possible Values**: For each $x$ in the range $[A, B]$, determine the valid range of $y$ values starting from $B$ up to $C$.\n4. **Valid Range for $z$**: For each valid pair $(x, y)$, compute the range of valid $z$ values using arithmetic series properties to efficiently calculate sums without iterating through all possible $z$ values.\n5. **Summing Contributions**: Contributions from valid $z$ values are accumulated using arithmetic series formulas and min/max functions to ensure efficiency.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently count valid triangles while adhering to the constraints, making it suitable for large input sizes.",
