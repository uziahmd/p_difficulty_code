Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is a. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. For every b candles he has, he can make one new. So, the process is: burn all available candles, collect the burned ones, convert them into new ones, and repeat until he can't make any more.\n\nWait, but how to model this? Let's think of it as a loop. Let's take the first example: 4 and 2. \n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. He burns them all, which gives 4 hours. Then, he has 4 burned candles. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new ones. Now, he burns those 2, adding 2 hours. Now, he has 2 burned candles. He can make 2/2 = 1 new. Burn that, +1 hour. Now, he has 1 burned candle. Since 1 < 2, he can't make any more. Total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see:\n\nStart with 6. Burn them all: 6 hours. Now 6 burned. 6/3=2 new. Burn those 2: +2. Now 2 burned. 2 <3, so can't make. But wait, the total would be 6+2=8. Which matches the sample. Oh right, but wait, what if there's a way to collect more?\n\nWait, maybe there's a case where after making new candles, you can collect again. Like, suppose a=5, b=3. Let's see:\n\nFirst, burn 5: 5 hours. Now 5 burned. 5//3 = 1, remainder 2. So make 1 new. Burn that: +1. Now, we have 1 (from the new one) + 2 (leftover from initial 5) = 3. Now, 3//3=1. Burn that: +1. Now, 1 burned. So total is 5+1+1=7?\n\nWait, but how does that work? Let me check:\n\nOriginal 5 candles: burn 5, get 5 hours. Then, 5 burned. Make 1 new (since 5//3=1). Burn that, +1. Now, we have 1 burned (from that new candle) plus 5 - 3*1 = 2 leftover from the original 5. Wait, no. Wait, when you make the new candle, you use up 3 burned ones. So after making 1 new, you have 5 - 3 = 2 burned left. Then, when you burn the new candle, you add another 1 burned. So total burned is 2 + 1 = 3. Then, you can make another 1. So that's 3//3=1. So then burn that, adding 1. Now, you have 1 burned. So total hours is 5 + 1 + 1 = 7. But how?\n\nSo the process is:\n\nTotal hours = initial a, plus the number of new candles made each time.\n\nBut how to model the accumulation of burned candles. Because each time you make new candles, you have some leftover from the previous step.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nInitialize total_hours = 0\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\nburned_candles = 0\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think:\n\nEach time you burn all the current candles. So:\n\ntotal_hours += current_candles\n\nThen, the burned_candles += current_candles\n\nThen, you can make new_candles = burned_candles // b\n\nBut then, the new_candles become the current_candles for the next iteration. And the burned_candles is updated to (burned_candles % b) + new_candles ?\n\nWait, no. Because when you make new candles, you use up (new_candles * b) burned candles. So the remaining burned candles after making new ones is (burned_candles - new_candles * b). Then, when you burn the new_candles, they become burned again.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is:\n\nWe have a variable for the number of burned candles. Initially, it's zero.\n\nBut each time we burn all the current candles. So:\n\ncurrent_candles = a\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nburned = 0\n\nwhile current_candles > 0:\n\n    total_hours += current_candles\n\n    burned += current_candles\n\n    new_candles = burned // b\n\n    current_candles = new_c",
