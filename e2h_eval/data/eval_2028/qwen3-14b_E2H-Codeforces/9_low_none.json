Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm, so the standard knapsack approach won't work here because the m is too big for O(nm) time. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think. Since the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, maybe I can handle each weight category separately. For example, for items of weight 1, I can take as many as possible, but since there's also items of higher weights, perhaps I need to find an optimal way to combine them.\n\nWait, but how? Let's break it down. Let's group all items by their weight. For each weight (1, 2, 3), sort them in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight, we can precompute the prefix sums. That way, for any number of items taken from that weight group, we can quickly get the total cost.\n\nBut how do I combine these groups optimally? Let's think about the problem as follows: for each possible number of weight 1 items, weight 2 items, and weight 3 items, such that total weight is ≤ m, compute the maximum cost. But even that seems computationally heavy if done naively.\n\nAlternative approach: Since the weights are small (only 1,2,3), maybe we can use dynamic programming with some optimizations. However, considering the m can be up to 3e5, even O(m) approaches might be feasible.\n\nWait, but for each weight group, maybe we can find the best combination. Let me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Split the items into three groups based on their weight: w1, w2, w3.\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost. Then compute prefix sums for each group. For example, for w1, the prefix sum array will have the sum of top k items.\n3. Now, for each possible number of weight 3 items (say, k), and then for each possible number of weight 2 items (say, l), compute how much weight is left, and then take as many weight 1 items as possible. But even this approach might be too slow if done naively.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight is 3, maybe we can iterate over the number of weight 3 items. For each possible count of weight 3 items, we can compute how much weight remains, and then solve the problem for the remaining weight using the weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut even that could be O(m) for weight 3 items. Let me think:\n\nThe maximum number of weight 3 items is min( (m // 3), len(w3)). So for each possible count of weight 3 items (k), which could be up to 3e5/3 = 1e5, then for each k, we need to solve the problem for the remaining weight (m - 3*k) using the weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to solve the problem for weight 1 and 2 items efficiently?\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can use another approach. Let's consider that for a given remaining capacity, say 'rem', how to choose the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nLet me think of this as a subproblem. Suppose I have a certain amount of capacity rem. How to select items from the weight 1 and 2 groups to maximize the cost.\n\nFor this subproblem, let's say I have sorted lists of weight 1 and 2 items, with their prefix sums.\n\nLet me denote the number of weight 2 items as x. Each weight 2 item takes 2 units of capacity. Then the remaining capacity after taking x items is rem - 2x, which must be >=0. Then, the number of weight 1 items that can be taken is (rem - 2x). But since we can take up to the number of available items in each group.\n\nSo for each possible x (number of weight 2 items taken), we can compute the maximum possible x (up to min( (rem//2), len(w2)), and then take the maximum of (prefix_w2[x] + prefix_w1[ (rem - 2x) ] ), but also considering that (rem - 2x) can't exceed the number of weight 1 items available.\n\nBut even this approach would take O(rem) time for each subproblem. However, since rem can be up to 3e5, and for each possible k (number of weight 3 items), this would be O(m^2), which is not feasible.\n\nHmm, but perhaps there",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints require an optimized approach due to the large possible values for the number of items and the weight capacity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Items by Weight**: Separate the items into three groups based on their weights (1, 2, and 3).\n2. **Sort and Prefix Sums**: Sort each group in descending order of cost and compute prefix sums for each group. This allows quick calculation of the maximum cost for taking the top `k` items from each group.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Counts**: For each possible count of weight 3 items, calculate the remaining capacity and determine the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items that can be carried within the remaining capacity.\n4. **Optimize Subproblem**: For the remaining capacity after considering weight 3 items, use a two-pointer technique to efficiently determine the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    w1 = []\n    w2 = []\n    w3 = []\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        wi = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ci = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        if wi == 1:\n            w1.append(ci)\n        elif wi == 2:\n            w2.append(ci)\n        else:\n            w3.append(ci)\n    \n    # Sort and compute prefix sums\n    w1.sort(reverse=True)\n    w2.sort(reverse=True)\n    w3.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums for each group\n    prefix1 = [0]\n    for c in w1:\n        prefix1.append(prefix1[-1] + c)\n    \n    prefix2 = [0]\n    for c in w2:\n        prefix2.append(prefix2[-1] + c)\n    \n    prefix3 = [0]\n    for c in w3:\n        prefix3.append(prefix3[-1] + c)\n    \n    max_total = 0\n    \n    # Try all possible numbers of weight 3 items\n    max_k3 = min(len(w3), m // 3)\n    for k3 in range(0, max_k3 + 1):\n        weight_used = k3 * 3\n        rem = m - weight_used\n        \n        # Now solve for rem with w1 and w2\n        # Use two pointers approach\n        i = len(prefix2) - 1  # number of w2 items taken\n        j = rem  # number of w1 items taken\n        max_curr = 0\n        \n        # For each possible i (number of w2 items), find the best j\n        # i ranges from 0 to min(len(w2), rem//2)\n        # j is rem - 2*i, but cannot exceed len(w1)\n        # So for each i, compute j = min(rem - 2*i, len(w1))\n        # But we need to iterate over possible i's efficiently\n        \n        # We can iterate i from 0 to min(len(w2), rem // 2)\n        max_i = min(len(prefix2) - 1, rem // 2)\n        # Also, we can try all possible i up to max_i\n        # However, for efficiency, we can use two pointers approach\n        # Let's try all possible i from 0 to max_i\n        # But since max_i could be up to 1.5e5, and for each k3 (up to 1e5), it's O(1.5e5 * 1e5) which is too slow\n        \n        # Alternative approach: for each possible i, j = rem - 2*i\n        # We can precompute for all possible i in 0 to len(prefix2)-1\n        # But how?\n        # Let me think of the following:\n        # For the current rem, the maximum number of w2 items is min(len(w2), rem//2)\n        # Then, for each i from 0 to that max_i, compute j = rem - 2*i\n        # Take the minimum between j and len(w1)\n        # So the total is prefix2[i+1] + prefix1[min(j, len(prefix1)-1)]\n        # But even this would be O(max_i) per k3, which could be O(3e5) * O(1.5e5) = 4.5e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n        \n        # So we need a smarter way.

For the current rem, the best combination of w2 and w1 can be found by considering the following:\n        # For each possible number of w2 items (x), the number of w1 items is y = rem - 2x.\n        # The maximum x is min(len(w2), rem // 2).\n        # The maximum y is min(rem, len(w1)).\n        # So for x in 0 to max_x, we can compute the total cost.\n        # However, this is O(max_x) per k3, which is too slow.\n        \n        # Wait, but the total number of k3 is up to 1e5, and for each k3, the max_x is up to 1.5e5, leading to 1.5e10 operations. That's way too much.\n        \n        # So we need a better approach. Let's think of the following:\n        # Let's precompute for the w2 and w1 groups. For any given capacity, the maximum value can be computed using the two groups.\n        # How? Let's think of the problem as follows: we have two types of items, weight 1 and 2, and we want to maximize the value for a given capacity.\n        # This is a classic knapsack problem, but with items of only two weights. There is an optimized way to do this.\n        \n        # Here's an idea: for the current rem, we can use a greedy approach. However, since the items are sorted, the best approach is to take as many high-value items as possible.\n        # For example, for the given rem, we can take up to (rem // 2) items of weight 2, and the rest as weight 1.\n        # However, this might not be optimal because sometimes replacing a weight 2 item with two weight 1 items might give a higher value.\n        # But how can we handle this?\n        \n        # Let's think of the following: For the current rem, we can take x items of weight 2 and (rem - 2x) items of weight 1. The optimal x is the one that maximizes the sum.\n        # To find this x efficiently, we can consider that the optimal x is either floor(rem / 2) or floor(rem / 2) - 1, etc., up to a small number of possibilities.\n        # Because the items are sorted in descending order, the optimal x is likely to be near the maximum possible x.\n        \n        # So here's the plan: for each possible k3, we compute the rem, and then try x from max(0, x_max - 100) to x_max, where x_max is min(len(w2), rem // 2). For each x in this range, we compute the corresponding y = rem - 2x, and take the minimum of y and len(w1). Then, we compute the total value and keep the maximum.\n        \n        # This approach reduces the number of iterations per k3 to around 200, which is manageable.\n        \n        x_max = min(len(w2), rem // 2)\n        # Try x in the range [max(0, x_max - 100), x_max]\n        start_x = max(0, x_max - 100)\n        for x in range(start_x, x_max + 1):\n            y = rem - 2 * x\n            if y < 0:\n                continue\n            y = min(y, len(w1))\n            curr = prefix2[x + 1] + prefix1[y]\n            if curr > max_curr:\n                max_curr = curr\n        # Also check x=0 and x=x_max\n        # Wait, the above loop already covers those\n        total = prefix3[k3 + 1] + max_curr\n        if total > max_total:\n            max_total = total\n    \n    print(max_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Grouping and Sorting**: Items are grouped by their weights (1, 2, 3) and sorted in descending order of cost to facilitate greedy selection.\n2. **Prefix Sums**: Prefix sums are computed for each group to quickly calculate the total cost for selecting the top `k` items.\n3. **Iterative Optimization**: For each possible count of weight 3 items, the remaining capacity is calculated, and the optimal combination of weight 1 and 2 items is determined using a limited range of checks around the maximum possible number of weight 2 items, ensuring efficiency.\n\nThis approach efficiently balances between exploring possible combinations and maintaining computational feasibility given the problem constraints.",

For any given capacity, the maximum value can be computed using the two groups.\n        # How? Let's think of the problem as follows: we have two types of items, weight 1 and 2, and we want to maximize the value for a given capacity.\n        # This is a classic knapsack problem, but with items of only two weights. There is an optimized way to do this.\n        \n        # Here's an idea: for the current rem, we can use a greedy approach. However, since the items are sorted, the best approach is to take as many high-value items as possible.\n        # For example, for the given rem, we can take up to (rem // 2) items of weight 2, and the rest as weight 1.\n        # However, this might not be optimal because sometimes replacing a weight 2 item with two weight 1 items might give a higher value.\n        # But how can we handle this?\n        \n        # Let's think of the following: For the current rem, we can take x items of weight 2 and (rem - 2x) items of weight 1. The optimal x is the one that maximizes the sum.\n        # To find this x efficiently, we can consider that the optimal x is either floor(rem / 2) or floor(rem / 2) - 1, etc., up to a small number of possibilities.\n        # Because the items are sorted in descending order, the optimal x is likely to be near the maximum possible x.\n        \n        # So here's the plan: for each possible k3, we compute the rem, and then try x from max(0, x_max - 100) to x_max, where x_max is min(len(w2), rem // 2). For each x in this range, we compute the corresponding y = rem - 2x, and take the minimum of y and len(w1). Then, we compute the total value and keep the maximum.\n        \n        # This approach reduces the number of iterations per k3 to around 200, which is manageable.\n        \n        x_max = min(len(w2), rem // 2)\n        # Try x in the range [max(0, x_max - 100), x_max]\n        start_x = max(0, x_max - 100)\n        for x in range(start_x, x_max + 1):\n            y = rem - 2 * x\n            if y < 0:\n                continue\n            y = min(y, len(w1))\n            curr = prefix2[x + 1] + prefix1[y]\n            if curr > max_curr:\n                max_curr = curr\n        # Also check x=0 and x=x_max\n        # Wait, the above loop already covers those\n        total = prefix3[k3 + 1] + max_curr\n        if total > max_total:\n            max_total = total\n    \n    print(max_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
