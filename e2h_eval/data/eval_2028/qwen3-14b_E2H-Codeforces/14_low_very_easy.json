He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.\n\n## Output\nFirst print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '5']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']\n\n## Note\nThe factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where given an integer m, I have to find the number of positive integers n such that n! has exactly m trailing zeros. And then output those numbers in order. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers up to n. Because there are usually more 2s than 5s, so the count is based on 5s. So the formula for the number of trailing zeros is floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ... until the division is zero.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding all n's where this count equals m. But how do I find those n's?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, there might be multiple n's that result in exactly m trailing zeros. For example, in the sample input where m=1, the output is 5 numbers: 5,6,7,8,9. Let me check why. The count for 5 is 1 (5/5=1). For 6, same as 5, since 6/5 is 1.2, floor is 1. Similarly up to 9. Then when you reach 10, it's 2 zeros.\n\nSo the key is that for some ranges of n, the trailing zero count remains the same. But how do I find those ranges?\n\nThe approach would be to find the possible n's that give exactly m zeros. However, there's a catch. For some m, there might be no n's. Like in the sample input where m=5, the output is 0. Wait, no, the sample input says for m=5, the output is 0? Wait the example input shows that when input is 5, the output is 0. Wait let me check the example again.\n\nWait the example input is given as ['1', '5'] and output is ['5\\n5 6 7 8 9', '0']. Oh right, so when m is 5, there are no n's. So how does that happen?\n\nLet me think. Let's compute for m=5. Let's see what n's would produce exactly 5 trailing zeros.\n\nLet me compute the trailing zeros for some numbers:\n\nFor n=24: 24/5 =4, 24/25=0. Total 4. So 4 zeros.\n\nn=25: 25/5=5, 25/25=1, 25/125=0. Total 5+1=6 zeros. So 6 zeros. So between 24 and 25, the count jumps from 4 to 6. So there's no n that gives exactly 5 zeros. Hence, for m=5, the answer is 0.\n\nAh, so this suggests that for certain m values, there are no n's. So the problem requires us to check if there exists any n that gives exactly m zeros, and if so, find all such n's.\n\nSo the steps I need to take:\n\n1. Find the possible n's where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m.\n\nBut how?\n\nAn approach could be to find the lower and upper bounds of n that would result in m zeros. But how?\n\nLet me think. For a given m, the possible n's must be in a range where the count of trailing zeros is exactly m. Let's think of the function f(n) which returns the number of trailing zeros in n!.\n\nThis function is non-decreasing. Because as n increases, the count can stay same or increase. So for example, when n increases by 1, the count can either stay same (if the new number doesn't add any 5s) or increase by 1 or more (if the new number is a multiple of 5, 25, etc.)\n\nSo for a given m, there could be a range of n's where f(n) = m. But sometimes, there might be no such n. For example, when m is between f(n) and f(n+1) but there's a jump of more than 1.\n\nSo the idea is to find the minimal n where f(n) = m, and then check how many consecutive numbers after that also have the same count.\n\nBut how to find if there exists such n?\n\nAlternatively, for a given m, we can find the smallest n such that f(n) >= m. Then check if f(n) is exactly m. If not, then there's no solution. Otherwise, find the range of numbers where f(n) = m.\n\nWait, but how to find the numbers that have exactly m zeros.\n\nAnother approach: For each m, find the lower bound and upper bound of n such",
