After the winter exams he got his hands on a group's gradebook.Overall the group has n students. They received marks for m subjects. Each student got a mark from 1 to 9 (inclusive) for each subject.Let's consider a student the best at some subject, if there is no student who got a higher mark for this subject. Let's consider a student successful, if there exists a subject he is the best at.Your task is to find the number of successful students in the group.\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100) — the number of students and the number of subjects, correspondingly. Next n lines each containing m characters describe the gradebook. Each character in the gradebook is a number from 1 to 9. Note that the marks in a rows are not sepatated by spaces.\n\n## Output\nPrint the single number — the number of successful students in the given group.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11828\\n11111']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample test the student number 1 is the best at subjects 1 and 3, student 2 is the best at subjects 1 and 2, but student 3 isn't the best at any subject.In the second sample test each student is the best at at least one subject.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to find the number of successful students. A student is successful if they are the best in at least one subject. Being the best in a subject means no one has a higher mark than them in that subject. So, for each subject, we need to find the maximum mark, and then check which students have that mark. Each such student is considered successful. But since a student can be successful in multiple subjects, we need to count each student once even if they are best in multiple subjects.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n1. For each subject (column in the gradebook), determine the maximum mark.\n2. For each student, check if there's at least one subject where their mark in that subject is equal to the maximum for that subject. If yes, they are successful.\n3. Count how many such students there are.\n\nLet me think about how to structure this.\n\nFirst, input handling. The input is n and m, followed by n lines each with m characters. Each line represents a student's marks for m subjects. For example, if the input is '223', then the first student has marks 2, 2, 3 for the three subjects.\n\nSo, the first step is to read the input correctly. Then, for each column (subject), find the maximum value. Then, for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns is equal to the maximum of that column. If at least one exists, count that student.\n\nSo, let's break it down.\n\nLet me think about the steps in code:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read n lines, each line being a string of m digits. Let's convert each line into a list of integers. For example, for the first sample input:\n\nn=3, m=3\n\nstudents = [\n    [2, 2, 3],\n    [2, 3, 2],\n    [1, 1, 2]\n]\n\nThen, for each subject (columns 0, 1, 2):\n\nSubject 0: the marks are 2, 2, 1. Max is 2. So students 0 and 1 have this. So these two are successful.\n\nSubject 1: marks are 2, 3, 1. Max is 3. Only student 1 has this. So he is successful.\n\nSubject 2: marks are 3, 2, 2. Max is 3. Only student 0 has this. So he is successful.\n\nSo the successful students are student 0 (best in subject 0 and 2), student 1 (best in subject 1). Student 2 isn't best in any. So total 2, which matches the sample.\n\nSo how do I compute the max for each column?\n\nFor each column j in 0..m-1:\n\nmax_marks[j] = max( students[i][j] for i in 0..n-1 )\n\nOnce I have max_marks for each column, then for each student, check if any of their marks in the columns equals the max_marks for that column.\n\nIf at least one exists, then count the student.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Read the data into a 2D list (students).\n\n- Compute for each column the maximum value.\n\n- For each student, check for each column if their mark in that column is equal to the max of that column. If any is true, then count the student.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, reading the input. The input comes from stdin. The first line is n and m. Then n lines follow.\n\nBut wait, the input could be given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the example input:\n\nThe example input shows two test cases. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Wait, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and m, then n lines follow. However, in the example input, the first input is a list of two test cases. But perhaps that's just for the example, but in reality, the program should process a single test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as per the first line. The example shows two different inputs, but perhaps that's for two separate test cases. But the actual code needs to process a single test case. Because the problem says \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and the input is given via standard input.\n\nSo, the code must read from stdin, which for the problem would be a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input given, the first input is:\n\n['3 3\\n223\\n232\\n112', '3 5\\n91728\\n11",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of successful students in a group based on their grades in various subjects. A student is considered successful if they are the best in at least one subject. The best student in a subject is defined as having the highest mark in that subject.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of students (n) and subjects (m), followed by the gradebook entries.\n2. **Convert Grades**: Convert each student's grades from strings to integers for easier manipulation.\n3. **Determine Maximum Marks per Subject**: For each subject, find the maximum mark achieved by any student.\n4. **Identify Successful Students**: For each student, check if they have the maximum mark in at least one subject. If they do, they are considered successful.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nstudents = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    line = input().strip()\n    students.append([int(c) for c in line])\n\n# Find the maximum marks for each subject\nmax_marks = [0] * m\nfor j in range(m):\n    max_val = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if students[i][j] > max_val:\n            max_val = students[i][j]\n    max_marks[j] = max_val\n\n# Check each student for success\nsuccessful = 0\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(m):\n        if students[i][j] == max_marks[j]:\n            successful += 1\n            break\n\nprint(successful)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first line of input is split into integers `n` (number of students) and `m` (number of subjects). The subsequent lines are read as strings and converted into lists of integers representing each student's grades.\n2. **Finding Maximum Marks**: For each subject (column in the gradebook), we iterate through all students to find the highest mark achieved.\n3. **Checking Success**: For each student, we check if their mark in any subject matches the maximum mark for that subject. If they do, they are counted as successful.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the successful students by leveraging simple iteration and comparison, ensuring that we handle up to the maximum constraints effectively.",
