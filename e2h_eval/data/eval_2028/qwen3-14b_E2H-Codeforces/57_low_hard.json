His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have in the Olympiad based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the results of the first and second tours, but they are not linked to names. So, we have to consider all possible pairings of a_i (first tour) and b_j (second tour) for each participant, and determine the best and worst possible positions Vasya could have.\n\nThe key here is that Vasya's total is at least x. But since the teacher doesn't know which a_i and b_j belong to Vasya, we have to assume that there exists some pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. And for the purposes of calculating best and worst ranks, we can choose any such pair for Vasya, but we need to find the best and worst possible positions he could have.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for the best possible rank: we want to maximize Vasya's total points so that he can be as high as possible. Because if he has a higher total, he can be ranked higher. So for the best case, we should select the maximum possible a_i + b_j that is at least x. Then, we need to count how many participants have a sum strictly greater than this value. The best rank would be that count plus 1. However, if there are multiple participants with the same sum as Vasya's, the jury can arrange them in any order, so in the best case, Vasya can be placed first even if others have the same sum.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that if two or more participants have the same sum, the jury can assign places as they choose. So for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and that all others with the same sum are placed after him. Therefore, the best possible rank is determined by the number of people with sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum plus 1. But since we can choose Vasya's sum to be as high as possible (as long as it's at least x), we need to maximize his sum.\n\nSo the approach for the best rank:\n\nFind the maximum possible sum s = a_i + b_j where s >= x. Then, count how many participants have a sum strictly greater than s. The best rank is that count + 1. Because even if there are people with the same sum as s, the jury can place Vasya above them.\n\nBut wait, how do we find the maximum possible sum? Well, since we can pair any a_i with any b_j (but each participant has exactly one a and one b?), no. Wait, the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. Wait, the problem says that each participant participated in both tours, but the input gives the first tour's points and the second tour's points as separate lists. However, for each participant, their first tour score is in the first list, and their second tour score is in the second list. However, the problem says that the lists are given in arbitrary order. So, the actual pairing between a_i and b_j is unknown. So, for example, participant 1 has a_1 in first tour and some b_j in second tour, but we don't know which one. So, when considering all possible pairings, we can choose any possible pairing for the participants. However, the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. But for the purposes of the problem, we can choose the best possible pairing for Vasya's case.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher has to find the best and worst possible place that Vasya could have. So, the teacher needs to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j (each participant has exactly one a and one b) such that the total points for each participant is a_i + b_j, but the pairing is such that for Vasya, there exists at least one pair (i,j) where a_i + b_j >=x. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points. So, the actual pairing of the a and b arrays must have at least one participant (Vasya) whose a_i + b_j is >=x. However, the teacher doesn't know which one. So, for the best and worst possible ranks, we can choose any possible pairing (i.e., any possible way of assigning a_i and b_j to participants) that satisfies that there exists at least one participant (Vasya) with a_i + b_j >=x. But since the problem is to find the best and worst possible",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves considering all possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours to find the optimal scenarios for Vasya's rank.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Rank Calculation**:\n   - To find the best possible rank, maximize Vasya's total score by pairing the highest scores from the first and second tours such that their sum is at least `x`.\n   - Count how many participants can have a higher total score than this maximum sum. The best rank is determined by this count plus one.\n\n2. **Worst Rank Calculation**:\n   - To find the worst possible rank, minimize Vasya's total score while ensuring it is at least `x`.\n   - Count how many participants can have a higher or equal total score than this minimum sum. The worst rank is determined by this count plus one, considering that ties can be resolved in favor of other participants.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    line1 = input[idx].split()\n    n, x = int(line1[0]), int(line1[1])\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    # Sort the arrays\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # For best rank: maximize Vasya's sum\n    # Find the maximum possible sum >= x\n    max_sum = 0\n    # Use two pointers to find the maximum sum >= x\n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        current = a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j]\n        if current >= x:\n            max_sum = current\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j -= 1\n    \n    # Now count how many pairs have sum > max_sum\n    # We can use a sorted list of all possible sums\n    # But since we need to count how many pairs have sum > max_sum, we can do the following:\n    # For each a_i, find the number of b_j where a_i + b_j > max_sum\n    # This can be done with binary search\n    count_best = 0\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        target = max_sum + 1\n        # Find the first b_j where ai + b_j > max_sum\n        # which is b_j > (max_sum - ai)\n        # So find the first index in b_sorted where b_j > (max_sum - ai)\n        val = max_sum - ai + 1\n        pos = bisect.bisect_right(b_sorted, val - 1)\n        count_best += (n - pos)\n    \n    best_rank = count_best + 1\n    \n    # For worst rank: minimize Vasya's sum (but >=x)\n    # Find the minimal sum s >= x\n    # To find the minimal s, we can use two pointers approach again\n    # Start from the lowest possible sum >=x\n    min_sum = float('inf')\n    i = 0\n    j = 0\n    while i < n and j < n:\n        current = a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j]\n        if current >= x:\n            if current < min_sum:\n                min_sum = current\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    \n    # Now count how many pairs have sum >= min_sum\n    count_worst = 0\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        target = min_sum\n        # Find the first b_j where ai + b_j >= target\n        # which is b_j >= (target - ai)\n        val = target - ai\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(b_sorted, val)\n        count_worst += (n - pos)\n    \n    # However, this counts the number of pairs with sum >= min_sum\n    # But since Vasya's sum is exactly min_sum, the worst case is when all these are >= min_sum\n    # So the worst rank is count_worst + 1?
