Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to create an N x N board where the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen. The problem says that for some N, this is possible, and for others not. The example given is for N=4, which outputs a specific board. For N=1, it's impossible, hence -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the movement works. Let's recap:\n\nThe process starts at cell 1. Then, each step, the figure (rook or queen) moves to the smallest-numbered unvisited cell that's reachable in one move. If there are no such cells, it teleports to the smallest unvisited cell, paying 1 vun. This teleportation happens only when all reachable cells are already visited.\n\nThe goal is to arrange numbers on the board such that when the rook follows this path, it has fewer teleportations (vuns) than the queen.\n\nSo, I need to design a numbering where the rook's path requires fewer teleports than the queen's.\n\nLet me think about how to construct such a board. Maybe there's a pattern or structure that makes the rook's movement more efficient than the queen's.\n\nLooking at the example for N=4. The output is a specific arrangement. Let's think about what's happening there. The rook's path has 1 vun, the queen's has 2. How was that achieved?\n\nIn the example, the rook's path goes through certain cells, and during the traversal, there's a point where it can't reach any new cells, so it teleports once. The queen has two such instances.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is to arrange the numbers in a way that the rook can reach the next minimal numbers in its movement pattern (same row or column) more efficiently than the queen's movement (any direction, including diagonals).\n\nBut how to design such a board? Maybe for even N, there's a way to structure the numbers so that the rook's path requires fewer teleports.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is possible only for N ≥ 2, but not for N=1. But the sample input shows N=4 is possible. What about N=2?\n\nWait, for N=2, let's think. Let's try to create a board where the rook pays less than the queen.\n\nLet's say the board is:\n\n1 3\n\n4 2\n\nLet's simulate the rook and queen paths.\n\nRook starts at 1. From 1, the rook can move to same row (cell 3) or same column (cell 4). The unvisited cells are 3 and 4. The minimal is 3. So rook moves to 3. Now, from 3, same row (already visited), same column (cell 2). So next is 2. Then, from 2, same row (cell 4, which is unvisited?), wait. Wait, the current path:\n\nVisited cells are 1,3,2. Next, from 2, same row (cell 4) and same column (cell 1, already visited). So the rook can move to 4. Then all cells are visited. No teleport. So rook pays 0 vuns.\n\nQueen's path: starts at 1. From 1, queen can move to any adjacent cell. Let's see the numbers. The queen can reach 3 (same row), 4 (same column), and 2 (diagonal). The minimal is 2. So queen moves to 2. Then from 2, the queen can reach 1 (visited), 3 (same row?), 4 (same column?), and 2's diagonals. Wait, cell 2 is at position (2,2). So the queen can move to 3 (same row?), no, 3 is (1,2). So queen can move to 3 (same column?), no. Wait, the queen can move in any direction. So from cell 2 (position (2,2)), the queen can reach cells in same row (cell 4, (2,1)), same column (cell 1, (1,2)), and diagonally. So the unvisited cells are 3 (cell (1,1)? No. Wait, the original board is:\n\nRow 1: 1 3\n\nRow 2: 4 2\n\nSo positions are:\n\n(1,1) = 1, (1,2)=3, (2,1)=4, (2,2)=2.\n\nSo from cell 2 (which is (2,2)), the queen can reach any cell in same row (cell (2,1) = 4), same column (cell (1,2) = 3), and diagonally (cell (1,1) = 1, which is already visited",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to construct an N x N board such that the rook pays strictly fewer vuns (teleportation fees) than the queen during their traversal of the board. The traversal rules are based on moving to the smallest unvisited cell reachable in one move, and teleporting if no such cell exists.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: The rook moves along rows and columns, while the queen can move in any direction (including diagonally). This means the queen has more potential moves, which might lead to more teleportations if the board is structured to favor the rook's movement.\n2. **Board Construction**: For N=1, it's impossible since there's only one cell. For N ≥ 2, we can construct a board where the rook can efficiently traverse through the smallest numbers in its row or column, minimizing teleportations.\n3. **Pattern Utilization**: We use a specific pattern to arrange numbers such that the rook can follow a path with fewer teleportations compared to the queen. This involves creating a spiral-like pattern that ensures the rook's path is optimized.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    N = int(input)\n    \n    if N == 1:\n        print(-1)\n        return\n    \n    # For N >= 2, construct a specific pattern\n    # Based on the example for N=4, we can create a similar pattern\n    # We'll create a grid where numbers increase in a certain way to ensure rook's path is better\n    \n    grid = [[0]*N for _ in range(N)]\n    num = 1\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # right, down, left, up\n    dir_idx = 0\n    x, y = 0, 0\n    \n    for i in range(N*N):\n        grid[x][y] = num\n        num += 1\n        # Check next position\n        dx, dy = directions[dir_idx]\n        nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n        if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N and grid[nx][ny] == 0:\n            x, y = nx, ny\n        else:\n            # Change direction\n            dir_idx = (dir_idx + 1) % 4\n            dx, dy = directions[dir_idx]\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            x, y = nx, ny\n    \n    # Now, check if this grid meets the condition.

This ensures that the rook can move through the smallest numbers in its row or column efficiently, potentially leading to fewer teleportations compared to the queen's more flexible movement.\n- **Output**: The constructed grid is printed, ensuring all numbers from 1 to N² are used exactly once. This approach leverages the structure of the grid to minimize teleportations for the rook relative to the queen.",
