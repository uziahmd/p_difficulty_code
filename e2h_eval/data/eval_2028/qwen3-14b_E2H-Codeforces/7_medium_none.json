The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the construction rules again.\n\nSo the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to the initial one. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) must have k new vertices connected to them. And this process must be done at least once. Wait, so the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, each of those k nodes must have k children added. So the process is like building layers. But how does that translate into the total number of vertices?\n\nLet me think about the structure. The snowflake is a tree. Because each step adds new nodes connected to existing ones. Let's model the number of nodes.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that the snowflake is built in m levels. The first level is the root. Then level 2 has k nodes. Then, each node in level 2 has k children (level 3). Then, each node in level 3 has k children (level 4), etc. But the process must be done at least once. Wait, the description says: after the initial step (adding the first k nodes), each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected to k new nodes. This step should be done at least once. So the process of adding layers must happen at least once. Which implies that the snowflake must have at least two layers. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the next step is adding k nodes to each of those k nodes. So the total number of nodes would be:\n\nFor example, for the minimal case where k=4 and the process is done once. Let's see:\n\nInitial node (level 1): 1 node.\n\nAdd k nodes (level 2): total is 1 + k.\n\nThen, each of the k nodes in level 2 has k children. So adding k * k nodes. Total becomes 1 +k +k². But wait, the problem says that this step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is when we do this once. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut what if we do more steps? For example, after adding the second layer (level 3), then we can add another layer. Each node in level 3 (which are leaves) would have k children. So for each step, the number of nodes increases by (k^m), where m is the current level. Wait, perhaps the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of layers added beyond the first. But how many layers are allowed?\n\nWait, the construction rules are:\n\nStart with one node.\n\nThen, add k new nodes connected to the initial node. Then, each node that is connected to only one other (i.e., the ones added in the first step) must have k new nodes added. This step must be done at least once. So, the process is that after the initial step, you have to perform the expansion step once. But maybe you can perform it multiple times?\n\nWait, perhaps the snowflake is constructed as follows: the initial node is level 0. Then, each expansion step adds a new level. Let's model the number of nodes.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake as a tree with the following structure:\n\nThe root (level 0) has k children (level 1). Each node in level 1 has k children (level 2). Each node in level 2 has k children (level 3), etc. But the process must have at least one expansion step. That is, the snowflake must have at least two levels. Because the initial step (adding level 1) is required, and then the expansion step (adding level 2) is required once. So the minimal snowflake is when we have levels 0, 1, 2. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut if we do more expansion steps, then the total is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\n- Initial step: level 0 (1 node). Then, add level 1 (k nodes). Then, expand level 1 nodes by adding their children (level 2: k * k nodes). Then, expand level 2 nodes by adding their children (level 3: k^3 nodes). So if you do m expansion steps (each time expanding the leaves), then the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. But how many expansion steps are allowed?\n\nThe problem says that the step (expanding the leaves) must be done at least once. So m must be >= 1. So the total number of nodes can be written as sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m >= 1. Wait, but sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). However, for m >=1, the sum is 1 + k + ... +k^m.\n\nBut wait, the initial step (adding the k nodes) is part of the process. So the first expansion step is adding level 2. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 (when m=2? Or m=1? Maybe I need to re-express this.)\n\nAlternatively, the snowflake can be constructed in such a way that there are t layers, where t is at least 2. Because the first layer is the root, then the second layer is the k children. Then, the third layer is the children of the second layer, etc. So for t layers, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{t-1} k^i. And since the expansion step must be done at least once, t must be at least 2. So for example, when t=2, the total is 1 +k. But wait, that's not possible because the expansion step is required once. Wait, the initial step is adding the k nodes. Then the expansion step is adding the next layer. So for t=2 layers, the total is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. So the expansion step is adding the second layer. Which would require that the number of layers is at least 2. Wait, but the initial step is adding the first layer (the k nodes). Then, the expansion step is adding the second layer. So the total number of layers is 2. But then the total number of nodes is 1 +k. However, according to the problem's example, when n=6, the answer is NO. Let's check the sample input.\n\nSample input includes n=6. The output is NO. But for example, if k=2, then with t=2 layers (sum 1 + 2 = 3). For t=3 layers, sum is 1+2+4=7. So 6 is not achievable. But in the sample input, n=6 outputs NO. However, in the sample input, n=13 outputs YES. Let's see. For example, 1 +k +k^2 =13. So k^2 +k -12 =0. Solving gives k = [-1 ± sqrt(1+48)] / 2 = [ -1 + 7 ]/2 = 3. So yes, k=3. So 1+3+9=13. Which is valid. So that's why the sample input for 13 outputs YES.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as sum_{i=0}^m k^i for some integer k>1 and m>=1, where m is the number of layers minus 1. Wait, the sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But m must be at least 1. Because for m=1, sum is 1 +k. But according to the problem's rules, the expansion step must be done at least once. So for m=1, the sum is 1 +k. But that would mean that the expansion step was done once. Wait, the expansion step is adding the second layer. So when m=1, the sum is 1 +k, which is the case where there are two layers. But in that case, the expansion step was done once. So that's allowed. However, in the sample input, n=2 is given. For n=2, the sum would be 1 +k =2. So k=1. But k must be greater than 1. Hence, n=2 is invalid. Which matches the sample input (output is NO for n=2).\n\nSo the problem is to check if n can be written as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and m >=1. Or, alternatively, n can be written as sum_{i=0}^m k^i where m >=1, and k>1.\n\nBut also, there's another possibility. What if the expansion steps are done multiple times. For example, for m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. For m=3, 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, etc. So the problem is to check if n can be represented in any of these forms.\n\nBut how do we check that for a given n?\n\nThe problem requires that for a given n, there exists some k>1 and m≥1 such that n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). Alternatively, n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to check all possible possibilities.\n\nSo the approach is: for each test case n, check if there exists a k>1 and m≥1 such that n is equal to the sum 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m.\n\nBut how to check this efficiently?\n\nFirst, note that for each possible m, we can check if there exists a k>1 such that the sum equals n. Since m can be up to log_2(n), since for m=60, even k=2 gives sum 2^61-1 which is over 1e18.\n\nSo for each possible m (from 1 up to 60, since 2^60 is about 1e18), we can check if there exists a k such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i =n. For each m, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nBut what's the maximum possible m?\n\nFor example, for m=1, the sum is 1 +k =n → k =n-1. So for this to be valid, k must be ≥2. So n-1 ≥2 → n≥3. So for example, if n=3, then k=2, which is valid. So for m=1, possible.\n\nFor m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 =n. We need to find k>1 such that this equation holds. Similarly for higher m.\n\nSo for each m from 1 up to log_2(n), we can check if there exists a k>1 such that the sum equals n.\n\nNow, how to compute for a given m and n, whether there exists a k>1 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i =n.\n\nLet me denote the sum as S(m, k) = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nWe need to find if there exists integer k>1 such that S(m, k) =n.\n\nFor each m, we can perform a binary search on k. Because for fixed m, S(m, k) increases as k increases. So for a given m, we can binary search k between 2 and upper bound.\n\nWhat is the upper bound for k for a given m?\n\nWell, since S(m, k) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. For k ≥2, this sum is at least 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... +2^m = 2^{m+1} -1. So for a given n, the maximum possible k for a given m is such that S(m, k) ≤n. So for binary search, the upper bound can be n^(1/m), but perhaps even better to compute it as something else.\n\nBut for binary search, perhaps we can set the upper bound as n. Because for m ≥1, S(m, k) ≥1 +k. So if k is larger than n, then 1 +k would be larger than n. So for each m, the upper bound for k is n. But that's a very loose upper bound. However, for binary search, even with large upper bounds, since m is small (up to 60), it's manageable.\n\nBut for example, for m=60, the maximum possible k is such that k^60 is roughly n. So for n up to 1e18, k can be up to 1e18^(1/60) ≈ 10^(18/60) = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So for m=60, the upper bound is small.\n\nSo for each m from 1 to 60, we can perform a binary search on k in [2, ... upper_bound], and check if there exists a k such that S(m, k) =n.\n\nBut how to compute S(m, k) without overflow? Well, since n is up to 1e18, and m is up to 60, even for k=1e5, the sum for m=60 would be way larger than 1e18. So during the binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally and stop if it exceeds n.\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nIf n is 1: output NO (since the minimal snowflake requires at least 1 +k, which for k>1 is 3 or more. Wait, for m=1, sum is 1 +k. For k>1, the minimal sum is 1+2=3. So n=1 is invalid. Similarly for n=2, which is 1 +k=2 →k=1 which is invalid.)\n\nSo for n=1, output NO. For n=2, output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck for all possible m (starting from 1 up to max_m) whether there exists a k>1 such that the sum equals n.\n\nIf any such m and k exist, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop over m from 1 to 60 (since for m=60, even with k=2, the sum is 2^61-1 which is around 2e18, which is larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, m can't be larger than 60.)\n\nFor each m:\n\nCompute the minimal possible sum for k=2. If that is larger than n, skip this m. Else, perform a binary search on k between 2 and upper bound (like n) to see if there exists a k such that sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given m and k?\n\nWe can compute it iteratively. For example, for m steps:\n\nsum = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m.\n\nBut for large m and k, this could overflow. However, since n is up to 1e18, during the calculation, if the sum exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nSo here's a helper function to calculate the sum for given m and k, and check if it equals n.\n\nBut how to handle possible overflows? Well, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large, so no problem. But during the calculation, we can check if the sum exceeds n and break early.\n\nSo for each m, binary search for k.\n\nLet me think about the binary search steps.\n\nFor a given m, the sum S(k) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m.\n\nWe need to find if there exists a k>1 such that S(k) =n.\n\nSince S(k) is strictly increasing with k, for fixed m, we can binary search on k.\n\nThe lower bound is 2, upper bound can be determined as follows. For example, the minimal value of S(k) for k=2 is 2^{m+1} -1. If this is larger than n, then no solution for this m. Otherwise, upper bound can be something like n (since for k= n, S(k) is at least 1 +n, which is larger than n. So the upper bound can be n, but for practical purposes, we can compute the upper bound as the value where S(k) is just over n.\n\nBut for binary search, even if upper bound is high, it's manageable because m is small.\n\nSo for each m, perform the following steps:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = some upper limit (maybe n, but perhaps better to compute a smarter upper bound).\n\nBut for example, for m=1, S(k) = 1 +k =n →k =n-1. So the upper bound for k is n-1. Which for m=1, the high can be n-1.\n\nBut for general cases, perhaps high can be set as n, and during the binary search, we check if S(k) is equal to n.\n\nBut how to compute S(k) for given m and k?\n\nLet me code a helper function:\n\ndef compute_sum(m, k):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(m+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nWait, but for m steps, the exponents go from 0 to m. So for m+1 terms. So for example, m=2, sum is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nBut this approach can be used. However, for large k and m, this can be slow. However, since m is up to 60, and per test case, this is acceptable.\n\nBut for binary search steps, for each m, the binary search would take O(log n) steps, and each step takes O(m) time. Since m is up to 60, and per test case, for m up to 60, the total steps are 60 * log(n) * 60, which is acceptable for t=1e4.\n\nBut let's think about the example for n=13. For m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. We need to find k such that this equals 13. Let's compute for k=3: 1+3+9=13. So yes. So the code would find this.\n\nAnother example: n=6. Let's check for m=1: sum is 1 +k =6 →k=5. Which is allowed. But why is the sample input for n=6 output NO?\n\nWait, this suggests a problem with my understanding. Because according to the sample input, when n=6, the output is NO. But according to this logic, for m=1, k=5 would make sum 1+5=6. But why is that not allowed?\n\nAh! Oh right, the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. Wait, the expansion step is the step where each leaf is connected to k new nodes. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the expansion step (connecting each leaf to k new nodes) must be done at least once. So the expansion step is done once. Which implies that the snowflake must have at least two layers. Wait, the initial step is adding the first layer (level 1). The expansion step adds the second layer (level 2). So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2. So for m=2 layers (layers 0, 1, 2), the sum is 1 +k +k^2. But earlier, I thought that for m=1, the sum is 1 +k. Which would correspond to only one expansion step? Or not?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step is adding k nodes (level 1). Then, the expansion step is done once. Which means that each of the nodes in level 1 (which are connected to only one other vertex) must have k new vertices added. So this adds k *k nodes (level 2). Thus, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2. So the expansion step is done once. So the minimal snowflake has 1 +k +k^2 nodes. Therefore, the sum is for m=2 layers (levels 0, 1, 2). So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. So the earlier analysis was wrong. The m in the sum is not m layers but m+1 layers?\n\nWait, the original sum for the snowflake must be at least 1 +k +k^2. So for the expansion step to be done once. So the previous thinking about m being the number of expansion steps is incorrect. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, but the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds a new layer. The first expansion step adds k^2 nodes. The second expansion step adds k^3 nodes, etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps. Since the expansion step must be done at least once, m ≥1. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, with m ≥1. For example, when m=1, sum is 1 +k +k^2? No, that's for m=2. Wait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nLet me think of the expansion steps as follows:\n\n- The initial step (before any expansion) is 1 node (level 0).\n\n- The first expansion step: connect each of the initial node's children (level 1) to k new nodes. So this adds k *k nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nBut the first expansion step is done once. So the number of expansion steps is m=1. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is 1 +k*(k^1 -1)/(k-1) ? No, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). Which is the sum for m=2 (since the formula is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1)), where m is the number of terms minus 1. So the number of terms is m+1. So for the sum 1 +k +k^2, there are 3 terms, which corresponds to m=2. But the number of expansion steps is 1.\n\nSo this suggests that the number of expansion steps is m-1. Or perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nThe snowflake is built as follows:\n\nStart with one node (level 0).\n\nStep 1: Add k nodes connected to the root. Now, level 1 has k nodes. This is the first step.\n\nThen, expansion step 1: each node in level 1 (which are leaves) gets k children. Level 2 now has k*k nodes. Total nodes: 1 +k +k².\n\nExpansion step 2: each node in level 2 (now leaves) gets k children. Level 3 has k³ nodes. Total nodes: 1 +k +k² +k³.\n\nSo the number of expansion steps is m. So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m+1}? No. Wait:\n\nOriginal step (adding level 1) is not considered an expansion step. The expansion steps are the steps after that. So the first expansion step adds level 2. Second adds level 3, etc.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No. For m expansion steps:\n\nAfter initial step (level 1), expansion steps 1 to m:\n\nLevel 0: 1 node.\n\nLevel 1: k nodes.\n\nLevel 2: k^2 nodes (after expansion step 1).\n\nLevel 3: k^3 nodes (after expansion step 2).\n\n...\n\nLevel m+1: k^{m+1} nodes (after expansion step m).\n\nTotal nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i ?\n\nNo, because the initial step adds level 1 (k nodes). Then, expansion steps add levels 2, 3, ..., m+1. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i - 1? No. Wait:\n\nThe sum from level 0 to level (m+1) is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i. But the initial step is adding level 1. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1} ?\n\nBut that would be for m+1 expansion steps. But the expansion steps are m steps. So for m expansion steps, the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? Or perhaps not. Let me take m=1 expansion steps. Then the total is 1 +k +k^2. Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So for m expansion steps, the total is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i? No, that would be for m+1 terms. Wait, for m expansion steps, the number of terms is m+2? No. Let me think again:\n\nThe initial step adds level 1 (k nodes). Then, for each expansion step, we add a new level. So m expansion steps add m levels (level 2 to level m+1). So the total number of levels is m+2? No. The initial level is level 0 (1 node), then level 1 (k nodes). Then expansion step 1 adds level 2 (k² nodes). Expansion step 2 adds level 3 (k³ nodes). ... expansion step m adds level m+1 (k^{m+1} nodes). The total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i. Which is equal to (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So m ≥1. So the total number of nodes is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1), where m ≥1. Which is equivalent to (k^{t} -1)/(k-1), where t ≥3 (since t = m+2 ≥ 3). Wait, no. For m=1, t = m+2 = 3. So the total number of nodes is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k². Which matches the earlier example.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that the sum could be for any t ≥2. But according to this, it's for t ≥3. So this changes everything.\n\nSo the correct condition is that n must be equal to (k^t -1)/(k-1), where t ≥3, and k ≥2.\n\nBut why? Because the expansion step must be done at least once. Which corresponds to m ≥1, leading to t = m+2 ≥ 3.\n\nWait, this seems to contradict the earlier example where n=13 is allowed. For example, 13 = 1 +3 + 3^2 = (3^3 -1)/(3-1) = (27-1)/2 = 26/2 =13. Yes. So t=3, which is allowed. So for t ≥3.\n\nBut what about the case where t=2? For example, (k^2 -1)/(k-1) =k+1. So n=k+1. For example, if k=2, n=3. Is this allowed?\n\nAccording to the problem's rules, the expansion step must be done at least once. But if t=2, which corresponds to m=0 expansion steps. Which is not allowed. Hence, t must be ≥3.\n\nSo the correct condition is that n must be expressible as (k^t -1)/(k-1) for integers k≥2 and t≥3.\n\nThis explains why in the sample input, n=6 is not allowed. Let's see:\n\nCheck if 6 can be written as (k^t -1)/(k-1) with t≥3 and k≥2.\n\nFor t=3: (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k² +k +1. We need this to be 6. So k² +k +1 =6 →k² +k -5=0. Solutions are (-1 ± sqrt(21))/2. Not integer. So no.\n\nFor t=4: (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k² +k +1. Set to 6: k^3 +k² +k +1 =6 →k^3 +k² +k -5=0. Try k=1: 1+1+1-5=-2. k=2: 8+4+2-5=9≠0. So no.\n\nFor t=2: (k^2-1)/(k-1)=k+1=6 →k=5. But t=2 is not allowed. So this is invalid. Hence, n=6 is not possible. Which matches the sample output.\n\nBut earlier analysis thought that m=1 expansion steps would allow sum 1 +k +k². Which is correct. So the correct approach is to check whether n can be written as (k^t -1)/(k-1) with t ≥3 and k ≥2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if there exists integers t ≥3 and k ≥2 such that n = (k^t -1)/(k-1).\n\nNow, the challenge is to find for a given n, whether such k and t exist.\n\nSo the approach is to iterate over possible t values (starting from 3 up to log_2(n)+1, since for k=2, the minimal value for t is 3, which gives (8-1)/(2-1) =7. So for n=7, it's allowed. For larger t, the minimal value increases.)\n\nFor each t, we can check if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) =n. Which simplifies to k^{t-1} +k^{t-2} + ... +k +1 =n.\n\nFor example, for t=3, we have k² +k +1 =n.\n\nFor each t, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nBut how to find the possible range of t?\n\nThe maximum possible t is log_2(n). Because for k=2, the sum for t is 2^{t} -1/(2-1) =2^t -1. Wait, no: for t, the sum is (k^t -1)/(k-1). For k=2, it's 2^t -1. For example, t=3 gives 7. For larger t, this grows exponentially. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum t is about 60, since 2^60 is around 1e18.\n\nSo for each t from 3 up to 60, we can check if there's a k ≥2 that satisfies the equation.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nIf n is 1: output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nFor t in 3 to 60:\n\n   Check if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\n   If found, return YES.\n\nIf none found after all t, return NO.\n\nNow, how to check for a given t and n, whether there's a k ≥2 such that the equation holds.\n\nLet me think about solving for k in the equation:\n\nsum_{i=0}^{t-1} k^i = n.\n\nWhich is equivalent to (k^t -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nWe can rearrange this as k^t -1 =n (k-1) →k^t -n k + (n-1) =0.\n\nBut solving this equation for integer k is difficult analytically. However, for a fixed t, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nBecause for fixed t, the function f(k) = sum_{i=0}^{t-1}k^i is strictly increasing in k. So for each t, we can binary search for k in the range [2, ... upper_bound].\n\nThe upper bound can be determined as follows: since for k ≥2, the sum is at least 2^{t} -1. So if n < 2^t -1, then no solution for this t. Else, the upper bound for k can be n (since for k=n, the sum is at least 1 +n + ... which is larger than n).\n\nBut to find the upper bound for binary search, we can note that for the sum to be equal to n, k must be less than or equal to n^(1/(t-1)). Because the sum is at least k^{t-1} (since all terms are positive). So k^{t-1} ≤ sum =n →k ≤n^(1/(t-1)).\n\nSo for binary search, the upper bound can be set to n^(1/(t-1)) +1. However, calculating this in Python can be done with integer operations.\n\nBut for practical purposes, during binary search, we can set low=2, high= some upper limit, and compute the sum incrementally, stopping early if it exceeds n.\n\nSo the helper function for a given t and k is to compute the sum and compare with n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum without overflow? In Python, it's not a problem, but for large t and k, it can be time-consuming. However, since t is up to 60, and for each binary search step, the sum computation is O(t) steps, it's manageable.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nif n ==1: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\nfor t in 3 to 60:\n\n   low = 2\n\n   high = 2 (initial guess)\n\n   find upper bound for k. For example, since sum >=k^{t-1} (since sum is k^{t-1} + ... +k +1 ≥k^{t-1} ), then k^{t-1} ≤n →k ≤n^(1/(t-1)). So high can be set to n^(1/(t-1)) +1. But how to compute that in Python? We can use binary search to find the upper bound, but for simplicity, we can set high to n initially, and during binary search, compute the sum and see.\n\nBut perhaps even better to perform binary search with high as n, but during the sum calculation, if the sum exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nSo for each t, perform binary search on k between 2 and some upper bound (say, n), and check if the sum equals n.\n\nSo let's code this.\n\nNow, for each t in 3 to 60:\n\n   compute the minimal possible sum for k=2: sum_2 = 2^t-1/(2-1) = 2^t -1. If this is larger than n, then skip this t.\n\n   else:\n\n      perform binary search between low=2 and high= some upper bound (like n) to find if there exists a k where sum equals n.\n\nBut for example, for t=3, the sum for k is k^2 +k +1. We can binary search for k.\n\nLet me think about the sample input for n=13.\n\nt=3:\n\nsum =k^2 +k +1 =13 →k^2 +k -12=0 →k=( -1 + sqrt(1+48 )) /2 = (sqrt(49)-1)/2 = (7-1)/2=3. So yes, k=3. So returns YES.\n\nAnother sample input: n=6",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem constraints. The snowflake graph is constructed in such a way that it must have at least three levels (including the root), and each level after the first must be formed by adding $ k $ new vertices to each vertex in the previous level.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A valid snowflake graph with $ n $ vertices can be represented as $ \\frac{k^t - 1}{k - 1} $ where $ k > 1 $ and $ t \\geq 3 $. This formula comes from the sum of a geometric series.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Levels**: For each possible number of levels $ t $ starting from 3 up to a reasonable upper bound (since $ 2^{60} $ is slightly larger than $ 10^{18} $), check if there exists an integer $ k $ such that the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $.\n3. **Binary Search for $ k $**: For each $ t $, use binary search to find a valid $ k $ such that the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_t = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18\n    for t in range(3, max_t + 1):\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find upper bound for k\n        # We can use binary search here\n        # First check if for k=2, the sum is <=n\n        # Compute the sum for k=2\n        sum_k = 0\n        current = 1\n        for _ in range(t):\n            sum_k += current\n            current *= 2\n            if sum_k > n:\n                break\n        if sum_k > n:\n            continue\n        # Now perform binary search between low=2 and high=n\n        # But to find upper bound, we can use binary search\n        # However, for practical purposes, we can set high to n\n        left = 2\n        right = n\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            total = 0\n            current = 1\n            for _ in range(t):\n                total += current\n                current *= mid\n                if total > n:\n                    break\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            elif total < n:\n                left = mid + 1\n            else:\n                right = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **is_possible Function**: This function checks if a number $ n $ can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series with at least 3 terms. It iterates over possible values of $ t $ (number of terms) from 3 to 60. For each $ t $, it uses binary search to find a valid integer $ k $ such that the sum of the series equals $ n $.\n- **Binary Search**: For each $ t $, the binary search checks possible values of $ k $ between 2 and $ n $, calculating the sum of the geometric series incrementally and stopping early if the sum exceeds $ n $.\n- **Main Function**: Reads input, processes each test case, and prints \"YES\" or \"NO\" based on whether a valid snowflake graph can be formed with the given number of vertices.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations using mathematical properties of geometric series and binary search, ensuring it handles the large constraints effectively.",
