The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph as defined. The hard version has n up to 1e18, which means we need an efficient algorithm, probably O(1) or O(log n) per test case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the structure of the snowflake graph. Let's re-read the description.\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (so those leaves) are connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. So, the process is like building layers.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows. Let's model this.\n\nLet's think of the snowflake as a tree. Because each step adds new nodes connected to existing leaves. So, the structure is a tree where each node has exactly k children except for the ones in the last layer. Wait, but the process is: after the initial step, each leaf (which are the ones added in the first step) get k new nodes. Then, perhaps again, those leaves (the ones added in the second step) get more k nodes. But the process must be done at least once. So the minimum steps would be two steps beyond the initial.\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the next step is adding k children to each of the leaves (those k nodes). So, the total number of nodes after that would be:\n\nInitial: 1.\n\nAfter first expansion (adding k children to root): 1 + k.\n\nThen, each of those k leaves gets k children. So adding k * k nodes. Total is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, this step (adding k children to leaves) should be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would have 1 + k + k^2 nodes. For example, when k=4, the minimal is 1+4+16=21? But the example says that for n=6, the answer is NO, and for 13 it's YES. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the construction. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe construction rules:\n\nInitially, one vertex.\n\nThen, add k new vertices connected to the initial. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (i.e., the leaves) is connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. So, the initial step (adding the first k) is not considered as the step. The step is the process of adding k children to each leaf. So the process is:\n\nStart with root (1 node).\n\nStep 1: add k children to root. Now, the root has degree k, and each of these k nodes has degree 1. Now, the step (adding k children to each leaf) is done once. So, after that, each of those k leaves gets k children. So adding k * k nodes. Total nodes: 1 + k + k^2. Then, maybe more steps can be done. Each time, all current leaves (which are the ones added in the previous step) get k children each.\n\nSo the total number of nodes depends on how many layers we add. Let's model this.\n\nLet's say that the snowflake is built with m layers. Wait, perhaps the initial step (adding the first k children) is considered as the first layer. Then, each subsequent step adds another layer.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's define the number of nodes after m steps. Wait, perhaps the steps are:\n\n- The initial step (step 0) is 1 node.\n\n- Step 1: add k children to the root. Now, total nodes is 1 + k.\n\n- Step 2: add k children to each of the k leaves. So adding k * k nodes. Total is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n- Step 3: add k children to each of the k^2 leaves. Adding k^3 nodes. Total is 1 + k + k^2 + k^3.\n\nAnd so on. But according to the problem statement, the step (adding k children to leaves) must be done at least once. Which implies that the snowflake must have at least two steps. Because step 1 is adding the first k children (the initial step), and then step 2 is adding the next layer. So the minimal number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. So for example, if k=2, the minimal is 1+2+4=7.\n\nBut the example input includes n=6, which outputs NO. Let's see why. For n=6, can there be any k?\n\nIf the snowflake is built with steps 1 (initial step) and then step 2 (adding once). So the total is 1 + k +k^2 = n. Let's check for possible k.\n\nFor example, n=6: 1 +k +k² =6 → k² +k -5=0. The solution is k=(-1±sqrt(21))/2. Not integer. So no solution. So answer is NO. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example is n=13. Let's see. Let's check possible k. Suppose that the snowflake has 1 +k +k² =13. Then k² +k -12 =0. Solutions: (-1 ± sqrt(1+48))/2 = (-1 +7)/2= 3. So k=3. Which is valid. So answer is YES.\n\nAnother example is n=15. Let's see: 1 +k +k² =15 → k² +k -14=0. Discriminant is 1 +56=57. sqrt(57) is irrational. So no. But maybe there's another way. Like, maybe more layers. For example, if there are three layers: 1 +k +k² +k^3 =n. For example, for k=2, 1 +2 +4 +8=15. So yes. So for n=15, answer is YES. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the problem is to find for a given n, whether there exists some integer k>1 and some integer m ≥ 2 (since the step must be done at least once) such that n equals the sum 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. Wait, no. Because the initial step is adding k nodes (step 1), then each subsequent step adds a layer. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of layers added. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial step (step 0) is 1 node. Then, step 1 (the first expansion) adds k nodes. Then step 2 (the second expansion) adds k^2 nodes. Step 3 adds k^3 nodes, etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of expansions. But according to the problem statement, the step (adding k children to leaves) must be done at least once. Which means that m must be at least 1. Because the first expansion (adding k children) is step 1, which is part of the process. Wait, no. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\nThe initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh, the step of adding k children to leaves is done at least once. So, the initial step (adding the first k children) is not considered as that step. The step refers to the process of adding k children to leaves. So, the initial step (adding the first k) is required, and then the step (adding children to leaves) must be done once. So the minimal case is when the initial step is done (adding k children) and then the step is done once (adding k children to each of the leaves). So the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2. Therefore, the number of layers is 2 (the initial step plus one more step). So the formula for the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of steps (the step of adding to leaves). Wait, maybe I need to model the total number of nodes as follows:\n\nThe snowflake is constructed by:\n\n- Start with 1 node.\n\n- Then, add a first layer of k nodes (connected to the root). So total nodes is 1 +k.\n\n- Then, for each of the next steps (at least once), add a new layer where each leaf (from previous step) adds k children. So, for each step after the first layer, the number of nodes added is k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step.\n\nBut the leaves from the previous step are the nodes added in the previous step. For example:\n\n- After the first layer (k nodes), the leaves are those k nodes. Then, adding a second layer: each of them adds k children. So the number of nodes added here is k * k. So total nodes is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nIf we do a third step, each of the k^2 leaves (from the second layer) adds k children. So adding k^3 nodes. Total becomes 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2. Because the first step (adding the first layer) is mandatory, and then the step (adding layers) must be done at least once (so m is at least 2? Or m is the number of steps after the first layer? Let me think again.\n\nThe initial step (adding the first k nodes) is required. Then, the step of adding layers must be done at least once. So that means that the number of layers added after the first step is at least one. So the total number of layers is 1 (the first layer) plus s steps, where s ≥1. So the total nodes would be 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s+1} ?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for the total number of nodes is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2. Because:\n\n- For m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k². Which corresponds to the initial step (adding k) and then adding another layer (adding k²). Which meets the requirement that the step is done once.\n\nYes. So for any m ≥ 2, the sum S is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where k>1, and m ≥ 2.\n\nBut also, the problem allows for more steps. For example, m could be 3, which would be 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo our task is to check if for the given n, there exists integers k>1 and m≥2 such that n equals the sum S = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1) - 1? Wait, wait, the sum S is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. Which is equal to (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) - (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) - ... Wait, no. The sum from i=0 to m of k^i is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m is equal to that. So S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, but the problem says that the snowflake is constructed as follows: initial step (1 node) then add k nodes (so sum is 1 +k). Then, each step adds layers. So the sum S is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of layers. But the first layer is the k nodes, then the next layers are added. So for m=1, S is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the step (adding layers) must be done at least once. Which suggests that the sum must have at least two terms beyond the initial 1? Or perhaps m is the number of times the step is applied. Let me re-express.\n\nThe initial step (adding k children) is required. Then, the step (adding k children to leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is that after adding the initial k children, we perform one step of adding k children to each leaf. Which adds k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2. Which would correspond to m=2 (sum from i=0 to m=2: 1 +k +k^2). So for the sum to be valid, m must be at least 2.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to checking if there exists integers k>1 and m≥2 such that n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) - 1? No, wait: the sum 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m equals (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for example, when m=2, that's (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. So the problem requires that n equals that sum for some k>1 and m≥2.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the step (adding k children to leaves) must be done at least once. Which implies that m must be at least 2. Because:\n\n- The initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes) → m=1? Or perhaps m is the number of layers added beyond the initial? I think that the sum S is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 2. Because:\n\n- m=1 gives S = 1 +k. But that would mean that the step (adding k children to leaves) was done zero times. Which is invalid. Because the step must be done at least once. Hence, the minimal m is 2. So the sum is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nTherefore, for a given n, we need to check if there exists k>1 and m≥2 such that n = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, no. The sum S is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for example, when m=2, the sum is (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. So for the snowflake to exist, n must be equal to that sum for some k>1 and m≥2.\n\nSo the problem becomes: given n, check if there exists integers k>1 and m≥2 such that n = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for example, in the case where m=2, the sum is (k^3-1)/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1. Which is what we had earlier.\n\nSo the problem is equivalent to checking if n can be written as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and m≥2.\n\nBut how do we check that for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nLet me think about possible approaches. For each test case n, we need to check if there exists a pair (k, m) where k ≥2, m ≥2, such that n equals the sum S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nAlternatively, since m ≥2, m+1 ≥3. Let me denote t = m+1. Then t ≥3, and S = (k^t -1)/(k-1). So the problem reduces to checking if n can be written as (k^t -1)/(k-1) for some integers k ≥2 and t ≥3.\n\nSo the problem becomes: for a given n, check if there exists integers k ≥2, t ≥3 such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nBut (k^t -1)/(k-1) is the sum of a geometric series 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1}.\n\nSo for example, when t=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo the problem is to check if n can be represented in that form for any k ≥2 and t ≥3.\n\nSo how can we check this efficiently?\n\nThe key idea is to iterate over possible values of t and check if for that t, there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nBut for t up to log2(n) +1, since for t=3, the minimal value of the sum is 1+2+4=7. For larger t, the minimal sum increases. For example, t=3, k=2: 7; t=4, k=2: 1+2+4+8=15; t=5, k=2: 31, etc.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 1e18, we need to find all possible t's that are feasible.\n\nBut for each possible t, how do we check if there's a k such that the sum equals n?\n\nLet me consider that for each t, the function f(k) = (k^t -1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing with k. So for fixed t, we can binary search on k to see if there's a k that satisfies f(k) =n.\n\nBut how do we find the possible t's?\n\nThe maximum possible t is such that for k=2, the sum is 1+2+...+2^{t-1} = 2^t -1. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum t is around 60 (since 2^60 is about 1e18). So t can range from 3 to up to 60.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n can be expressed as (k^t -1)/(k-1) for some t ≥3 and k ≥2.\n\nTo do this:\n\nLoop over t from 3 up to log2(n)+1 (since for t=60, 2^t is 1e18, but for higher t, even k=2 would make the sum exceed 1e18).\n\nFor each t, perform a binary search on k to see if there exists a k where the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for a given k and t?\n\nWell, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1} = (k^t -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut calculating this for large k and t may be problematic due to overflow. However, since n is up to 1e18, and t is up to 60, even for k=1e9, k^t would be way larger than 1e18. So during the binary search, we can compute the sum incrementally and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nSo for each t, the steps would be:\n\n- Find the minimal and maximal possible k for that t.\n\nThe minimal k is 2. The maximum k can be found by considering that for the sum to be ≤n, since sum is 1 +k + ... +k^{t-1} ≥ 1 +k +k^2 ≥ 1 +2 +4 =7. So for each t, the maximum possible k is such that 1 +k + ... +k^{t-1} ≤n. Since the sum increases with k, we can binary search for k in [2, ... , upper_bound].\n\nBut how to compute the upper bound for k?\n\nFor a given t, the sum is at least 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1} ≥k^{t-1} (since the sum has t terms, each at least 1, but for k ≥2, the largest term is k^{t-1}).\n\nBut to find an upper bound for k, note that the sum is (k^t -1)/(k-1) < k^t/(k-1). For k≥2, this is less than k^{t}/(k/2) ) = 2k^{t-1}.\n\nSo for the sum to be ≤n, 2k^{t-1} ≤n → k ≤ (n/2)^{1/(t-1)} }.\n\nSo for binary search, the upper bound for k can be set to something like (n)^(1/(t-1)) +1.\n\nBut for practical purposes, since t can be up to 60, and n up to 1e18, even for t=3, the upper bound for k would be sqrt(n). For example, for t=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 =n → k^2 +k +1 =n → k^2 ~n → k ~ sqrt(n). So for binary search, the upper limit can be set as n^(1/(t-1)) +1.\n\nBut how to compute this in Python without floating point inaccuracies? Well, perhaps for each t, we can binary search k in the range [2, ... , upper], where upper is something like n^(1/(t-1)) + 2.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and t, without overflowing?\n\nWe can compute the sum incrementally, adding each term and stopping early if the sum exceeds n. For example:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for i in range(t):\n\n        total += k**i\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return -1\n\n    return total\n\nBut for k=2 and t=60, this would be 2^0 + 2^1 + ... +2^59 = 2^60 -1. Which is about 1e18, which is manageable in Python as integers.\n\nBut for larger k and t, even for k=1e5 and t=3, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. For k=1e5, that's 1e10, which is manageable.\n\nSo for each t, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper bound, and for each candidate k, compute the sum and check if it equals n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- If n is less than the minimal possible value (for t=3, k=2: 7), then output NO.\n\nElse:\n\nLoop t from 3 to max_t (where max_t is the maximum possible t for which 1+2+...+2^{t-1} ≤n. For example, for n=1e18, 2^t -1 ≤n → t can be up to 60.)\n\nFor each t:\n\n   perform binary search on k in [2, ... , upper] to see if there exists a k such that sum equals n.\n\nIf any of these checks returns true, output YES. Else, after checking all t, output NO.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the maximum possible t for which we need to check?\n\nFor example, for t=60, the minimal sum is 1+2+2^2+...+2^59 = 2^60 -1. Which is about 1.1e18. So for n up to 1e18, t can be up to 60.\n\nBut for n=1e18, 2^60 is 1.15e18, which is larger than 1e18. So for t=60, the minimal sum is 2^60 -1, which is larger than 1e18. So for n=1e18, t can be up to 59.\n\nSo for each n, the maximum t is up to log2(n) +1. So in code, for a given n, the maximum t can be calculated as up to 60.\n\nSo the code can loop t from 3 to 60 (or until 1+2+...+2^{t-1} exceeds n).\n\nNow, for each t, how to compute the upper bound for k?\n\nWell, since the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1} =n.\n\nThe sum is increasing in k. So for a given t, we can binary search k between 2 and some upper bound. For the upper bound, since the sum is at least k^{t-1} (since the sum has t terms, each at least 1, but the largest term is k^{t-1} for k ≥1). So k^{t-1} ≤ sum =n → k ≤n^{1/(t-1)}.\n\nSo the upper bound for binary search can be set to n^{1/(t-1)} + 1. But how to compute that in Python?\n\nWell, for each t, we can compute the upper bound as int(n ** (1/(t-1))) + 2. But since for exponents, taking roots can be imprecise, perhaps better to use binary search for k up to a certain limit, but since for each t, the upper bound is small, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, during binary search, we can start with low=2, high=2, and double high until the sum exceeds n. Then perform binary search between low and high.\n\nThis approach avoids computing roots and is safer against precision errors.\n\nSo here's a plan for each t:\n\nInitialize low = 2, high = 2.\n\nWhile the sum for k=high and t is less than n: multiply high by 2.\n\nOnce we have a high where sum exceeds n, perform binary search between low and high to find if any k exists where sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for a given k and t? As discussed earlier, we can compute it incrementally, adding terms and breaking early if the sum exceeds n.\n\nSo, the steps for each t:\n\nCheck if for some k, the sum equals n.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nFirst, handle edge cases. For example, if n is 1: the minimal sum is 7, so output is NO. Similarly, for n=2, 3, 6, etc.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead t test cases. For each n:\n\nif n <7: output NO.\n\nelse:\n\nfor t in 3 to max_t:\n\n   check if there exists a k ≥2 such that the sum equals n.\n\nif any of these checks return True, output YES.\n\nelse, output NO.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute max_t. Let's think: for t, the minimal sum is 1+2+...+2^{t-1} = 2^t -1. So for n, the maximum possible t is the maximum t such that 2^t -1 ≤n. So t_max can be computed as floor(log2(n+1)).\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, log2(1e18) is about 60. So for each n, t can be up to 60.\n\nSo in code, for each n, we can loop t from 3 to 60, and for each t, check if 2^t -1 <=n. If not, break the loop.\n\nBut for some t, even if 2^t -1 is larger than n, there might be a k smaller than 2 that makes the sum equal to n. Wait, no, because k must be ≥2. So for a given t, the minimal sum is 2^t -1. So if 2^t -1 >n, then for this t, no possible k can make the sum equal to n. So we can break the loop once t exceeds log2(n+1).\n\nSo, in code, for each n, the loop for t can run from 3 to up to 60, but for each t, check if 2^t -1 <=n. If not, break.\n\nNow, the code for checking a particular t and n:\n\ndef check(n, t):\n\n    # find if there exists k >=2 such that sum_{i=0}^{t-1} k^i =n.\n\n    # sum is (k^t -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\n    # binary search for k.\n\n    # first, find the upper bound for k.\n\n    low = 2\n\n    high = 2\n\n    while compute_sum(high, t) < n:\n\n        high *=2\n\n    # Now binary search between low and high.\n\n    while low <= high:\n\n        mid = (low + high) //2\n\n        s = compute_sum(mid, t)\n\n        if s == n:\n\n            return True\n\n        elif s <n:\n\n            low = mid +1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid -1\n\n    return False\n\nBut compute_sum needs to calculate the sum for k and t, and return it, or return something if it exceeds n. But how?\n\nWait, the function compute_sum(k, t) can be implemented as follows:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for i in range(t):\n\n        total += k**i\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return n+1  # indicates overflow\n\n    return total\n\nBut in Python, exponentiation is easy. However, for large t and k, this could be slow. However, since t is up to 60, and for each binary search step, this is O(t) operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for k=2 and t=60, this is 60 steps. For each t, the binary search would take O(log (upper_bound)) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in practice, for large k and t, even the first few terms may exceed n. For example, if k is 1e5 and t=3, the sum is 1 + 1e5 + 1e10, which is 1e10 + ... which for n up to 1e18 is manageable.\n\nSo, the code seems feasible.\n\nNow, let's think about the example given.\n\nSample Input:\n\nTest case n=13.\n\nCheck for t=3:\n\nsum is 1 +k +k² =13 →k² +k -12=0 →k=( -1 + sqrt(1 +48 )) /2 = (sqrt(49)-1)/2 = (7-1)/2=3 → yes. So returns True.\n\nThus, output YES.\n\nAnother example: n=15. For t=4, sum is 1 +k +k² +k³. For k=2: 1+2+4+8=15 → yes.\n\nAnother example: n=255. Let's see. For t=3: 1 +k +k² =255 →k² +k -254=0 → sqrt(1 + 4*254) = sqrt(1017) ≈31.89. So (31.89 -1)/2 ≈15.44. So check k=15: 15² +15 = 225+15=240 <255. k=16: 256+16=272>255. So no. For t=4: 1 +k +k² +k^3 =255. Let's try k=4: 1+4+16+64=85. k=5: 1+5+25+125=156. k=6: 1+6+36+216=259>255. So no. For t=5: 1 +k +k² +k³ +k^4 =255. Let's try k=3: 1+3+9+27+81= 121. k=4: 1+4+16+64+256= 341>255. So no. What about t=8? Let's think for k=2: sum is 2^8 -1 = 255. Yes! Because for t=8, the sum is 1+2+4+...+2^7 = 2^8 -1 = 255. So yes. So for t=8 and k=2, the sum is 255. Thus, returns YES.\n\nWhich matches the sample input.\n\nAnother sample input is n=1000000000000000000 (1e18). The output is NO. Let's see why. For example, check if there exists any t and k.\n\nFor example, t=3: 1 +k +k² =1e18. Solving k² +k +1 =1e18 →k ~ sqrt(1e18) = 1e9. Let's compute k= 999999999: k² is ~ 1e18. Let's see, but 1e18 is 1 followed by 18 zeros. So for k= 999999999, k² is (approx) 1e18. But adding k and 1 would make the sum larger than 1e18. So perhaps there's no solution for t=3. For t=2, but t must be ≥3. So perhaps no solution.\n\nBut how to know for sure. The code would check for all possible t up to 60.\n\nBut the code would return NO for that case.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle very large exponents, but in Python, integers can be arbitrarily big.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python:\n\nBut for each test case, we need to loop through t from 3 to up to 60, and for each t, perform the binary search.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead t test cases. For each n in the test case:\n\nif n < 7: print 'NO' (since for t=3, k=2 gives 7).\n\nelse:\n\nfor t in 3 to 60:\n\n   compute the minimal sum for this t (with k=2) which is 2^t -1. If that is larger than n, break the loop (since higher t will have even larger minimal sums).\n\n   else:\n\n      perform the binary search for k as described.\n\n      if any of the checks returns True, then output 'YES'.\n\nif none of the t's worked, output 'NO'.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut how to compute 2^t -1 for each t? Well, for t up to 60, 2^t can be computed as 1 << t, but for t=60, that's 1e18ish.\n\nBut for each t, we can check if 2^t -1 >n. If so, break the loop.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the check function for a given t and n.\n\nBut in Python, functions can't be inside loops easily, but we can implement it inline.\n\nBut for each t, in the code:\n\nfor t in range(3, 61):\n\n    min_sum_for_t = (2**t -1)\n\n    if min_sum_for_t >n:\n\n        break\n\n    # proceed to check for this t.\n\n    # perform binary search for k.\n\nBut for t up to 60, 2^t can be up to 2^60, which is 1.1e18, which is manageable.\n\nNow, the code for the binary search:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for i in range(t):\n\n        total += k**i\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return n + 1  # indicates overflow\n\n    return total\n\nBut for large k and t, this can be slow. However, since t is small (up to 60), and for each binary search step, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way to compute the sum. For example, using the formula (k^t -1) // (k-1). However, for k=1, but k is ≥2. So for k ≥2, the formula is correct.\n\nBut for large exponents, computing k^t may be expensive. However, in Python, exponentiation is optimized, but for k=1e9 and t=60, k^t is 1e540 which is way beyond 1e18, but during the compute_sum function, the code would add terms until it exceeds n. So for example, if during the compute_sum, the first term is k^0=1, then k^1=k, then k^2, etc. Once the sum exceeds n, return early.\n\nBut in the binary search, the code would have already determined that high is such that compute_sum(high, t) is larger than n. So during the binary search steps, for mid, compute_sum(mid, t) would be either equal, less than, or greater than n.\n\nBut",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with a given number of vertices $ n $ can exist. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and our task is to check if there exists a valid configuration of vertices for the given $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding layers of vertices. Each layer adds $ k $ new vertices to each leaf node from the previous layer. This process must be done at least once after the initial expansion.\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**: The total number of vertices in such a graph can be represented as the sum of a geometric series $ 1 + k + k^2 + \\ldots + k^{t-1} $, where $ t $ is the number of layers and $ k $ is the number of new vertices added per leaf in each layer. This sum can be expressed as $ \\frac{k^t - 1}{k - 1} $.\n3. **Efficient Check**: For each test case, we check if there exists integers $ k > 1 $ and $ t \\geq 3 $ such that the sum equals $ n $. We iterate over possible values of $ t $ (from 3 to 60) and use binary search to find a valid $ k $ for each $ t $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t, n):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(t):\n        total += k ** i\n        if total > n:\n            return n + 1\n    return total\n\ndef check(n):\n    max_t = 60\n    for t in range(3, max_t + 1):\n        # Compute minimal sum for this t (k=2)\n        min_sum = (2 ** t) - 1\n        if min_sum > n:\n            break\n        # Binary search for k\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find upper bound for high\n        while compute_sum(high, t, n) < n:\n            high *= 2\n        # Now binary search between low and high\n        found = False\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, t, n)\n            if s == n:\n                found = True\n                break\n            elif s < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n        if found:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t_cases = int(input[0])\n    idx = 1\n    results = []\n    for _ in range(t_cases):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        if n < 7:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            if check(n):\n                results.append(\"YES\")\n            else:\n                results.append(\"NO\")\n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: For values of $ n $ less than 7, it's impossible to form a valid snowflake, so we immediately return \"NO\".\n3. **Iterating Over Possible Layers**: For each possible number of layers $ t $ (from 3 to 60), we check if the minimum possible sum (using $ k = 2 $) is less than or equal to $ n $.\n4. **Binary Search for Valid $ k $**: For each valid $ t $, we perform a binary search on $ k $ to check if there exists a value such that the sum of the geometric series equals $ n $.\n5. **Early Termination**: If a valid configuration is found, we immediately return \"YES\" for that test case. If no valid configuration is found after checking all possibilities, we return \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations within the constraints, leveraging mathematical properties and binary search for performance.",
