The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are:\n\n1. The districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between every pair. So the initial structure is a tree.\n2. After removing k districts, the remaining districts must form a connected subtree.\n3. We want to maximize the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts. Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute more. So ideally, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nWait, but how to balance between keeping high-numbered districts and maintaining connectivity. Because if you have a high-numbered district, but it's in a part of the tree that requires cutting off lower-numbered ones, but maybe you can't keep all the high ones.\n\nSo the strategy is probably to keep the largest possible districts, but ensuring that they are connected. But how?\n\nLet me think. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible districts, perhaps we need to find a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and then remove the k smallest ones (but not sure). However, the problem is that the subtree must be connected.\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is similar to finding a maximum spanning tree, but in this case, the weights are 2^i, which are very large. So the optimal subtree would be the one that includes the highest possible nodes, but connected.\n\nBut how to choose which nodes to remove. Let me think: Since each node has a value of 2^i, which is larger than the sum of all smaller nodes. For example, 2^i is greater than sum_{j=1}^{i-1} 2^j. Because sum from j=1 to m is 2^{m+1} - 2. So 2^i is bigger than that sum when i >= m+1. Wait, for example, 2^5 is 32, sum of 1-4 is 1+2+4+8=15. So yes, each higher node is worth more than all lower ones combined. Therefore, the optimal strategy is to keep the largest possible nodes, and remove the smallest ones, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nWait, but how? Because if you have a tree, and you need to select n-k nodes that form a connected subtree. Since the sum is maximized by keeping as many high-numbered nodes as possible, perhaps the optimal way is to select the largest (n -k) nodes, and then check if they form a connected subtree. If they do, then that's the answer. If not, then we need to remove some lower nodes and include higher ones. But given that higher nodes are better, perhaps we can find a way to select the largest possible nodes, and then ensure that they are connected.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a subtree that includes the largest possible nodes. Since the tree is connected, perhaps the way to do this is to start from the largest node, and then include all necessary nodes to keep the subtree connected. But since we need to remove exactly k nodes, perhaps we can model this as choosing which nodes to remove, starting with the smallest ones.\n\nWait, but here's a thought: since each node's value is so much higher than the sum of all smaller ones, the optimal solution is to keep the (n -k) largest nodes, and remove the k smallest ones. However, this is only possible if those (n -k) largest nodes are connected. Otherwise, we need to remove some of the larger ones and include smaller ones to make the subtree connected.\n\nBut how can we check if the largest (n -k) nodes form a connected subtree? For example, if the largest node is connected to other large nodes, but if not, then we need to adjust.\n\nBut considering that the tree is connected, perhaps the largest nodes form a connected subtree. But that's not necessarily true. For example, imagine a tree where node 5 is connected to node 4, which is connected to node 3, which is connected to node 2, which is connected to node 1. If n=5 and k=2, then n -k =3. The largest three nodes are 3,4,5. But they are connected (since 5 is connected to 4, which is connected to 3). So yes. But suppose the tree is structured such that node 5 is connected to node 1, and node 4 is connected to node 2. Then, the largest three nodes would be 3,4,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans than lower-numbered ones, so we aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, meaning there's exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since each district's fan count is $2^i$, higher-numbered districts are significantly more valuable. Thus, we prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure the remaining districts form a connected subtree. This can be achieved by starting from the highest-numbered district and performing a depth-first search (DFS) to include as many high-numbered districts as possible while maintaining connectivity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    # We need to keep (n - k) districts, which should be the largest ones\n    # So we start from the largest node and do a DFS to collect as many large nodes as possible\n    # Then, if we have less than (n -k), we need to include some smaller ones\n    \n    # Let's find the largest node first\n    keep_count = n - k\n    keep = set()\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # We need to select the largest nodes first, but we need to make sure they are connected\n    # Start from the largest node and do a DFS, collecting the nodes in order of their size\n    # But how to prioritize adding larger nodes?\n    # Instead, we can use a priority queue approach, but since the tree is connected, we can use a greedy approach\n    \n    # Let's try to collect the largest possible nodes first, using a BFS or DFS starting from the largest\n    # We'll start with the largest node, then add its neighbors, but prioritize larger nodes\n    \n    # However, since the tree is connected, the best way is to start from the largest node and traverse the tree,\n    # collecting as many nodes as possible, prioritizing larger ones.\n    \n    # But since we need to keep exactly (n -k) nodes, we can do a modified DFS where we collect the nodes in order of their value.\n    \n    # Another approach: the optimal set is the largest (n -k) nodes that form a connected subtree.\n    # To find this, we can start from the largest node and perform a DFS, collecting nodes in order of their value.\n    \n    # Here's a better idea: we can perform a DFS starting from the largest node, and collect all nodes that can be reached, but we need to ensure that we collect enough nodes.\n    # If the number of collected nodes is less than (n -k), we need to include other nodes.\n    \n    # However, since the tree is connected, and the largest node is part of it, we can collect the largest nodes first.\n    \n    # Let's start with the largest node and do a DFS, but track the nodes in order of their size.\n    \n    # First, collect all nodes in a list sorted in descending order\n    sorted_nodes = sorted(range(1, n+1), reverse=True)\n    \n    # We can use a priority queue approach to select the largest nodes, but ensure connectivity.\n    # Alternatively, since the tree is connected, we can use a greedy approach:\n    # Start from the largest node, and then greedily add the next largest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n    \n    # However, this might not be efficient for large n.

But what if we didn't collect enough nodes?
