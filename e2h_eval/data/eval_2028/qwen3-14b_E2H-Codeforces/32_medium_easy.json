    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the instability is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array. So when I remove one element, I want to minimize that difference. The question is, which element to remove?\n\nLet me think about the original array. Suppose the array is sorted. Because if it's sorted, then the min and max are the first and last elements. But when we remove an element, the new min and max would depend on which element we remove.\n\nWait, but for the original array, the instability is max - min. If I remove one element, the new instability will be the max of the remaining elements minus the min of the remaining elements.\n\nSo the idea is: for each element in the array, if I remove it, what is the new instability? Then take the minimum among all those possibilities.\n\nBut calculating this naively for each element would be O(n^2), which for n up to 1e5 would be way too slow. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nBut wait, if the array is sorted, maybe there's a way to compute the possible instabilities quickly.\n\nLet me think. Suppose the array is sorted. Let's say the original array is sorted as a[0], a[1], ..., a[n-1].\n\nIf I remove the first element (a[0]), then the new array's min is a[1], and max is a[n-1]. So instability is a[n-1] - a[1].\n\nIf I remove the last element (a[n-1]), then the new instability is a[n-2] - a[0].\n\nIf I remove any element in between, say a[i], then the new array's min is a[0] (since the first element is still there) and the max is a[n-1] (since the last element is still there). So the instability is a[n-1] - a[0], same as original. Wait, but that's only if the element removed is not the min or max. So in that case, removing any element that's not the first or last in the sorted array would leave the min and max as the original ones. Therefore, the instability remains the same as the original array.\n\nWait, but that's not true. For example, suppose the array is [1, 3, 4, 7]. Original instability is 7-1=6. If I remove 3, the array becomes [1,4,7], instability is 6. If I remove 4, same thing. But if I remove the first element (1), the instability is 7-3=4. If I remove the last element (7), instability is 4-1=3. So in this case, the best option is to remove the last element.\n\nSo the conclusion is that when the array is sorted, the optimal choice is to either remove the first element, the last element, or maybe some other element in between? Wait, but for elements in between, removing them doesn't change the min or max. So the instability would be same as original. So the minimal instability would be the minimum between (original instability - (if you remove first or last element)), or maybe something else.\n\nWait, no. Let me rephrase. When the array is sorted, the original instability is a[-1] - a[0]. If I remove any element except the first or last, the new instability is still a[-1] - a[0]. So the only way to get a better instability is to remove the first or last element. Because removing the first element would make the new instability a[-1] - a[1], and removing the last element would make the new instability a[-2] - a[0]. So the minimal instability is the minimum between these two options.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple elements with the same value as the first or last? Like in the first example given:\n\nInput is [1,3,3,7]. Sorted array is [1,3,3,7]. Original instability is 6. If we remove 7, the instability is 3-1=2. If we remove 1, the instability is 7-3=4. So the best is to remove 7. So in this case, the answer is min between a[-2]-a[0] (which is 3-1=2) and a[-1]-a[1] (7-3=4). So the minimal is 2.\n\nSo in this case, the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nSo for the sorted array, the answer is min( (a[-2] - a[0]), (a[-1] - a[1]) )\n\nWait, but what if n is 2? For example, input is [1, 100000], then removing either element gives instability 0. Which is the case in the second example. So for n=2, the answer is 0.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nSort the array. Then, for each possible element to remove, compute the instability. However, for the sorted array, when you remove an element, the only possible cases that can give a better instability are when you remove the first element or the last element. Because for any other element, the min and max remain the same. Therefore, the minimal instability is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nWait, but what if there are duplicates in the array? For example, if the array is [1, 2, 2, 2, 3]. Original instability is 3-1=2. If we remove the first element (1), the instability is 3-2=1. If we remove the last element (3), the instability is 2-1=1. So the answer is 1. Which is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) = 2-1=1 and (a[-1] - a[1])=3-2=1. So yes, the minimum of those two is 1.\n\nAnother example: [1, 3, 5, 7]. Original instability is 6. If we remove 1, instability is 7-3=4. Remove 7, instability is 5-1=4. So the answer is 4. Which is min between 5-1=4 and 7-3=4. So that works.\n\nBut what about if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The original instability is 4. If we remove 1, the instability is 4-2=2. If we remove 5, instability is 3-1=2. So the answer is 2. Which is min between a[-2] - a[0] (4-1=3?), wait wait. Wait, the array is [1,2,3,4,5]. a[-2] is 4, a[0] is 1. So 4-1=3. And a[-1] - a[1] is 5-2=3. So min of those is 3. But the actual answer is 2. Wait, this contradicts our previous logic. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh right, because in this case, removing the first element (1) gives the array [2,3,4,5], instability 5-2=3. But wait, the actual answer would be 3, but according to the example I thought earlier, I thought that removing 1 gives instability 4-2=2. Wait no, that was a mistake. Wait, the array after removing 1 is [2,3,4,5], so max is 5, min is 2, so instability is 3. So the correct answer is 3. So why did I think it was 2? That was a mistake. So in this case, the answer is min between 3 and 3, which is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the initial logic holds. So the conclusion is that when the array is sorted, the minimal instability after removing exactly one element is the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nBut wait, what if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Then, the original instability is 5. If we remove the first element, the instability is 6-2=4. If we remove the last element, it's 5-1=4. But what if we remove the second element (2)? The array becomes [1,3,4,5,6], instability is 6-1=5. Which is worse. So the minimal is indeed 4. Which is the min between a[-2]-a[0] (5-1=4) and a[-1]-a[1] (6-2=4). So the logic holds.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- Sort the array.\n- Compute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n- That's the answer.\n\nWait, but what if n is 2? For example, n=2, the array is [a, b]. After removing one element, the array has one element, so the instability is 0. So in this case, the answer is 0. Which is handled by the formula, since for n=2, a[-2] is a[0], and a[-1] is a[1]. So (a[-2] - a[0]) is 0, and (a[-1] - a[1]) is 0. So min is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the approach is to sort the array, then compute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nWait, but what if the array is [1, 1, 1, 1]. Then, after removing any element, the instability is 0. So the formula gives (a[-2] - a[0]) = 1-1=0, and (a[-1] - a[1]) = 1-1=0. So correct.\n\nAnother test case: the first example in the problem. Input array [1,3,3,7]. Sorted is [1,3,3,7]. a[-2] is 3, a[0] is 1. So 3-1=2. a[-1] is 7, a[1] is 3. 7-3=4. So min is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: input [1, 100000]. Sorted array is [1, 100000]. a[-2] - a[0] is 1 -1 =0. a[-1] -a[1] is 100000-1=99999. So min is 0. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Sort the array.\n\n- If n == 2, then the answer is 0.\n\n- Else, compute the minimum between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because when you remove the first element, the new array's min is a[1], max is a[-1], so instability is a[-1] - a[1]. When you remove the last element, the new array's min is a[0], max is a[-2], so instability is a[-2] - a[0]. So the minimal between these two options is the answer. Because for any other element, removing it does not change the min and max, so the instability remains the same as original (a[-1] - a[0]). But if the original instability is higher than the two options, then the answer is the min between those two.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it. Then, if n is 2, output 0. Otherwise, compute min between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple elements that can be removed to get a lower instability? For example, if the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], then removing the first element gives instability 6-2=4, removing the last element gives instability 6-1=5. So the minimum is 4. But what if there's another element to remove that gives a better result? For example, suppose the array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Removing the first element gives instability 7-2=5. Removing the last element gives 7-1=6. But what if I remove the second element (2), then the array is [1,3,4,5,6,7,8]. The instability is 8-1=7. Which is worse. So no, the best is to remove the first or last element.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the minimal instability is the minimum between the two options: removing the first element or removing the last element.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=2. Output 0.\n\nCase 2: All elements are the same. Then, after removing any element, the instability is 0. So the code returns 0.\n\nCase 3: n=3. For example, [1, 2, 3]. The options are:\n\nremove 1: instability is 3-2=1.\n\nremove 2: instability is 3-1=2.\n\nremove 3: instability is 2-1=1.\n\nSo the answer is 1. Which is min between (a[-2] - a[0]) = 2-1=1 and (a[-1] -a[1]) = 3-2=1. So correct.\n\nAnother case for n=3: [1, 3, 5]. The answer is min(3-1=2, 5-3=2) → 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: [1, 5, 5]. Then, removing 1 gives instability 5-5=0. Removing 5 gives instability 5-1=4. So the answer is 0. Which is min between (a[-2] - a[0]) =5-1=4 and (a[-1] -a[1])=5-5=0. So correct.\n\nSo the code works for that.\n\nSo the code steps are:\n\nRead n, read the array, sort it.\n\nIf n is 2, output 0.\n\nElse, compute min between (a[-2] - a[0]) and (a[-1] - a[1]).\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read list of integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nIf n == 2: print 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\noption2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\nresult = min(option1, option2)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n4\n\n1 3 3 7 → sorted is [1,3,3,7]\n\noption1 is a[-2] - a[0] → 3 - 1 = 2.\n\noption2 is a[-1] - a[1] →7 -3=4. min is 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2\n\n1 100000 → output 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, [1, 2, 3]. options are 2-1=1 and 3-2=1. min is 1.\n\nAnother test case: [1, 5, 5], sorted [1,5,5]. option1 is 5-1=4, option2 is 5-5=0. So min is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut note that for n=2, the code returns 0. For other cases, compute the options.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n from stdin.\n\nThen read the array as list of integers.\n\nSort it.\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nBut wait, what about n=3?\n\nYes, for example, n=3, the code works.\n\nBut what if n is 1? Well, the problem says n is at least 2.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nRead n from input.\n\nThen read the array.\n\nBut for the input, the second line is n integers.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nif n == 2:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n\n    option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n\n    print(min(option1, option2))\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the code would return 2, which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: input is 3 elements [1, 5, 5]. The code returns min(5-1=4, 5-5=0) → 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: [1, 3, 5, 7], n=4. option1 is 5-1=4, option2 is 7-3=4. min is 4. Which is correct.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nBut what about if the array is [1, 2, 5, 5, 5]. Then, the options are:\n\noption1 is a[-2] - a[0] →5 -1=4.\n\noption2 is a[-1] -a[1] →5 -2=3. So min is 3. Which is correct, because removing the first element (1) gives instability 5-2=3. Or removing the last element (5) gives instability 5-1=4. So the minimal is 3.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently determining the minimum and maximum values after removing one element.\n2. **Handle Edge Case for n=2**: If the array has only two elements, removing either element results in an instability of 0.\n3. **Calculate Minimum Instability**: For arrays with more than two elements, the optimal strategy involves considering two scenarios:\n   - Removing the first element of the sorted array, which results in the instability being the difference between the second last element and the first element.\n   - Removing the last element of the sorted array, which results in the instability being the difference between the last element and the second element.\n4. **Result Calculation**: The minimum instability is the smaller value between the two scenarios mentioned above.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    if n == 2:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        option1 = a[-2] - a[0]\n        option2 = a[-1] - a[1]\n        print(min(option1, option2))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting the Array**: By sorting the array, we can easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are crucial for calculating instability.\n- **Edge Case Handling**: When the array length is 2, removing any element leaves a single-element array, which has zero instability.\n- **Efficient Calculation**: By evaluating the instability when removing the first or last element of the sorted array, we efficiently determine the minimum possible instability without needing to check each element individually, leading to an optimal O(n log n) time complexity due to sorting. This approach ensures we handle large input sizes efficiently.",
