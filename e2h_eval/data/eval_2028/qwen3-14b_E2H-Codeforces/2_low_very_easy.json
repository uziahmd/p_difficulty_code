Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. But wait, the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letters. So, for example, all cells in the main diagonal must be the same as each other, and all cells in the other diagonal must be the same as each other. Also, the two diagonals must have the same letter? Or can they be different?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\". Oh, so the entire diagonals must have the same letter. So the main diagonal has all the same character, and the other diagonal also has all the same character. But what about between the two diagonals? Are they allowed to be different? Wait, no. Because the second condition says that all other squares (not on diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the letters on the diagonals. So the two diagonals must have the same letter, or can they be different?\n\nWait, no. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same; all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals.\"\n\nSo, the first part says that both diagonals have all letters the same. But does that mean that both diagonals have the same letter as each other? Or each diagonal has its own same letter?\n\nFor example, suppose the main diagonal is all 'a's, and the other diagonal is all 'b's. Then, the other squares must be all the same letter, but different from both 'a' and 'b'? Or is it that the other squares must be different from the letters on the diagonals, which would require that the two diagonals have the same letter?\n\nBecause if the two diagonals have different letters, then the other squares must be different from both. But that's impossible if the other squares are all the same. Because suppose the diagonals have 'a' and 'b', then the other squares must be a letter that is not 'a' and not 'b'. But then, the diagonals are not the same. So, the problem statement says that the diagonals must have the same letters. Wait, the wording is:\n\n\"on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same\"\n\nSo, perhaps each diagonal has all letters the same. But the two diagonals can have different letters? Or does \"the same\" here refer to both diagonals having the same letter?\n\nThis is critical. Let's look at the example given.\n\nIn the sample input, the second case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nWhich outputs YES.\n\nLet's see. The diagonals are:\n\nFirst diagonal (0,0), (1,1), (2,2): w, s, w. Wait, that's not all the same. Wait, but the sample output says YES. Wait that can't be right. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait no, let me check again. The input is:\n\nFor the second case:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nThe main diagonal is (0,0)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,2)=w. So all same.\n\nThe other diagonal is (0,2)=w, (1,1)=w, (2,0)=w. So all same. So both diagonals are same letters (all w). Then the other squares (non-diagonal) are:\n\nLooking at each cell not on the diagonals. Let's see for n=3, the diagonals are positions where row == column or row + column == n-1 (since n is 3, 0-based). For n=3, row+column = 2.\n\nSo for each cell (i,j):\n\nIf i == j",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' based on specific conditions. The conditions are that both diagonals of the square must have the same letters, and all other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter different from those on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: Verify that all elements on both diagonals are the same. For a square grid of size `n x n`, the main diagonal runs from the top-left to the bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal runs from the top-right to the bottom-left.\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: Ensure that all elements not on the diagonals are the same and different from the diagonal elements.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check if both diagonals have the same character\ndiag1_char = grid[0][0]\ndiag2_char = grid[0][n-1]\n\nvalid = True\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        # Check if current cell is on either diagonal\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            # Check if it matches the diagonal characters\n            if i == j:\n                if grid[i][j] != diag1_char:\n                    valid = False\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != diag2_char:\n                    valid = False\n        else:\n            # Check if it's the same as non-diagonal character\n            # We need to track the non-diagonal character\n            pass\n\n# Now check the non-diagonal elements\nnon_diag_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        if non_diag_char is None:\n            non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                valid = False\n\n# Check if the non-diagonal character is different from both diagonals\nif non_diag_char is not None:\n    if non_diag_char == diag1_char or non_diag_char == diag2_char:\n        valid = False\n\n# Also, ensure that both diagonals have the same character\nif diag1_char != diag2_char:\n    valid = False\n\nprint(\"YES\" if valid else \"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Checks**: The main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are checked for uniformity. If any element on these diagonals does not match the expected character, the result is marked invalid.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Checks**: All elements not on the diagonals are checked to ensure they are uniform and different from the diagonal characters. This involves tracking the first non-diagonal character and ensuring all others match it while also verifying it is different from the diagonal characters.\n4. **Final Validation**: The result is printed as \"YES\" if all conditions are met, otherwise \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check both the diagonal and non-diagonal conditions in a single pass through the grid, making the solution both optimal and straightforward.",
