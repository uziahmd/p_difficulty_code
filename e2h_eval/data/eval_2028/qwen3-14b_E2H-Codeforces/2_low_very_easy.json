Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check if all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check if all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same and not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nFirst, collect all the characters from the diagonals. Then check if they are all the same. Then collect all non-diagonal characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, for the diagonals, there's an overlap in the middle cell when n is odd. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell is part of both diagonals. So when checking, we need to make sure that all cells in both diagonals are same. So for each cell in the two diagonals, check if they are same as the first diagonal's first cell.\n\nWait, but perhaps the first step is to collect all the diagonal cells and check if they are all the same. Then collect all non-diagonal cells and check if they are all same and different.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the grid.\n- For each cell, determine if it's on either of the two diagonals.\n- Collect all the characters from the diagonals into a set. If the size of this set is not 1, then return NO.\n- Collect all the non-diagonal characters into another set. If the size of this set is not 1, return NO.\n- Also, check that the two sets (diagonal and non-diagonal) are different. If they are same, return NO.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the non-diagonal letters must be same and different from the diagonal's letters. So:\n\n- The diagonal set must have exactly one character (d_char).\n- The non-diagonal set must have exactly one character (n_char).\n- And d_char != n_char.\n\nSo, steps:\n\nCheck all diagonal cells: all same?\n\nCheck all non-diagonal cells: all same?\n\nCheck that the two characters are different.\n\nIf all three conditions are true, output YES, else NO.\n\nSo how to check if all diagonal cells are same?\n\nLet me think about how to loop through the diagonals.\n\nFor a cell (i,j) in a grid, it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, check if it's on either of those.\n\nSo, for each cell (i, j):\n\nif i == j or i + j == n-1 → part of diagonals.\n\nElse → part of non-diagonals.\n\nSo, first, collect all the diagonal characters. Let's take the first diagonal cell (0,0) as the reference. All other diagonal cells must be same as this.\n\nWait, but what if the first cell is part of both diagonals? Like in the case of n=3, (1,1) is part of both. But in any case, the code can collect all the diagonal characters and check that they are all same.\n\nSo, for example, for the first step:\n\nd_chars = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n) if i == j or i + j == n-1]\n\nThen check if all elements in d_chars are same. If not, return NO.\n\nThen, collect all non-diagonal characters:\n\nnon_d_chars = [grid[i][j] for i in range(n) for j in range(n) if not (i == j or i + j == n-1)]\n\nCheck if all elements in non_d_chars are same. If not, return NO.\n\nThen check if the first element of d_chars is different from first element of non_d_chars. Wait, but if non_d_chars is empty? Wait, no. Because n is at least 3, and for n=3, the diagonals have 3 + ",
