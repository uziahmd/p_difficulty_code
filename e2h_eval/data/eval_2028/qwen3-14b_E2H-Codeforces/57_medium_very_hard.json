His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have based on the given points from two tours. \n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. We have n participants. Each has a score in the first tour (array a) and second tour (array b). But the problem is that the a and b arrays are not paired. That is, for each participant, their first tour score is a_i and second is b_j, but we don't know which a_i pairs with which b_j. However, we know that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >= x. \n\nOur goal is to determine the best possible rank (minimum possible) and worst possible rank (maximum possible) that Vasya could have, considering all possible pairings of a and b. \n\nSo, for the best rank, we want to maximize Vasya's total points, so that he is as high as possible. For the worst rank, we want to minimize his total points (but still ensuring that it's at least x), so that he is as low as possible.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet's think about the best case first. To get the best possible rank, we need to choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as large as possible. Because if Vasya has the maximum possible total, then he can be placed first. But wait, maybe there are other participants with higher totals. Wait, no. Because if we choose the maximum possible a_i + b_j for Vasya, then others can't have higher than that. Wait, but others are also paired. So for the best case, we need to pair Vasya's a_i and b_j such that his total is as high as possible. Then, others can be paired in a way that as many as possible have lower totals. But since the problem allows the jury to assign ranks when there are ties, the best possible rank for Vasya would be 1 if there's a way to pair his a_i and b_j to get the maximum possible sum, and then arrange others such that no one else has a higher sum than him. \n\nWait, but how do we compute that? Let's think:\n\nFor the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya's total is as high as possible. So, the maximum possible total he can have is the maximum a_i + b_j. But since we need to have at least x, but the problem says that there exists a pair with sum >=x. So, for the best case, we can take the maximum possible sum for Vasya. Then, the best rank is 1 if there are no other participants with sum higher than that. But how can we calculate how many participants could have a higher or equal sum?\n\nWait, but the problem is that the other participants' pairings can be arranged in any way. For example, when calculating the best rank, we can arrange the pairings so that as few as possible people have a higher sum than Vasya's. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nAlternatively, the best possible rank is determined by the number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum. But since we can arrange the pairings optimally for the best case, we can choose Vasya's sum to be as high as possible, and arrange others' pairings such that as few as possible have higher sums. \n\nSo for the best case scenario, we can choose Vasya's sum to be the maximum possible (max_a + max_b). Then, the number of people that can have a sum higher than this is zero. Hence, his best possible rank is 1. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because for example, if there are multiple people who can have higher sums. Wait, no. If Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, then no one else can have a higher sum. Because the maximum possible sum is the sum of the maximum a_i and maximum b_j. So if we pair those two, then others can't have a higher sum. So in that case, the best possible rank is 1. \n\nBut what if there are multiple people with the same maximum sum? Like, suppose there are multiple a_i's equal to max_a, and multiple b_j's equal to max_b. Then, when pairing them, maybe others can have the same sum. But since the jury can assign ranks arbitrarily, Vasya can be placed first. \n\nSo for the best possible rank, it's always 1. Wait, but in the first sample input, the output is 1. Let me check that. \n\nIn the first sample input, all a_i are 1 and all b_i are 1. So the maximum sum is 2. All participants have sum 2. So the best possible rank is 1 (if the jury gives him first place) and worst is 5 (since there are 5 people). \n\nSo according to this logic, the best possible rank is 1. But how do we confirm that? \n\nYes, because for the best case, we can choose the highest possible sum for Vasya. Then, even if others have the same sum, the jury can assign him first place. \n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. But wait, no. What if there's no way for Vasya to have a sum that's higher than others? Like, if all participants have the same sum. Then the best possible is 1. \n\nBut what if there are other participants that can't have a sum higher than Vasya's. Then the best possible is 1. \n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. But why does the second example output 1 as the best? Because in that case, the maximum possible sum for Vasya is 4+8=12. And others can't have more than that. \n\nSo, perhaps the best possible rank is always 1. But that's not possible. Wait, what if there are multiple people with the same maximum sum. But the problem says that the jury can assign the ranks as they like. So, even if there are 5 people with the same maximum sum, Vasya can be first. So the best possible rank is always 1. \n\nBut why in the first sample, the output is 1. So that's correct. \n\nWait, then why the second sample's output is 1 and 5? Because the best possible is 1. \n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is always 1? But how? \n\nWait, but what if Vasya's maximum possible sum is not the maximum possible overall? For example, suppose that the maximum sum possible for Vasya is 10, but there exists some other participant that can have a sum of 10. But wait, no. Because if Vasya's sum is 10 (the maximum possible), then others can't have a higher sum. Because that would require that someone else's a_i + b_j is higher than that. But the maximum possible sum is the maximum a_i plus maximum b_j. So if Vasya takes that pair, then others can't have higher than that. \n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1. \n\nBut then why in the first sample, the output is 1. So that's correct. \n\nSo, perhaps the best possible rank is always 1. But why? \n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose that Vasya's maximum possible sum is S. Now, how many other participants can have a sum >= S? Well, if there are multiple a_i's and b_j's that can form S. For example, if there are two a_i's with value A, and two b_j's with value B, where A + B = S. Then, if Vasya takes one of them, another participant could take another pair, leading to same sum. But since the jury can assign ranks, Vasya can be first. \n\nThus, regardless of how many people have the same maximum sum, the best possible rank is 1. \n\nSo the best possible rank is always 1. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the teacher knows that Vasya has at least x points. So, for the best case, we can choose the maximum possible sum (as long as it's >=x). But maybe the maximum possible sum is less than x? No, because the problem says that there exists at least one pair with sum >=x. So the maximum possible sum is at least x. \n\nSo for the best case, the answer is 1. \n\nBut why in the sample input 2, the output is 1. Which is correct. \n\nSo, the best possible rank is 1. So the first part of the output is always 1. \n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWhat if there are other participants that can have a higher sum than Vasya's maximum possible sum? No, because Vasya's maximum possible sum is the maximum possible of a_i + b_j. So, if Vasya takes that pair, others can't have higher. \n\nTherefore, the best possible rank is always 1. \n\nSo, the first part of the output is always 1. \n\nNow, the problem is to compute the worst possible rank. \n\nSo, the worst possible rank is determined by how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum. But since we can arrange the pairings in a way that maximizes the number of people with higher sum than Vasya. \n\nBut how do we find that? \n\nThe key is to find the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have (but still >=x), and then count how many participants can have a sum higher than that. \n\nBut how to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya? \n\nWait, no. Because the minimal possible sum for Vasya is x. But since the problem says that there exists a pair with sum >=x, but for the worst case, we can choose a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as small as possible (but still >=x). Then, for that sum, we need to find how many participants can have a sum higher than that. \n\nBut how to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya. \n\nBut how do we find the minimal possible sum that is >=x. \n\nSo, for the worst case, we need to select a pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j is as small as possible (but still >=x). Then, the worst possible rank is the number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than that value, plus 1. \n\nBut how to compute that? \n\nBut how to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya. \n\nSo, the minimal sum for Vasya is x. But maybe there's no pair with exactly x. So the minimal possible sum is the minimal value s >=x such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum s. \n\nBut how to find that? \n\nAlternatively, for the worst case, we want to find the minimal possible s (>=x) that Vasya can have, and then count how many participants can have sum >s. \n\nBut how to find that minimal s. \n\nBut perhaps the minimal s is x. However, if there's no pair that adds up to x, then we need to find the next possible. \n\nBut how to find the minimal s >=x such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum s. \n\nBut perhaps that's not necessary. Because for the worst case, we can choose any pair that gives a sum >=x. So, to maximize the number of people with higher sums, we need to choose the minimal possible sum for Vasya. Because if his sum is smaller, then more people can have higher sums. \n\nSo the approach is: \n\nFor the worst case, find the minimal possible sum s (s >=x) that can be achieved by Vasya. Then, compute how many participants can have sum >s. Then the worst possible rank is that count + 1. \n\nBut how to find that minimal s. \n\nBut how do we find the minimal possible s >=x. \n\nThis seems like a problem where we need to find the minimal s >=x such that there exists a_i and b_j with a_i + b_j = s. \n\nBut perhaps the minimal s is x. However, if there's no such pair, then we need to find the next possible. \n\nBut how to find that? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal possible s is the minimal value that is >=x and can be formed by a_i + b_j. \n\nBut how to find that? \n\nWell, perhaps we can sort the a and b arrays. Then for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then, the minimal s is the minimum over all these possibilities. \n\nBut that's a possible approach. \n\nBut let's think. For example, if we have a_i sorted in ascending order, and b_j sorted in ascending order. For each a_i, find the minimal b_j that when added to a_i gives >=x. Then, for each a_i, the minimal possible b_j is the first one in the sorted b array that meets a_i + b_j >=x. \n\nBut then the minimal s for Vasya is the minimal among all a_i + b_j for such pairs. \n\nOnce we have that minimal s, then we need to count how many participants can have sum >s. \n\nBut how to count that. \n\nBut how to count the maximum number of participants that can have a sum greater than s. \n\nBecause when we are trying to find the worst case for Vasya, we want to maximize the number of people with sum higher than his s. \n\nSo, for that, we need to pair the a and b arrays in a way that as many as possible participants have a sum higher than s. \n\nBut how? \n\nThe way to maximize the number of participants with sum >s is to pair the a and b arrays in a way that as many pairs as possible have sum >s. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to: given the arrays a and b, find the maximum number of pairs (each element used once) where a_i + b_j > s. \n\nBut how to compute that maximum number. \n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding maximum matching between two arrays where the sum is greater than s. \n\nTo find the maximum number of pairs with a_i + b_j >s, we can use a greedy approach. \n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet, such that a_i + b_j >s. \n\nAlternatively, sort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, find the smallest b_j that can be paired with it to get a sum >s. \n\nWait, but this is similar to the two pointers approach. \n\nLet me think. Suppose we sort a in ascending order, and sort b in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, we want to find the smallest b_j that is larger than (s - a_i). Then, the number of elements in b that are larger than (s - a_i) would be the possible candidates for pairing. \n\nBut how to maximize the number of pairs. \n\nThe standard approach for maximum number of pairs with sum >s is to sort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Then, use two pointers. Start with the largest a_i and the largest b_j. If a_i + b_j >s, then we can pair them, and move both pointers. Else, we need to move the a pointer to the left (since a_i is too small, even with the largest possible b_j). \n\nWait, that's the approach for maximum number of pairs. Let me think. \n\nLet me take an example. Suppose a is [1, 2, 3], b is [4, 5, 6]. s is 5. \n\nWe want to find the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j >5. \n\nIf we sort a ascending, and b ascending. Then, start with a[0] (smallest a) and b[2] (largest b). \n\na[0] + b[2] = 1+6=7>5. So pair them. Now, count increases by 1. Then, move to a[1] and b[1]. \n\na[1]+b[1] = 2+5=7>5. Count becomes 2. Then, a[2] and b[0]: 3+4=7>5. Count 3. \n\nSo total 3 pairs. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: a is [1, 1, 1], b is [1, 1, 1], s=2. \n\nWe need pairs where sum is >2. So sum must be 3. Each pair is 1+1=2 which is not >2. So maximum pairs is 0. \n\nSo the approach would be:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. \n\nInitialize i = 0 (start of a), j = n-1 (end of b). \n\ncount = 0 \n\nfor each a_i in a:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] > s: \n\n       count +=1 \n\n       i +=1 \n\n       j -=1 \n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1 \n\nWait, no. Wait, the idea is that for the largest possible b_j, we try to pair with the smallest a_i that can be paired with it. \n\nAlternatively, here's the two pointers approach:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. \n\nInitialize i = 0 (start of a), j = n-1 (end of b). \n\ncount = 0 \n\nfor each element in a:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] > s:\n\n       count +=1 \n\n       i +=1 \n\n       j -=1 \n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1 \n\nBut this approach may not work in all cases. Let's see. \n\nTake the first example where a is [1,2,3], b is [4,5,6], s=5. \n\nInitially, i=0, j=2. a[0]=1 + b[2]=6=7>5. So count becomes 1. i=1, j=1. a[1]=2 + b[1]=5=7>5. count 2. i=2, j=0. a[2]=3 + b[0]=4=7>5. count 3. Correct. \n\nAnother example: a = [1, 3, 5], b = [2, 4, 6], s=5. \n\nWe want to find maximum pairs with sum >5. \n\nPossible pairs:\n\n(3,4) sum 7\n\n(5,6) sum 11\n\n(1,6) sum 7. \n\nSo maximum pairs is 2. \n\nUsing the two pointers approach:\n\nSort a as [1,3,5], sort b as [2,4,6]. \n\ni=0, j=2. 1+6=7>5. count=1. i=1, j=1. 3+4=7>5. count=2. i=2, j=0. 5+2=7>5. count=3. \n\nBut that's wrong. Because the actual maximum is 3 pairs. \n\nWait, but in that case, all possible pairs sum to 7 or more. \n\nYes, because:\n\nEach pair (1,2) sum 3 which is not >5. But in the two pointers approach, the code would pair 1 with 6, 3 with 4, 5 with 2. All three pairs sum to 7, 7, 7. So the count is 3. Which is correct. \n\nSo the two pointers approach gives the correct maximum count. \n\nSo, the algorithm for maximum number of pairs with sum >s is:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. \n\nInitialize i = 0 (start of a), j = n-1 (end of b). \n\ncount = 0 \n\nwhile i < n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] > s:\n\n       count +=1 \n\n       i +=1 \n\n       j -=1 \n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1 \n\nSo this gives the maximum number of pairs that can be formed with sum >s. \n\nSo, for the worst case scenario, we need to find the minimal possible s (>=x) that Vasya can have. Then, the worst rank is the number of participants that can have sum >s (which is the maximum count from the above algorithm) plus 1. \n\nBut how to find the minimal possible s for Vasya. \n\nSo, the problem now is to find the minimal possible s such that s >=x and there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum s. \n\nOnce we have that s, then compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s. \n\nBut how to find that minimal s. \n\nSo, the minimal s is the minimal value that is >=x and can be achieved by some a_i + b_j. \n\nBut how to find this s. \n\nAn approach is to generate all possible a_i + b_j, then find the minimal s that is >=x. \n\nBut since n can be up to 1e5, generating all possible pairs would be O(n^2), which is impossible. \n\nTherefore, we need a more efficient way. \n\nAlternative approach: \n\nWe can find the minimal s >=x by using binary search. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think. \n\nWe can sort a and sort b. \n\nFor a given value of s, can we find at least one pair (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j >=s? \n\nBut how to find the minimal s >=x. \n\nAlternatively, we can find the minimal possible s >=x such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >=s. \n\nBut how to find this minimal s. \n\nWait, but the minimal s is x, but only if there exists a pair with sum >=x. \n\nBut the problem says that it is guaranteed that there exists such a pair. \n\nSo, perhaps the minimal possible s is x. \n\nBut if there is no pair with sum exactly x, but there are pairs with sum greater than x. \n\nWait, but for the worst case scenario, we want the minimal possible s that is >=x. So the minimal possible s is the minimal value that is >=x and can be achieved by some pair. \n\nBut how to find that. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nWe can sort the a array and the b array. \n\nThen, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. \n\nThe minimal s for that a_i is a_i + b_j. \n\nWe can then find the minimal s across all a_i. \n\nBut how to find the minimal b_j for each a_i. \n\nFor example, for a given a_i, the minimal b_j that satisfies a_i + b_j >=x is the first element in the sorted b array that is >= (x - a_i). \n\nSo, if we sort the b array, for each a_i, we can perform a binary search to find the minimal b_j that satisfies this condition. \n\nOnce we find that, the minimal s for this a_i is a_i + b_j. \n\nThen, the overall minimal s is the minimum of all such s's across all a_i. \n\nBut this would give us the minimal possible s that Vasya can have (as long as it's >=x). \n\nYes, because for each a_i, we find the minimal b_j that when added to a_i gives >=x. Then, the minimal of all those a_i + b_j is the minimal possible s. \n\nSo, the steps for finding the minimal s are:\n\nSort the b array. \n\nFor each a_i in a:\n\n   target = x - a_i \n\n   find the smallest b_j >= target. \n\n   if such a b_j exists, then s_candidate = a_i + b_j \n\n   keep track of the minimal s_candidate. \n\nSo, after checking all a_i, the minimal s_candidate is the minimal possible s. \n\nBut if there's no such b_j for a_i, then this a_i cannot be paired with any b_j to reach x. However, the problem states that there exists at least one pair (i,j) with sum >=x, so for at least one a_i, there exists a b_j. \n\nOnce we find this minimal s, then we proceed to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >s, and then add 1 to get the worst possible rank. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. For the best possible rank, it's always 1. \n\n2. For the worst possible rank:\n\n   a. Find the minimal possible s >=x that can be achieved by some pair (a_i, b_j). \n\n   b. Compute the maximum number of pairs (participants) that can have a sum >s. \n\n   c. The worst possible rank is that number + 1. \n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead n and x. \n\nRead array a and array b. \n\nSort array b. \n\nCompute the minimal s as follows:\n\n   min_s = infinity \n\n   for each ai in a:\n\n       target = x - ai \n\n       find the first index in sorted b where b_j >= target \n\n       if found, then candidate = ai + b_j \n\n       if candidate < min_s, update min_s \n\n   So, after all ai, min_s is the minimal s. \n\nOnce min_s is found, compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > min_s. \n\nHow to compute that? Using the two pointers approach as discussed earlier. \n\nSo, sort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. \n\nThen, use two pointers approach to find the maximum number of pairs with sum > min_s. \n\nThen, worst_rank = count + 1. \n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple pairs that can be formed with sum > min_s. But since we are to count the maximum possible, the two pointers approach gives that. \n\nSo, the worst_rank is the count of such pairs plus 1. \n\nBut why plus 1? Because if there are 'count' participants with sum >s, then Vasya's rank is count + 1. \n\nYes. Because if there are k participants with higher sum than Vasya's s, then he can be placed at k+1-th position. \n\nBut in the worst case scenario, we want to maximize k. \n\nSo, the code for the worst case is as described. \n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample inputs. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=5, x=2 \n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nsorted b is [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nFor each ai (which is 1), target is x - ai = 2-1=1. \n\nFind the first b_j >=1. That is index 0. So candidate is 1+1=2. So min_s is 2. \n\nThen, compute maximum number of pairs with sum >2. \n\nsum >2 is sum >=3. But since all a_i and b_j are 1, sum is 2. So no pairs. count is 0. \n\nworst_rank = 0 +1 =1? But sample output is 5. \n\nWait, this is a problem. \n\nWait, the sample input's first case output is 1 5. \n\nSo according to our approach, for the worst case, the code computes worst_rank as 0 +1 =1, but the correct answer is 5. \n\nSo there's a mistake here. \n\nWhat's wrong? \n\nAh! Oh right, the minimal s is 2. But in this case, all participants have sum 2. So, the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s is 0. Therefore, the worst possible rank is 0+1=1. But the sample output is 5. \n\nSo clearly, there's a mistake in the logic. \n\nWait, what's the correct worst possible rank here? \n\nIn the first sample, all participants have sum 2. Since Vasya's sum is 2, the worst possible rank is 5. Because all participants have the same sum. So the jury can assign him the last place. \n\nBut according to our approach, the code counts the number of participants with sum >s (which is zero) and adds 1. Which gives 1, but the correct answer is 5. \n\nSo, our approach is wrong. \n\nWhat's the error here? \n\nAh! Because in the worst case scenario, Vasya's sum is s. The number of participants that have sum strictly greater than s is count. Then, the worst possible rank is count + 1. But if there are other participants with sum equal to s, then they can be placed after Vasya, so the rank is count + number_of_equal_participants + 1? Or not? \n\nNo. Because the problem says that if two or more participants have the same sum, the jury can assign places as they like. \n\nSo, for the worst case, we want to maximize the number of participants that are ranked higher than Vasya. \n\nSo, when Vasya's sum is s, the number of participants with sum strictly greater than s is count. Additionally, there are some participants with sum equal to s. In the worst case, the jury can place all of them before Vasya. \n\nSo, the worst possible rank is count + 1 (if there are no others with same sum) or count + number_of_same + 1? No. \n\nWait, the problem says that when participants have same sum, the jury can assign the places. So, for the worst case, the teacher wants to arrange the participants in such a way that Vasya's rank is as bad as possible. \n\nSo, if there are m participants with sum equal to s (including Vasya), then the worst possible rank is count + m. Because the jury can place all m participants (including Vasya) after the count participants with higher sum. But since the jury can arrange the same sum participants in any order, the worst case for Vasya is that all the same sum participants are placed after the ones with higher sum. \n\nSo, the worst possible rank is count + m. \n\nBut how to compute m. \n\nBut m is the number of participants that can have sum equal to s. \n\nBut how to compute that. \n\nSo, the problem is that our previous approach only considered the number of participants with sum >s. But in reality, the worst case is when the number of participants with sum >s plus the number of participants with sum ==s (excluding Vasya) is added to the count. \n\nBut how to compute that. \n\nSo, for the worst possible rank, we need to find the number of participants that can have sum >s (call this count_higher) plus the number of participants that can have sum ==s (call this count_equal). Then, the worst possible rank is count_higher + count_equal + 1? Or count_higher + count_equal? \n\nWait, if there are count_higher participants with higher sum, and count_equal participants with same sum (including Vasya), then the worst possible rank is count_higher + count_equal. Because the jury can arrange all the count_equal participants to be after the count_higher. So, Vasya can be placed last among the count_equal. \n\nBut how to compute count_higher and count_equal. \n\nBut how to compute how many participants can have sum >=s. \n\nBut in our approach, for the worst case, we have chosen s as the minimal possible sum that Vasya can have (>=x). So, the question is, how many participants can have sum >s, and how many can have sum ==s. \n\nBut how to compute that. \n\nThis complicates the problem. \n\nSo, the initial approach was incorrect because it didn't account for participants with the same sum as Vasya. \n\nSo, the correct approach for the worst possible rank is:\n\nOnce we have s (the minimal sum that Vasya can have), then the worst possible rank is the number of participants with sum >s (call this count_higher) plus the number of participants with sum ==s (call this count_equal) minus 1 (because Vasya is one of the count_equal participants). Then, the rank is count_higher + count_equal. \n\nWait, because the count_equal includes Vasya. So, the other participants with sum ==s can be placed before him, so he is last among them. \n\nFor example, if there are 5 participants with sum ==s, then the worst possible rank is count_higher + 5. \n\nBut how to compute count_higher and count_equal. \n\nBut how to compute the maximum possible count_higher and count_equal. \n\nWait, but the count_higher is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >s. \n\nBut the count_equal is the maximum number of participants that can have sum ==s. \n\nBut how to compute that. \n\nBut how to find the maximum possible number of participants with sum >=s. \n\nAlternatively, for the worst case, the number of participants that can have sum >=s is (count_higher + count_equal). \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nBut how to find the maximum number of participants with sum >=s. \n\nThis seems complicated. \n\nBut perhaps the problem is that when we compute the maximum number of participants with sum >s, we are not considering that the same pairs used to compute that count may not allow for other pairs with sum ==s. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the maximum number of participants with sum >=s. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think. \n\nWe need to find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can have sum >=s. \n\nBut how to compute that. \n\nBut how to compute that. \n\nThis seems challenging. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the maximum number of pairs that can have sum >=s. \n\nBut for the worst case scenario, we want to maximize the number of participants that have sum >=s. Because that would mean that Vasya is placed after as many as possible participants. \n\nBut how to compute that. \n\nBut perhaps the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s is (total_pairs). \n\nBut that's not helpful. \n\nLet me think again. \n\nThe worst possible rank is determined by the number of participants that can have sum greater than s (count_higher) plus the number of participants that can have sum equal to s (count_equal). Because in the worst case, all of them are placed before Vasya. \n\nSo, the worst possible rank is count_higher + count_equal. \n\nBut how to compute count_higher and count_equal. \n\nBut how to compute count_higher. \n\nEarlier, we computed count_higher as the maximum number of pairs with sum >s. \n\nBut how to compute count_equal. \n\nBut count_equal is the maximum number of pairs with sum ==s. \n\nBut how to compute that. \n\nBut perhaps the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s is (count_higher + count_equal). \n\nBut how to compute this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s. \n\nBut how? \n\nLet me think of the following approach. \n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. \n\nFor the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s, we can use a modified two pointers approach. \n\nLet me think. \n\nFor example, we can try to pair the smallest a_i with the largest possible b_j such that a_i + b_j >=s. \n\nLet me think of the following approach: \n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. \n\nInitialize i = 0, j = n-1. \n\ncount = 0 \n\nwhile i < n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] >=s:\n\n       count +=1 \n\n       i +=1 \n\n       j -=1 \n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1 \n\nThis gives the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s. \n\nYes. Because for each a_i, we try to pair it with the largest possible b_j that can make the sum >=s. \n\nThis is similar to the previous approach. \n\nSo, in the first sample input, where s=2, a and b are all 1's. \n\nSo, for each a_i, we pair with b_j. \n\ncount will be 5. \n\nSo, count_higher is the number of pairs with sum >s. \n\nIn this case, sum is 2, which is not >s. So count_higher is zero. \n\ncount_equal is 5. \n\nThus, worst_rank = 0 +5 =5, which matches the sample. \n\nSo, the problem is that we need to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s (call it total_ge), and then the maximum number of pairs with sum >s (call it count_higher). Then, count_equal = total_ge - count_higher. \n\nBut how to compute count_higher and count_ge. \n\nBut for the worst case, we need to calculate count_higher (number of participants with sum >s) and count_equal (number of participants with sum ==s). \n\nBut how? \n\nWell, count_ge is the maximum number of pairs with sum >=s. \n\ncount_higher is the maximum number of pairs with sum >s. \n\ncount_equal = count_ge - count_higher. \n\nBut how to compute count_ge and count_higher. \n\nSo, for the first sample, count_ge is 5, count_higher is 0. \n\nThus, worst_rank = count_higher + count_equal = 0 +5 =5. \n\nWhich is correct. \n\nFor the second sample input:\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n6",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have in an Olympiad based on his scores from two tours. The solution involves finding the maximum and minimum possible sums Vasya could achieve and then determining how these sums affect his rank relative to other participants.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: This is always 1 because Vasya can be paired with the highest possible scores from both tours, ensuring he gets the top rank.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: This requires finding the minimum possible sum Vasya could achieve that is still at least `x`.
