She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. Let's think about how she can do this optimally.\n\nFirst, the initial setup: there are n tabs, and the mouse is at position pos. She needs to leave only tabs from l to r. So any tabs outside that range must be closed. The challenge is figuring out the fastest way to do that.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. The key is that she can close tabs to the left or right of her current position. But each time she closes tabs, the a and b (the min and max indices of the remaining tabs) change. However, since she wants to close all tabs outside [l, r], maybe we can model this as needing to close tabs to the left of l and to the right of r.\n\nWait, but the problem says that when she closes tabs, she can close all to the left or right of the current cursor position. So for example, if she's at position x, she can close all tabs left of x (i.e., from a to x-1) or all tabs right of x (from x+1 to b). But after closing, the a and b would adjust accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal strategy is to first close all tabs to the left of l, and then close all tabs to the right of r. Or maybe in some order. But how to get to the positions where she can perform those closes efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are certain positions where she can perform the closing operations with minimal steps.\n\nLet me consider the cases where the current position is already in the [l, r] range. For example, in the third sample input, l=1, r=5, and the initial position is 2. Since all tabs are already in the desired range, no action is needed. So output is 0.\n\nAnother example: the second input is 6 3 1 3. So she needs to close tabs to the right of 3. She's at position 3. So she can just close all tabs to the right (which would be 4-6). That takes 1 second. So the answer is 1.\n\nSo the main idea is to figure out which closing operations are needed, and what's the minimal steps to reach the positions where those operations can be done.\n\nLet me think about the steps required:\n\nCase 1: The current position is already within [l, r]. Then, she may need to close tabs to the left of l and/or to the right of r. However, she can only close those tabs if she is positioned at the correct spot. For example, to close all tabs to the left of l, she needs to be at position l. Because then, closing all tabs to the left of l (which are from a to l-1) would remove them. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r, she needs to be at r. Because then closing all tabs to the right (from r+1 to b) would remove them.\n\nBut wait, what if l is 2, and she is at position 3. Then, to close tabs to the left of l (which is 2), she needs to be at position 2. So she has to move to 2, then close left. But if she is at 3, she can't close the left of 2 unless she moves to 2.\n\nSimilarly for closing the right side.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\nIf she needs to close tabs to the left of l, then she must move to l, then close left. Similarly for closing tabs to the right of r: move to r, then close right.\n\nBut what if l is already 1? Then there's nothing to close on the left. Similarly if r is n, then nothing to close on the right.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCheck if l is 1. If not, then she needs to close tabs to the left of l. Which requires moving to l, then closing left. Similarly for r and closing right.\n\nBut how to compute the time for that?\n\nFor example, suppose she needs to close left. The time to move from pos to l is |pos - l|. Then one second to close. Similarly for closing right: move to r, take |pos - r| seconds, then one second to close.\n\nBut wait, maybe she can do both steps in a way that overlaps. Like, if she needs to close left and right, maybe she can move to l, close left, then move to r (but after closing left, the tabs to the right of r are still there). Wait, but after closing left, the a and b would adjust. But perhaps the movement is still possible.\n\nWait, the movement is based on the current a and b. But when she closes tabs to the left, the new a is l. So during the movement, after closing left, the a is l, and the b is the original n. So when moving to r, the movement steps are based on the current a and b. But perhaps the movement steps are not affected by the closing steps except for the a and b. However, since the problem is to close all tabs outside [l, r], perhaps the steps can be considered in a way that the movement is done in the original tab set.\n\nWait, maybe the problem can be simplified. Because the closing operations can be done in any order, but the minimal steps would be to first close the left and right parts. However, the movement steps are done in the original tab arrangement. Because once you close tabs, the a and b change, but the movement is constrained by the current a and b. However, perhaps the optimal path is to first move to the necessary positions and close, and the movement steps can be calculated based on the original positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the movement steps can be calculated as if the tabs are still present, because when she moves, she can move through the tabs that are not yet closed. But that might complicate things.\n\nBut maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think: the only thing that matters is that she must perform two operations (if needed):\n\n1. Close all tabs to the left of l. To do this, she must be at position l. Because when she closes to the left, it closes everything from a to i-1. So if she is at position l, then closing left would close all tabs from a (original a) to l-1. But since l is the left end of the desired range, that's exactly the tabs that need to be closed.\n\nSimilarly, to close the tabs to the right of r, she must be at r and close to the right.\n\nSo, regardless of the order, the steps needed are:\n\nIf l > 1: she needs to move to l (time |pos - l|) and then close left (1 sec).\n\nIf r < n: she needs to move to r (time |pos - r|) and then close right (1 sec).\n\nBut what if she can do these steps in a way that combines movement? For example, if she needs to close both left and right, maybe she can move to l, then move to r, which would take |pos - l| + |l - r| steps, plus 2 seconds for closing. Or maybe she can move to r first, then to l, which would be |pos - r| + |r - l| steps, plus 2 seconds. But which is better?\n\nBut perhaps the minimal time is |pos - l| + |pos - r| + 2? No, because that would be if you have to move from pos to l and then to r, but that's not the case. Because if you move from pos to l, then from l to r, the total movement steps is |pos - l| + |l - r|. Then adding 2 seconds for closing. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, but if you have to move to l and then to r, then the movement steps are |pos - l| + |l - r|. Alternatively, if you can move directly to r first, then to l, which would be |pos - r| + |r - l|. But the minimal between the two options depends on the positions.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think: the movement steps required for both operations can be optimized.\n\nFor example, if you need to close left and right, then the minimal movement steps is the minimal between:\n\n- moving to l, then moving to r (steps |pos - l| + |l - r|)\n\nOR\n\n- moving to r, then moving to l (steps |pos - r| + |r - l| )\n\nOR \n\nsome other path?\n\nBut the minimal movement steps between the two options is the same as |pos - l| + |pos - r| - |l - r|? Or perhaps not. Wait, no. For example, if l is 2, r is 4, and pos is 3. Then moving to l (2) is 1 step, then to r (4) is 2 steps. Total movement steps 3. Alternatively, moving to r (4) is 1 step, then to l (2) is 2 steps. Same total.\n\nBut in general, the total movement steps for both is |pos - l| + |l - r| = |pos - l| + (r - l) if l < r. Similarly for the other direction. But since r - l is fixed, the minimal between |pos - l| + (r - l) and |pos - r| + (r - l) is determined by which of |pos - l| or |pos - r| is smaller. So the minimal movement steps would be min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) + (r - l). But that's only if you have to move to both positions. However, perhaps there's a way to optimize further.\n\nWait, but if you have to move to both positions, the minimal movement is |pos - l| + |l - r|, but that's equivalent to |pos - l| + |r - l|, which is the same as |pos - r| + |r - l| if you go from pos to r first. But since |pos - l| + |r - l| is equal to |pos - r| + |r - l| only if pos is between l and r. Otherwise, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal movement steps when you have to go to both l and r is (distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r) or (distance from pos to r) + (distance from r to l). Which is the same as (distance from pos to l) + (r - l) or (distance from pos to r) + (r - l). So the minimal between these two is (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|)) + (r - l). But perhaps there's a better way, like moving directly to some point that allows both operations. But I don't think so. Because you have to reach l and r, so the movement steps would be the sum of the steps between those points.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter approach. Let's think of the total steps required for the entire process. For example, if you need to close both left and right:\n\nTotal steps would be:\n\nmovement steps to reach l (or r) + 1 (for closing left) + movement steps to reach r (or l) + 1 (for closing right).\n\nBut if you first move to l, then close left (takes 1 sec). Then, you need to move to r. How long does that take? After closing left, the a is l, and the current position is l. So moving from l to r would take (r - l) steps (since you can move right each time). Then close right (1 sec). So total movement steps is |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2 seconds (closing steps).\n\nAlternatively, if you first move to r (taking |pos - r| steps), close right (1 sec), then move to l (taking (r - l) steps) and close left (1 sec). So total steps |pos - r| + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWhich option is better depends on whether |pos - l| or |pos - r| is smaller. So the minimal between these two options would be (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut what if the initial position is already in the [l, r] range? For example, pos is between l and r. Then, moving to l takes (pos - l) steps, moving to r takes (r - pos) steps. So in that case, if you choose to go to l first, then to r, the movement steps is (pos - l) + (r - l) steps. Or if you go to r first, then to l, it's (r - pos) + (r - l) steps. Which is worse than going to l first?\n\nWait, no. For example, if pos is in the middle of l and r, say l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then moving to l (2) takes 1 step, then moving to r (4) takes 2 steps. Total movement steps 3. Alternatively, moving to r (1 step) then to l (2 steps) also 3 steps. So the same.\n\nSo, for the case when you need to close both left and right, the total steps would be (steps to reach l or r) + (distance between l and r) + 2 (for the two closes). But the minimal steps to reach l or r is min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ), but maybe not. Because when you have to reach both l and r, the minimal movement steps is |pos - l| + |r - l|, or |pos - r| + |r - l|. But since |r - l| is fixed, the minimal between the two is min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l). Then adding 2 for the closes.\n\nSo overall, the total steps for the case when both left and right need to be closed is (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) + (r - l)) + 2.\n\nBut what if the initial position is already at l or r? For example, pos is l. Then steps to reach l is 0, then moving to r takes (r - l) steps. Then 2 closes. So total steps (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, if pos is l, and you need to close left (but l is already the left end, so no need to close left). Wait, no. Because if l is 2, then closing left would close all tabs to the left of l, which is 1. So if l is 2, then closing left is needed. But if the initial position is l (2), then you can close left immediately. Then, you need to move to r (say 4) and close right. So steps: 0 (to move to l) + 1 (close left) + (r - l) steps (from l to r) + 1 (close right). So total (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut in that case, the formula above holds.\n\nNow, what if she needs to close only left or only right?\n\nFor example, if l=1, then no need to close left. So only need to close right. Which requires moving to r, then closing right. Steps: |pos - r| + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if r = n, then no need to close right. So steps: |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nWe need to check whether l > 1 (needs to close left) and whether r < n (needs to close right). Depending on that, we calculate the steps.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nCase 1: l == 1 and r == n. Then no need to close anything. Answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: l == 1. So only need to close right. Steps: |pos - r| + 1.\n\nCase 3: r == n. So only need to close left. Steps: |pos - l| + 1.\n\nCase 4: Both l > 1 and r < n. Need to close left and right. So steps are (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) + (r - l)) + 2.\n\nWait, but why is that? Because the movement steps are (steps to get to either l or r) + steps to move from there to the other end (r - l) steps, then 2 closes.\n\nBut let's take the first example given:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4 → Output 5.\n\nIn this case, l=2, r=4. So l>1 and r <n (n=6). So need to close left and right.\n\nmin(|3 - 2|, |3 -4|) is min(1, 1) = 1. Then add (4-2) = 2. Then add 2. Total 1 + 2 + 2 = 5. Which matches the sample. So that seems correct.\n\nAnother sample: Input is 6 3 1 3. So l=1, r=3. So since l=1, only need to close right. Steps: |3 -3| + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample: 5 2 1 5. l=1, r=5. So no steps needed. Output is 0.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. So need to close left (since l=2>1) and right (r=3 <5). So steps: min(|1-2|, |1-3|) = 1. Then add (3-2)=1. Then +2 → 1+1+2=4. Let's see:\n\nShe can move to l=2 (steps 1), then move to r=3 (steps 1). Then close left (1 sec) and close right (1 sec). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 2 = 4. Correct.\n\nBut what if she can close left and right in a different way? Like, move to l, close left, then move to r and close right. That's exactly what's being calculated.\n\nAnother example: n=5, pos=5, l=2, r=3. So need to close left and right. min(|5-2|, |5-3|) is 2 (distance to l=2 is 3, to r=3 is 2). So min is 2. Then (3-2) =1. +2 → 2+1+2=5 steps. Let's see:\n\nShe can move to r=3 (steps 2), then move to l=2 (steps 1). Then close right (1 sec) and close left (1 sec). Total steps 2 + 1 + 2 =5. Yes.\n\nBut what if she moves to l first? That would be |5-2|=3 steps. Then move to r (3-2=1 step). Total movement steps 3+1=4. Then 2 closes. Total 4+2=6. Which is worse. So the formula correctly picks the minimal between the two.\n\nSo the formula for case 4 is correct.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\nCheck if l ==1 and r ==n → 0 steps.\n\nElse:\n\nif l ==1 → need to close right. Steps: |pos - r| +1.\n\nelif r ==n → need to close left. Steps: |pos - l| +1.\n\nelse → need to close both. Steps: min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut wait, what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range?\n\nLike, for example, l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then, the steps would be min(1, 1) + 2 + 2 = 5 steps. Which is correct as per the first sample.\n\nAnother example: l=2, r=4, pos=2. Then steps would be min(0, 2) → 0 + (4-2) = 2 + 2 → 4 steps. Which would be:\n\nMove to l (already there). Close left (1 sec). Then move to r (steps 2). Close right (1 sec). Total steps 0 + 2 + 2 = 4. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the current position is to the left of l? For example, l=3, r=5, pos=1. So need to close left (l=3>1) and right (r=5 <n (assuming n is say 6). So steps: min(|1-3|, |1-5|) → min(2,4) is 2. Then (5-3) is 2. +2 → total 2+2+2=6.\n\nLet me see:\n\nShe can move to l (3) which takes 2 steps. Then move to r (5) which is 2 steps. Close left (1 sec) and close right (1 sec). Total 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 steps.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother scenario: pos is to the right of r. For example, l=2, r=4, pos=5. Need to close left and right. min(|5-2|, |5-4|) is 1. Then add (4-2) = 2. +2 → 1+2+2=5 steps. Let's see:\n\nShe can move to r (4) which is 1 step. Then move to l (2) which is 2 steps. Close right (1 sec) and close left (1 sec). Total steps: 1+2 + 2 = 5. Correct.\n\nSo the formula seems to hold.\n\nSo now, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nif l ==1 and r ==n:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    if l ==1:\n\n        # only need to close right\n\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\n    elif r ==n:\n\n        # only need to close left\n\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # need to close both left and right\n\n        steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but what about when the current position is already in the [l, r] range? For example, l=2, r=4, pos=3. Then according to the formula, steps is min(1,1) + 2 + 2 = 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: l=2, r=4, pos=2. Then steps is min(0, 2) + 2 + 2 = 0 + 2 + 2 = 4. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the current position is already at l or r?\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=4, pos=4. Then steps is min( |4-2|=2, |4-4|=0 ) → 0. Then add (4-2)=2. Then +2. So 0 + 2 + 2 =4. Which would be:\n\nmove to r (already there), close right (1 sec). Then move to l (4 to 2: 2 steps). close left (1 sec). Total steps 0 + 2 + 2 = 4. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the steps to reach r is zero. Then, closing right (tabs to the right of r, which are none, since r is 4 and n is say 5. So closing right would close tabs from 5 to 5. So that's needed. Then, after closing right, the a and b are adjusted. But the movement steps to reach l is from r (4) to l (2), which is 2 steps.\n\nSo the formula seems to work.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases. Let me check the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. Not 1 or n. So steps = min( |3-2|=1, |3-4|=1 ) + (4-2) +2 → 1 + 2 + 2 =5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput: 6 3 1 3. Here, l=1, r=3. Since l=1, steps is |3 -3| +1 → 0 +1=1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSample 3:\n\nInput: 5 2 1 5. l=1, r=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. Then steps is min(1, 2) → 1 + (3-2) + 2 → 1 +1 +2=4. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=5, l=2, r=3. Then steps is min( |5-2|=3, |5-3|=2) → 2 + (3-2) + 2 → 2 +1 +2=5. Which is correct.\n\nWhat if l=3, r=3, and pos is 1. Then, since l=3>1, and r=3 <n (assuming n is 5). So steps: min(|1-3|, |1-3|) + (3-3) +2 → 2 +0 +2 =4. Which is correct. Because she needs to move to l (3) (2 steps), close left (1 sec), then move to r (3) (0 steps), close right (1 sec). Total steps 2 + 0 + 2 =4.\n\nAnother case: l=3, r=3. n=5. pos=3. So steps: min(0, 0) + 0 +2 → 0 +0 +2=2. Which is correct: close left (1 sec) and close right (1 sec). So total 2 steps.\n\nAnother case: l=3, r=3, pos=4. Then steps is min( |4-3|=1, |4-3|=1) + 0 +2 → 1 +0 +2=3. So steps:\n\nMove to l (3) (1 step), close left (1 sec). Then move to r (3) (0 steps), close right (1 sec). Total steps 1 + 0 + 2=3. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about when l=1 and r=n? Then the answer is 0. For example, if n=3, pos=2, l=1, r=3. Output is 0.\n\nAnother edge case: when l=r. For example, n=5, l=3, r=3. Then, need to close left (tabs 1-2) and right (tabs 4-5). So steps would be min(|pos -3|, |pos-3|) + 0 + 2 → 2* |pos-3| + 2.\n\nSo for pos=3, steps is 0 + 0 + 2 = 2. Which is correct: close left (1 sec) and close right (1 sec).\n\nAnother case: pos=1, l=3, r=3, n=5. Then steps is min( |1-3|=2, |1-3|=2) + 0 +2 → 2 + 0 +2=4. Which is: move to l (2 steps), close left (1 sec), move to r (0 steps), close right (1 sec). Total 2 + 2 steps? Wait, movement steps is 2 steps to move to l. Then, after closing left, you are at l=3. Then, you need to close right, which requires being at r=3. So you are already there. So steps for movement is 2 steps, then 1 sec for close left, then 1 sec for close right. Total steps 2 + 1 + 1 =4. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nThe code will read n, pos, l, r.\n\nBut the input is given as a single line with four integers. Wait, the input is given as a single line, but the example shows multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as a single line of input containing four integers. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nBut that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is the only line of input. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r ...\n\nSo the input is one line, four integers. But the sample input shows three lines. Oh, perhaps that's a mistake in the problem description. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe sample input shows:\n\nInput\n\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\nOutput\n\n['5', '1', '0']\n\nWhich suggests that there are multiple test cases. However, the problem says \"the only line of input\", which seems conflicting. But perhaps the original problem is from a programming competition where the input is multiple lines, but the user here made a mistake in formatting.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases, which implies that the code should read multiple lines of input. However, the problem says \"the only line of input contains four integer numbers ...\".\n\nThis is confusing. But looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the problem is that the original problem has multiple test cases, but the user here presented it as a single line. However, the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\nSo the input is one line with four integers. The sample input seems to be three separate test cases, which may be a mistake. But according to the problem statement, the code should read one line of input and output one line of output.\n\nSo for example, the first sample input is 6 3 2 4, output is 5.\n\nSo the code should read four integers from input, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nTherefore, the code should be written to read a single line of input, split into four integers, and output the answer.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nRead the input line, split into n, pos, l, r.\n\nThen compute as per the logic above.\n\nSo, code:\n\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    if l == 1:\n        # close right\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    elif r == n:\n        # close left\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    else:\n        steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n    print(steps)\n\nWait, but what if l is 1 and r is not n? For example, l=1, r=3, n=5. Then, the code will check l ==1, and steps is |pos - r| +1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if l=1 and r is not n, but the user needs to close the right part. So yes.\n\nBut what if l is not 1, and r is n? Then steps is |pos - l| +1.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when l=1 and r=n? Then the code returns 0.\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1: input 6 3 2 4 → l=2, r=4. Not 1 or n. So steps is min(3-2=1, 3-4=1) → 1 + (4-2) = 2 + 2 → total 5. Correct.\n\nSample 2: input 6 3 1 3 → l=1, r=3. Since l==1, steps is |3-3| +1 = 0+1=1. Correct.\n\nSample 3: input 5 2 1 5 → l=1, r=5. So output 0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=5, pos=1, l=2, r=3. Then steps is min(1-2=1, 1-3=2) → 1 + (3-2) +2 → 1+1+2=4.\n\nAnother case: n=5, pos=5, l=2, r=3. steps is min(5-2=3, 5-3=2) → 2 + (3-2) +2 → 2+1+2=5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range and the l and r are not the full range. For example, n=5, pos=3, l=2, r=4. So steps is min(3-2=1, 3-4=1) + (4-2) + 2 → 1 + 2 + 2 =5 steps. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the user doesn't need to close anything? For example, l=2, r=4, and n=5, but the current position is already in the [l, r] range. But since l is not 1 and r is not n, the code computes steps. But what if the user doesn't need to close anything? No, because l and r are not 1 and n. So the code is correct.\n\nBut for example, if l=2, r=4, and n=5, but the user is supposed to leave only tabs from 2 to 4. So tabs 1 and 5 need to be closed. So the code is correct in computing the steps.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside a specified segment [l, r] while starting from a given position pos in her browser. The solution involves efficiently moving the cursor and closing tabs to minimize the time spent.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the segment [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no action is needed, so the answer is 0.\n2. **Closing Tabs on One Side**:\n   - If the left boundary of the segment is at the first tab (l=1), only tabs to the right of r need to be closed. The time required is the distance from the current position to r plus one second for closing.\n   - If the right boundary of the segment is at the last tab (r=n), only tabs to the left of l need to be closed. The time required is the distance from the current position to l plus one second for closing.\n3. **Closing Tabs on Both Sides**: If both sides need closing, calculate the minimum time to move to either the left or right boundary, then move to the other boundary, and add the time for closing operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    if l == 1:\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    elif r == n:\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    else:\n        steps = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r)) + (r - l) + 2\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: Directly checks if the segment [l, r] spans all tabs, which requires no actions.\n- **Single Side Closing**: If only one side needs closing, compute the time based on the distance from the current position to the respective boundary plus one second for the closing operation.\n- **Both Sides Closing**: Calculate the minimum movement time to either boundary, then account for moving between the two boundaries and the two closing operations. This ensures the shortest path to close all necessary tabs efficiently.\n\nThis approach ensures that we minimize the movement and closing operations by leveraging the closest boundary first, thus optimizing the total time required.",
