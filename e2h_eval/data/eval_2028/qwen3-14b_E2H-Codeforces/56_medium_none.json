Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about determining whether there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. So, the key here is to check all possible perfect matchings and see if at least one of them has non-crossing paths.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a perfect matching means here. Since R and B are equal (because the first line says R and B, and the problem says every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one base). Wait, the problem says R and B are given, but for a perfect matching, they must be equal. Oh, right, the problem says that the input is such that R and B are given. Wait, the input description says that the first line has R and B. But the problem statement says that the assignment is a perfect matching, which requires that R equals B. Wait, but the input may have R != B? Wait, no. Because the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching. So the input must have R = B. Wait, but looking at the input examples, in the first example it's 3 3, and the second is 2 1. Wait, but the second example's output is No. But how can there be a perfect matching if R and B are different? Oh, wait the problem says that the input is given with R and B, but the problem says that we need to assign R spaceships to B bases so that each has exactly one. So that implies that R must equal B. But the input may have R != B? But according to the problem statement, the input is given as R and B. But the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching, which requires that R equals B. So maybe the problem actually ensures that R equals B? Or maybe the code needs to check that first? Wait, looking back at the problem statement: the first line says R and B. But the problem says \"assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So that implies that R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible. So perhaps in the input, R and B are always equal? Because otherwise, the answer would be No. But the problem says that in the input, R and B can be between 1 and 10. So perhaps the code should first check if R != B, then output No. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed that no two points coincide and no three are colinear. But the problem says that the input is given with R and B. So, the first thing the code should do is check if R != B. If they are not equal, output No. Because there's no way to have a perfect matching. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if R equals B. If not, output No.\n\nBut in the sample input, the second example is R=2, B=1. So the output is No. Which makes sense because R != B. So the code should handle that case.\n\nSo, the first step is to check if R != B. If so, output No.\n\nNow, assuming R = B. Then, the problem reduces to checking if there exists a perfect matching between the two sets (spaceships and bases) such that no two edges cross each other.\n\nSo, how to model this?\n\nThe problem is equivalent to finding a bipartite matching between the two sets where the edges are non-crossing. But since the problem requires that all edges are non-crossing, we need to find a permutation of the bases (or spaceships) such that when each spaceship is connected to a base in the permutation, none of the lines cross.\n\nBut how to check for that?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\n- Generate all possible perfect matchings (permutations of the bases for the spaceships) and check for each if any pair of edges cross.\n\nIf any of these permutations has no crossing edges, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nBut since R and B are up to 10, the number of permutations is 10! which is 3,628,800. For 10, that's manageable? Well, 10! is about 3.6 million. For each permutation, checking all pairs of edges for crossings. For each permutation, the number of pairs is O(n^2). For n=10, that's 45 per permutation. So total operations would be around 3.6 million * 45 = 162 million operations. That's acceptable for Python? Well, perhaps. But maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nBut given the constraints (R and B up to 10), it's feasible.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Check if R != B. If yes, output No.\n\n2. Else, generate all possible permutations of the bases (since each spaceship is matched to exactly one base).\n\nWait, but the spaceships and bases are two separate sets. Let me think: the problem is to assign each spaceship to a base. So, for each permutation of the bases, we can assign the i-th spaceship to the perm[i]-th base. Wait, but the bases are given as a list. So for example, if the spaceships are S_1, S_2,... S_n, and the bases are B_1, B_2,... B_n. Then a permutation p (of 0..n-1) would assign S_i to B_p[i]. So for each permutation, we can check if all the line segments between S_i and B_p[i] are non-crossing.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments cross?\n\nWe need to check for any two pairs of line segments (from the permutation) whether they cross. For each pair of edges (S_i -> B_p[i]) and (S_j -> B_p[j]) where i < j, check if the two line segments cross.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments cross?\n\nFirst, we need to determine if two line segments AB and CD intersect. The standard approach is to use the orientation method. However, since the problem says that no three points are colinear, we don't have to worry about overlapping edges or colinear points. So, for two line segments AB and CD, they cross if and only if the orientations of (A,B,C) and (A,B,D) are different, and the orientations of (C,D,A) and (C,D,B) are different. This is the standard method for checking if two line segments intersect.\n\nSo, the steps for checking if two line segments AB and CD intersect:\n\n- Compute orientation of A, B, C.\n\n- Compute orientation of A, B, D.\n\n- If the orientations are different, then the lines AB and CD may intersect. But also check that the other direction (C, D, A and C, D, B) have different orientations.\n\nAlternatively, using the cross product approach. But since the problem states that no three points are colinear, we don't have to handle cases where points are colinear.\n\nSo, for two line segments (s1, t1) and (s2, t2), we can check if they intersect by checking if the points s2 and t2 are on opposite sides of the line s1t1, and s1 and t1 are on opposite sides of the line s2t2.\n\nSo, the code for checking if two line segments AB and CD intersect is as follows:\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0]-A[0])*(C[1]-A[1]) - (B[1]-A[1])*(C[0]-A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if AB and CD intersect\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nWait, but this returns True if the segments AB and CD cross each other. But what about the case where one of the endpoints is on the other segment? But the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, for example, if AB and CD share an endpoint, but that's not allowed. Wait, but the problem says that no two points coincide. So, the line segments can't have overlapping endpoints. Because all points are unique. So, in the case of AB and AC, the line segments AB and AC share point A. But since the problem says that the line segments are from a spaceship to a base, and all points are unique. So, if in the permutation, two line segments share a point, but that's only possible if two different spaceships are assigned to the same base, which is impossible since the permutation is a perfect matching. So, in our case, each line segment connects a unique spaceship to a unique base. Therefore, all the line segments are between distinct points. So, the case of overlapping endpoints is not possible. Therefore, the above function will correctly detect if two line segments cross each other.\n\nSo, for each permutation of the bases, we can generate the list of line segments (spaceship i to base permutation[i]). Then check for all pairs of line segments in this list whether they intersect. If any pair does, then this permutation is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid.\n\nSo, the algorithm is:\n\nFor each possible permutation of the bases (since each spaceship is matched to exactly one base):\n\n   For all i < j:\n\n      Check if the line segment between spaceship i and base perm[i] intersects with the line segment between spaceship j and base perm[j].\n\n   If no intersections found, return \"Yes\".\n\nIf none of the permutations work, return \"No\".\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\nElse, read the R spaceships' coordinates, then read B bases' coordinates.\n\nGenerate all permutations of the B bases (since the permutation is of length R = B). For each permutation, check if the corresponding line segments have any crossings.\n\nBut wait, the permutation is of the bases. For example, if there are R = B = 3, then the permutation is a list of indices (0, 1, 2) in some order. So, for the i-th spaceship (say, the first spaceship is index 0 in the list), we connect it to the base at position perm[i].\n\nBut how to represent the bases? Let's say that the bases are stored as a list, say bases = [ (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ... ].\n\nThen, for a permutation p (which is a list of indices, e.g., [1, 0, 2] for 3 elements), the i-th spaceship is connected to bases[p[i]].\n\nSo, the code would need to generate all permutations of the list [0, 1, ..., R-1], and for each permutation, check all pairs of line segments.\n\nNow, the problem is that for R=10, the permutations are 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, checking O(n^2) pairs. For each pair, checking the intersection.\n\nBut for R=10, 10! is manageable. Let's think about the time. For each permutation, checking 10*9/2 = 45 pairs. Each pair requires 4 cross product calculations. So, for each permutation, 45 * 4 = 180 operations. Multiply by 3.6 million permutations, that's about 648 million operations. Hmm, that's a lot for Python. Maybe it's tight, but given that the constraints are small, perhaps it's acceptable. However, perhaps there's a way to optimize.\n\nBut for the problem's constraints, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. For example, for small n, like up to 10, it's feasible.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nImplement the ccw function and the segments_intersect function.\n\nRead the input: first line R and B. Then R lines of spaceship coordinates, then B lines of base coordinates.\n\nCheck if R != B: output No.\n\nElse, generate all permutations of the B bases (indices 0 to B-1). For each permutation, check if the set of line segments between spaceship i and base perm[i] has any crossing.\n\nIf any permutation passes, output Yes. Else, No.\n\nNow, in Python, generating permutations can be done with itertools.permutations.\n\nBut for the bases, the permutation is over the indices of the bases. For example, if bases are [b0, b1, b2], then permutations would be all possible orderings of [0,1,2].\n\nSo, code:\n\nimport sys\nimport itertools\n\ndef ccw(A, B, C):\n    return (B[0] - A[0])*(C[1] - A[1]) - (B[1] - A[1])*(C[0] - A[0])\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if AB and CD intersect\n    ccw1 = ccw(A, B, C)\n    ccw2 = ccw(A, B, D)\n    ccw3 = ccw(C, D, A)\n    ccw4 = ccw(C, D, B)\n    # If AB and CD intersect, then the signs of ccw1 and ccw2 are different, and same for ccw3 and ccw4\n    if (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) and (ccw3 * ccw4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        rebels.append( (x, y) )\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    # Now generate all permutations of the bases indices\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations( range(B) ):\n        # For this permutation, check all pairs of segments\n        # For each i < j, check if the segment between rebels[i] and bases[perm[i]] intersects with rebels[j] and bases[perm[j]]\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                A = rebels[i]\n                B = bases[perm[i]]\n                C = rebels[j]\n                D = bases[perm[j]]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nBut wait, the code for checking segments_intersect is correct? Let me think again.\n\nThe function segments_intersect returns True if AB and CD cross. But the code checks if the two segments cross. However, there's a possibility that the segments are colinear but not overlapping. However, the problem states that no three points are colinear. So, for two segments AB and CD, if they are colinear, then the points A, B, C, D are colinear, but since no three points are colinear, that's impossible. Because, for example, if AB and CD are colinear, then A, B, and C would be colinear. So, the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, this case cannot happen. Thus, the code is safe.\n\nSo, the code for segments_intersect is correct.\n\nBut wait, the function returns True if the two segments cross, but what about if one of the segments is an endpoint of the other? Like, AB is from A to B, and CD is from C to D, where C is on AB. But the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, if C is on AB, then A, B, C are colinear, which is not allowed. Hence, this case is not possible. So, the code is safe.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nSo, rebels are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)], bases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nThe first permutation is [0,1,2], which connects each rebel to the base in order. Let's check if any segments cross.\n\nSegments:\n\nRebel 0 (0,0) to base 0 (-2,1)\n\nRebel 1 (2,0) to base 1 (0,3)\n\nRebel 2 (3,1) to base 2 (2,2)\n\nCheck all pairs:\n\nBetween (0,0)-(-2,1) and (2,0)-(0,3): Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute the ccw values.\n\nA = (0,0), B = (-2,1), C = (2,0), D = (0,3).\n\nCompute ccw(A,B,C) = ( (-2 - 0) * (0 - 0) ) - ( (1 - 0) * (2 - 0) ) ?\n\nWait, the formula is (B.x - A.x) * (C.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (C.x - A.x)\n\nSo, for A=(0,0), B=(-2,1), C=(2,0):\n\n(B.x - A.x) = -2 - 0 = -2\n\n(C.y - A.y) = 0 - 0 = 0\n\n(B.y - A.y) = 1 - 0 = 1\n\n(C.x - A.x) = 2 - 0 = 2\n\nSo, the value is (-2)*0 - 1*2 = -2. So ccw1 = -2.\n\nccw2 is ccw(A,B,D) where D is (0,3). So:\n\nC is D here. So:\n\n(B.x - A.x) * (D.y - A.y) - (B.y - A.y) * (D.x - A.x) \n\n= (-2) * (3 - 0) - (1) * (0 - 0) = (-2)*3 - 1*0 = -6. \n\nSo ccw1 is -2, ccw2 is -6. Their product is positive. So the condition (ccw1 * ccw2 < 0) is false. So the segments do not cross. \n\nSo, this pair does not cross. \n\nAnother pair: (0,0)-(-2,1) and (3,1)-(2,2). Let's check.\n\nA=(0,0), B=(-2,1); C=(3,1), D=(2,2).\n\nccw(A,B,C) is (-2)*(1 - 0) - (1)*(3 - 0) = (-2)(1) - 1*3 = -2 -3 = -5.\n\nccw(A,B,D) is (-2)*(2 - 0) - (1)*(2 - 0) = (-2)(2) -1*(2) = -4 -2 = -6. \n\nAgain, same sign. So no crossing.\n\nThen between (2,0)-(0,3) and (3,1)-(2,2):\n\nCheck AB is (2,0) to (0,3), CD is (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCompute ccw for AB and CD.\n\nccw(A,B,C) where A is (2,0), B is (0,3), C is (3,1):\n\n(B.x - A.x) is 0-2 = -2. (C.y - A.y) is 1-0=1. \n\n(B.y - A.y) is 3-0=3. (C.x - A.x) is 3-2=1.\n\nSo (-2)*1 - 3*1 = -2 -3 = -5.\n\nccw(A,B,D) where D is (2,2):\n\n(B.x - A.x) is -2. (D.y - A.y) is 2 - 0 = 2. \n\n(B.y - A.y) is 3. (D.x - A.x) is 2-2=0.\n\nSo (-2)*2 - 3*0 = -4. \n\nSo both are negative. So product is positive. So no crossing.\n\nHence, this permutation is valid. So the code would return Yes.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. Since R != B, output is No. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Suppose the rebels are (0,0), (0,1). Bases are (1,0), (1,1). Then possible permutations are [0,1] and [1,0].\n\nIn the first permutation, the lines are (0,0)-(1,0) and (0,1)-(1,1). These lines are parallel, no crossing.\n\nIn the second permutation, (0,0)-(1,1) and (0,1)-(1,0). These lines cross. So the code would check both permutations. The first permutation is valid, so output is Yes.\n\nSo the code would return Yes.\n\nAnother case: R=2, B=2. Rebels (0,0), (2,2). Bases (1,1), (3,3). Then, in any permutation, the lines are from (0,0) to (1,1) and (2,2) to (3,3) — no crossing. Or (0,0) to (3,3) and (2,2) to (1,1) — the lines cross? Let's see. The line segments (0,0)-(3,3) and (2,2)-(1,1) are colinear. But the problem states that no three points are colinear. Wait, in this case, the points are (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3). So three points are colinear. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed that no three points are colinear. So such an input is invalid. So in the problem's input, this case is not possible. Hence, the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the code's handling of the permutations.\n\nIn the code, for each permutation in itertools.permutations(range(B)), which for B=3 is all possible orderings of [0,1,2].\n\nBut the code uses the rebels and bases lists. For each i in 0..R-1, the i-th rebel is connected to bases[perm[i]].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, in Python, itertools.permutations is available, and for small numbers, it's manageable.\n\nBut for R=10, the code may take some time. However, given the constraints, it's acceptable.\n\nSo, this should solve the problem.\n",

If no valid permutation exists, \"No\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible assignments are checked efficiently given the constraints, leveraging permutations and geometric checks to determine the feasibility of non-intersecting paths.",
