The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And then return this count modulo mod. The constraints are n up to 500, which suggests that a brute force approach is impossible because the number of permutations is n! which is way too big for n=500. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nFirst, let's think about the problem. Let me break it down into parts.\n\nThe total number of permutation pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q is equal to (total permutations choose 2) because for any two distinct permutations, exactly one is lex smaller than the other. Since there are n! permutations, the total number of such pairs is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. But we need to find how many of these pairs satisfy that inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut considering all possible pairs, maybe there's a symmetry here. Suppose for each pair (p, q) where p != q, exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) holds. However, if there are some pairs where inv(p) equals inv(q), then those would be excluded. But since the problem counts only the pairs where p is lex smaller than q and inv(p) > inv(q), perhaps we can find the total number of such pairs by considering the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) = (total pairs where p < q and inv(p) != inv(q)) / 2. Because for each pair where inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of the two possibilities holds. However, this is only true if for every pair (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(p) < inv(q) is true. Which is the case. So the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). And the total number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) != inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs), where same_inversion_pairs is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). Then, the answer would be (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs) / 2. But wait, this is only if the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where p < q and inv(p) < inv(q). Which makes sense because for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of the two possibilities holds. So when considering ordered pairs where p < q, the count of inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the count of inv(p) < inv(q) for those pairs. Therefore, the answer would be (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs) // 2.\n\nBut how do I compute same_inversion_pairs? That's the number of pairs (p, q) where p is lex smaller than q and inv(p) = inv(q). So the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute total_pairs = (n! * (n! - 1)) // 2.\n\nCompute same_inversion_pairs = ?\n\nThen the answer is (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs) // 2 mod mod.\n\nSo the key is to compute same_inversion_pairs. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can compute the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). Then subtract that from the total_pairs and divide by 2 to get the answer.\n\nBut how do I compute same_inversion_pairs?\n\nLet me think. For each possible inversion count k, let c_k be the number of permutations of size n with exactly k inversions. Then, the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q) is sum_{k} [ (c_k choose 2) * (number of pairs of permutations with same inversion count k where p < q) ? ] Wait, no. Because for each group of permutations with the same inversion count k, the number of pairs (p, q) where p < q is (c_k choose 2). Because for each pair of distinct permutations in that group, exactly one is lex smaller than the other. So the total same_inversion_pairs is sum_{k} (c_k * (c_k - 1) ) / 2.\n\nWait, yes. Because for each k, the number of unordered pairs (p, q) with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q) is (c_k choose 2). And for each such pair, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. Therefore, the number of same_inversion_pairs is sum_{k} (c_k choose 2). Because same_inversion_pairs counts all pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). So for each group of permutations with the same inversion count, the number of such pairs is (c_k choose 2). Therefore, the same_inversion_pairs is sum_{k} (c_k choose 2).\n\nTherefore, the answer is (total_pairs - sum_k (c_k choose 2 )) // 2 mod mod.\n\nSo the problem now becomes: compute for each k, the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions, then compute the sum over k of (c_k choose 2), and then compute the answer as (total_pairs - sum) // 2 mod mod.\n\nBut how to compute c_k for all k?\n\nThis seems like a classic dynamic programming problem. The number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions can be computed using DP.\n\nThe recurrence is as follows: Let dp[n][k] be the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions. Then, for the nth element, when inserting it into a permutation of n-1 elements, inserting it at position i (0-based) adds i inversions. So the recurrence is:\n\ndp[n][k] = sum_{i=0}^{min(n-1, k)} dp[n-1][k - i]\n\nThe base case is dp[1][0] = 1, and dp[1][k] = 0 for k > 0.\n\nBut for n up to 500, what is the maximum possible k? The maximum number of inversions for n elements is n*(n-1)/2. For n=500, that's 500*499/2 = 124750. So the maximum k is around 125,000. So for n=500, the DP table would be 500 x 125000. But for each n, the maximum k increases by n-1. So the DP table needs to be of size up to 500 x (500*501)/2 = 500*501/2 = 125250. So for n=500, the maximum k is 124750. So the DP table for n=500 would have up to 124750 entries per n.\n\nSo the DP approach is feasible. Let's think about how to compute this.\n\nWe can precompute dp for all n up to 500 and for all k up to max_k.\n\nOnce we have the dp table, for each n, the c_k is dp[n][k].\n\nSo for the problem, once we compute all c_k for the given n, then compute sum (c_k choose 2) for all k. Then compute the answer as (total_pairs - sum) // 2 mod mod.\n\nBut wait, what about the total_pairs? Let's compute that.\n\ntotal_pairs is (n! * (n! - 1)) // 2. Because the number of unordered pairs of distinct permutations is (n! choose 2) = n!*(n! - 1)/2. Since for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total_pairs is indeed that value.\n\nBut for large n (like 500), computing n! is going to be a huge number, but since mod can be up to 1e9, and n is up to 500, we need to compute factorials modulo mod? Wait, no. Because the formula for total_pairs is (n! * (n! - 1)) // 2. However, since the answer is (total_pairs - sum) // 2, and mod is not necessarily prime, we need to compute this value modulo mod. However, division by 2 in modular arithmetic is possible only if mod is coprime with 2. But mod can be even. So how to handle this?\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the answer is (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs) divided by 2. So we need to compute this value mod mod. However, the division by 2 is an integer division. Because total_pairs is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2, and same_inversion_pairs is sum (c_k choose 2), which is an integer. Therefore, (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs) must be even, so that when you divide by 2, you get an integer. Therefore, we can compute (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs) as a number, then divide by 2, then take mod mod.\n\nBut how to compute this when n is up to 500, which makes n! very large (like 500! is way beyond 1e1000, which can't be stored as a regular integer in Python, but Python can handle big integers. However, for n=500, the value of n! is manageable in Python, but when mod is applied, perhaps we need to compute n! modulo something. Wait, but for the total_pairs, we need to compute (n! * (n! - 1)) // 2. However, since mod may not be a prime, and we need to compute this value mod mod, but the problem is that for large n, n! can be very big, but in Python, big integers are handled.\n\nBut wait, if n is up to 500, then n! is a number with about 1000 digits. However, when we compute (n! * (n! - 1)) // 2 mod mod, perhaps we can compute n! mod (2 * mod) and then compute the product? Wait, but how to compute (a * b) // 2 mod mod, when a and b are large numbers.\n\nBut perhaps there's another approach. Let's think:\n\nLet me denote A = n! and B = (A - 1). Then total_pairs = (A * B) // 2. So the value we need is (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs) // 2. But same_inversion_pairs is sum (c_k choose 2) which is sum (c_k * (c_k - 1) // 2). So the entire expression is [(A * B) // 2 - sum (c_k * (c_k - 1) // 2 ) ] // 2. Which simplifies to [ (A * B - sum (c_k * (c_k - 1)) ) ] // 4. Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal expression: (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs) // 2.\n\ntotal_pairs is (A * B)/2.\n\nsame_inversion_pairs is sum (c_k * (c_k - 1) / 2).\n\nSo the expression is [ (A*B/2) - sum(...) ] / 2 = (A*B - 2 * sum(...)) / 4.\n\nBut since the original problem says that (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs) must be even, then this division by 2 is valid. However, handling this in code with big integers is possible in Python, but for n=500, calculating A = n! could be feasible. However, for n=500, 500! is a number with 1135 digits. But Python can handle that.\n\nBut even so, for the problem, the answer is (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs) // 2 mod mod. So perhaps we can compute (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs) as a big integer, then divide by 2, then take mod mod.\n\nBut how to compute this when mod is given. For example, if mod is 1e9, then the value of (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs) can be extremely large, but since Python can handle arbitrary precision integers, it's possible.\n\nBut the problem is that for n=500, n! is a very big number. However, even for n=500, Python can compute it. So perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. Precompute the dp table for the number of permutations with k inversions for n up to 500.\n\n2. For the given n, compute all c_k (the dp[n][k] values).\n\n3. Compute sum_c = sum( c_k * (c_k - 1) // 2 for all k )\n\n4. Compute A = factorial(n)\n\n5. Compute total_pairs = (A * (A - 1)) // 2\n\n6. answer = (total_pairs - sum_c) // 2 mod mod\n\nBut for n=500, the factorial could be up to 500! which is a huge number. However, in Python, this is manageable. However, when n is up to 500, the calculation of the factorial is feasible.\n\nBut what about the DP for the number of inversions? Let's think about how to compute that.\n\nThe DP approach is:\n\nInitialize a 2D array dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of permutations of i elements with j inversions.\n\nBase case: dp[1][0] = 1.\n\nFor each i from 2 to n:\n\n   for each j from 0 to max_inversions_i:\n\n       dp[i][j] = sum_{k=0 to min(i-1, j)} dp[i-1][j - k]\n\nBut for i=500 and j up to 124750, this would be O(n^3) time. Wait, for each i, the maximum j is i*(i-1)/2. For each i, the number of j's is O(i^2). For each j, the inner loop runs up to i-1 steps. So the total time complexity is O(n^3). For n=500, this would be 500^3 = 125 million operations. Which is acceptable in Python? Well, 1e8 operations take about a second. 125 million is about 1.25e8, which might be tight. But perhaps with optimizations, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize this DP. Because the recurrence for dp[i][j] is the sum of dp[i-1][j - k] for k from 0 to min(i-1, j). But this is equivalent to the convolution of the previous dp with a certain kernel. Alternatively, we can use prefix sums to compute the sum quickly.\n\nYes! For each i, when building dp[i], for each j, dp[i][j] is equal to the sum of dp[i-1][j - k] for k from 0 to min(i-1, j). But since k can be up to i-1, and j -k >=0. So for a given j, the sum is sum_{x = max(0, j - (i-1))}^{j} dp[i-1][x], but I'm not sure. Wait, let's think: when inserting the ith element into a permutation of i-1 elements, inserting it in position k (0-based) adds k inversions. So for a permutation of i elements with j inversions, it can be formed by taking a permutation of i-1 elements with j - k inversions, where k ranges from 0 to i-1 (since inserting the new element into position k in the permutation of i-1 elements adds k inversions). Therefore, dp[i][j] = sum_{k=0}^{min(i-1, j)} dp[i-1][j -k}.\n\nBut for each j, this sum is over the range of j -k >=0, so k can be from 0 to min(i-1, j). Which is equivalent to summing dp[i-1][j'] where j' ranges from j - (i-1) to j, but ensuring that j' >=0.\n\nBut instead of recomputing the sum for each j, we can use prefix sums. For example, for each i, the dp[i][j] can be computed as the sum of dp[i-1][j - 0], dp[i-1][j - 1], ..., dp[i-1][j - (i-1)], but only for those terms where j -k >=0.\n\nThis sum can be calculated efficiently using prefix sums. Let's say we have a prefix sum array for dp[i-1]. Then for each j, the sum is prefix[j] - prefix[j - i], but adjusted for the boundaries. Let me think:\n\nLet's consider that for dp[i][j], the sum is sum_{x = max(0, j - (i-1))}^{j} dp[i-1][x]. Wait, no. Because k is the number of inversions added, which is from 0 to i-1. So for the previous permutation, the number of inversions is j - k. So j -k can be from j - 0 to j - (i-1). So the possible values of j -k are from j - (i-1) to j, but only if they are >=0. Therefore, the sum is over all x in [max(0, j - (i-1)), j], where x = j -k. So x ranges from j - (i-1) to j, but x can't be negative. Therefore, the sum is sum_{x = max(0, j - (i-1))}^{j} dp[i-1][x}.\n\nBut this is the same as the sum of dp[i-1][x] from x = a to x = b, where a = max(0, j - (i-1)), and b = j. This can be computed quickly with a prefix sum array.\n\nSo for each i, we can precompute the prefix sums of dp[i-1], and then for each j, compute the sum in O(1) time.\n\nThis would reduce the time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2 * max_k), which for n=500 and max_k ~ 125,000 would be O(500^2 * 125000) = 3.125e10 operations, which is way too big. Wait, no. Wait, the max_k for each i is i*(i-1)/2. For i=500, it's 124750. So for each i, the number of j's is O(i^2). So the total number of operations would be O(n^3) again, but with a better constant factor. However, with the prefix sum approach, for each j, the sum can be done in O(1) time, so the total time is O(n^2 * max_k) ?\n\nWait, no. For each i, we process all possible j's (up to i*(i-1)/2). For each j, we compute the sum using the prefix sum array. So for each i, the time is O(max_j_i), which is O(i^2). So overall, the total time is O(n^3). Which for n=500 would be 500^3 = 125 million operations. Which is manageable in Python if optimized properly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nImplement the DP with prefix sums to speed up the sum calculation.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation details.\n\nFirst, we need to precompute dp for all n up to 500. For each n, we'll compute dp[n][k] for all possible k.\n\nBut for n=500, the maximum k is 500*499/2 = 124750. So for each i from 1 to 500, we need to store an array of size up to 124750. But since for each i, the maximum k is i*(i-1)/2, which for i=500 is 124750, but for smaller i, it's less. So perhaps we can create a 2D array where for each i, the maximum j is i*(i-1)//2.\n\nBut in practice, for each i, we can have a list of size (i*(i-1)//2 + 1), but that's complicated. Alternatively, for all i up to 500, we can have a maximum j of 124750. So we can create a 2D array of size (501) x (124750 + 1), initialized to 0. Then for each i, and j up to the maximum possible for that i, compute the dp[i][j].\n\nBut for i=1, the maximum j is 0. For i=2, it's 1. For i=3, 3, etc.\n\nSo the steps for the DP:\n\nInitialize a 2D array, say dp, with dp[i][j] representing the number of permutations of i elements with j inversions.\n\nInitialize dp[1][0] = 1.\n\nFor i from 2 to n_max (500):\n\n   max_prev_j = (i-1)*(i-2) // 2\n\n   max_current_j = i*(i-1) // 2\n\n   Create a new array for dp[i], size up to max_current_j + 1.\n\n   Compute the prefix sums of dp[i-1] up to max_prev_j.\n\n   For each j in 0 ... max_current_j:\n\n       lower = max(0, j - (i-1))\n\n       upper = j\n\n       if lower > max_prev_j:\n\n           sum_val = 0\n\n       else:\n\n           sum_val = prefix[upper] - prefix[lower - 1] (if lower > 0 else prefix[upper])\n\n       dp[i][j] = sum_val\n\nBut how to compute the prefix sums?\n\nFor each i, after computing dp[i-1], we can compute a prefix sum array for dp[i-1], which allows us to compute the sum from a to b quickly.\n\nBut for each i, the previous dp[i-1] has entries up to (i-1)(i-2)/2. So for the current i, when processing j, the upper is j, which can be up to i*(i-1)/2. However, when j is larger than (i-1)(i-2)/2 + (i-1) (which is i*(i-1)/2), then lower is j - (i-1) which may be larger than the max_prev_j.\n\nSo for each i, the steps would be:\n\nCompute the prefix array for dp[i-1]. Let's call this prefix_prev, where prefix_prev[k] = sum_{x=0}^k dp[i-1][x}.\n\nThen for each j in 0 to max_current_j:\n\n   lower = max(0, j - (i-1))\n\n   upper = j\n\n   if upper > max_prev_j:\n\n       upper = max_prev_j\n\n   if lower > upper:\n\n       sum_val = 0\n\n   else:\n\n       sum_val = prefix_prev[upper] - (prefix_prev[lower - 1] if lower > 0 else 0)\n\n   dp[i][j] = sum_val\n\nBut how to handle the upper and lower?\n\nAlternatively, for each j, the sum is the sum of dp[i-1][x], where x ranges from max(0, j - (i-1)) to min(j, max_prev_j). Because x can't exceed the max_prev_j.\n\nSo for each j, the lower bound is max(0, j - (i-1)), upper is min(j, max_prev_j). If lower > upper, then sum is 0.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nNow, in code, for each i, we can precompute the prefix_prev array for dp[i-1], then for each j, compute the sum.\n\nBut how to represent the dp array. Since for n up to 500, and j up to 124750, we can create a 2D list of lists, where dp[i] is a list of size (max_j + 1) for that i. But for efficiency, perhaps we can precompute up to the maximum possible j (for n=500) once.\n\nBut in Python, for a 500 x 125000 array, that's 500 * 125000 = 62,500,000 entries. Each entry is an integer. For Python, that's manageable, but memory-wise, it's about 62 million integers, each taking 4 bytes (assuming 32-bit integers). That's about 250MB, which is acceptable.\n\nBut given that for each i, the maximum j is i*(i-1)/2, which for i=500 is 124750, but for smaller i, the max j is smaller. So perhaps for each i, we can create a list of size (i*(i-1)//2 + 1), but for code simplicity, perhaps we can create a 2D array of size (n_max +1) x (max_j +1), where max_j is 124750. For each i, j can be up to i*(i-1)//2, and for j beyond that, the value is zero.\n\nBut for code, perhaps it's easier to preallocate a 2D array with dimensions (n_max + 1) x (max_j + 1), where max_j is 124750.\n\nSo let's proceed with that.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nFirst, precompute the dp table.\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D list of (n_max + 1) rows, each row being a list of (max_j + 1) zeros.\n\nBut for n_max=500, max_j is 500*499//2 = 124750.\n\nSo:\n\nmax_n = 500\n\nmax_j = max_n * (max_n -1) // 2\n\nThen, for each i in 1..max_n:\n\n   for j in 0..max_j:\n\n       dp[i][j] = 0\n\nBut initializing this may take some time. However, in Python, for 501 rows and 124751 columns, it's manageable.\n\nBut for each i, the maximum j that can be considered is i*(i-1)//2. So for i=1, j can be 0. For i=2, j can be 0 or 1. For i=3, j can be 0..3, etc.\n\nSo for each i, during the DP step, we process j from 0 to i*(i-1)//2.\n\nBut during the computation, for j beyond that, the dp[i][j] will remain zero.\n\nNow, the code outline:\n\nInitialize dp as a 2D array of zeros.\n\ndp[1][0] = 1\n\nfor i in 2 to n_max:\n\n    prev_max_j = (i-1)*(i-2) // 2\n\n    current_max_j = i*(i-1) // 2\n\n    # compute prefix_prev array for dp[i-1]\n\n    prefix_prev = [0] * (prev_max_j + 2)  # indexes 0 to prev_max_j + 1?\n\n    prefix_prev[0] = 0\n\n    for x in 0 to prev_max_j:\n\n        prefix_prev[x+1] = prefix_prev[x] + dp[i-1][x]\n\n    # Now, for each j in 0 to current_max_j:\n\n    for j in 0 to current_max_j:\n\n        lower = max(0, j - (i-1))\n\n        upper = j\n\n        # upper can't exceed prev_max_j\n\n        upper = min(upper, prev_max_j)\n\n        if lower > upper:\n\n            dp[i][j] = 0\n\n        else:\n\n            # sum from lower to upper in dp[i-1]\n\n            sum_val = prefix_prev[upper + 1] - prefix_prev[lower]\n\n            dp[i][j] = sum_val\n\nBut wait, the prefix_prev array is built as prefix_prev[k] = sum_{x=0}^{k-1} dp[i-1][x} ?\n\nYes. Because for the prefix_prev array, the standard way is to have prefix_prev[0] = 0, prefix_prev[1] = dp[i-1][0], prefix_prev[2] = dp[i-1][0] + dp[i-1][1], etc. Then, the sum from a to b (inclusive) is prefix_prev[b+1] - prefix_prev[a].\n\nSo for lower and upper, the sum is prefix_prev[upper+1] - prefix_prev[lower].\n\nBut in code, when j is up to current_max_j, which is i*(i-1)//2. But for j up to that, upper is min(j, prev_max_j). So for j up to prev_max_j + (i-1) ?\n\nBut for i >= 2, prev_max_j is (i-1)(i-2)/2. Adding (i-1) gives (i-1)(i-2)/2 + (i-1) = (i-1)(i-2 + 2)/2 = (i-1)*i/2 = current_max_j. So j can be up to current_max_j, which is exactly prev_max_j + (i-1).\n\nThus, the code above should correctly compute the sum.\n\nOnce the dp table is computed, for the given n, we can get all c_k = dp[n][k], for k from 0 to max_j.\n\nOnce we have that, compute sum_c = sum( c_k * (c_k - 1) // 2 for all k )\n\nThen compute total_pairs = (fact * (fact - 1)) // 2, where fact is n!.\n\nThen answer = (total_pairs - sum_c) // 2 mod mod.\n\nBut for n=500, the factorial is a huge number. However, in Python, we can compute it as a big integer. For example, fact = 1, then for i in 1 to n: fact *= i.\n\nBut for n=500, that's manageable.\n\nBut when n is 500, the value of fact is 500! which is a 1135-digit number. However, Python can handle that.\n\nOnce we compute all these values, the answer is (total_pairs - sum_c) // 2 mod mod.\n\nBut how to compute (total_pairs - sum_c) // 2 when total_pairs and sum_c are very large? Well, in Python, integer division is possible.\n\nNow, let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample input: n=4, mod=403458273.\n\nSample output: 17.\n\nLet's compute.\n\nFor n=4, compute the sum_c.\n\nFirst, compute dp[4][k] for all k.\n\nFor example, the number of permutations of 4 elements with k inversions.\n\nLet's see:\n\nThe possible inversion counts for n=4 are 0 to 6.\n\nBut let's compute the dp table.\n\nBut maybe I can look up the values for n=4.\n\nBut for the sample input, the sum_c is sum (c_k choose 2).\n\nThe total_pairs is (4! * (4! - 1)) / 2 = (24 * 23)/2 = 276.\n\nsum_c is sum (c_k choose 2) for all k.\n\nThen answer is (276 - sum_c) // 2.\n\nIn the sample, the answer is 17, so (276 - sum_c) // 2 = 17 → 276 - sum_c = 34 → sum_c = 276 -34 = 242.\n\nSo sum_c is 242.\n\nLet me check what sum_c would be.\n\nFor n=4, the number of permutations with each inversion count:\n\nThe inversion counts for permutations of 4 elements are as follows:\n\nNumber of permutations with 0 inversions: 1 (the identity).\n\nWith 1 inversion: 1 (swap two adjacent elements, but there are 3 possible adjacent swaps, but wait no. Wait, for example, [1,2,3,4] has 0 inversions. To get 1 inversion, you need to swap two elements that are adjacent. There are 3 such swaps. So the number is 3? Or maybe more?\n\nWait, actually, the number of permutations with exactly k inversions can be found in OEIS sequences. For example, for n=4:\n\nThe inversion counts are:\n\nk=0: 1\n\nk=1: 1 (no, wait, no. For example, [1,2,4,3] has 1 inversion. Similarly, [1,3,2,4], [2,1,3,4], [1,2,3,4] has 0. So for k=1, there are 3 permutations. Wait, no, for n=4, the number of permutations with 1 inversion is C(4,2) = 6? No, no. Because each inversion is a pair of elements that are out of order. But the number of permutations with exactly one inversion is equal to the number of ways to have exactly one pair (i,j) where i < j and a_i > a_j. For this, the permutation must have exactly one such pair, which implies that the rest of the elements are in order. For example, the permutation [1, 2, 4, 3] has one inversion (4 and 3). Similarly, [1, 3, 2, 4], [2, 1, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4] has 0. So there are 3 such permutations. Wait, but there are C(4, 2) = 6 pairs. For each pair, swapping them would give a permutation with exactly one inversion. However, if the elements are not adjacent, swapping them would create more inversions. For example, swapping 1 and 3 in [1,2,3,4] gives [3,2,1,4], which has multiple inversions. So the only way to have exactly one inversion is to swap two adjacent elements. So for n=4, there are 3 such permutations (swapping positions 1-2, 2-3, 3-4). So for k=1, the count is 3.\n\nBut according to the dp approach, let's compute dp[4][k].\n\nBut perhaps I should compute the dp for n=4.\n\nLet me compute the dp step by step.\n\nFor i=1:\n\ndp[1][0] = 1.\n\nFor i=2:\n\nmax_prev_j = 0.\n\ncurrent_max_j = 1.\n\nprefix_prev is [0, 1], since dp[1][0] = 1.\n\nFor j in 0 to 1:\n\nj=0:\n\nlower = max(0, 0 -1) = 0.\n\nupper = min(0, 0) = 0.\n\nsum_val = prefix_prev[0+1] - prefix_prev[0] = 1 - 0 = 1 → dp[2][0] = 1?\n\nWait, but inserting the 2nd element into position 0 (which adds 0 inversions) would require the previous permutation to have 0 inversions. So dp[2][0] = 1 (the permutation [2,1] has 1 inversion? Wait, no. Wait, the dp[i][j] represents the number of permutations of i elements with j inversions. For i=2, inserting the 2nd element into position 0 (the beginning) would add 0 inversions (since it's before all elements, but in a permutation of 1 element, inserting the new element in position 0 would make it [new, old], which has 1 inversion. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the recurrence.\n\nWait, the recurrence is that inserting the new element (the ith element) into position k (0-based) in the permutation of i-1 elements. This insertion adds k inversions. Because the new element is placed at position k, which means there are k elements after it in the permutation. So each of these elements is smaller than the new element (since it's a permutation), thus contributing k inversions.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the new element is the largest element (since we are building permutations incrementally?), or not? No, the permutation is of numbers 1..i. When inserting the new element into a permutation of 1..i-1, the new element is i. Inserting it into position k (0-based) in the permutation of size i-1. So the new permutation will have i in position k. The elements before it are the first k elements, and after it are the remaining",
