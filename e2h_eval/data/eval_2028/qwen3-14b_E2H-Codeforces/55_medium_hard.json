    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical ternary string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0s and 2s directly. Hmm.\n\nSo the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent) and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). So what does that mean for the order of characters?\n\nLet me think about the possible rearrangements. Since we can swap 0s and 1s, but not 0s and 2s, maybe the positions of 0s and 2s are somewhat fixed relative to each other, but 1s can move around between 0s and 2s?\n\nWait, no. Let's think: For example, if there's a 0 followed by a 1 followed by a 2. Then, I can swap the 0 and 1, then the 1 and 2. So maybe 0 can move past 1s and 2s? Or wait, no. Because swapping 0 and 1 is allowed, but swapping 0 and 2 isn't. So if there's a 0 and a 2 that are not adjacent, how can they be swapped?\n\nWait, suppose I have a sequence like 0 2. I can't swap them directly. But if there's a 1 in between, maybe I can move the 0 and 2 past each other via the 1?\n\nLike, for example: 0 1 2. Then, I can swap the 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then swap the 0 and 2? No, because that's not allowed. Wait, but the 0 and 2 are not adjacent here. So maybe the 0 can't pass through the 2. So maybe the 0s and 2s can't be swapped, but 1s can move between them?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s can be moved past 1s, and the 2s can be moved past 1s, but 0s and 2s can't be moved past each other. So the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. Because if you have a 0 followed by a 2, you can't swap them. But if there's a 1 between them, maybe you can move the 0 and 2 around?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the string is \"0 1 2\". Can I get the 0 and 2 to swap positions?\n\nLet me think. The original is 0 1 2. I can swap the 0 and 1 to get 1 0 2. Then, I can swap the 0 and 2? No, because they are not adjacent. Wait, the 0 is next to 2? No, the 0 is in the middle. So the 0 and 2 are separated by a 0. So no. Alternatively, can I swap the 1 and 2 first? Let's see. Original is 0 1 2. Swap the 1 and 2 to get 0 2 1. Now, the 0 and 2 are adjacent. But I can't swap them. So that's stuck. So the 0 and 2 can't be swapped. So in this case, the relative order of 0 and 2 can't be changed. Because even with the 1 in between, you can't get them to swap positions.\n\nSo this suggests that the 0s and 2s are fixed in their relative order. Because you can't swap them. So the positions of 0s and 2s can't be changed relative to each other. Only the 1s can be moved between them.\n\nWait, but if there's a 0 and a 2 in the string, their positions relative to each other can't be changed. So the final string must have all the 0s and 2s in the same order as the original string. But the 1s can be moved around between them.\n\nSo the problem reduces to arranging the 1s in between the 0s and 2s. But how?\n\nSo for example, let's say the original string has some 0s and 2s, and some 1s. The 1s can be moved freely between the 0s and 2s. But the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order. So the minimal lex string would be to arrange all the 1s as far to the left as possible, but considering that the 0s and 2s are fixed.\n\nWait, but how?\n\nLet me think of the original string as consisting of a sequence of 0s, 1s, and 2s. But the relative order of 0s and 2s can't be changed. So the final string will have the same order of 0s and 2s as the original, but the 1s can be placed between them.\n\nBut how do we arrange the 1s?\n\nFor example, suppose the original string is '0 2'. Then the 1s can't be inserted between them. But if there are 1s in the original string, they can be moved around. Wait, but if there are 1s in the original string, they can be moved between 0s and 2s.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to approach this is to split the original string into blocks of 0s, 1s, and 2s, but considering that the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. But the 1s can be moved between them. So perhaps the idea is to collect all the 1s and place them in the positions where they can be arranged to make the lex smallest string.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the problem as follows. The 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So the final string will have all the 0s and 2s in the same order as the original string. However, between them, the 1s can be arranged. Also, any 1s that are present in the original string can be moved into positions between the 0s and 2s.\n\nSo for example, if the original string is '0 1 2', then the 0 and 2 are in the same order. The 1 can be placed between them, but since it's already there, nothing changes. However, if the original string is '0 2 1', then the 1 can be moved to between the 0 and 2. So the final string would be '0 1 2'.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother example: original string is '2 0 1'. Then, the 2 and 0 are in the original order. But since 2 comes before 0, but we can't swap them. So the final string must have 2 before 0. However, the 1 can be moved to between them. So the minimal string would be '0 1 2'? No, because the original order of 2 and 0 can't be changed. Wait, original string is '2 0 1'. The 2 and 0 are in the order 2 followed by 0. Since we can't swap 0 and 2, the final string must have the 2 before 0. So the minimal string would be '0 1 2' is not possible because that would require moving the 2 after the 0. So the correct minimal string would be '0 1 2' is not possible. Wait, original is 2 0 1. How can we arrange the 1s?\n\nLet me think. The original string is 2 0 1. Let's see:\n\nWe can swap the 0 and 1 (they are adjacent), so 2 1 0. Then, can we swap the 1 and 0? No, because the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (so yes, they can be swapped). Wait, the 1 and 0 can be swapped. So the original is 2 0 1. We can swap the 0 and 1 to get 2 1 0. Then, can we swap the 1 and 2? Because they are adjacent. So 2 1 0 → 1 2 0. Then, can we swap the 2 and 0? No. So the final string would be 1 2 0. But the original order of 2 and 0 is 2 before 0. But in the new string, the 2 is after 1, but the 0 is after 2. So the 2 is still before the 0. So that's allowed.\n\nWait, but the original order of 2 and 0 is that 2 comes before 0. In the new string, 1 2 0, the 2 comes before 0. So that's okay. So the 2 and 0's order is preserved.\n\nSo the idea is that the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So their order in the original string must be preserved in the final string. However, the 1s can be moved around between them. So how can we arrange the 1s?\n\nThe minimal lex string would have as many 0s as possible at the beginning, then 1s, then 2s. But since the 0s and 2s can't be reordered, perhaps the approach is to collect all the 1s and place them between the 0s and 2s, but in a way that allows the lex order to be minimized.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to approach this is to split the original string into a list of characters that are either 0 or 2, and collect the 1s in between them. Then, arrange the 1s in the positions where they can be placed to minimize the lex order.\n\nWait, here's a possible approach:\n\n- The order of 0s and 2s in the original string must remain the same. So, for example, if the original string has a 0 followed by a 2, then in the final string, the 0 must come before the 2. Similarly, if there's a 2 followed by a 0, the 2 must come before the 0.\n\n- The 1s can be placed anywhere between these 0s and 2s, but also can be placed in between the 0s and 2s. So, for example, if the original string is '0 2', then the 1s can be placed between them.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Split the original string into a list of 'fixed' elements (the 0s and 2s in their original order) and collect all the 1s that are in between them. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the fixed elements are the 0s and 2s, and the 1s can be inserted between them. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, think of the original string as consisting of some 0s and 2s, and the 1s can be moved between them. For example, the 1s can be placed in between any two fixed elements (0s and 2s), or before the first fixed element, or after the last fixed element.\n\nBut how to arrange them optimally?\n\nLet me think of the fixed elements as being in a list. For example, suppose the original string is '0 1 2 1 0 2'. Then the fixed elements are [0, 2, 0, 2]. The 1s are [1, 1].\n\nThen, the problem becomes inserting the 1s into the positions between the fixed elements, such that the resulting string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how to insert them optimally?\n\nSince the fixed elements are 0s and 2s, and the 1s can be placed anywhere between them. To make the lex smallest string, we want to place as many 1s as possible in the earliest positions possible, but considering that inserting them in certain positions may be better than others.\n\nWait, but inserting 1s before a 0 is better than inserting them after. Because 1 is larger than 0, so placing 1s before 0s would make the string worse. Wait, no. Let's think:\n\nSuppose we have a fixed element 0. If we can place a 1 before it, that would make the string start with 1, which is worse than having 0. So we want to avoid that. But if we can place 1s after the 0, that's better. But since the fixed elements are in order, perhaps the optimal way is to insert the 1s between the fixed elements in a way that minimizes the lex order.\n\nLet me think of the fixed elements as a sequence. For example, suppose the fixed elements are [a_1, a_2, ..., a_k], where each a_i is either 0 or 2. Then, between each pair of consecutive fixed elements, we can insert some number of 1s. Also, before the first fixed element and after the last fixed element, we can insert 1s.\n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s?\n\nLet me think of the fixed elements as being in a list. Let's say the fixed elements are [F_1, F_2, ..., F_m], and there are n_1 1s to insert.\n\nWe need to distribute these 1s into the m+1 possible gaps (before F_1, between F_1 and F_2, ..., between F_{m-1} and F_m, after F_m).\n\nThe goal is to distribute the 1s into these gaps in a way that the overall string is lex smallest.\n\nBut how?\n\nThe key is that inserting 1s into certain gaps can be better than others. For example, inserting 1s before a 0 would be worse than inserting them after the 0. Wait, no. Let's take an example. Suppose the fixed elements are [0, 2]. The possible gaps are:\n\ngap 0: before 0\n\ngap 1: between 0 and 2\n\ngap 2: after 2.\n\nIf we insert some 1s in gap 0, then the string starts with 1s followed by 0. Which is worse than starting with 0. So to minimize lex order, we should not insert any 1s into gaps that are before a 0. Because inserting 1s there would make the string start with 1, which is worse than 0.\n\nSimilarly, inserting 1s after a 2 would be better than inserting them between 0 and 2. Because inserting after 2 would add 1s after the 2, which is better than putting them between 0 and 2.\n\nBut how to decide where to insert the 1s optimally?\n\nLet me think of the possible gaps and their positions. For each gap, inserting 1s into that gap would affect the lex order. The optimal strategy is to insert as many 1s as possible into the earliest possible gaps that can be filled without increasing the lex order.\n\nWait, but the 1s are between the fixed elements. So for example, inserting 1s into the gap before the first fixed element (if the first fixed element is 0) would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. Therefore, we should not insert any 1s into that gap. Similarly, inserting 1s into gaps before a 0 would be bad.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal way is to insert all the 1s into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them doesn't cause a worse lex order. Let's think about the gaps.\n\nEach gap is between two fixed elements, or before the first, or after the last.\n\nFor each gap, inserting 1s into it would contribute to the string as follows:\n\nFor example, if the gap is between F_i and F_{i+1}, inserting x 1s here would add x '1's between F_i and F_{i+1}.\n\nThe question is, where to place the 1s so that the lex order is minimized.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can process each gap in order. For each gap, decide how many 1s to insert here. The idea is that inserting 1s into a gap earlier in the string is better if the 1s are placed in positions that don't cause the string to be larger.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the gaps as follows:\n\nFor each gap, inserting 1s into that gap would have the following effect:\n\n- If the gap is before the first fixed element, inserting 1s here would add 1s at the beginning of the string. Since 1 is larger than 0, this is worse than putting them elsewhere. So we want to avoid inserting here.\n\n- If the gap is after the last fixed element, inserting 1s here would add 1s at the end of the string. Since 1 is smaller than 2, inserting them here is better than inserting them before a 2.\n\n- For gaps between two fixed elements, say between F_i and F_{i+1}, inserting 1s here would be better if inserting them here makes the string lex smaller than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nBut how to compare different gaps?\n\nLet's consider two consecutive gaps, say gap A and gap B. Suppose inserting 1s into gap A is better than inserting into gap B. How to determine that.\n\nFor example, suppose we have two gaps:\n\nGap A is between F_i and F_{i+1}.\n\nGap B is between F_j and F_{j+1}.\n\nWe need to decide which gap to insert the 1s first.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal strategy is to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them is beneficial.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the 1s can be inserted into the gaps between fixed elements. The best place to insert 1s is between a 0 and a 2, or between a 0 and another 0, or between a 2 and another 2. But how?\n\nLet me think of the fixed elements as a list. For each gap between two fixed elements, the decision of inserting 1s depends on the left and right elements of the gap.\n\nFor example, if the gap is between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s here would be beneficial. Because inserting 1s between 0 and 2 would allow us to have 0 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is better than leaving the 0 and 2 as is, since 0 is better than 1 and 2 is better than 1. But inserting the 1s here would make the string have 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than having 0 followed by 2 (since 0 is followed by 1, which is better than 0 followed by 2).\n\nBut if the gap is between two 0s, inserting 1s between them would be worse than inserting them elsewhere. Because inserting 1s between 0s would create a 0 followed by 1s followed by 0. But that's worse than putting the 1s after the second 0. For example, suppose we have two 0s. Inserting 1s between them would give 0 1 0, which is worse than 0 0 1.\n\nWait, but the 1s can be moved to the end. So perhaps the optimal way is to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gaps that are between a 0 and a 2, or between a 0 and something else, but in a way that allows the lex order to be minimized.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: the 1s can be placed anywhere, but to minimize the lex order, we want to have as many 0s as possible at the beginning, then 1s, then 2s. However, the fixed elements (0s and 2s) are in their original order, so the 0s and 2s can't be reordered. So the problem is to arrange the 1s between the fixed elements in a way that allows the 0s to be as early as possible, and the 2s as late as possible.\n\nSo, for example, if there's a gap between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s here would be good. Because that way, the 0 is followed by 1s and then the 2. That's better than having the 0 followed by 2 and then the 1s.\n\nBut if there's a gap between a 0 and another 0, inserting 1s here would be worse than inserting them after the second 0. Because inserting between the two 0s would give 0 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is worse than 0 followed by 0 followed by 1s.\n\nSimilarly, inserting 1s between a 2 and a 0 would be bad, because that would create 2 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is worse than inserting the 1s after the 2, leading to 2 followed by 1s, then the 0. But since the 0 must come after the 2, inserting the 1s between them would be worse than inserting them after the 2 and before the 0.\n\nSo the key is to insert the 1s into the gaps that are between a 0 and a 2, but also between 0s and 0s, and between 2s and 2s, but in a way that allows the lex order to be minimized.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nSince the 0s and 2s are fixed in their order, the minimal lex string can be constructed by greedily placing the 1s as early as possible, but only in positions where they don't interfere with the fixed elements.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think of the entire string as consisting of the fixed elements (0s and 2s) and the 1s that can be inserted between them. The minimal lex string would be the one that has all the 1s placed in the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not make the string worse.\n\nSo, for example, between two fixed elements, if inserting 1s here would be better than inserting them elsewhere, then do that.\n\nLet me think of the gaps again. The gaps can be considered in order, and for each gap, decide how many 1s to insert.\n\nThe rule for inserting 1s into a gap is:\n\n- If the gap is between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s here is beneficial because it allows the 0 to be followed by 1s and then the 2, which is better than 0 followed by 2 and then 1s.\n\n- If the gap is between two 0s, inserting the 1s here would be worse than inserting them after the second 0. So we want to avoid inserting here.\n\n- If the gap is between two 2s, inserting the 1s here would be worse than inserting them after the second 2.\n\n- If the gap is before the first fixed element (which is a 0), inserting 1s here would be worse than inserting them after the 0.\n\n- If the gap is after the last fixed element (which is a 2), inserting 1s here is better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nSo the idea is to process the gaps in order, and for each gap, insert as many 1s as possible, but only if inserting them here is better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, for each gap, the priority of inserting 1s into it is determined by the following:\n\n- If the current gap is between a 0 and a 2, inserting 1s here is the best option. Because that way, the 0 is followed by 1s, which is better than having the 0 followed by 2, then 1s.\n\nWait, but inserting 1s between 0 and 2 would make the string have 0 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is better than 0 followed by 2 followed by 1s. So inserting 1s between 0 and 2 is better.\n\nSimilarly, if the gap is between a 0 and a 0, inserting the 1s here would be worse than inserting them after the second 0. Because inserting between the two 0s would create 0 1s 0, which is worse than 0 0 1s.\n\nSo for the gaps, the priority is:\n\n- Gaps where inserting 1s would be between a 0 and a 2: highest priority.\n\n- Gaps where inserting 1s would be between 0 and 0: lower priority than between 0 and 2.\n\n- Gaps where inserting 1s would be between 2 and 2: lower priority than between 0 and 2.\n\n- Gaps where inserting 1s would be between 2 and 0: inserting here would create 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. But since the 2 is before 0, this is allowed. However, inserting the 1s after the 2 would be better, since 2 is followed by 1s and then 0. But the 0 is after the 2. So inserting 1s between 2 and 0 would be better than inserting them after the 0. Because inserting between 2 and 0 would make the 2 followed by 1s, then 0. But inserting after the 0 would make the 2 followed by 0, then 1s. Which is worse than the first option.\n\nWait, for example, original fixed elements are 2 followed by 0. Inserting 1s between them gives 2 1s 0. Which is better than 2 0 1s. Because 2 is followed by 1, which is better than 0. So inserting between 2 and 0 is better than inserting after the 0.\n\nSo inserting between 2 and 0 is better than inserting after the 0. So for gaps between 2 and 0, inserting the 1s here is better than inserting them after the 0.\n\nSo the priority of inserting 1s into gaps is based on the following:\n\nFor each gap, the priority is determined by the left and right fixed elements. The higher the priority, the more we want to insert 1s into that gap first.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- Gaps between 0 and 2 have higher priority than gaps between 2 and 0.\n\nWait, but inserting between 0 and 2 is better than inserting between 2 and 0? Not sure. Let me think.\n\nSuppose we have two gaps: one between 0 and 2, and another between 2 and 0.\n\nWhich one should we prioritize inserting 1s into?\n\nIf inserting into the 0-2 gap gives us 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, which is better than inserting into the 2-0 gap, which would be 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. Which one is better lex-wise?\n\nWell, the first option starts with 0, which is better than starting with 2. So the 0-2 gap is higher priority than the 2-0 gap.\n\nSo the priority for inserting 1s into a gap is determined by the left and right fixed elements. The priority is higher for gaps where inserting 1s allows the earliest possible placement of 1s in the string.\n\nSo here's a possible plan:\n\n- Collect all the fixed elements (0s and 2s) in their original order.\n\n- Collect all the 1s in a list.\n\n- For each gap between fixed elements (including before the first and after the last), determine the priority of inserting 1s into that gap.\n\n- Distribute the 1s into the gaps according to their priority.\n\nBut how to compute the priority for each gap?\n\nAn alternative idea: for each gap, the priority is determined by the left and right elements. The priority is such that we want to insert as many 1s as possible into the earliest possible gaps where inserting them would not make the lex order worse.\n\nLet me think of the gaps as being ordered from left to right. For each gap in order, we decide how many 1s to insert into it. The decision is based on whether inserting the 1s here would help in making the string lex smaller.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nFor each gap, if inserting a 1 into this gap would lead to a lex smaller string than not inserting it, then we insert as many as possible.\n\nBut how to compare inserting into this gap versus inserting into another.\n\nAlternatively, for each gap, the earliest possible position where inserting 1s would be beneficial is the gap that comes first in the string and allows the 1s to be placed as early as possible.\n\nBut how to determine which gaps are better.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nThe optimal way to insert the 1s is to insert them in the earliest possible positions where inserting them would not increase the lex order. For example, between two fixed elements, inserting 1s is better if the left element is 0 and the right is 2, because inserting the 1s between them allows the 0 to be followed by 1s, which is better than the 0 followed by 2 and then the 1s.\n\nBut if the left element is 0 and the right is 0, inserting the 1s between them would create a 0 followed by 1s followed by 0, which is worse than inserting the 1s after the second 0.\n\nSo the idea is to process the gaps in order and for each gap, insert as many 1s as possible if the current gap is between a 0 and a 2, or between a 0 and something else, but only if it's better than inserting them elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to insert all the 1s between the 0s and 2s as much as possible, and then insert the remaining 1s after the last 2.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nExample 1: input is '100210' → output is '001120'.\n\nOriginal string: '1', '0', '0', '2', '1', '0'.\n\nThe fixed elements are 0, 0, 2, 0. The 1s are 1, 1.\n\nThe gaps are:\n\ngap0: before the first 0.\n\ngap1: between first 0 and second 0.\n\ngap2: between second 0 and 2.\n\ngap3: between 2 and 0.\n\ngap4: after the 0.\n\nNow, the 1s can be inserted into these gaps.\n\nTo make the lex smallest string, we want to insert the 1s into the earliest possible gaps that are not before a 0.\n\nSo for gap0: inserting 1s here would make the string start with 1, which is worse than starting with 0. So we don't insert here.\n\ngap1: between two 0s. Inserting 1s here would create 0 1s 0. But that's worse than inserting after the second 0. So we want to avoid this. So we don't insert here.\n\ngap2: between 0 and 2. Inserting 1s here is good. So insert all possible 1s here. Let's say we have two 1s. Inserting both here would make the string have 0 0 followed by 1s followed by 2, then 0. So the string would be '001120'.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nAnother example: input is '20' → output is '20'.\n\nNo 1s, so nothing to do.\n\nAnother example: input is '210' → original string is 2,1,0. The fixed elements are 2 and 0. The 1s are [1]. The gaps are:\n\ngap0: before 2.\n\ngap1: between 2 and 0.\n\ngap2: after 0.\n\nInserting the 1 into gap1 (between 2 and 0) gives 2 1 0. Which is better than inserting into gap2 (2 0 1) or gap0 (1 2 0). The lex order of 210 is worse than 201, but inserting into gap1 gives 210, which is worse than inserting into gap2 (201). Wait, but why?\n\nWait, the original fixed elements are [2, 0], and the 1 can be inserted into the gap between 2 and 0, or after 0.\n\nInserting into gap1 (between 2 and 0) gives 2 1 0.\n\nInserting into gap2 (after 0) gives 2 0 1.\n\nWhich is better? Comparing 210 vs 201. The latter is better. So in this case, inserting into gap2 is better.\n\nBut according to our previous logic, inserting between 2 and 0 is better than inserting after 0. But in reality, inserting after 0 is better.\n\nSo this suggests that our previous logic was wrong. What's the mistake here?\n\nAh, because inserting between 2 and 0 gives 2 followed by 1, which is worse than 2 followed by 0. Because 2 is followed by 1, which is worse than 0. So inserting between 2 and 0 is worse than inserting after the 0.\n\nSo the previous idea of inserting between 0 and 2 is better than inserting between 2 and 0 is not correct. Because inserting between 2 and 0 would make the string have 2 followed by 1, which is worse than 2 followed by 0.\n\nSo this shows that the priority of the gaps depends on the left and right elements. For example, inserting between a 0 and 2 is better than inserting between 2 and 0.\n\nSo the idea is that, for a gap between left and right elements, we want to insert 1s into it only if inserting them here improves the lex order compared to not inserting them here.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nLet me think of the following: when inserting 1s into a gap, the insertion will affect the string. For the earliest possible position where the insertion can be done, we want to choose the gap that allows the earliest possible 1s to be placed in the string, but in a way that doesn't make the string worse.\n\nBut how to compare different gaps.\n\nAlternative idea: for each gap, the insertion of 1s into it is allowed only if the left element is less than 1, or the right element is greater than 1. But this is not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the way to decide whether inserting 1s into a gap is beneficial is to compare the left and right elements.\n\nFor example, inserting 1s into a gap between left and right elements:\n\n- If left is 0 and right is 2: inserting 1s here is beneficial, as it allows the 0 to be followed by 1s and then 2. This is better than leaving the 0 followed by 2 and then the 1s.\n\n- If left is 0 and right is 0: inserting 1s here would be worse than inserting after the right 0.\n\n- If left is 0 and right is 1: but wait, the right element is part of the fixed elements (0 or 2). So this case can't happen.\n\nWait, the fixed elements are only 0s and 2s. So the gaps are between 0s and 2s, or between 0 and 0, or between 2 and 2, or between 2 and 0, or before the first fixed element (which is 0 or 2), or after the last fixed element (which is 0 or 2).\n\nSo for each gap, the left and right elements are known. For example, the gap between two fixed elements, say left = L (0 or 2), right = R (0 or 2).\n\nWhen inserting 1s into this gap, the effect is that the string will have L followed by some 1s followed by R.\n\nWe want to know whether this is better than not inserting the 1s into this gap (i.e., having L followed by R, and the 1s elsewhere).\n\nBut how to compare this with other options.\n\nLet me think about the following: inserting 1s into a gap between L and R will have the effect of replacing L R with L followed by 1s followed by R. This is better than the original if the 1s are placed in a way that makes the string lex smaller.\n\nBut how to compare inserting into different gaps.\n\nFor example, between L=0 and R=2: inserting 1s here would make the string have 0 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is better than the original 0 2. So inserting here is good.\n\nBetween L=2 and R=0: inserting 1s here would make the string have 2 followed by 1s followed by 0. This is worse than the original 2 0 (since 2 is followed by 1, which is worse than 2 followed by 0). So inserting here is bad.\n\nBetween L=2 and R=2: inserting 1s here would make the string have 2 followed by 1s followed by 2. Which is worse than 2 followed by 2, but better than inserting the 1s after the second 2. Because inserting after the second 2 would have the 1s after the 2s, which is better.\n\nWait, inserting between 2 and 2 would create 2 1s 2, which is worse than 2 2 1s. So it's better to insert after the second 2.\n\nSo the conclusion is: for a gap between L and R, inserting 1s here is beneficial only if inserting them here would improve the lex order",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest ternary string possible by performing allowed swaps on adjacent characters. The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. The key insight is that '0's and '2's cannot be swapped directly, so their relative order must remain unchanged. However, '1's can be freely moved around between '0's and '2's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Fixed Elements**: Extract all '0's and '2's from the input string while maintaining their original order. These elements are considered fixed.\n2. **Collect 1s**: Gather all '1's from the input string as they can be moved around.\n3. **Distribute 1s**: Insert the collected '1's into the gaps between the fixed elements in a way that minimizes the lexicographical order. The optimal strategy involves inserting '1's between '0' and '2' first, followed by inserting any remaining '1's after the last fixed element.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    fixed = []\n    ones = []\n    for c in s:\n        if c == '0' or c == '2':\n            fixed.append(c)\n        else:\n            ones.append('1')\n    \n    result = []\n    # Add the first gap (before the first fixed element)\n    # We will not add any 1s here if the first fixed element is '0'\n    # because it would make the string start with '1' which is worse than '0'\n    # Similarly for other gaps\n    # Process each gap in order\n    # Gaps are: before first, between fixed elements, after last\n    # We need to decide where to insert the 1s\n    \n    # For each gap, determine how many 1s to insert\n    # We'll process gaps in order, and insert 1s where it's beneficial\n    # We'll prioritize inserting between 0 and 2, then between 0 and 0, then between 2 and 2, etc.\n    \n    # First, handle the initial gap before the first fixed element\n    # Only insert 1s here if the first fixed element is '2' (since inserting before '2' would be better than after)\n    # But since '1' is smaller than '2', inserting before '2' is better than inserting after\n    # However, if the first fixed element is '0', inserting before it would make the string start with '1', which is worse than '0'\n    # So we only insert here if the first fixed element is '2'\n    if fixed and fixed[0] == '2' and ones:\n        result.extend(ones)\n        ones = []\n    \n    # Now process the gaps between fixed elements\n    for i in range(len(fixed) - 1):\n        left = fixed[i]\n        right = fixed[i + 1]\n        # Determine if we should insert 1s here\n        # If left is '0' and right is '2', insert all remaining 1s here\n        if left == '0' and right == '2' and ones:\n            result.append('0')\n            result.extend(ones)\n            ones = []\n        else:\n            result.append(left)\n        # If we have no more 1s, just append the rest of the fixed elements\n        if not ones:\n            for j in range(i + 1, len(fixed)):\n                result.append(fixed[j])\n            break\n    \n    # If there are still 1s left, append them after the last fixed element\n    if ones:\n        if fixed:\n            result.append(fixed[-1])\n        result.extend(ones)\n    else:\n        # Append the remaining fixed elements\n        for c in fixed:\n            if not result or result[-1] != c:\n                result.append(c)\n    \n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Read input and output\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    inputs = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    for s in inputs:\n        print(min_ternary_string(s))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fixed Elements Extraction**: We iterate through the input string to separate '0's and '2's (fixed elements) from '1's (which can be moved).\n2. **Handling Initial Gap**: If the first fixed element is '2', we insert all '1's before it to minimize the lexicographical order.\n3. **Gap Processing**: We process gaps between fixed elements.
