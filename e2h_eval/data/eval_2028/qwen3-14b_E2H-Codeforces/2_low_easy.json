Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is n lines each with n characters. n is odd. So for example, for n=5, the main diagonal is positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4). The other diagonal is (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0). Wait, but note that the center cell (2,2) in this case is part of both diagonals. So when checking the diagonals, we need to make sure that all cells in both diagonals are the same. Also, the two diagonals might have the same letter, but the other cells must have a different letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this diagonal_char.\n2. Check that all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same and not equal to diagonal_char.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nLet me think about how to iterate through the grid.\n\nFor each cell (i,j), it's on a diagonal if i == j or i + j == n - 1. Because for a square of size n, the main diagonal is i = j, and the anti-diagonal is i + j = n-1. For example, in n=3, the anti-diagonal cells are (0,2), (1,1), (2,0).\n\nSo for all cells (i,j) in the grid, check if they are on either diagonal. If they are, they must be equal to diagonal_char. Otherwise, they must be equal to another_char, which is different from diagonal_char.\n\nBut how do I find diagonal_char and another_char?\n\nFirst, collect all the characters from the diagonals. All of them must be the same. So, take the first diagonal cell (0,0) as the candidate. Then check that all other diagonal cells (both diagonals) are equal to this.\n\nWait, but what if the two diagonals have different characters? Like, suppose the main diagonal is all 'a's, and the anti-diagonal is all 'b's. Then that's invalid. Because the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letters.\n\nSo first step: collect all the characters from both diagonals. Check that they are all the same. Let's say that the first diagonal cell (0,0) is the reference. Then check that every cell in both diagonals is equal to this reference.\n\nOnce that is done, then check all other cells (non-diagonal) are equal to another character, which is different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input:\n\nFirst example:\n\nInput is:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nSo the diagonals are:\n\nLooking at positions (i,j) where i == j or i + j = 4 (since n=5, 0-based).\n\nFor (0,0) is 'x', (0,4) is 'x'.\n\n(1,1) is 'o', (1,3) is 'o'.\n\n(2,2) is 'x', (2,2) is same cell.\n\n(3,3) is 'o', (3,1) is 'o'.\n\n(4,4) is 'x', (4,0) is 'x'.\n\nSo the diagonals have x, o, x, o, x, o, x? Wait, let me list all the cells in the diagonals.\n\nFor n=5, the diagonals are:\n\nMain diagonal: (0,0), (1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4).\n\nAnti-diagonal: (0,4), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (4,0).\n\nSo combining both, the cells are:\n\n(0,0), (0,4), (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1), (3,3), (4,0), (4,4).\n\nWait, but (2,2) is in both. So the total unique cells are 5 + 5 - 1 = 9 cells.\n\nIn the first input example, the main diagonal cells are:\n\nRow 0:",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria. The criteria are that all cells on both diagonals of the grid must contain the same letter, and all other cells (not on the diagonals) must contain the same different letter.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonals**: Verify that all cells on both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) contain the same character.\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Cells**: Ensure that all cells not on either diagonal contain the same character, which is different from the character on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check if all diagonal elements are the same\ndiag_char = grid[0][0]\nis_valid = True\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            if grid[i][j] != diag_char:\n                is_valid = False\n                break\n    if not is_valid:\n        break\n\nif not is_valid:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    # Now check non-diagonal elements\n    non_diag_char = None\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            if i != j and i + j != n - 1:\n                if non_diag_char is None:\n                    non_diag_char = grid[i][j]\n                else:\n                    if grid[i][j] != non_diag_char:\n                        is_valid = False\n                        break\n        if not is_valid:\n            break\n    if is_valid and non_diag_char != diag_char:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The first character of the main diagonal (`grid[0][0]`) is taken as the reference character. We iterate through all cells on both diagonals to ensure they all match this reference character.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: If the diagonal check passes, we then check all non-diagonal cells. We use the first encountered non-diagonal character as the reference and ensure all other non-diagonal cells match this character.\n4. **Validation**: If both checks pass and the non-diagonal character is different from the diagonal character, we print \"YES\"; otherwise, we print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check the required conditions with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
