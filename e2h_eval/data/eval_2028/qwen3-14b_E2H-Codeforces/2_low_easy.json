Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, for the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells in these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all non-diagonal cells are the same, and that they are not equal to 'd_char'.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal characters. For each cell (i,j) in the grid, check if it's on either of the two diagonals. For the main diagonal, i == j. For the other diagonal, i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, if it's on either diagonal, collect its value.\n\nThen, check that all those collected values are the same. Let's say that value is d_char.\n\nThen, collect all the non-diagonal cells. Check that all of them are the same and not equal to d_char.\n\nBut wait, there's another possibility: what if the non-diagonal cells are all same but same as d_char? Then it's invalid.\n\nSo, the steps:\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\n- All diagonal cells must be same. Let's get the first diagonal cell's value (like (0,0)) as d_char. Then check all other diagonal cells are same as d_char.\n\nThen, check non-diagonal cells:\n\n- All non-diagonal cells must be same. Let's get the first non-diagonal cell's value (like (0,1) if n is 3) as o_char. Then check all other non-diagonal cells are same as o_char. Also, o_char must not equal d_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3. For example, when n=3, the diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping in the center. So total diagonal cells are 2n - 1. For n=3, that's 5 cells. The total cells is 9, so non-diagonal is 4. So there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, how to proceed:\n\nFirst, iterate through all cells. For each cell, check if it is on a diagonal. Collect all the diagonal cells and non-diagonal cells.\n\nBut perhaps, for efficiency, we can check for each cell whether it's on a diagonal. Then:\n\n- For all diagonal cells, check that they are the same as the first diagonal cell.\n\n- For all non-diagonal cells, check that they are same as the first non-diagonal cell, and that this is different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut what if all the non-diagonal cells are same, but same as diagonal? Then it's invalid.\n\nSo, let's think about the steps:\n\nFirst, collect the diagonal characters. Let's take the first diagonal cell (0,0) as d_char. Then check that every other diagonal cell (i,j) where i==j or i+j = n-1 has the same value as d_char.\n\nThen, collect the non-diagonal cells. Take the first non-diagonal cell (like (0,1)) as o_char. Then check that all non-diagonal cells are equal to o_char, and that o_char != d_char.\n\nBut what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3, so for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So no problem.\n\nBut how to find the first non-diagonal cell? Well, for example, in the first row, the first cell is (0,0) which is diagonal. The next cell (0,1) is not. So that's a candidate. But maybe in some cases, the first non-diagonal cell is (0,1) or (1,0) etc.\n\nBut perhaps, for the non-diagonal cells, we can check all of them, and collect their values. Then check that all are same and not equal to d_char.\n\nBut how to collect the non-diagonal cells?\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLoop through",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all cells on both diagonals must contain the same character, and all other cells (non-diagonal) must contain the same character different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Diagonal Consistency**: Verify that all cells on both diagonals (main diagonal and anti-diagonal) contain the same character. This character will be referred to as `d_char`.\n2. **Check Non-Diagonal Consistency**: Ensure all non-diagonal cells contain the same character (`o_char`) which is different from `d_char`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check if n is odd (given in problem statement, but just in case)\nif n % 2 == 0:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Collect diagonal characters and check consistency\nd_char = None\nvalid_diagonal = True\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            if d_char is None:\n                d_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n                    valid_diagonal = False\n\nif not valid_diagonal:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Collect non-diagonal characters and check consistency\no_char = None\nvalid_non_diagonal = True\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i != j and i + j != n - 1:\n            if o_char is None:\n                o_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != o_char:\n                    valid_non_diagonal = False\n\nif not valid_non_diagonal:\n    print(\"NO\")\n    exit()\n\n# Check if o_char is different from d_char\nif o_char == d_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: The main diagonal (where row index equals column index) and the anti-diagonal (where the sum of row and column indices equals `n-1`) are checked for consistency. If any cell on these diagonals does not match the first diagonal character (`d_char`), the result is immediately \"NO\".\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: All cells not on the diagonals are checked for consistency. If any non-diagonal cell does not match the first non-diagonal character (`o_char`), the result is \"NO\".\n4. **Final Check**: Ensure that the non-diagonal character (`o_char`) is different from the diagonal character (`d_char`). If they are the same, the result is \"NO\", otherwise \"YES\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using two passes over the grid, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
