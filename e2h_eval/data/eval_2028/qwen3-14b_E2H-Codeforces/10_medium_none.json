Golorp's name is a program in some programming language. Some scientists believe that this language is Befunge; golorps are tantalizingly silent.Variables consumed by golorps can take values from 0 to 9, inclusive. For each golorp its daily diet is defined by its name. Some golorps are so picky that they can't be fed at all. Besides, all golorps are very health-conscious and try to eat as little as possible. Given a choice of several valid sequences of variable values, each golorp will choose lexicographically smallest one.For the purposes of this problem you can assume that a golorp consists of jaws and a stomach. The number of variables necessary to feed a golorp is defined by the shape of its jaws. Variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws.A hungry golorp is visiting you. You know its name; feed it or figure out that it's impossible.\n\n## Input\nThe input is a single string (between 13 and 1024 characters long) â€” the name of the visiting golorp. All names are similar and will resemble the ones given in the samples. The name is guaranteed to be valid.\n\n## Output\nOutput lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values fit for feeding this golorp. Values should be listed in the order in which they get into the jaws. If the golorp is impossible to feed, output \"false\".\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.', '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.', '?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.']\n\n### Output\n['0010', 'false', '0250341', '0101']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem called \"Feed the Golorp.\" Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that a golorp's name defines its daily diet. The name is a string that represents some kind of program, and we need to find the lexicographically smallest sequence of variable values (digits 0-9) that can be fed through its jaws. If it's impossible, output 'false'.\n\nThe examples given have inputs that are strings like '?(...) : ...' and outputs are sequences of digits or 'false'. So I need to figure out how to parse the golorp's name into some constraints and then find the minimal lex sequence that satisfies them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the structure of the golorp's name represents. Looking at the sample input and output:\n\nFor example, the first input is ['?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'] and output is '0010'. Let's think about what that might mean.\n\nThe format seems to resemble Befunge, as mentioned in the problem statement. Befunge is a 2D esoteric programming language where the instruction pointer moves in directions (like up, down, left, right) and the code is a grid of characters. But how does this relate to the problem?\n\nThe problem says that variables are consumed by the golorp, and each variable is a digit from 0-9. The sequence of variables is determined by the jaws' structure. The name of the golorp is a program that defines how variables are processed. The goal is to find a sequence of digits that, when processed through this program, allows the golorp to eat them, following certain rules.\n\nBut how do I model this? The problem mentions that variables can get to the stomach only via the jaws. So perhaps the program's structure defines a path that must be followed, and the variables are read along that path. Also, the program may have conditions that need to be satisfied based on the variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the name is structured as a series of operations that must be satisfied. For example, the part after the colon might be a list of conditions. Let's look at the sample input again:\n\nIn the first example, the input is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.' \n\nBreaking this down: the part before the colon is something like ?(...), which might represent the jaws. The part after the colon is a list of conditions. For example, the first sample's output is '0010', which has four digits. Maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the jaws part?\n\nWait, looking at the first sample's input: the jaws part is _-_/___*__. Let's count the underscores. Let me see:\n\nThe first part is _-_/___*__:\n\nBreaking it down into parts separated by operators. Maybe each underscore represents a variable? Or perhaps the number of underscores in the jaws determines the number of variables needed. For example, the first sample's jaws part has:\n\nLet me count the underscores in the first sample's jaws:\n\nOriginal jaws part: _-_/___*__\n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- _ - / _ _ _ * _ _\n\nSo there are 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 underscores? Wait, but the output is 0010, which is 4 digits. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the jaws part defines a path that the program must follow, and each step along the path requires a variable. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the sample outputs and trying to see patterns.\n\nSample Input 1: Output is '0010' (length 4). Let's look at the jaws part: _-_/___*__. How many variables could that be? Maybe the number of underscores is 1+3+2=6? But that's not matching. Alternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part before the colon. Let's check the first sample's jaws part: _-_/___*__.\n\nBreaking that down: the underscores are in groups. Maybe each operator (like -, /, *, etc.) is between variables. For example, if the jaws part is something like a series of operations between variables, the number of variables would be the number of operands. For example, an expression like a - b / c * d would require 4 variables. But the jaws part here is _-_/___*__, which could be parsed as (a - b) / (c * d) ? Not sure. But in that case, the number of variables would be 4. Which matches the first sample's output of 4 digits. So maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of operands in the jaws expression. So for each operator, the number of operands would be determined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the jaws part is a Befunge-like program, and the variables are read from the input as the program is executed. But how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the sample input and output, perhaps the part after the colon is a list of constraints that the variables must satisfy. For example, in the first sample, the part after the colon is ':-___>__.' which may be a list of conditions. Let's look at the sample output: 0010. Let's think about the possible constraints.\n\nIn the first sample, the output is 0010. Let's imagine that the conditions after the colon are something like:\n\nThe variables must satisfy certain inequalities. For example, the first sample's part after colon is ':-___>__.' which could be interpreted as a series of comparisons. For example, the '->___' could be a comparison like the third variable is greater than the fourth. Let's see: if the variables are [0,0,1,0], then the third variable is 1, the fourth is 0, so 1>0. That's true. So maybe the part after the colon is a list of conditions that the variables must satisfy.\n\nSo the general approach would be:\n\n1. Parse the golorp's name into two parts: the jaws part (before the colon) and the conditions part (after the colon).\n\n2. Determine how many variables are needed based on the jaws part.\n\n3. Parse the conditions part into a list of constraints that the variables must satisfy.\n\n4. Find the lexicographically smallest sequence of digits (0-9) that satisfies all constraints. If no such sequence exists, output 'false'.\n\nBut how to parse the jaws part and the conditions part?\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nThe first sample's name is '?(_-_/___*__):-___>__.'\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe part before the colon is ?(...), which might be the jaws. The part inside the parentheses is _-_/___*__. The question mark may be indicating that this is a function or a predicate. The colon then separates the jaws from the conditions.\n\nThe conditions part is '-___>__.' which may be a list of conditions. Each condition is something like a comparison between variables. For example, the '->___' might be a comparison between the third variable and the fourth (since there are three underscores before the > and two after). So the third variable (index 2 if zero-based) must be greater than the fourth (index 3). Then the '.' might be a terminator.\n\nSimilarly, the second sample input is '?(__-_+_/_____):-__>__,_____<__.' The output is 'false'. Let's see: the conditions part is '-__>__,_____<__.' So maybe there are two conditions: first, the second variable is greater than the third (since there are two underscores before the > and one after?), and then the fourth variable is less than the fifth? But the jaws part would determine how many variables there are. Let's think about the jaws part for the second sample: __-_+_/_____. How many variables are there here?\n\nBreaking down the jaws part: __-_+_/_____.\n\nAssuming that each operator is between variables. For example, the expression could be (a - b) + (c / d), but that would have four variables. However, the underscores are grouped as two, then one, then one, then one, then five? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the jaws part is a sequence of operations that must be evaluated, and the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores. For example, each underscore is a variable. So if the jaws part has N underscores, then the number of variables is N.\n\nLet me check the first sample's jaws part: _-_/___*__.\n\nHow many underscores are there? Let's count:\n\n- The first part is '_', then '-', then '/', then '___' (three underscores), then '*' and '__' (two underscores). So total underscores: 1 + 3 + 2 = 6? But the output is 4 digits. That doesn't fit. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the jaws part is a path that the program follows, and the number of variables is equal to the number of steps in that path. For example, in Befunge, the program is a grid, and the instruction pointer moves around. But without knowing the exact structure, it's hard to model.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the sample outputs, let's think of the number of variables required. The first sample's output is 4 digits, the second sample's output is 'false', third is 7 digits, fourth is 4 digits.\n\nLooking at the first sample's jaws part: _-_/___*__.\n\nIf the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the jaws part minus the number of operators. For example, each operator takes two operands. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the jaws part is a Befunge-like program, and the number of variables is determined by the number of positions that are read during the execution. For example, the program starts at some point, and the variables are read from the input as the program is executed. But how?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps I should look for more clues in the sample inputs.\n\nLooking at the first sample's output: 0010. Let's think about the conditions part. The part after the colon is ':-___>__.'.\n\nAssuming that the colon separates the jaws from the conditions. The conditions are written in a way that resembles Prolog syntax. For example, in Prolog, a rule is written as head :- body. Here, maybe the part after the colon is a list of conditions that must be satisfied.\n\nSo the first sample's conditions are '-___>__.' which could be a single condition. The '-' might be an operator, and the rest is a comparison. Maybe the condition is that the third variable (since there are three underscores before the '>') is greater than the second variable (since there are two underscores after the '>')? Or perhaps the number of underscores before and after the operator indicates the positions of variables involved in the condition.\n\nFor example, in '-___>__.' the '>' is preceded by three underscores and followed by two. This could mean that the third variable (counting from the start) is greater than the second variable (since there are two underscores after the operator). Wait, but that would be variable index 2 (third variable) compared to variable index 1 (second variable). But in the sample output, the third variable is 1 and the second is 0. 1>0 holds. So that seems to fit.\n\nSo the condition is that the variable at position (number of underscores before the operator) is compared with the variable at position (number of underscores after the operator). The operator is either >, <, etc. So for example, in the first sample, the condition is that the third variable (index 2) is greater than the second variable (index 1). But wait, the underscores before the '>' are three, so the variable is the third one (assuming that underscores are variables). But the underscores after the '>' are two, so the second variable. So the condition would be var[2] > var[1]. In the sample output 0010, var[2] is 1, var[1] is 0. So 1>0 is true.\n\nSo the conditions are a list of comparisons between variables. Each comparison is represented by an operator (>, <, etc.) and the number of underscores before and after the operator indicate which variables are being compared.\n\nSo the parsing of the conditions part would involve splitting into individual conditions. Each condition is something like a sequence of underscores followed by an operator and then underscores, possibly with other elements. For example, in the third sample input:\n\n'?(______________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___):-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______.', the conditions part is '-__<___,___<____,____<_____,_____<______,______<_______'.\n\nEach of these commas separates different conditions. For example, the first condition is '-__<___', which could be that the variable at position 2 (two underscores before the '<') is less than the variable at position 3 (three underscores after the '<'). So var[2] < var[3].\n\nIf this is the case, then the approach would be:\n\nFor each condition in the conditions part:\n\n- Split the conditions by commas to get individual constraints.\n\n- For each constraint, parse the operator and the positions of the variables involved.\n\nOnce we have the constraints, we need to find the lex smallest sequence of digits that satisfies all constraints.\n\nNow, the next question is: how many variables are there? How is that determined by the jaws part?\n\nLooking back at the first sample: the jaws part is _-_/___*__. Let's assume that the number of variables is the number of underscores in the jaws part. Let's count:\n\nIn the first sample's jaws part: _-_/___*__ has 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 underscores. But the output is 4 variables. So that doesn't fit. So this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the jaws part divided by the number of operators plus something else. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the jaws part is a Befunge-like program that defines a path, and the number of variables is the number of positions that the instruction pointer visits during the program's execution, which depends on the program's structure. But without knowing the specifics of how the program works, this is hard to model.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the sample outputs and their corresponding jaws parts:\n\nSample 1: jaws part is _-_/___*__ â†’ output length 4.\n\nSample 4: input is '?(__+___+__-___):-___>__.' â†’ output is '0101' (length 4). The jaws part is __+___+__-___ â†’ underscores count: 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10 underscores. So again, output is 4. So this suggests that the number of variables is not directly determined by the number of underscores in the jaws part.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the conditions part? No, because in the first sample, the conditions part is ':-___>__.' which has 3 + 2 = 5 underscores. But the output is 4 variables. So that also doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the jaws part is a Befunge-like program that uses the variables as input. The number of variables required is determined by the number of times the program reads from input. For example, if the program has a series of 'g' instructions (get input) then each 'g' corresponds to a variable. But without knowing the exact Befunge syntax, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the jaws part divided by the number of operators plus 1. For example, if the jaws part is an expression with operators, the number of variables is the number of operands. For instance, an expression like a - b / c * d has 4 variables. So for the jaws part _-_/___*__, the expression would be (a - b) / (c * d), which has 4 variables. Which matches the first sample's output of 4 variables. Similarly, the fourth sample's jaws part is __+___+__-___, which could be (a + b) + (c - d), which has 4 variables. That matches the output of 4 variables. So this seems plausible.\n\nSo the number of variables is determined by the number of operands in the jaws expression. How to parse that?\n\nThe jaws part is a mathematical expression made of variables (underscores) and operators. Each operator combines two operands. The number of variables is the number of operands in the expression.\n\nFor example, an expression like a + b has two operands. An expression like a + b * c has three operands. But how to parse this correctly?\n\nThis seems like a problem of parsing expressions and counting the number of operands. However, without knowing the exact precedence and grouping, it's challenging. But perhaps the jaws part is structured as a simple expression where each operator is binary and the expression is fully parenthesized. But given that the sample jaws parts don't have parentheses, this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the jaws part is a sequence of operations, and the number of variables is the number of underscores in the jaws part minus the number of operators. Because each operator combines two operands, and each operand is a variable (represented by an underscore). For example, in the first sample's jaws part, the underscores are 1 + 3 + 2 = 6. The operators are '-', '/', '*', which are three operators. So number of variables would be 6 - 3 + 1 = 4? Because each operator reduces the count by one. For example, two variables and one operator gives one operand. So the formula would be number of variables = (number of underscores) - (number of operators) + 1 ?\n\nWait, let's test this:\n\nFirst sample's jaws part: underscores count is 1 + 3 + 2 = 6. Operators are '-', '/', '*' â†’ 3 operators. So variables = 6 - 3 + 1 = 4. Which matches the sample output of 4 variables. Fourth sample's jaws part is __+___+__-___ â†’ underscores count is 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 = 10. Operators are '+', '+', '-', which is 3 operators. So variables = 10 - 3 + 1 = 8? But the sample output is 4 variables. So this formula doesn't hold. So this approach is wrong.\n\nHmm. Another idea: the number of variables is the number of underscores in the jaws part. For example, the first sample's jaws part has 1+3+2=6 underscores, but sample output is 4 variables. Doesn't fit. So this can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the conditions part. But in the first sample's conditions part, there are 3+2=5 underscores. Output is 4. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the part after the colon. For example, the first sample's conditions part is ':-___>__.' which has 3+2=5 underscores. But output is 4. Still not matching.\n\nAnother angle: the sample outputs suggest that the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the conditions part. Let's take the first sample's conditions part: ':-___>__.' â†’ underscores before '>' is 3, after is 2. Total 5. But the output is 4 variables. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of commas in the conditions part plus one. For example, the first sample's conditions part has no commas. So variables would be 1. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe I should look for another pattern. For example, in the first sample, the output is 4 variables. Let's look at the conditions part again: the condition is that the third variable is greater than the second. So there are at least two variables. But the output is four. So how is the number of variables determined?\n\nMaybe the number of variables is determined by the maximum number of underscores in any of the conditions. For example, in the first sample's condition, the underscores before the '>' are 3, and after are 2. So max is 3. But the output has 4 variables. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of variables is determined by the sum of underscores in each condition. For example, in the first sample's condition, 3 + 2 = 5. But output is 4 variables. Doesn't fit.\n\nThis seems stuck. Let's think differently. Since the problem states that the name is guaranteed to be valid, perhaps the number of variables can be derived from the conditions part. For example, each condition refers to variables by their positions. The maximum position across all conditions plus one is the number of variables.\n\nIn the first sample's condition: the underscores before '>' are 3, which would refer to variable 3 (if counting from 1), and the underscores after are 2, referring to variable 2. So the maximum variable index is 3. Thus, the number of variables is 3. But the sample output is 4 variables. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if the underscores are counted as the number of variables, then 3 underscores before '>' would refer to the third variable. So the maximum variable index across all conditions is the number of variables. For example, in the first sample's condition, the maximum is 3, but the output is 4 variables. So again, this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of variables needed to satisfy the conditions. For example, the conditions may imply that there are multiple variables, but how to know that?\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should look for more clues in the sample inputs.\n\nThird sample input: the output is '0250341', which is 7 digits. The jaws part is __________________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___ (I think it's a long string of underscores followed by operators). Let's count the underscores in the jaws part. It's hard to count from the given string, but perhaps the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores divided by the number of operators plus something else. But again, without knowing the exact structure, it's hard.\n\nAlternative plan: Maybe the number of variables is determined by the number of underscores in the jaws part, but each operator is between two variables. For example, the number of variables is the number of underscores, and the number of operators is the number of operators in the jaws part. But since each operator connects two variables, the number of variables is equal to the number of operators + 1. For example, if there are 3 operators, then there are 4 variables. Let's test this with the first sample.\n\nIn the first sample's jaws part: how many operators? The jaws part is _-_/___*__. The operators are '-', '/', '*'. So three operators. So number of variables would be 3+1=4. Which matches the sample output of 4 variables! That seems promising.\n\nLet's check the fourth sample's input: the jaws part is __+___+__-___, which has operators '+', '+', '-', three operators. So variables would be 3+1=4. Which matches the sample output of 4 variables. Great!\n\nWhat about the third sample input? The jaws part is __________________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___.\n\nLet me count the number of operators. Let's see: the string is:\n\n\"__________________________/____+_______*__-_____*______-___\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe first part is a lot of underscores, then '/', then some underscores, then '+', then underscores, then '*', then underscores, then '-', then underscores, then '*', then underscores, then '-', then underscores.\n\nSo the operators are '/', '+', '*', '-', '*', '-', which is 6 operators. Then number of variables is 6+1=7, which matches the sample output of 7 digits. Yes! That makes sense.\n\nSo the number of variables is determined by the number of operators in the jaws part plus 1. So how to count the number of operators in the jaws part?\n\nThe jaws part is the part inside the parentheses of the first part of the name. For example, in the first sample, it's _-_/___*__. The operators are -, /, *.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Parse the input string to extract the jaws part (the part inside the parentheses after the ?).\n\n   For example, the input string starts with '?(...):...'.\n\n   So the first step is to split the string into two parts: the jaws part (before the colon) and the conditions part (after the colon).\n\n   For example, for the string '?(...):-...':\n\n   - The part before the colon is '?(...)', which includes the ? and the parentheses. We need to extract the content inside the parentheses.\n\n   So, first, split the string on the colon to get the two parts.\n\n   Then, for the first part (before colon), split it into the ? and the parentheses. For example, the first part is something like '?(...)', so we can extract the part inside the parentheses.\n\n   Once we have that, count the number of operators in that part. The number of variables is operator_count + 1.\n\n2. Once the number of variables is known, parse the conditions part (after the colon) into a list of constraints.\n\n   For example, the conditions part is something like '-___>__.' which is a single condition, or '-__<___,___<____,...' which is multiple conditions separated by commas.\n\n   Each condition is of the form [underscores][operator][underscores][.], where the underscores before the operator indicate the first variable index (number of underscores), and the underscores after indicate the second variable index.\n\n   For example, '-___>__.' â†’ the operator is '>', the first variable is 3 (three underscores), the second is 2 (two underscores). So the constraint is var[3] > var[2].\n\n   But wait, in the first sample, the condition is var[3] > var[2], and the sample output is 0010. Let's check:\n\n   variables are [0, 0, 1, 0]. So var[3] is 0 (index 3?), or is it 1-based? Because the underscores before the '>' are three, which would be variable index 3 (assuming 1-based). But in the sample output, the third variable (index 2 if 0-based) is 1, and the second variable (index 1) is 0. So if the underscores are 3, then it's variable index 3 (0-based 2?), but I'm confused.\n\n   Let's clarify: suppose the underscores before the operator indicate the number of variables to take. For example, if there are three underscores before the operator, that means the first variable is the third one (assuming 1-based indexing). So for the condition '-___>__.' (three underscores before, two after), the constraint is var[3] > var[2]. Assuming variables are 1-based.\n\n   In the first sample's output, the variables are [0, 0, 1, 0]. So var[3] is 1, var[2] is 0. 1>0 holds. So that works.\n\n   So the variables are 1-based. So for each condition, the underscores before the operator give the first variable's index (1-based), and the underscores after give the second variable's index.\n\n   So the plan for parsing the conditions:\n\n   a. Split the conditions part into individual constraints by splitting on commas.\n\n   b. For each constraint, strip any leading or trailing whitespace (though the input probably doesn't have any), and then find the operator (which is one of >, <, =, etc.), and split the underscores before and after.\n\n   For example, a constraint like '-__<___' would be parsed as follows:\n\n   The operator is '<', the underscores before are 2, the underscores after are 3. So constraint is var[2] < var[3].\n\n   Now, the problem is how to parse each constraint into these components.\n\n   How to find the operator? The operator is one of the symbols like >, <, =, etc. So for each constraint, we can look for the first occurrence of one of these operators, and split the string into left and right parts.\n\n   For example, in the constraint '-___>__', the operator is '>', and the left part is '___', the right part is '__'.\n\n   But the constraint may have other characters, like the first sample's condition is '-___>__.' â€” the '.' at the end is probably a terminator. So we can ignore any characters after the operator and underscores.\n\n   So for parsing each constraint:\n\n   - Remove any non-alphanumeric characters except the underscores and the operator.\n\n   Or perhaps, for each constraint, we can process it by finding the operator, then the underscores before and after.\n\n   For example, take the constraint '-___>__.'.\n\n   We can split it into parts by finding the operator. The operator is the first occurrence of >, <, or =. Let's say that the operator is the first occurrence of any of these symbols.\n\n   Once found, the left part is the underscores before the operator, and the right part is the underscores after.\n\n   For example, in '-___>__.', the operator is '>', the left part is '___', the right part is '__'.\n\n   But how to handle cases where the operator is not in the middle? Like if there are other characters.\n\n   But according to the samples, the constraints seem to be structured with underscores before and after the operator, and possibly a '.' at the end.\n\n   So for each constraint, we can:\n\n   - Remove any non-underscore and non-operator characters (like the '.' and possibly the '-').\n\n   Wait, but the sample's first condition has a '-' before the underscores. For example, '-___>__.' â€” the '-' is part of the constraint?\n\n   Or perhaps the '-' is part of the operator? No, the operator is one of >, <, etc. So the '-' is part of the left part? Or is it a typo?\n\n   This is confusing. Let's look at the first sample's condition again: '-___>__.'.\n\n   If the operator is '>', then the left part is '-___' and the right part is '__'. But that would not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the '-' is part of the left side's underscores. But underscores are only underscores. So perhaps the '-' is a mistake, or perhaps the constraints are written in a way that the left and right parts are the underscores, and any other characters are ignored.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the '-' is part of the operator. But that doesn't fit with the sample. For example, if the operator is '-', then the constraint is comparing the underscores before and after. But that would be a different scenario.\n\n   This is very confusing. Let's try to think of the sample's condition again. The first sample's output is 0010, which is four variables. The condition is '-___>__.' â€” perhaps the '-' is not part of the underscores but part of the operator. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the '-' is part of the left part's underscores, but that would mean that the underscores include other characters. But the problem says that variables are digits 0-9, and the jaws part consists of underscores and operators.\n\n   Maybe the '-' in the condition is a typo, and the actual condition is '___>__.' â€” three underscores before '>' and two after. Which would mean var[3] > var[2]. Which fits the sample's output.\n\n   But how to parse this? It seems that the constraints may have leading or trailing characters that are not underscores or operators. For example, the first sample's condition starts with a '-', which may be a typo or perhaps part of the parsing logic.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the entire condition is a Prolog-style predicate, and the '-' is part of the syntax. For example, in Prolog, the head of a rule is followed by :-, which separates the head from the body. So in the sample input, the part after the colon is the body of the rule, which contains the conditions.\n\n   So the first sample's conditions part is '-___>__.' â€” perhaps the '-' is part of a comparison operator. But I'm not sure.\n\n   This seems too ambiguous. Given that the problem says that the input is valid, and that the sample outputs are correct, perhaps I should focus on the parsing of the conditions part based on the sample.\n\n   Let's take the first sample's condition: '-___>__.' \n\n   Assuming that the condition is that the third variable is greater than the second. Then the underscores before '>' are three, after are two. So the '-' is not part of the underscores. So perhaps the '-' is a typo or part of the parsing that I'm not considering.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the '-' is a placeholder for an operator. For example, in the jaws part, the '-' is an operator, and in the conditions part, the '-' is part of the operator. But this is unclear.\n\n   Given that I'm stuck on parsing the conditions, perhaps I should proceed with the following assumptions:\n\n   - The number of variables is determined by the number of operators in the jaws part plus one.\n\n   - To find the number of operators in the jaws part, we can count the number of characters that are operators (e.g., +, -, *, /, etc.) in the jaws part.\n\n   Then, for the conditions part:\n\n   - Split the conditions part into individual constraints by commas.\n\n   - For each constraint, strip any leading/trailing characters (like '.'), and then find the operator and the number of underscores before and after.\n\n   For example, in the first sample's condition '-___>__.' â€” stripping the '.' gives '-___>__', then the operator is '>', and the underscores before are three, after are two. The '-' is part of the underscores? Or not?\n\n   Wait, but underscores are only underscores. So the '-' is not an underscore. This suggests that perhaps the '-' is a typo, or perhaps the parsing is different.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the '-' is part of the operator. But the operator is '>'. So this is unclear.\n\n   Another idea: perhaps the conditions part is a series of comparisons between variables, where each comparison is of the form \"var_i op var_j\", and the way to find i and j is by counting the number of underscores before and after the operator.\n\n   For example, in the first sample's condition '-___>__.' â€” assuming that the '-' is not part of the underscores, but is a typo or part of the parsing. If we ignore the '-', then the underscores before '>' are three, and after are two. So var_3 > var_2.\n\n   So, for parsing the conditions, we can process each constraint by:\n\n   - Removing all non-underscore and non-operator characters (like '-', '.', etc.)\n\n   - Then, find the operator, split into left and right parts, count the underscores.\n\n   But how to find the operator? For example, in the string '___>__', the operator is '>'.\n\n   So for each constraint string, we can iterate through the characters and find the first occurrence of an operator (like >, <, =, etc.).\n\n   Once found, split the string into left and right parts. The left part is the underscores before the operator, the right part is the underscores after.\n\n   For example, in the string '___>__', the operator is '>', left part is '___', right is '__'.\n\n   Now, the problem is that the constraint may contain other characters. For example, in the sample's first condition '-___>__.' â€” the '-' is not part of the underscores. So perhaps the '-' is a mistake, or perhaps it's part of the operator.\n\n   Alternatively, perhaps the '-' is part of the left side's underscores. But underscores are only underscores. So this is confusing.\n\n   Given that this is a programming competition problem, perhaps the constraints are formatted in a specific way. Looking at the sample inputs:\n\n   First sample's conditions part is ':-___>__.' â€” after splitting on the colon, the part is '-___>__.' (assuming that the colon is the separator). The first character is '-', which is not an underscore. So this suggests that the parsing is more complex.\n\n   Maybe the conditions part is a list of Prolog-style goals. For example, the first sample's conditions part is '-___>__.' which could be a goal like 'something > something else'.\n\n   But without more information, it's hard to proceed.\n\n   Given that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another way. Let's think about the problem as follows:\n\n   The number of variables is determined by the number of operators in the jaws part plus 1. Once that's determined, the constraints are a list of comparisons between variables, and the task is to find the lex smallest sequence of digits satisfying all constraints.\n\n   So, assuming that the number of variables is known, the main problem is to parse the constraints and generate the lex smallest sequence.\n\n   For the constraints parsing, perhaps the following approach can be used:\n\n   For each constraint in the conditions part:\n\n   - Remove any characters that are not underscores or operators. For example, in '-___>__.', remove the '-' and '.' to get '___>__'.\n\n   - Then, find the operator (the first occurrence of >, <, =, etc.) in the remaining string.\n\n   - Split the string into left and right parts based on the operator.\n\n   - Count the number of underscores in the left part (this is the first variable index) and in the right part (second variable index).\n\n   For example, for '___>__', the left part is '___' (3 underscores), right is '__' (2 underscores). So the constraint is var[3] > var[2].\n\n   This seems plausible.\n\n   So, the steps to parse the constraints are:\n\n   For each constraint string:\n\n   1. Remove all characters except underscores and operators (like >, <, =).\n\n   2. Find the operator (the first occurrence of >, <, or =).\n\n   3. Split into left and",
