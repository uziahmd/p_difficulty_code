And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Each week is defined as k consecutive days. For each of these weeks, we calculate the sum of the sleep times and then find the average of all those sums. The output needs to be precise with at least six decimal digits.\n\nSo the input gives n and k, followed by a list of n integers. The output is the average of all the possible consecutive k-day periods.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to compute the sum for each window of size k and then take the average of those sums. However, if n is up to 2e5, then a naive approach that checks each window by adding up k elements each time would be O(n*k), which would be 4e10 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a more efficient method.\n\nAh right, the sliding window technique. We can compute the sum of the first window in O(k) time, and then each subsequent window can be computed in O(1) time by subtracting the element that's left behind and adding the new element that comes in. This way, the total time complexity is O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Add this sum to a total sum variable.\n3. Then, for each next window (from position 1 to n - k), subtract the element that's no longer in the window (a[i-1]) and add the new element (a[i + k - 1]). Add this to the total.\n4. Once all windows are processed, divide the total by the number of windows (which is n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nBut wait, what about the data types? The numbers can be up to 1e5, and multiplied by up to 2e5 elements, so the sum could be up to 1e5 * 2e5 = 2e10. Which fits into Python's integers, so no problem there. But when we divide, we need to handle floating points accurately.\n\nNow, how to implement this?\n\nLet's outline the steps in code:\n\nRead n and k. Then read the list of a's.\n\nCompute the initial window sum. Then iterate through the list, updating the sum for each window.\n\nBut let's think about the number of windows. For example, if n=3 and k=2, there are 2 windows. So the number of windows is (n - k + 1). So for each i from 0 to (n -k) ?\n\nWait, the initial window is from index 0 to k-1. Then next is 1 to k, etc. So for each window starting at index i (0-based), where i ranges from 0 to (n -k).\n\nSo the total number of windows is (n -k +1).\n\nSo the steps:\n\nInitialize current_sum as sum(a[0..k-1]).\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nThen for each i in 1 to (n -k):\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\nadd this to total_sum.\n\nOnce all done, average is total_sum / (number_of_windows).\n\nBut wait, the initial sum is added once. Then for each of the (n -k) other windows, we add their sum. So the total number of additions is (n -k +1) ?\n\nYes. Because the initial sum is the first window. Then for each of the next (n -k) windows, we add each sum. So total_sum is the sum of all window sums.\n\nThen the average is total_sum divided by (number_of_windows) which is (n -k +1).\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, code-wise:\n\nIn Python, reading the input. For multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the example input:\n\nWait the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, the input given is:\n\nThe first line is ['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWait, but the problem says that the input is given as per the standard input. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake here. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k. The second line contains n integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are three test cases. So perhaps the original problem is expecting multiple test cases, but the problem statement may have been miswritten. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user provided an example where the input is given as multiple lines, but perhaps that's just for the example. Let me check the original problem statement again.\n\nWait, the original problem's input is:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105). The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\nSo each test case is two lines. The sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the actual problem is that the code needs to process multiple test cases. Wait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as per one test case. However, looking at the sample input given by the user, it's three separate test cases. For example, the first input is '3 2\\n3 4 7', which would be n=3, k=2, and the array [3,4,7]. The output is '9.0000000000' which is (3+4 + 4+7)/2 = (7 + 11)/2 = 18/2 =9. Correct.\n\nBut how does that fit with the problem's input description? Maybe the user made a mistake in the sample input. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the user is providing multiple test cases, but the original problem expects only one. Wait, looking back at the problem statement, the original problem says that the input is for one test case. However, in the sample input given here, there are three test cases. So perhaps the user made a mistake here, but perhaps the actual problem requires handling multiple test cases. But the original problem's input is for one test case. So perhaps the user's sample input is not properly formatted. But the problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the user has given multiple test cases in the sample input. However, the original problem might be expecting a single test case. But the code needs to process multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement again, the sample input shows three different inputs and outputs. But the problem says that the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. But perhaps the actual problem is that the code needs to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user's sample input is a list of test cases. For example, the first input line is '3 2\\n3 4 7', then '1 1\\n10', then '8 2\\n...'.\n\nBut how can that be? Because in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the user's sample input is a list of test cases, each with their own input. So the code needs to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original input is not clear. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of three test cases. The sample output is three lines. So perhaps the actual problem requires processing multiple test cases. However, the original problem statement's input description says that the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains the array. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how do we know how many test cases there are? Because the problem's original input description doesn't mention that. But looking at the sample input, perhaps the code is supposed to read all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut the user's sample input shows that each test case is given as two lines. So the code must read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. So for example, the first test case is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSecond test case is:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nThird test case is:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nSo the code must read all test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut how to read them? In Python, reading from stdin can be done by reading all lines at once, then processing them in pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the problem description, and the actual problem is to process multiple test cases. However, the original problem statement may not mention that. But given the sample input and output, perhaps that's the case.\n\nBut the problem says, \"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo perhaps the original problem is that the code must handle multiple test cases, but the problem statement's input is not properly described. However, given the sample input and output, it's necessary to process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how can we know? Let's check the sample input and output again.\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nSo each input line is a separate test case. So the code must read multiple test cases. However, the original problem statement's input description says that the first line contains n and k, and the second line contains the array. So perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the problem description, and the actual problem expects multiple test cases. But since the sample input includes multiple test cases, the code must handle that.\n\nSo, the code needs to process multiple test cases. How to do that in Python?\n\nWell, the standard way is to read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of two lines (each test case is two lines), and process each group.\n\nBut how to read the input correctly? For example, in some cases, the input may be provided with multiple lines. So in Python, the code can read all lines, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the original problem is from Codeforces or similar, and the actual problem has multiple test cases. However, the problem's original description may not mention that. But given the sample input and output, we can assume that.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. Let me recheck the original problem statement.\n\nOriginal problem statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105). The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\nSo the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input provided by the user seems to have multiple test cases. That's confusing.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. For example, perhaps the sample input is not part of the problem, but the user is trying to show multiple examples. However, the problem says that the code should read from standard input, so perhaps the actual problem expects multiple test cases. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code should handle one test case. However, the sample output shows three outputs. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps the user is mistaken, and the problem is to process a single test case. Let me look at the sample input again.\n\nThe first sample input is '3 2\\n3 4 7' which would be n=3, k=2. The output is 9.0000000000. Which is correct as explained before.\n\nThe second sample input is '1 1\\n10' which gives output 10.0000000000. Which makes sense as there is one week (the only day), sum is 10, average is 10.\n\nThird sample input is '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'. The number of weeks is 8-2+1=7. The sum for each week is:\n\n1+2=3\n\n2+4=6\n\n4+100000=100004\n\n100000+123=100123\n\n123+456=579\n\n456+789=1245\n\n789+1=790\n\nTotal sum is 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = let's compute that.\n\nBut the sample output is 28964.2857142857. Let's see: the total sum of all weeks is 3 + 6 = 9, then 100004 + 100123 = 200127, then 579 + 1245 = 1824, plus 790. So total is 9 + 200127 = 200136 + 1824 = 201960 + 790 = 202750. Then divide by 7: 202750 / 7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample output. So the code needs to process that.\n\nBut how to read the input? If the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases, then the code needs to read all test cases. But the problem's original input description says that the input is two lines. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input, and the actual problem is to process a single test case. However, the sample input given by the user shows three test cases. So this is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's note, the third example's note says that there are 7 weeks, so the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. Which implies that the code is handling a single test case.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the sample input. Maybe the sample input is not part of the problem's actual input format. But the problem's original input is for a single test case. Therefore, the code should read two lines: first line n and k, second line the array.\n\nBut then why does the sample input show three test cases? Perhaps the user is showing three examples, each with their own input and output. So the code should process one test case, and the sample input is three separate test cases.\n\nBut the problem says that the code should read from standard input, which implies that the code should process a single test case. However, in programming contests, sometimes the code is expected to process multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem's original input is for multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says otherwise.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. But given the sample input and output, perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description may have been miswritten.\n\nBut how can we proceed? Well, the user's sample input is given as a list of test cases, and the output is a list of outputs. So the code must process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code must read all test cases from the input. How?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of two lines (each test case is two lines). For example, for each test case, read two lines: first line is n and k, second line is the array.\n\nBut how to handle that? Let's think of the input as being multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. So for example, the input could be:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nWhich would be three test cases.\n\nThus, the code should read all lines, then process them in pairs. So in Python, the code can read all lines, then loop through them two at a time.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, using sys.stdin.read().splitlines() to get all lines, then process them in pairs.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(lines):\n\n    n, k = map(int, lines[i].split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, lines[i+1].split()))\n\n    # process this test case\n\n    i += 2\n\nBut then, what if the number of lines is odd? Well, according to the problem's input description, each test case is two lines. So the input should have even number of lines. So the code can assume that.\n\nSo given that, the code can process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement may not mention that, but the sample input shows that.\n\nTherefore, proceeding under the assumption that the code must process multiple test cases, each with two lines.\n\nNow, back to solving the problem.\n\nOnce the code reads a test case, it needs to compute the average as discussed earlier.\n\nSo for each test case:\n\nCompute the number of windows: m = n -k +1.\n\nIf m is zero? Well, since k <=n, m is at least 1.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\nThen for each next window, subtract the element leaving and add the new element.\n\nSum all these window sums, then divide by m.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nBut for large n and k, the initial sum can be computed with sum(a[0:k]).\n\nBut for very large k (like 2e5), sum(a[0:k]) would take O(k) time. Which is acceptable since the total time for all test cases would be O(n) per test case.\n\nBut in Python, for a list of 2e5 elements, summing the first k elements is manageable.\n\nOnce the initial sum is computed, then the sliding window proceeds.\n\nSo code steps for each test case:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead the array a as a list of integers.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nIf m is 0, but since k <=n, m is >=1.\n\nCompute current_sum = sum(a[0:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, m):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\naverage = total_sum / m\n\nThen output average with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, for m = n -k +1. For example, when n=3, k=2, m=2. The loop runs from 1 to m-1 (since range(1, m) is 1 to 1 (if m=2), so one iteration. Which is correct.\n\nYes. For example, in the first sample input, m=2. So the loop runs once. The initial sum is 3+4=7. Then for i=1, subtract a[0] (3) and add a[1+2-1] = a[2] (7). So current_sum is 7-3+7= 11. total_sum is 7 + 11 = 18. average is 18/2 =9. Correct.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nNow, handling the output: the average needs to be printed with at least 6 decimal digits. So in Python, we can format the output with 10 decimal digits, as in the sample outputs.\n\nSo, for example, in Python:\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut in the sample outputs, the first case is 9.0000000000, which is exactly 9.0.\n\nBut how to ensure that the output is printed with exactly 10 decimal digits, even if trailing zeros?\n\nYes, using the format string with .10f will do that.\n\nBut what about the precision? Since the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-6, using floating point division and formatting with 10 decimals should be sufficient.\n\nBut in Python, when dealing with large numbers, the floating point division might have some precision issues. However, since the problem allows for a relative or absolute error up to 1e-6, using floating point division should be okay. However, for very large sums, perhaps using floating points could lose precision. But since the sum is up to 2e5 * 1e5 = 2e10, and when divided by m (up to 2e5), the average is up to 1e5. So using floating points (double) should have enough precision, since double can represent integers up to 2^53 exactly. Since 2e10 is way below that, the sum can be represented exactly as a float. However, when dividing, the average may not be an integer, but the division in Python uses floating points, which should be precise enough for the problem's requirements.\n\nSo the code should be okay.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n =k. Then m=1. The average is the sum of the entire array divided by 1. So the code would compute sum(a) / 1. Which is correct.\n\nEdge case 2: k=1. Then each window is a single element. The average is the average of all elements. Which is sum(a) / n. Because m =n -1 +1 =n. So total_sum is sum of all elements. average is sum(a)/n. Which is correct.\n\nAnother edge case: when n=1, k=1. Then average is a[0]/1 =a[0].\n\nAnother case: when the array is all 1s. For example, n=5, k=3. Then each window sum is 3, and there are 3 windows. Average is 3.0.\n\nSo the code should handle all these.\n\nNow, testing the third sample input.\n\nSample input third case:\n\nn=8, k=2.\n\narray: [1,2,4,100000,123,456,789,1]\n\nnumber of windows: 8-2+1=7.\n\nsum of all windows:\n\nwindow 1: 1+2=3\n\nwindow 2: 2+4=6\n\nwindow 3: 4+100000=100004\n\nwindow 4: 100000 + 123 = 100123\n\nwindow 5: 123 + 456 = 579\n\nwindow 6: 456 + 789 = 1245\n\nwindow 7: 789 +1 = 790\n\nsum total: 3 +6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 +790 = ?\n\nLet's calculate step by step:\n\n3 +6 =9\n\n9 + 100004 = 100013\n\n+100123 = 200136\n\n+579 = 200715\n\n+1245 = 201960 \n\n+790 = 202750.\n\nAverage is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857...\n\nWhich is what the sample output shows. So the code would compute that correctly.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead all lines from stdin.\n\nProcess each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead the array as a list of integers.\n\nCompute m =n -k +1.\n\nCompute initial sum.\n\nThen loop for m-1 times (since the first window is already added once).\n\nBut wait, the initial sum is added once. Then for each of the next m-1 windows, we add the current_sum. So the loop runs from 1 to m-1 (since m is the number of windows). For example, if m is 2, then the loop runs once (i=1).\n\nSo the code:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, m):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\naverage = total_sum / m\n\nThen print with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, for a list a, a[:k] is the first k elements.\n\nBut for large k, say 2e5, sum(a[:k]) could take O(k) time. But since for each test case, this is O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for multiple test cases, the code can handle it.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut what about the case where k is 0? No, the constraints say 1<=k<=n.\n\nSo no problem.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nTest case 1: n=3, k=2, a=[3,4,7]\n\nm=3-2+1=2.\n\ncurrent_sum = 3+4=7.\n\ntotal_sum =7.\n\nloop runs for i in 1 to 1 (range(1,2)):\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 - a[0] (3) + a[1+2-1] = a[2] (7) → 7-3+7=11.\n\ntotal_sum becomes 7+11=18.\n\naverage is 18/2=9.0 → correct.\n\nSample test case 2: n=1, k=1. a=[10]. m=1. total_sum is 10. average 10.0 → correct.\n\nThird test case:\n\nAs discussed earlier.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, when reading the input, the code must read all lines. So:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n and k\n\n        n, k = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx +=1\n\n        # process this test case\n\n        m = n -k +1\n\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\n        total_sum = current_sum\n\n        for i in range(1, m):\n\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n            total_sum += current_sum\n\n        average = total_sum / m\n\n        # print with 10 decimal digits\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut wait, in the third sample input, the output is 28964.2857142857. Let's see:\n\n202750 /7 = 28964.285714285714...\n\nWhen printed with 10 decimal digits, it would be 28964.2857142857 (the 11th digit is 1, so rounds down? Or depends on the exact value.)\n\nBut Python's formatting rounds to the nearest decimal. However, the problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error is within 1e-6. So printing with 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nBut the code uses the format string with 10 decimal digits. So that's correct.\n\nNow, testing for possible errors.\n\nWhat if the array is empty? No, since n >=1.\n\nAnother possible error: when k= n, then m=1. So the code computes sum(a) once, divides by 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: when k=1. For example, n=3, k=1. Then m=3. The sum for each window is a[0], a[1], a[2]. total_sum is sum(a). average is sum(a)/3. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, considering performance. For n=2e5, the code would process O(n) steps. The sum(a[:k]) is O(k), which is acceptable. But for multiple test cases, each with O(n) steps, it's acceptable.\n\nBut for very large k (like 2e5), sum(a[:k]) is O(2e5) steps. But that's acceptable for Python.\n\nBut what if there are multiple test cases with large n and k? For example, if there are T test cases, each with n=2e5, then the code would run in O(T * n) time, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nNow, the code is written.\n\nNow, let's check the sample outputs.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nOutput is 9.0000000000.\n\nSample code produces that.\n\nTest case 2: output is 10.0000000000.\n\nThird test case output is 28964.2857142857.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nBut in Python, when you print with .10f, how does it handle the decimal digits?\n\nFor example, in the third case, the actual value is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857142857...\n\nSo when printed with 10 decimal digits, it would be 28964.2857142857. But the sample output is 28964.2857142857. So the code's output matches.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code must be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout. Also, the code must not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\n    idx = 0\n\n    while idx < len(lines):\n\n        n, k = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n\n        idx += 1\n\n        m = n - k + 1\n\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\n        total_sum = current_sum\n\n        for i in range(1, m):\n\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n            total_sum += current_sum\n\n        average = total_sum / m\n\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut in Python, when you have multiple test cases, and the code reads lines correctly. Also, note that the code uses the splitlines() function, which splits on all line breaks.\n\nBut what if the input has leading or trailing spaces? Probably not, since the problem says that the input is given correctly.\n\nBut in the code, the lines are read as per the input. So the code should work.\n\nTesting the code with the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nThe code would process these three test cases, and output the three lines as per the sample.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive k-day periods (weeks) from a given list of daily sleep times. The solution must efficiently handle large input sizes and provide precise results up to 10 decimal places.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: This technique allows us to efficiently compute the sum of each consecutive k-day period. Instead of recalculating the sum from scratch for each window, we adjust the sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first k elements to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Iterate Through Windows**: For each subsequent window, update the sum using the sliding window technique and accumulate the total sum of all window sums.\n4. **Compute Average**: Divide the total sum of all window sums by the number of windows to get the average sleep time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        n, k = map(int, lines[idx].split())\n        idx += 1\n        a = list(map(int, lines[idx].split()))\n        idx += 1\n        m = n - k + 1\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        for i in range(1, m):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        average = total_sum / m\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines for processing multiple test cases.\n2. **Sliding Window Initialization**: The initial sum of the first k elements is computed to start the sliding window.\n3. **Updating Window Sum**: For each subsequent window, the sum is updated by subtracting the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that has entered the window.\n4. **Total Sum Calculation**: The sum of all window sums is accumulated and then divided by the number of windows to get the average sleep time.\n5. **Precision Handling**: The result is formatted to ensure at least 10 decimal places, meeting the problem's precision requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures an efficient O(n) time complexity per test case, making it suitable for handling large input sizes up to the given constraints.",
