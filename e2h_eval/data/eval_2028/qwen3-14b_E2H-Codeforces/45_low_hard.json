There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a balanced bracket. But here, the structure isn't fixed. We need to arrange the matches in a way that maximizes the number of games the winner plays, under the given constraints.\n\nLet me look at the examples. For n=3, the output is 2. The winner plays two games. How does that work? Let's see: the first game is between two players, say 1 and 2. Suppose player 1 wins. Then, player 1 has played 1 game. The next game must be against player 3. Since player 3 hasn't played any games yet, the difference is 1, which is allowed. So player 1 plays two games. That's why the answer is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the answer is 2. Wait, but in a standard knockout, the winner would have to play 2 games (since 4 players, 3 games total, but the winner plays 2). However, the example says that the maximum is 2. So maybe there's a way to have more? But according to the note, in the third sample, the answer is 2. So perhaps the maximum is not always log2(n), but depends on some other structure.\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum possible number of games the winner can play, given the constraints on how matches are arranged.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say the winner plays k games. Each time they play a game, they must have a new opponent. Let's consider the structure of the tournament for the winner.\n\nEach time the winner plays a game, their opponent must have a number of games played that's either equal to the winner's current count or one less. Because when the winner plays their first game, they have 0 games, so the opponent must also have 0. Then after the first game, the winner has 1 game. The next opponent can have 0 or 1 games. But for the maximum number of games, perhaps we want to arrange that each time the winner plays, their opponent has as many games as possible, allowing the winner to play more games.\n\nWait, maybe the problem relates to Fibonacci numbers. Because, for the winner to play k games, the number of players required would be something like the (k+1)th Fibonacci number. Let me think.\n\nLet me think about the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games. Let's denote f(k) as the minimal number of players needed so that the winner can play k games. Then, for the winner to play k games, he must have played k-1 games before the final one. So for each step, the opponent in the ith game must have a certain number of games.\n\nAlternatively, think of the process as building a tree. Each time the winner plays a game, they have to have an opponent. Let's think of the winner's path. For the first game, the opponent must have 0 games. So the opponent is someone who has only played 0 games. For the second game, the opponent can have 0 or 1 games. But to maximize the number of games, perhaps the opponent must have 1 game. But how?\n\nWait, here's an idea. To have the winner play as many games as possible, each time they play a game, their opponent must have played as many games as possible. Let's model this.\n\nLet's suppose that the winner plays k games. Let's think about how many players are needed. For the first game, the winner has 0 games, so the opponent must have 0 games. So that's 2 players. Now, for the second game, the winner has 1 game. The opponent must have either 0 or 1 games. To maximize the number of games, we want the opponent to have 1 game. How can that happen? That opponent must have played one game before facing the winner. So that requires that the opponent had a previous match. So for the second game, the opponent must have come from a subtree where they played 1 game. So the total players required for the winner to play 2 games would be 2 + 1 (the opponent's subtree). Wait, perhaps this is leading to a Fibonacci sequence.\n\nLet me think recursively. Let f(k) be the minimum number of players required for the winner to play k games. Then:\n\nFor the winner to play k games, he must have played k-1 games before.",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given a specific rule that two players can only compete if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one. This problem can be efficiently solved using a recursive approach based on Fibonacci numbers.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Constraints**: The key constraint is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they have already played differs by at most one. This implies that the tournament structure must be arranged in such a way that the winner can face opponents with the maximum number of prior games possible.\n2. **Recursive Insight**: The minimum number of players required for the winner to play `k` games follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each game the winner plays requires an opponent who has played a certain number of games, which in turn requires additional players.\n3. **Fibonacci Sequence**: Using the Fibonacci sequence, we can determine the maximum number of games the winner can play by finding the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the given number of players `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef max_games(n):\n    # Precompute Fibonacci numbers until we exceed n\n    fib = [0, 1]\n    while fib[-1] < n:\n        fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])\n    \n    # Find the largest Fibonacci number <= n\n    k = 0\n    while fib[k] <= n:\n        k += 1\n    k -= 1\n    \n    # The answer is the index of that Fibonacci number minus 1\n    return k - 1\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    print(max_games(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**: We generate Fibonacci numbers until we exceed the given number of players `n`. This helps us determine the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n2. **Finding the Largest Fibonacci Number**: By iterating through the generated Fibonacci sequence, we find the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to `n`.\n3. **Result Calculation**: The index of this Fibonacci number (adjusted by subtracting 1) gives the maximum number of games the winner can play, as each Fibonacci number corresponds to the minimum number of players required for the winner to play that many games.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and large input sizes up to $10^{18}$ by leveraging the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, ensuring optimal performance.",
