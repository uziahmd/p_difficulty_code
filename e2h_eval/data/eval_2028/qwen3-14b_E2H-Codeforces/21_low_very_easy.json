The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, it needs a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, it needs a key with even b_j. \n\nRight. So the problem reduces to counting how many chests are even and how many are odd. Then, we need to match them with the available keys of opposite parity. \n\nWait, but the keys also have their own parities. Let me think. Let's split the chests into two groups: even_chests and odd_chests. Similarly, split the keys into even_keys and odd_keys. \n\nFor example, each even chest (a_i even) needs an odd key. Each odd chest (a_i odd) needs an even key. \n\nSo the maximum possible chests opened would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nYes! Because for each even chest, we can use an odd key. But if there are more even chests than odd keys, then we can only use as many as the number of odd keys. Similarly for the other case.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nThat makes sense. Let me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's check their parities:\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9, 11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Their parities: 8 even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So even_keys = 3 (8,4,20), odd_keys = 1 (7).\n\nSo min(3, 1) + min(2, 3) = 1 + 2 = 3. Which matches the first example's output of 3. Correct.\n\nSecond example input:\n\nChests: 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests =5, odd_chests=0.\n\nKeys: 5 (odd). So even_keys=0, odd_keys=1.\n\nSo min(5, 1) + min(0, 0) = 1 + 0 = 1. Which matches the second example's output.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are 20,30,40,50 (all even). So even_chests is 1, odd_keys is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. And odd_chests is 0, even_keys is 4. min(0,4) is 0. Total 0. Which matches the third example.\n\nGreat, so this logic works. So the plan is:\n\n- Count even and odd in a_i.\n- Count even and odd in b_j.\n- Compute min(even_a, odd_b) + min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nRead n and m.\n\nThen read the list of a's. Then count even_a and odd_a.\n\nThen read the list of b's. Count even_b and odd_b.\n\nThen compute the sum of min(even_a, odd_b) and min(odd_a, even_b).\n\nThat's straightforward.\n\nLet me think about edge cases. For example, when there are zero even or odd in either a or b.\n\nLike, if all chests are even, and all keys are even. Then min(even_a, odd_b) is min(even_a, 0) = 0. And min(odd_a, even_b) is min(0, ...) which is 0. So total 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: if there are more keys than needed. Like, even_a is 2, odd_b is 5. Then min(2,5) is 2. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\n",
