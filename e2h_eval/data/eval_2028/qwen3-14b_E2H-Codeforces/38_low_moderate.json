    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The problem is about finding the minimum number of nodes required to create a p-reachable directed graph, and then among those graphs, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly p-reachable means. The definition says that a directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly p ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v and u and v are reachable from each other. So for each such pair, both directions must have paths. Wait, no. Wait, reachability is mutual here. So for each ordered pair (u, v) with u < v, if they are reachable from each other, then that counts towards p. So the total count is the number of unordered pairs {u, v} where u < v and u can reach v and v can reach u. But since the problem says ordered pairs (u, v) with u < v, but in reality, for each such unordered pair, there's exactly one ordered pair (u, v) where u < v. So the p is the count of these unordered pairs.\n\nSo the first part is to find the minimal number of nodes n such that there exists a directed graph with exactly p such pairs. Then, among all such minimal n graphs, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs.\n\nNow, the unidirectional pairs are ordered pairs (u, v) where u != v, there's a path from u to v, but no path from v to u. So for each such pair, it's counted once. The question wants the maximum possible number of these pairs in the minimal n case.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. Let's start with the first part: finding the minimal n for a given p.\n\nThe key here is to find for a given p, the smallest n such that the maximum number of reachable pairs (u < v) that can be formed in a graph with n nodes is at least p. Wait, no. Because we need exactly p. But perhaps the minimal n is determined by the maximum possible number of such pairs for a certain structure.\n\nBut how to model the number of reachable pairs. For example, if the graph is a DAG with a topological order, and edges go from earlier nodes to later ones. In such a case, any two nodes u < v would have a path from u to v, but not vice versa. So the number of reachable pairs (u, v) with u < v and mutual reachability would be zero. So that's the case where p=0. So for p=0, the minimal n is 1? Because with one node, there are no pairs. But the input example shows for p=0, the output is 0 0. Wait, looking back at the sample input:\n\nIn the third example, input is 0, output is 0 0. Wait, but when p=0, the graph can have any number of nodes as long as there are zero pairs (u < v) with mutual reachability. For example, a graph with two nodes and a single edge from A to B. Then there's no mutual reachability between A and B. So for p=0, the minimal n is 1, because with one node, there are zero pairs. But according to the sample input, when the input is 0, the output is 0 0. Hmm, but wait the sample input says for input 0, output is '0 0'. But according to the problem statement, the first output is the minimum number of nodes required. So for p=0, the minimum number of nodes is 1? Or 0?\n\nWait, the problem says \"ordered pair of nodes (u, v)\" where u != v. So for a graph with 0 nodes, there are no pairs. So maybe when p=0, the minimal n is 0? But that's probably not allowed. Let me check the sample input again. For example, the third input is 0, output is 0 0. Which suggests that for p=0, the answer is 0 nodes. But how can a graph with 0 nodes have any pairs? Well, maybe the problem allows n=0. However, that seems odd. But according to the sample, when p=0, the output is 0 0. So perhaps for p=0, the minimal number of nodes is 0. But that's a corner case.\n\nBut let's proceed. The main idea is that for the minimal number of nodes, we need to find a way to arrange the graph so that exactly p pairs of nodes (u < v) are mutually reachable. How can we model this?\n\nAn approach is to consider that the maximum number of such pairs for a given n is C(n, 2), which occurs when the graph is a complete graph with all edges in both directions. Because every pair is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of nodes required to create a directed graph that is p-reachable, and then find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs in such graphs with the minimum number of nodes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Reachability**: A directed graph is p-reachable if it contains exactly `p` ordered pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v` and both nodes are mutually reachable.\n2. **Minimum Nodes Calculation**: The goal is to find the smallest number of nodes `n` such that the maximum number of mutually reachable pairs (which is `C(n, 2)`) is at least `p`. This can be found using a binary search approach.\n3. **Maximizing Unidirectional Pairs**: Once the minimum number of nodes `n` is determined, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs can be calculated based on the structure of the graph. This involves considering the number of ways to form unidirectional pairs within the constraints of the graph's reachability.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    p = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    if p == 0:\n        print(\"0 0\")\n        return\n\n    # Find the minimal n such that C(n, 2) >= p\n    # We need the smallest n where n*(n-1)//2 >= p\n    # Use binary search\n    low = 1\n    high = 2 * int(math.sqrt(p)) + 2\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if mid * (mid - 1) // 2 >= p:\n            high = mid\n        else:\n            low = mid + 1\n    n = low\n\n    # Now, find the maximum number of unidirectional pairs for this n\n    # The total number of unordered pairs is C(n, 2)\n    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2\n    # The number of mutual pairs is p\n    # The remaining pairs are unidirectional\n    # But how to maximize them?\n    # The maximum number of unidirectional pairs occurs when the mutual pairs are minimized\n    # However, the mutual pairs are fixed as p.\n    # The unidirectional pairs are (total_pairs - mutual_pairs) * 2 - something?\n\n    # Wait, each unordered pair {u, v} can be either:\n    # - mutual (both directions have paths)\n    # - unidirectional (only one direction has path)\n    # So for each unordered pair, if it's not mutual, it contributes 1 unidirectional pair (either (u,v) or (v,u), but not both)\n    # So the total number of unidirectional pairs is (total_pairs - p) * 1 * 2? No, because for each unordered pair, there is exactly one ordered pair (u,v) with u < v. If they are not mutual, then either (u,v) is unidirectional or (v,u) is, but since u < v, only (u,v) is considered. So actually, the number of unidirectional ordered pairs is (total_pairs - p) * 1, because for each of these pairs, exactly one of (u,v) or (v,u) is present, but only one of them is counted as unidirectional.\n\n    # Wait, the unidirectional pairs are ordered pairs (u, v) where u != v, there is a path from u to v, but no path from v to u. So for each unordered pair {u, v}, exactly one of (u, v) or (v, u) can be unidirectional, or neither if they are not reachable in either direction.\n\n    # However, in our case, the graph must have exactly p mutual pairs. For all other pairs, they are not mutual. So for each such pair, we can arrange the edges such that exactly one direction is present, making it unidirectional. Thus, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (total_pairs - p) * 1 * 2? No, wait:\n\n    # For each unordered pair {u, v} that is not mutual, there is exactly one ordered pair (u, v) or (v, u) that is unidirectional. But since the problem counts ordered pairs where u < v, we need to count how many of these (u, v) with u < v are unidirectional.\n\n    # Let me think: the total number of ordered pairs (u, v) with u != v is n*(n-1). Each unordered pair {u, v} contributes two ordered pairs: (u, v) and (v, u). But in our problem, for the mutual pairs, both (u, v) and (v, u) are present. For non-mutual pairs, exactly one of (u, v) or (v, u) is present, but not both.\n\n    # However, the problem counts only the ordered pairs (u, v) where u < v. For each such pair, if they are not mutual, then exactly one of (u, v) or (v, u) is present. But since u < v, if (u, v) is present and (v, u) is not, then (u, v) is a unidirectional pair. Similarly, if (v, u) is present and (u, v) is not, then (v, u) is a unidirectional pair, but since v > u, this would be counted as (v, u) with v > u, which is not part of the u < v condition. Therefore, for the purpose of counting unidirectional pairs where u < v, each non-mutual pair {u, v} contributes exactly one unidirectional pair if we arrange the edges so that the direction is from the smaller index to the larger index. Hence, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (total_pairs - p).\n\n    # Wait, the total number of unordered pairs is total_pairs = C(n, 2). For each of these, if they are not mutual, we can arrange the graph to have exactly one unidirectional ordered pair (u, v) where u < v. Therefore, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (total_pairs - p).\n\n    # However, the sample input for p=3 gives output 3 0. Let's check that case.\n\n    # For n=3, total_pairs = 3. p=3. So (total_pairs - p) = 0. Which matches the sample. So yes, this formula is correct.\n\n    # Therefore, the maximum number of unidirectional pairs is (total_pairs - p).\n\n    # But wait, in the sample input where p=4, the output is 5 6.
