            "content": "The following is a competitive programming problem.\n\n# Tokitsukaze and Mahjong\n\nTokitsukaze is playing a game derivated from Japanese mahjong. In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where Tokitsukaze has three tiles and wants to know the minimum number of extra tiles she needs to draw to form a mentsu, which is either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The input is three tiles. We need to check if they already form a mentsu. If not, determine the minimum number of tiles to add so that after adding, there's at least one mentsu.\n\nBut wait, when she draws tiles, she can add any number of tiles. So the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles needed to make a mentsu, considering all possibilities.\n\nLet me break it down. For each possible way to form a mentsu (either triplet or sequence), calculate how many tiles are needed. Then take the minimum among all these possibilities.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Check if the current three tiles already form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0.\n2. If not, find the minimal number of tiles to add to form a mentsu.\n\nBut how do I check for possible mentsu after adding some tiles?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nFor a triplet (koutsu): All three tiles must be the same. So if the current three are already a triplet, then 0. Otherwise, how many tiles to add to get a triplet?\n\nWait, the current three tiles may not be a triplet. For example, if there are two same tiles and one different. Then adding one more tile of the same as the two would make a triplet. So in that case, the required is 1. But if the three are all different, then you need to add two tiles of the same as one of them, or maybe another approach?\n\nWait, no. For example, suppose the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 3m. Then, to form a triplet, you can add two more 1m's, but that would require two tiles. But maybe there's a better way. However, the problem says that the minimal number of tiles. So for the triplet case, the minimal number of tiles to add depends on the counts of each tile.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is to consider all possibilities of forming a triplet or sequence, and compute the required tiles for each possibility, then take the minimum.\n\nSo for triplet possibilities: For each possible tile type (like 1m, 2p, etc.), check how many of that tile are present in the initial three. Then, the number of tiles needed to make a triplet is 3 - count. For example, if there are two 1m's, then adding one more gives a triplet. But if there are zero, then adding three.\n\nBut since we can choose any tile, perhaps the minimal number for triplet is min(3 - count for each tile type in the initial three). Wait, but maybe there's a better way. For example, if the initial three have two different tiles, like 1m, 1m, 2m. Then, the minimal is 1 (adding one 1m) to make triplet. But if the initial three have all different, then the minimal is 2 (add two of the same as one of them). So for triplet possibilities, the minimal required tiles would be 3 - max_count, where max_count is the maximum count of any tile in the initial three.\n\nWait, for example, if the initial three have counts like [2,1,0], then the max count is 2. So 3-2=1. Which is correct.\n\nBut for the case where all three are different, the max count is 1. So 3-1=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo for triplet possibilities, the minimal number of tiles needed is 3 - max_count. But wait, what if there's a way to get a triplet by adding tiles of a different type? For example, if the initial three are 1m, 2m, 3m. Then, to form a triplet, you can add two more 1m's (total of 3 tiles, but that would require 2 added). Or, you could add three 4m's, which would require 3. So the minimal is 2. So the approach of taking the max count is correct here.\n\nSo for triplet possibilities, the minimal required tiles is 3 - max_count.\n\nBut for the sequence (shuntsu) possibilities, it's more complicated.\n\nSo for sequences, the three tiles need to form a consecutive sequence in the same suit. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. But the initial three may not form such a sequence. How can we find the minimal tiles to add to form a sequence?\n\nBut the initial three tiles could be part of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of extra tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a valid mentsu (either a triplet or a sequence) in her hand. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Existing Mentsu**: First, check if the current three tiles already form a valid mentsu (triplet or sequence). If they do, the answer is 0.\n2. **Triplet Possibility**: Calculate the minimum number of tiles needed to form a triplet. This is determined by finding the maximum count of any single tile type and calculating how many more tiles are needed to complete a triplet.\n3. **Sequence Possibility**: For each possible suit, check if the three tiles can be part of a sequence.
