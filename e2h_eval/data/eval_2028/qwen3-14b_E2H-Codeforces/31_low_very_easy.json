Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the total sum of all cards (found plus the new ones) equals zero. The existing found cards have a sum, and we need to make up the difference with new cards. But each new card can be any integer between -x and x, inclusive. And we need the minimal number of cards to reach the sum zero.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call that sum S. Then, the required sum from the new cards is -S. Because adding the new cards' sum to S should give zero.\n\nBut how do we find the minimal number of cards needed to get that required sum?\n\nLet me think. Let's say the required sum is T = -S. So we need to find the minimal number of cards whose sum is T, where each card is between -x and x.\n\nBut what's the minimal number of cards needed to reach T?\n\nWell, each card can contribute at most x (if positive) or -x (if negative). So, for example, if T is positive, then the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). Wait, but maybe not exactly. Let's think:\n\nSuppose T is positive. Then, each card can contribute up to x. So the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of T divided by x. For example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then 5/2 is 2.5, so we need 3 cards. Because two cards can contribute 2+2=4, and then one more card of 1. But wait, the maximum per card is 2. So 2+2+1 is allowed? Wait, but each card can be any value between -x and x. So for example, if T is 5, and x is 2, then the maximum per card is 2. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(5 / 2) = 3. Because 2*2=4, and then 1 more. But how can you get 5 with three cards? Like 2 + 2 + 1 =5. But each card can be as high as 2. So yes. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x).\n\nBut wait, what if T is negative? Then, the same logic applies. For example, T is -5, x is 2. Then the minimal number is ceil(5 / 2) = 3 cards. Because each card can contribute up to -2. So three cards of -2, -2, -1 sum to -5. But wait, the sum is -5. So the absolute value is 5. So the minimal number is ceil( |T| / x ). Because whether T is positive or negative, the minimal number of cards is determined by the absolute value of T divided by x, rounded up.\n\nSo the answer is ceil( |T| / x ), but only if T is not zero. If T is zero, then no cards are needed.\n\nWait, but what if T is zero? Then the sum is already zero. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum of the found cards, S.\n\n2. Compute T = -S. That's the sum needed from the new cards.\n\n3. If T is zero, return 0.\n\n4. Otherwise, compute the minimal number of cards needed to reach T, which is ceil( |T| / x )\n\nBut wait, let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 2, cards are -1, 1, 2. Sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. So |T| is 2. Divided by x (2) gives 1. So ceil(2/2) is 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond example input: 2 3, cards are -2, -2. Sum is -4. T is 4. |T| is 4. x is 3. 4/3 is 1.333..., ceil is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother test case: suppose T is 5, x is 3. Then 5/3 is 1.666, ceil is 2. So two cards: 3 + 2 =5. So yes.\n\nAnother case: T is 3, x is 3. Then 3/3 is 1. So one card. Correct.\n\nWhat about T is 0? Then zero cards.\n\nSo that seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what if T is 1, x is 1. Then 1/1 is 1, so one card. Correct.\n\nAnother case: T is 2, x is",
