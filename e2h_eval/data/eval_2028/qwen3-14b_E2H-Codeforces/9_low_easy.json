Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So the task is to find the maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm, right.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to approach this. Since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe there's a way to optimize based on that. Because for knapsack problems with large n and m, the standard DP approach (O(nm)) would be too slow. But since the weights are small, perhaps we can find a way to handle each weight group separately.\n\nLet me think. For each weight category (1, 2, 3), we can sort the items in descending order of cost. Then, for each weight, we can precompute the prefix sums. That way, for any number of items taken from that weight group, we can quickly calculate their total cost.\n\nBut how do we combine these groups optimally? For example, if we take x items of weight 1, y items of weight 2, and z items of weight 3, such that total weight x*1 + y*2 + z*3 <= m. We need to maximize the sum of their costs.\n\nThe challenge is to find the optimal combination of x, y, z.\n\nBut considering that the total weight is up to 3e5, and the number of items for each weight group could be up to 1e5, perhaps we can iterate through possible numbers of one of the groups and compute the best for the others.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Separate the souvenirs into three groups based on their weight (w=1, 2, 3).\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost. Then compute the prefix sums for each group.\n3. For each possible number of items taken from the weight 3 group (z), and for each possible number of items taken from the weight 2 group (y), compute how many items of weight 1 can be taken (x) given the remaining weight. But this might be O(n^2), which isn't feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can iterate over one of the groups and use the other groups' prefix sums to compute the best possible combination.\n\nLet me think: Let's say we fix the number of weight 3 items (z). Then, the remaining weight is m - 3*z. For that remaining weight, we can take some combination of weight 1 and 2 items. How do we find the best combination for that?\n\nFor the remaining weight, say rem = m - 3*z. Then, for the weight 1 and 2 items, we can find the maximum value by considering all possible numbers of weight 2 items (y), and then taking as many weight 1 items as possible. However, even this approach might be O(n^2) if we have to check for all possible z and y.\n\nBut perhaps we can find an efficient way to compute for each possible rem (after considering weight 3 items), the maximum value from weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nAnother idea: for each possible number of weight 3 items (z), we can compute the maximum possible value from weight 1 and 2 items with the remaining weight. How to compute that part efficiently?\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 items, the problem becomes similar to the classic unbounded knapsack but with items of weight 1 and 2. However, since the items are sorted, perhaps we can find the optimal selection quickly.\n\nWait, but for weight 1 and 2 items, we can consider that for a given capacity rem, the optimal is to take as many of the highest value items as possible. But since the items are sorted, perhaps we can precompute for each possible capacity up to m, the maximum value for combining weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nBut how to do that? Let's think again.\n\nSuppose we have two arrays: for weight 1, sorted in descending order, with prefix sums s1. For weight 2, sorted in descending order, with prefix sums s2.\n\nFor a given rem, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible y (number of weight 2 items taken) where 2*y <= rem. Then, the remaining weight is rem - 2*y, which can be filled with x = (rem - 2*y) weight 1 items. So for each y, we can take min(y_max, len(s2)) items of weight 2, and then take min( (rem - 2*y), len(s1) ) items of weight 1.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all possible rem?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible rem, we can iterate through all possible y (number of",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to maximize the total cost of souvenirs Petya can carry given a weight limit. Each souvenir has a weight of either 1, 2, or 3, and we can leverage the limited range of weights to optimize our approach.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy Overview:\n\n1. **Grouping by Weight**: We'll group all items by their weight (1, 2, or 3), sort each group in descending order of cost, and compute prefix sums for each group. This allows us to quickly calculate the maximum value obtainable from a certain number of items in each weight group.\n\n2. **Iterate Over Weight 3 Items**: Since the weight is 3, we can try taking up to `m // 3` such items. For each possible number of weight 3 items taken, we compute the remaining weight capacity and then find the best combination of weight 1 and 2 items that fit into this remaining capacity.\n\n3. **Optimize Weight 1 and 2 Items**: For the remaining capacity after accounting for weight 3 items, we use a two-pointer technique to find the optimal number of weight 1 and 2 items. We iterate through the number of weight 2 items and calculate how many weight 1 items can be added without exceeding the remaining capacity.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation with Prefix Sums**: Using prefix sums for weight 1 and weight 2 items, we can quickly compute the total cost for any number of items taken from those groups.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\n- **Prefix Sums**: We precompute prefix sums for each weight group to allow O(1) access to the total cost of the first `k` items in each group.\n- **Two-Pointer Technique**: When handling combinations of weight 1 and 2 items, we iterate over the number of weight 2 items, and for each, we compute the maximum number of weight 1 items that can fit in the remaining capacity.\n- **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where no items can be selected due to weight constraints.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    idx = 0\n    n = int(data[idx])\n    m = int(data[idx+1])\n    idx += 2\n    \n    w1 = []\n    w2 = []\n    w3 = []\n    \n    for _ in range(n):\n        wi = int(data[idx])\n        ci = int(data[idx+1])\n        idx += 2\n        if wi == 1:\n            w1.append(ci)\n        elif wi == 2:\n            w2.append(ci)\n        else:\n            w3.append(ci)\n    \n    # Sort and compute prefix sums\n    w1.sort(reverse=True)\n    w2.sort(reverse=True)\n    w3.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Compute prefix sums\n    s1 = [0]\n    for c in w1:\n        s1.append(s1[-1] + c)\n    \n    s2 = [0]\n    for c in w2:\n        s2.append(s2[-1] + c)\n    \n    s3 = [0]\n    for c in w3:\n        s3.append(s3[-1] + c)\n    \n    max_total = 0\n    len1 = len(w1)\n    len2 = len(w2)\n    len3 = len(w3)\n    \n    # Try all possible counts of weight 3 items\n    max_z = min(len3, m // 3)\n    for z in range(0, max_z + 1):\n        weight_used = 3 * z\n        rem = m - weight_used\n        if rem < 0:\n            continue\n        \n        # Now find best for weight 1 and 2 with rem capacity\n        # Use two pointers approach\n        i = 0\n        j = len2\n        best = 0\n        \n        while i <= len1 and j >= 0:\n            curr_weight = i * 1 + j * 2\n            if curr_weight <= rem:\n                best = max(best, s1[i] + s2[j])\n                i += 1\n            else:\n                j -= 1\n        \n        total = s3[z] + best\n        max_total = max(max_total, total)\n    \n    print(max_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Time Complexity Analysis:\n\n- Sorting: O(n log n)\n- Prefix sum computation: O(n)\n- Main loop over weight 3 items: O(m/3) = O(1e5)\n- Two-pointer technique within the main loop: O(len1 + len2) per iteration → overall O(n)\n\nThis ensures the solution is efficient even for the upper limits of input size.",
