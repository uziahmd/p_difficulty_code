The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on $$$n$$$. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.A permutation of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$ is a sequence of $$$n$$$ integers, where each integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ appears exactly once. For example, $$$[2,3,1,4]$$$ is a permutation of $$$1, 2, 3, 4$$$, but $$$[1,4,2,2]$$$ isn't because $$$2$$$ appears twice in it.Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ is the number of pairs of indices $$$(i, j)$$$ such that $$$i < j$$$ and $$$a_i > a_j$$$.Let $$$p$$$ and $$$q$$$ be two permutations of $$$1, 2, \\ldots, n$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of permutation pairs (p, q) such that p is lex smaller than q and the number of inversions in p is greater than that in q. And all this modulo a given mod. The constraints are up to n=500, which is quite big. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. For each pair of permutations (p, q), if p < q lex order, and inv(p) > inv(q), then count it. But since there are n! permutations, the total number of possible pairs is O((n!)^2), which is way too big for n=500. So brute force is impossible. Need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think about the properties here. The key is to find for all pairs of permutations (p, q) where p < q, and inv(p) > inv(q). How can I compute this efficiently?\n\nFirst, note that the total number of unordered pairs of distinct permutations is (n! * (n! - 1))/2. But since we need ordered pairs where p < q lex, perhaps the total number of such pairs is (n! * (n! - 1))/2. Because for any two distinct permutations, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the number of pairs where p < q is exactly half of the total number of distinct pairs. However, when considering the problem, we need to count among these pairs those that also satisfy inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut how to compute this? Let's denote that for all pairs (p, q) with p != q, exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of pairs where p < q is (total_permutations choose 2) = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. Now, the problem asks for the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q).\n\nBut maybe there's some symmetry here. Suppose for all pairs of distinct permutations (p, q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(q) > inv(p) holds (if they are equal, then neither). But how often do inv(p) equal inv(q)?\n\nBut even if that's not the case, perhaps for all pairs (p, q) where p < q, the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(q) > inv(p), plus the number of pairs where inv(p) = inv(q) divided by something. Wait, but this depends on whether there's any symmetry between p and q. However, since the lex order is not directly related to inversion counts, this might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs - same_inversion_pairs)/2, where same_inversion_pairs is the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). Because for all pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) ≠ inv(q), exactly one of inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(q) > inv(p) holds. So if I can compute the total number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q), then subtract that from the total number of p < q pairs, then divide by 2, that would give the answer.\n\nSo the formula would be:\n\nanswer = [ (total_pairs) - same_inversion_count ] / 2 \n\nBut wait, because total_pairs is the number of pairs where p < q. And for each pair where p < q and inv(p) != inv(q), exactly one of the two possibilities holds. So the number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs - same_inversion_count) / 2. That makes sense. Because for each pair (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) != inv(q), either inv(p) > inv(q) or inv(q) > inv(p). But since p and q are arbitrary, but in the total_pairs we are considering only p < q, then the number of such pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to the number of pairs where inv(q) > inv(p) in the other direction. But since we are considering all pairs (p, q) where p < q, and for each pair (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) > inv(q), there's a corresponding pair (q, p) where q < p and inv(q) < inv(p). But since in our total_pairs we are only counting p < q, the total number of pairs where inv(p) > inv(q) is equal to (total_pairs - same_inversion_count) / 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute total_pairs = (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2\n\nCompute same_inversion_count: the number of pairs (p, q) with p < q and inv(p) = inv(q)\n\nThen answer = (total_pairs - same_inversion_count) // 2 mod mod\n\nBut wait, how to compute same_inversion_count?\n\nThe same_inversion_count is the sum over all k of (c_k choose 2), where c_k is the number of permutations with exactly k inversions. Because for each k, the number of pairs of permutations with the same number of inversions is (c_k choose 2). However, among these pairs, exactly half of them will have p < q and the other half will have q < p. Except when p = q, but since we are considering pairs with p != q, the (c_k choose 2) counts all unordered pairs. So the same_inversion_count is sum_{k} (c_k choose 2) / 2 ?\n\nWait no. Because for each unordered pair {p, q} with p != q and inv(p) = inv(q), exactly one of p < q or q < p holds. So the total number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q) is equal to sum_{k} (c_k choose 2) / 2. Because for each unordered pair {p, q}, exactly one of the two ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is counted in the same_inversion_count.\n\nWait, no. The same_inversion_count is the number of ordered pairs (p, q) where p < q and inv(p) = inv(q). So for each unordered pair {p, q} where p != q and inv(p) = inv(q), exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in the same_inversion_count. So the same_inversion_count is equal to sum_{k} (c_k choose 2) * 1 / 2 * 2? No, wait. The total number of unordered pairs is sum (c_k choose 2), and each of these corresponds to exactly one ordered pair (p, q) where p < q. Therefore, same_inversion_count is exactly sum (c_k choose 2).\n\nWait no. Because for each unordered pair {p, q} with p != q and same inv count, exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in the set of p < q. So the same_inversion_count is equal to the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with p != q and same inv count, multiplied by 1. Because for each such unordered pair, exactly one of the ordered pairs (p, q) or (q, p) is counted in the same_inversion_count. Therefore, same_inversion_count = sum (c_k choose 2) for all k. Because the number of unordered pairs is sum (c_k choose 2), and each contributes exactly once to same_inversion_count.\n\nWait, no. Suppose that for a particular k, there are c_k permutations. Then the number of unordered pairs {p, q} with p != q and same inversion count is (c_k choose 2). Each of these pairs contributes exactly one to same_inversion_count, because exactly one of (p, q) or (q, p) is in the p < q set. Therefore, same_inversion_count is equal to sum (c_k choose 2) for all k.\n\nYes. So the same_inversion_count is sum_{k} (c_k choose 2), where c_k is the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\n(total_pairs - same_inversion_count) / 2 \n\nBut total_pairs is (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2. So substituting:\n\nanswer = [ ( (n! * (n! - 1)) / 2 ) - same_inversion_count ] / 2 \n\nWhich simplifies to (n! * (n! - 1) - 2 * same_inversion_count ) / 4 \n\nBut since we are dealing with integers, this division must be exact.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nSo the problem now becomes:\n\nCompute:\n\nans = [ (fact * (fact - 1) // 2) - same ] // 2 \n\nwhere fact = n! and same is sum (c_k choose 2) for all k.\n\nBut how to compute c_k for all k?\n\nFor n up to 500, the maximum number of inversions is n*(n-1)/2, which for n=500 is 500*499/2 = 124750. So for n=500, the number of possible inversion counts is up to 124750. So we need to compute the number of permutations for each inversion count k.\n\nBut how to compute the inversion counts for permutations of size n?\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem. Let me think about the recurrence for the number of permutations of size n with exactly k inversions.\n\nLet dp[n][k] be the number of permutations of n elements with exactly k inversions.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n\ndp[n][k] = sum_{i=0}^{min(n-1, k)} dp[n-1][k - i]\n\nBecause when inserting the nth element into a permutation of n-1 elements, inserting it at position j (counting from the end) adds j inversions. Wait, more accurately, inserting the new element (which is the largest element) into a permutation of size n-1. For example, inserting the new element (say, n) into position i (0-based from the left) would add i inversions. Because the new element is larger than all existing elements, so inserting it at position i (so that there are i elements after it) would contribute i inversions. Wait, no. If inserting into position i (from the left), then there are i elements before it, and (n-1 - i) elements after it. But since the new element is the largest, inserting it at position i would create (n-1 - i) inversions. Because all the elements after it are smaller than it. So for each insertion position, the number of inversions added is (n-1 - i) where i ranges from 0 to n-1. Wait, perhaps I should think of inserting the nth element into a permutation of n-1 elements. Let me think of building the permutation incrementally.\n\nFor example, when adding the nth element (which is the largest element in the permutation), inserting it into position i (so that there are i elements before it and (n-1 - i) elements after it). Since the new element is larger than all others, inserting it at position i adds (n-1 - i) inversions. Because each of the (n-1 - i) elements after it will form an inversion with it. So for each permutation of n-1 elements with k' inversions, inserting the new element in a position that adds t inversions gives a permutation of n elements with k' + t inversions. The possible values of t are 0, 1, ..., n-1. So for each possible t, the number of ways to insert is 1. So the recurrence is:\n\ndp[n][k] = sum_{t=0}^{n-1} dp[n-1][k - t], where k - t >= 0.\n\nBut for each n, the maximum possible inversion count is (n-1)*n/2. So for dp[n][k], the maximum k is (n-1)*n/2.\n\nThis recurrence can be used to compute dp[n][k] for all n up to 500 and k up to 500*499/2 = 124750.\n\nBut for n=500, the maximum k is 124750. So for each n, we need to compute dp[n][k] for all k up to that maximum. But with n up to 500, and k up to ~1e5, the DP table would be O(n^3) time? Because for each n and k, we need to sum up to n terms. For n=500, that would be O(500^3) operations. Let's compute 500^3 is 125,000,000. Which is manageable? Well, Python is not the fastest, but with optimizations, perhaps it can be done.\n\nBut wait, for each n, the maximum k increases by n-1. So for each step, the size of the dp array increases. Let's think about the steps:\n\nInitialize dp[0][0] = 1? Well, for n=0, perhaps not. For n=1, the number of inversions is 0. So dp[1][0] = 1.\n\nThen for n=2, dp[2][k] can be computed as follows:\n\nFor k=0: inserting into position 1 (t=0), so dp[1][0] = 1. So dp[2][0] = 1.\n\nFor k=1: inserting into position 0 (t=1), so dp[1][0] = 1. So dp[2][1] = 1.\n\nSo dp[2][0] = 1, dp[2][1] = 1.\n\nFor n=3:\n\nEach entry dp[3][k] is sum_{t=0}^2 dp[2][k - t], for k >= t.\n\nBut for k=0: t can be 0, so sum dp[2][0] = 1 → dp[3][0] = 1.\n\nk=1: t can be 0 or 1. dp[2][1] + dp[2][0] → 1+1=2.\n\nk=2: t=0 (dp[2][2] which is 0?), t=1 (dp[2][1] =1), t=2 (dp[2][0]=1). Sum is 0 + 1 + 1 = 2?\n\nWait, but for n=2, the max inversion is 1. So dp[2][2] is zero. So yes.\n\nk=2: sum for t=0,1,2. But k-t must be >=0. So for k=2, t can be 0,1,2. For t=0: k-t=2 → dp[2][2] =0. For t=1: k-t=1 → dp[2][1] =1. For t=2: k-t=0 → dp[2][0] =1. Sum is 0+1+1=2. So dp[3][2] = 2.\n\nSimilarly for k=3: t can be 0,1,2. For t=0: k-t=3 → dp[2][3] is 0. For t=1: 3-1=2 → dp[2][2] is 0. For t=2: 3-2=1 → dp[2][1] =1. Sum is 1. So dp[3][3] =1.\n\nSo for n=3, the inversion counts are:\n\n0 → 1, 1 → 2, 2 → 2, 3 →1.\n\nWhich matches the known values. For example, the permutations of 3 elements have inversion counts:\n\n[1,2,3] → 0\n\n[1,3,2] → 1\n\n[2,1,3] → 1\n\n[2,3,1] → 2\n\n[3,1,2] → 2\n\n[3,2,1] → 3.\n\nYes, that's 1, 2, 2, 1 → sum of counts for 0,1,2,3 is 1, 2, 2, 1. So the DP works.\n\nSo the recurrence is correct.\n\nNow, how to compute this efficiently in Python.\n\nThe problem is for n up to 500, and for each n, the maximum inversion count is up to 500*499/2 = 124750. So for each n, we can compute the dp[n][k] for k up to that maximum.\n\nBut for n=500, the maximum k is 124750, and for each n, we need to compute dp[n][k] for all k up to that value.\n\nThe initial approach would be to use a 2D array, where dp[n][k] is stored. But since n can be up to 500 and k up to 124750, the total storage is 500 * 124750 ≈ 62 million entries. However, in Python, using a list of lists may be memory intensive. But perhaps with some optimizations, it's manageable.\n\nAlternatively, since each dp[n] depends only on dp[n-1], we can use a 1D array and update it in a rolling manner.\n\nLet me think. For each n, we can compute dp[n] based on dp[n-1]. So for each n, we can have a current array (for n) and previous array (for n-1). For example, for each step, we can have a current array (curr) which is built from the previous array (prev).\n\nThe initial prev array for n=1 is [1] (since for k=0, there's 1 permutation, and for higher k, 0).\n\nFor each n from 2 to N:\n\ncurr is initialized as an array of zeros with length (max_k for n). For each possible inversion count k in curr, curr[k] = sum_{t=0}^{n-1} prev[k - t], provided that k - t >= 0.\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently?\n\nIf we do it naively, for each k in curr, we iterate t from 0 to min(n-1, k), and sum prev[k - t]. But for n up to 500 and k up to 124750, this would be O(n * max_k) per n. For n=500, max_k is 124750, so total time would be O(500 * 124750 * 500) = O(500^3 * 124750 / 500) ??? Wait, no. Let me re-calculate:\n\nFor each n (up to 500), for each k (up to (n)(n-1)/2), and for each t (up to n-1). So per n, the time complexity is O(k_max * n). For n=500, k_max is about 124750. So total time is O(500 * 124750 * 500) = 500^2 * 124750 = 250,000 * 124,750 ≈ 3.1e10 operations. That's way too slow for Python.\n\nThis is not feasible. So we need a better approach to compute the sum for each k.\n\nWait, but the sum for curr[k] is the sum of prev[k - t] for t from 0 to min(n-1, k). Which is equivalent to the sum of prev[j] where j ranges from k - (n-1) to k, but j must be >=0. So for each k, curr[k] = sum_{j = max(0, k - (n-1))}^{k} prev[j}.\n\nWait, but t can be from 0 to n-1. So when you insert the new element, you can add t inversions, where t ranges from 0 to n-1. So for a given k, the possible previous inversion counts are k - t, where t is between 0 and n-1. So k - t ranges from k - (n-1) to k. But k - t must be >=0. So the sum is over j = max(0, k - (n-1)) to k, but j can't exceed the previous maximum inversion count (which for n-1 is (n-1)(n-2)/2). However, for the current n, the k can be up to (n)(n-1)/2. So for each k, the sum is the sum of prev[j] where j is in [k - (n-1), k], but j can't be negative.\n\nThis looks like a sliding window sum. So for each n, we can compute the curr array using a sliding window approach, which allows us to compute each curr[k] in O(1) time, given that we have the previous array.\n\nYes! Because the sum for curr[k] is the sum of prev[k - t] for t from 0 to n-1. Which is the same as sum_{j = k - (n-1)}^{k} prev[j], where j >=0.\n\nSo for each n, we can precompute the prefix sums of the previous array, and then compute the sum for each k as the difference between prefix_sum[k] and prefix_sum[max(0, k - n)].\n\nWait, but the previous array for n-1 has maximum inversion count (n-1)(n-2)/2. So for a given k in the current n, the maximum possible j is k (but for j to be in the previous array, j can't exceed the previous maximum). So when computing curr[k], the j's range is from max(0, k - (n-1)) to min(k, previous_max). But how to handle that?\n\nBut for the DP, when building curr for n, the maximum possible k is (n)(n-1)/2. For each k in this range, the sum is over the previous array's values for j in [k - (n-1), k], but j can't be less than 0 or more than the previous_max.\n\nBut perhaps during the DP process, for each n, we can build the curr array with the correct size and use the prefix sums to compute the required sums quickly.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nInitialize for n=1, the inversion counts are [1] (only 0 inversions).\n\nFor each n from 2 to N:\n\n   prev = dp[n-1]\n\n   max_prev_k = (n-1)*(n-2)//2\n\n   curr_max_k = n*(n-1)//2\n\n   curr is initialized as a list of zeros of size curr_max_k + 1\n\n   compute prefix_sums for prev, where prefix_sums[i] is the sum of prev[0..i-1]\n\n   then for each k in 0 ... curr_max_k:\n\n       lower = max(0, k - (n-1))\n\n       upper = k\n\n       if upper > max_prev_k:\n\n           upper = max_prev_k\n\n       if lower > upper:\n\n           sum_val = 0\n\n       else:\n\n           sum_val = prefix_sums[upper + 1] - prefix_sums[lower]\n\n       curr[k] = sum_val\n\n   set dp[n] = curr\n\nBut how to compute prefix_sums?\n\nThe prefix_sums array for prev would be of size len(prev) + 1, where prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = prev[0], prefix_sums[2] = prev[0] + prev[1], etc. So for any range [a, b], the sum is prefix_sums[b+1] - prefix_sums[a].\n\nBut for the prev array, which has length max_prev_k + 1 (since indices 0 to max_prev_k), the prefix_sums array would be of length max_prev_k + 2.\n\nSo for each n, the steps are:\n\n- Compute the prefix_sums of the previous array.\n\n- For each k in 0 to curr_max_k:\n\n   compute the lower and upper bounds for j in the previous array.\n\n   sum the values in prev from lower to upper.\n\nBut how to handle when upper exceeds the max_prev_k? For example, when k is large enough that upper (which is k) exceeds the max_prev_k (which is (n-1)(n-2)/2). In that case, upper is clamped to max_prev_k.\n\nBut since for the current n, the maximum k is n*(n-1)/2. For example, when n=2, max_prev_k is (1*0)/2 = 0. For k=1 (curr_max_k is 1), upper is 1, which is larger than max_prev_k (0). So we clamp upper to 0. Then lower is k - (n-1) = 1 -1=0. So sum from 0 to 0, which is prev[0] = 1. Which is correct for dp[2][1] = 1.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nNow, the question is: how to compute the prefix_sums for each step. For each n, the previous array (prev) is of size (n-1)(n-2)/2 + 1. So for n=500, the previous array for n=499 is of size (499*498)/2 + 1 ≈ 124,251 + 1. So the prefix_sums array for that would be of size 124,252.\n\nBut for each n, the curr array is of size (n*(n-1))/2 + 1. For n=500, that's 124750 + 1 = 124751 elements.\n\nSo with this approach, the time complexity for each n is O(curr_max_k), which is O(n^2). Because for each n, curr_max_k is O(n^2). So overall time complexity is O(N^3), where N is 500. Which would be O(500^3) = 125,000,000 operations. That's acceptable for Python, perhaps?\n\nWell, let's see. For each n from 2 to 500:\n\n   curr_max_k = O(n²). So for each n, the loop runs O(n²) times. And for each iteration, the calculation is O(1) with prefix sums. So total steps are sum_{n=1}^N (n²) = O(N^3). For N=500, that's 500^3 = 125 million steps. Which in Python may be tight but manageable with optimizations.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nWe can represent the dp arrays as lists of integers. For each n, we'll compute the current dp array based on the previous one.\n\nNow, let's think about the initial conditions. For n=1, the only permutation has 0 inversions. So dp[1] = [1].\n\nFor n=2, dp[2] is [1, 1], since for k=0 and 1.\n\nBut let's code this step by step.\n\nNow, once we have the dp table computed for all n up to the input n, we can compute the c_k values for that n. For example, for the input n, we have dp[n][k] for all k. Then, same_inversion_count is sum_{k} (c_k choose 2), where c_k = dp[n][k].\n\nOnce we have same_inversion_count, then compute the answer as:\n\nfact = factorial(n)\n\ntotal_pairs = fact * (fact - 1) // 2\n\nans = (total_pairs - same_inversion_count) // 2 \n\nBut since mod is given, and the answer needs to be modulo mod, we need to compute this value modulo mod.\n\nBut how to handle large numbers? Because for n=500, fact is 500! which is astronomically large. But since we are working modulo mod, which may not be prime, and since we need to compute (total_pairs - same_inversion_count) // 2 mod mod, we need to find a way to compute this without dealing with huge numbers.\n\nWait, but the problem is that when we compute fact = n! and compute total_pairs = fact * (fact - 1) // 2, this is a very big number. However, since mod can be up to 1e9, and for n up to 500, n! can be up to 500! which is way bigger than 1e9, but we need to compute (total_pairs - same_inversion_count) // 2 mod mod. How can we compute this?\n\nBut here's the problem: the numbers involved in total_pairs and same_inversion_count can be extremely large, but we need to compute their difference, then divide by 2, then take mod mod. However, since mod may not be a prime, we cannot directly compute modular inverses. However, since the division by 2 is an integer division, we can compute it as follows:\n\nLet me denote A = total_pairs - same_inversion_count. We know that A must be even, because the answer is (A)/2. So we can compute A mod (2 * mod), then divide by 2, then take mod mod again.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause if A is even, then A = 2 * K. So K mod mod = (A / 2) mod mod.\n\nBut how to compute A mod (2 * mod), then divide by 2?\n\nBut how to compute A mod (2 * mod) when A is (total_pairs - same_inversion_count)?\n\nBecause total_pairs is (fact * (fact - 1)) // 2. But fact is n!.\n\nBut for n up to 500, n! can be computed modulo (2 * mod) if needed. But since mod can be up to 1e9, 2 * mod can be up to 2e9, which is manageable for Python's integers.\n\nWait, but how to compute fact mod (2 * mod) ?\n\nYes. Because for the purpose of calculating (total_pairs - same_inversion_count) mod (2 * mod), we can compute fact mod (2 * mod), then compute (fact * (fact - 1) // 2) mod (2 * mod).\n\nBut how to compute (fact * (fact - 1) // 2) mod (2 * mod) ?\n\nLet me think. Let me denote fact as F. Then total_pairs = F * (F - 1) // 2. So:\n\ntotal_pairs mod (2 * mod) can be computed as ((F mod (2 * mod)) * ((F - 1) mod (2 * mod))) // 2 mod (2 * mod). But division by 2 is possible only if the product F*(F-1) is even, which it is, since F and F-1 are consecutive integers. So their product is even, so dividing by 2 gives an integer.\n\nSo for this part, we can compute F mod (2 * mod), then compute F * (F - 1) mod (2 * mod * 2), then divide by 2, then mod 2 * mod again. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think:\n\nLet me compute F mod (2 * mod) as f. Then F = a * (2 * mod) + f.\n\nThen F * (F - 1) = (a * (2 * mod) + f) * (a * (2 * mod) + f - 1) = ... which mod 2 * mod is equal to f * (f - 1) mod 2 * mod.\n\nSo F * (F - 1) mod (2 * mod) is equal to (f * (f - 1)) mod (2 * mod). Then dividing by 2 gives us (total_pairs) mod (2 * mod) ?\n\nWait, no. Because total_pairs = (F * (F - 1)) // 2. So:\n\nF * (F - 1) = 2 * total_pairs. So mod 2 * mod:\n\nF * (F - 1) mod (2 * mod) = 2 * total_pairs mod (2 * mod).\n\nSo 2 * total_pairs mod (2 * mod) is equal to (F * (F - 1) mod (2 * mod)).\n\nThus, 2 * total_pairs ≡ (F * (F - 1) mod (2 * mod)) mod (2 * mod).\n\nTherefore, total_pairs mod (2 * mod) is equal to ((F * (F - 1) mod (2 * mod)) ) // 2 mod (2 * mod).\n\nBut since F * (F - 1) is even, (F * (F - 1) mod (2 * mod)) is even, so division by 2 is integer.\n\nSo the steps to compute total_pairs mod (2 * mod) are:\n\nCompute f = fact mod (2 * mod)\n\nproduct = (f * (f - 1)) % (2 * mod)\n\ntotal_pairs_mod = (product // 2) % (2 * mod)\n\nThen, same_inversion_count is sum (c_k choose 2) for all k. But same_inversion_count can be very large as well, but since we need to compute (total_pairs - same_inversion_count) mod (2 * mod), we can compute same_inversion_count mod (2 * mod) as well.\n\nBut how to compute same_inversion_count mod (2 * mod)? Because same_inversion_count is sum_{k} (c_k * (c_k - 1) // 2). So for each k, compute c_k * (c_k - 1) // 2 mod (2 * mod), then sum all of them mod (2 * mod).\n\nBut again, since c_k can be very large, but we have already computed them as integers (since n is up to 500, and the maximum c_k for n=500 is 500! which is way too big for Python to store as integers? Wait, no. For n=500, the dp[n][k] is the number of permutations with k inversions. But for n=500, the number of permutations is 500! which is a huge number, but for each k, the dp[n][k] can be up to 500! (when k is the maximum inversion count). However, in Python, integers can be arbitrarily large. So for n=500, the dp table would require storing numbers up to 500! which is a very big number, but Python can handle it. However, for n=500, the maximum k is 124750, and for each k, the dp[n][k] can be up to 500! which is a number with thousands of digits. This would be computationally expensive in terms of memory and time.\n\nWait, but for n=500, the dp[n][k] values are going to be huge. For example, for n=500, the number of permutations with exactly k inversions is a huge number, and storing them as integers would take a lot of memory and processing time. For example, even for n=10, the number of permutations is 3,628,800, and the dp table for n=10 would have entries up to 45 inversions, and each entry could be up to 3.6 million.\n\nBut for n=500, the numbers are way too big. So this approach is not feasible for n=500. Because even for n=20, the numbers become too big to handle with standard integer types, and for n=500, it's impossible.\n\nSo this suggests that the initial approach is not feasible for n=500. Therefore, I need a different approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the same_inversion_count is sum_{k} (c_k choose 2) = (sum c_k^2 - sum c_k) / 2. Because sum (c_k choose 2) = sum (c_k^2 - c_k)/2 = [sum c_k^2 - sum c_k ] / 2. And sum c_k is n! because each permutation has exactly one inversion count.\n\nSo same_inversion_count = (sum c_k^2 - n! ) / 2.\n\nSo the problem becomes: compute sum c_k^2, then compute same_inversion_count = (sum_c_sq - fact) // 2.\n\nBut then, the answer formula is:\n\nans = (total_pairs - same_inversion_count) // 2 \n\nWhich is:\n\nans = [ (fact*(fact-1)//2 ) - (sum_c_sq - fact)/2 ] / 2 \n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me compute:\n\ntotal_pairs - same_inversion_count = [ fact*(fact-1)/2 ] - [ (sum_c_sq - fact)/2 ]",
