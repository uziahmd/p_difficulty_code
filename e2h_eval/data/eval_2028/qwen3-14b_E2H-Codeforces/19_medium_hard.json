The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is that the tree structure is given. Since the districts form a tree (exactly one path between any two), removing some districts will split the tree into parts. But the president wants the remaining districts to be connected. So the problem reduces to choosing a connected subtree with (n - k) nodes, such that the sum of 2^i for those nodes is as large as possible. Then, we need to find which nodes to remove (the ones not in this subtree).\n\nBut how do we choose this subtree? Since the sum is maximized by keeping the nodes with the highest possible values. However, because the tree structure requires that the subtree is connected, we can't just take the top (n -k) nodes by value. For example, if the highest nodes are spread out in the tree, we need to find a way to include as many high-value nodes as possible while keeping the subtree connected.\n\nWait, but each node's value is 2^i. Since i ranges from 1 to n, the value increases exponentially with i. So the highest values are in the higher-numbered nodes. So our goal is to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree.\n\nSo maybe the optimal approach is to select a subtree that includes the largest possible nodes, and then remove the smallest ones. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider that the optimal subtree must include the node with the highest number, since otherwise, we could include it and remove another node. Because 2^highest is bigger than any sum of lower nodes. Wait, but maybe not. Suppose the highest node is isolated. But since the tree is connected, there's a path to other nodes. But in order to have a connected subtree, we need to include the highest node and some other nodes connected to it.\n\nSo the idea is that the optimal subtree will contain the node with the highest number, and then as many as possible of the next highest nodes, but connected to it. So perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to select a subtree that includes the largest possible nodes, and then find which nodes to remove.\n\nBut how to find that subtree?\n\nAnother approach: since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest possible nodes, we can think of the problem as selecting a subtree that contains as many of the largest nodes as possible. However, since the subtree must be connected, we need to find a way to include those nodes.\n\nLet me think about the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a problem where we want to keep (n -k) nodes, and the ones to keep must form a connected subtree. To maximize the sum, we need to keep the nodes with the largest possible values. But how to select them?\n\nThis sounds similar to a problem where we need to select a subtree with certain size and maximum sum. Since the tree is connected, and the sum is determined by the nodes included.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to include?\n\nAn alternative idea: since the value of each node is 2^i, which increases exponentially, the optimal strategy is to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. However, this may not be possible. For example, if the largest (n -k) nodes are not connected. So we need to find the subset of nodes with the largest possible values, but connected.\n\nBut how can we find that subset?\n\nMaybe we can think of it as a priority-based selection. We can start by including the node with the highest value (n), and then greedily add the next highest nodes that are connected to the existing subtree. However, this seems like a greedy approach that might not work. For example, if adding a lower node allows us to include more higher nodes later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to find the minimal set of nodes to remove, which are the smallest ones, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected. However, this also isn't straightforward.\n\nWait, but since the sum is maximized by keeping the largest nodes, perhaps the optimal solution is to keep all nodes except the smallest k ones, but only if those nodes can be removed without disconnecting the tree. But that's not necessarily true. For example, if the smallest nodes are spread out in the tree, removing them might disconnect the tree.\n\nSo, the challenge is to find which nodes to remove (the ones with the smallest values) such that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. How?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of pruning the tree. We need to remove exactly k nodes, and the remaining nodes must be connected. To maximize the sum, we want to remove the nodes with the smallest values. But how to ensure that the remaining nodes form a connected component.\n\nSo here's an idea: the optimal solution is to keep the nodes with the largest (n -k) values, but we need to make sure that they form a connected subtree. If they do, then we can remove the rest. But if they don't, we need to adjust.\n\nBut how to check if the largest (n -k) nodes are connected?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can perform a process where we start with the largest node and then keep adding nodes in order of their value, ensuring that the subtree remains connected. But this sounds like a BFS or DFS approach.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a tree where we include the largest nodes first, and then for each node, we include it if it's connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAnother thought: the problem is similar to finding a subtree with exactly (n -k) nodes, which has the maximum possible sum. Since the sum is the sum of 2^i, which is equivalent to the sum of the nodes' values. Since 2^i increases exponentially, the maximum sum is achieved by keeping the largest (n -k) nodes, but only if they form a connected subtree. However, if they don't, we need to find the next best option.\n\nBut how can we ensure that the largest (n -k) nodes form a connected subtree?\n\nWell, maybe the largest (n -k) nodes form a connected subtree. For example, if the tree is a straight line, and the largest nodes are at the end. But in general, it's not guaranteed.\n\nSo perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nWe need to select a subtree of size m = n -k. The subtree must be connected. The sum of the nodes is maximized when we select the m nodes with the highest values. However, if these nodes are not connected, we need to find the subset of nodes with the highest values that are connected.\n\nBut how to find that subset?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be approached with a priority queue. Let's think of the nodes sorted in descending order. We can start with the highest node and then add nodes that are connected to the existing subtree. But how?\n\nAlternatively, we can think of this as a problem of building a tree by selecting nodes in order of their value, and ensuring connectivity.\n\nHere's an idea inspired by Krusky's algorithm or Prim's algorithm:\n\n- Sort all nodes in descending order of their value (so node n, n-1, ..., 1).\n\n- Start with the highest node. Then, for each subsequent node, if it is connected to the current subtree, add it. Otherwise, skip it. Continue until we have m nodes.\n\nBut how to check if a node is connected to the current subtree? Because the tree is connected, but the nodes may not be connected in the current selection.\n\nWait, but the original tree is connected. So, for the nodes that we want to select, the problem is to find a connected subset that includes as many of the higher-value nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to efficiently find which nodes to include?\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as selecting which nodes to keep. The nodes to keep must form a connected component. Since we want the sum to be as large as possible, we need to include as many high-value nodes as possible. So perhaps we can model this as a problem where we need to keep the highest-value nodes, but remove the lowest ones, but ensuring that the kept nodes are connected.\n\nTo do this, we can think of the problem as a reverse process. We start with the entire tree and remove the nodes with the smallest values, but in a way that the remaining tree is connected.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. The process of removing nodes while keeping the tree connected. For example, if we have to remove k nodes, we can iteratively remove the node with the smallest value that is a leaf in the current tree. Because if we remove a leaf, the rest of the tree remains connected.\n\nThis seems promising. Because the idea is that in order to remove nodes while keeping the tree connected, we can remove leaves (nodes with degree 1) in the current tree. And since we want to remove the nodes with the smallest values, we can prioritize removing leaves with the smallest values first.\n\nBut how does this work?\n\nLet me think of the example given:\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nn=6, k=3. So we need to remove 3 nodes. The nodes to keep are 3 (since 6-3=3). The maximum sum is achieved by keeping nodes 2,5,6. But according to the sample output, the nodes removed are 1,3,4. Which are the ones not kept.\n\nBut how would the process of removing leaves work here?\n\nInitially, the tree is connected. Let's imagine that we have to remove 3 nodes. Let's think of the nodes in terms of their values. The nodes are 1 (2^1=2), 2 (2^2=4), 3 (8), 4 (16), 5 (32), 6 (64). Wait, no. Wait, the value is 2^i. So node 1's value is 2^1=2, node 2 is 4, node 3 is 8, node 4 is 16, node 5 is 32, node 6 is 64. So the largest values are 6,5,4,3,2,1. So we want to keep the largest 3 nodes (6,5,4?), but the sample says that the kept nodes are 2,5,6. Wait, that sum is 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. But 6+5+4 would be 64 + 32 + 16 = 112. So why isn't that the case?\n\nAh, because those nodes may not be connected. Let me check the sample input. The first input is:\n\nThe tree edges are:\n\n2 1\n\n2 6\n\n4 2\n\n5 6\n\n2 3\n\nSo the tree structure is:\n\nNode 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. Node 6 is connected to 2 and 5. So the tree looks like:\n\nLet me draw it:\n\n- Node 2 is central. It's connected to 1, 3, 4, 6.\n\n- Node 6 is connected to 5.\n\nSo the nodes 6,5,4,3, etc. are connected via node 2. So if we want to keep 6,5,4, then they are connected via node 2. But node 2 is not part of that set. Wait, but the kept nodes must form a connected subtree. So if we keep 6,5,4, then they are connected via 6-2-4, but node 2 is not kept. So that's not connected. Therefore, you can't have 6,5,4 as kept nodes unless node 2 is also kept. But then the total kept nodes would be 4, which is more than n-k=3. So the sample shows that the correct kept nodes are 2,5,6. Which is connected through node 2. So the sum is 4 + 32 + 64 = 100. Whereas if you kept 2,5,6 and 4, that would be 4 nodes, but n-k is 3. So that's not allowed.\n\nSo the problem is that the largest nodes may not be connected unless some lower nodes are included. Hence, the approach of removing the smallest nodes in a way that keeps the tree connected is necessary.\n\nSo back to the idea of removing leaves with the smallest values. Let's think of the process as follows:\n\nWe need to remove k nodes. Each time, we remove a leaf node (in the current tree) with the smallest value. This ensures that the remaining tree is connected, and that we are removing the nodes with the least contribution to the sum.\n\nThis seems like a viable approach. Let's see how this would work in the first sample.\n\nSample input 1: n=6, k=3. The nodes to remove are 3, then 1, then 4?\n\nLet me think. Let's simulate this process.\n\nInitially, the tree is connected. We need to remove 3 nodes. Let's find the leaves in the tree. Leaves are nodes with degree 1. Let's look at the initial tree:\n\nThe tree structure:\n\nEach node's degree:\n\nNode 1: connected to 2. Degree 1.\n\nNode 2: connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. Degree 4.\n\nNode 3: connected to 2. Degree 1.\n\nNode 4: connected to 2. Degree 1.\n\nNode 5: connected to 6. Degree 1.\n\nNode 6: connected to 2 and 5. Degree 2.\n\nSo the initial leaves are 1, 3, 4, 5.\n\nWhich of these has the smallest value? The values are:\n\nnode 1: 2^1=2\n\nnode 3: 2^3=8\n\nnode 4: 2^4=16\n\nnode 5: 2^5=32.\n\nThe smallest is node 1. So we remove node 1. Now, the tree has nodes 2,3,4,5,6. The degrees after removal:\n\nnode 2's degree is now 3 (connected to 3,4,6).\n\nnode 3: still degree 1 (connected to 2).\n\nnode 4: degree 1 (connected to 2).\n\nnode 5: degree 1 (connected to 6).\n\nnode 6: degree 2 (connected to 2 and 5).\n\nNow, the leaves are 3,4,5. Their values are 8, 16, 32. The smallest is 3. Remove node 3. Now, the tree is nodes 2,4,5,6. The leaves are 4,5. Values 16 and 32. Remove 4 (smallest). Now, the tree has nodes 2,5,6. Which is connected. So the nodes removed are 1,3,4. Which matches the sample output. So this approach works.\n\nSo the idea is that we need to remove k leaves (each time choosing the one with the smallest value) from the current tree. The remaining nodes will form a connected subtree, and since we are removing the smallest possible values, the sum is maximized.\n\nThis seems promising. So the algorithm would be:\n\n- Build the tree as an adjacency list.\n\n- For each node, track its degree.\n\n- Use a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the leaves (degree 1 nodes) in the current tree. However, since we need to always pick the leaf with the smallest value, the priority queue should be ordered by the node's value.\n\n- While the number of nodes to remove (k) is not zero:\n\n   - Remove the leaf with the smallest value from the priority queue.\n\n   - Add it to the list of nodes to remove.\n\n   - Remove the node from the tree (i.e., decrease the degree of its neighbor).\n\n   - If the neighbor's degree becomes 1, add it to the priority queue.\n\nThis process continues until k nodes are removed.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nThe main steps are:\n\n1. Build the adjacency list.\n\n2. Initialize the priority queue (min-heap) with all the leaves (degree 1 nodes) in the initial tree.\n\n3. For each step, extract the minimum value node from the heap, add to the removal list, and then process its neighbor.\n\nBut note that when a node is removed, its neighbors' degrees decrease by one. If that makes the neighbor's degree 1, then it becomes a leaf and needs to be added to the priority queue.\n\nBut how to handle the degrees? Let's think:\n\nWe can have a degree array, where for each node, we track its current degree in the tree. Initially, the degree is computed based on the adjacency list.\n\nThe priority queue (min-heap) contains all the leaves (degree 1 nodes) in the current tree.\n\nBut the problem is that when a node is removed, we need to check its neighbors. For each neighbor, we decrease their degree by 1. If after that, their degree is 1, then they become a new leaf and should be added to the heap.\n\nBut how to manage the heap? Because the heap may contain nodes that are already removed. Wait, no. Because once a node is removed, it's no longer part of the tree. So when processing the heap, we need to check whether the node is still in the tree. But that complicates things.\n\nWait, but in the algorithm, once a node is removed, it's not part of the tree anymore. So during the process, the priority queue may contain nodes that have already been removed. How to avoid processing them?\n\nAh, that's a problem. For example, suppose a node was in the priority queue but was already removed. When we pop it from the heap, we need to check whether it's still in the tree. If not, we ignore it.\n\nSo, the algorithm needs to be modified to account for that.\n\nBut how can we do that? Because the heap can have multiple entries, but once a node is removed, it's no longer part of the tree. So when we extract a node from the heap, we need to check if it's still in the tree (i.e., if its degree is not zero). Wait, but when a node is removed, we set its degree to zero. So during the process:\n\n- The degree array is maintained. For each node, if degree is zero, it's already removed.\n\nThus, during the extraction from the heap, we check if the node's degree is 1 (it's a leaf) and not yet removed. If not, we skip it.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nInitialize the degree array as the actual degree of each node in the original tree.\n\nInitialize the min-heap with all nodes that have degree 1. However, during the process, we may have multiple entries of the same node in the heap. But that's not efficient. Wait, but in reality, once a node is processed (removed), we can't process it again. So the heap may have duplicates. However, when we extract a node, we check whether it's still a leaf (degree 1 and not removed). If not, we skip it.\n\nBut this could lead to inefficiency. However, given that n is up to 1e6, we need an efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, we can manage the heap such that each node is in the heap only once. But how?\n\nLet me think. For example, when a node is added to the heap, it's because it became a leaf. Once it's processed (removed), we don't need to process it again. So the heap can have multiple entries for the same node, but when we extract it, we check if it's still a leaf. If not, we ignore it.\n\nThis approach may have O(n log n) time complexity, which is acceptable for n up to 1e6.\n\nSo the algorithm steps would be:\n\n- Read the tree and build adjacency list.\n\n- Compute the initial degrees for each node.\n\n- Initialize a priority queue (min-heap) with all nodes that have degree 1.\n\n- Initialize a list to collect the nodes to remove.\n\n- While the number of removed nodes is less than k:\n\n   - Pop the node with the smallest value from the heap.\n\n   - If the node's degree is not 1 (meaning it's already processed or not a leaf anymore), skip it.\n\n   - Else, add it to the removal list.\n\n   - Decrement the degree of its neighbors (since this node is being removed).\n\n   - For each neighbor, if after decrementing, the degree becomes 1, add it to the heap.\n\n- Once the loop ends, output the removal list sorted in increasing order.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires that the output is the list of removed districts in increasing order. So after collecting the nodes to remove, we sort them and output.\n\nBut how to handle the case when the heap is empty before we've removed k nodes? Well, since the tree is connected and we need to remove exactly k nodes, the process should be able to find k nodes to remove. Because, for example, when you remove a node, the tree remains connected until you have removed (n-1) nodes (leaving one node). So for k < n, it's possible.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the first sample:\n\nSample input:\n\nn=6, k=3.\n\nInitial degrees:\n\nnode 1: 1\n\nnode 2: 4\n\nnode 3: 1\n\nnode 4: 1\n\nnode 5: 1\n\nnode 6: 2\n\nInitial heap contains nodes 1,3,4,5. The heap is a min-heap, so the first extracted is 1 (value 1). Add to removal list. Now, process its neighbor (node 2). Decrement degree of node 2 from 4 to 3. Since node 2's degree is now 3, not 1, nothing is added to the heap.\n\nNext, the heap has 3,4,5. The next extracted is 3 (value 3). Add to removal list. Process its neighbor (node 2). Decrement degree of node 2 to 2. Still not 1. No addition to heap.\n\nHeap now has 4,5. Extract 4 (value 4). Add to removal list. Process neighbor node 2. Decrement degree to 1. Now, node 2's degree is 1. Add it to the heap. Now, the heap has 5 and 2 (value 2 is 2^2=4, which is smaller than 5's value 32. Wait, no. Wait, the heap is ordered by the node's value. So node 2's value is 2, node 5's value is 5. Wait, the heap is a min-heap based on the node's number? Or based on the value 2^i? No. The node's value is 2^i, but the problem is that when we want to remove the node with the smallest value (i.e., the node with the smallest 2^i, which corresponds to the node with the smallest i). So, the priority queue should be ordered by the node's value, which is 2^i. However, since 2^i increases with i, the node with the smallest i has the smallest value. So, to minimize the value, we need to select the node with the smallest i. Wait, no. Wait, the node's value is 2^i. So for two nodes, say node 1 (value 2) and node 2 (value 4), the node with the smaller value is node 1. So, in order to remove the nodes with the smallest values, the priority queue should be ordered by the node's value, which is 2^i. But comparing 2^i for different nodes is equivalent to comparing their i's, since 2^i is strictly increasing with i. Therefore, the node with the smallest i has the smallest value. Thus, the priority queue can be ordered by the node's number (since node numbers are unique and 2^i increases with i).\n\nWait, this is a crucial point. Since 2^i is strictly increasing with i, the node with the smaller i has a smaller value. So when choosing which node to remove, the priority is to remove the node with the smallest i (since that gives the smallest value). Therefore, the min-heap can be ordered based on the node's number (i.e., the node's index). Because node 1 has smaller value than node 2, etc.\n\nWait, but the problem requires that the nodes to remove are those with the smallest values, which correspond to the smallest i. So, for example, in the first step, the heap contains nodes 1,3,4,5. The smallest i is 1, so that's the one to remove. Then, the next step, the heap has 3,4,5. The smallest i is 3. So that's the next to remove. Then, heap has 4,5. Remove 4. Then, node 2 becomes a leaf. So next, the heap contains 5 and 2. The smallest i is 2. So we remove node 2. But in the sample, we only needed to remove 3 nodes. So in this scenario, the algorithm would have removed 1,3,4, and then possibly others. Wait, but in the first sample, k is 3, so after removing 1,3,4, the process stops. So the algorithm works.\n\nBut what if the heap has node 2 and 5, and the next step would be to remove node 2? But in that case, the algorithm would have removed 3 nodes (1,3,4), and that's sufficient.\n\nSo the algorithm is correct. Therefore, the priority queue can be implemented as a min-heap based on the node's number (since that's equivalent to the value 2^i).\n\nSo, the key is to use a priority queue (min-heap) that holds the nodes which are leaves (degree 1) in the current tree, and each time we extract the node with the smallest number (since that's the one with the smallest value). Then, we remove it and process its neighbors.\n\nSo the steps in code would be:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nBuild the adjacency list.\n\nCompute the initial degrees for each node.\n\nInitialize the min-heap with all nodes that have degree 1.\n\nThen, for each of the k steps:\n\n   Pop the node with the smallest number from the heap.\n\n   If the node's degree is not 1, skip (it's already processed).\n\n   Add it to the removal list.\n\n   For each neighbor of the node:\n\n      If the neighbor hasn't been removed (degree > 0):\n\n         decrement its degree by 1.\n\n         if the neighbor's degree becomes 1, add it to the heap.\n\nBut how to track whether a node has been removed? Well, when a node is processed (i.e., added to the removal list), its degree is set to 0. So when we check the degree, if it's 0, then the node is already removed.\n\nWait, but the degree is modified during processing. Let me think:\n\nInitially, the degree is the actual number of edges in the tree.\n\nWhen a node is removed, we process its neighbors. For each neighbor, we decrease their degree by 1. But the node itself is no longer part of the tree, so its degree is set to 0 (or not? Maybe not. Because the degree array is used to track the current degree of the node in the current tree. Once a node is removed, it's no longer part of the tree, so its degree is 0. However, when processing the node, we check if its degree is 1. So, for example, when a node is popped from the heap, if its degree is 1, it's a valid leaf. Otherwise, it's already been processed or is not a leaf anymore.\n\nBut how to handle that. Let's think:\n\nInitially, the degree array is correctly set. For each node, when it's processed (added to the removal list), we need to mark it as removed. How?\n\nActually, the degree array is modified as follows:\n\nWhen we remove a node, we process its neighbors. For each neighbor, we decrease their degree by 1. The node being removed is no longer part of the tree. But in the code, when we pop a node from the heap, we check if its current degree is 1. If yes, then it's a valid leaf. Otherwise, it's not. For example, if the node was already processed (i.e., added to the removal list), then its degree would have been set to 0. So, when we check if the current degree is 1, it's not, and we skip processing it.\n\nBut how is the degree of the node being removed handled? Well, when the node is processed (added to the removal list), we do not modify its own degree. Because when we remove a node, we only process its neighbors. So, for example, when we remove node x, we look at all its neighbors and decrease their degrees. However, the degree of x is not modified. But since x is being removed, any future checks on its degree would find that it's not 1 (since it's already been removed). Wait, but the degree of x was initially 1 (if it was a leaf). After being removed, the degree of x is not modified. So, when it's popped from the heap, the code checks if its degree is 1. If it was a leaf, then yes, but after being removed, the code adds it to the removal list, and then processes its neighbors. But the degree of x is still 1. However, once it's removed, it's no longer part of the tree, so any further processing of x is invalid.\n\nBut how to prevent that? Because the code may have multiple entries of the same node in the heap. For example, if a node x is a leaf, added to the heap, then after being removed, the code may have another entry of x in the heap. When it's popped again, the code checks if its degree is 1. Since it's still 1, but it's already been removed, the code would process it again. Which is incorrect.\n\nAh, this is a problem. So the approach of checking the degree is not sufficient. Because once a node is removed, its degree is not modified. So even though it's already removed, the code may process it again.\n\nSo, how to avoid that?\n\nWe need a way to know if the node has already been removed. So perhaps we need a separate array (like a boolean array) to track whether the node is still present in the tree.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n- Create a boolean array 'removed' initialized to False.\n\n- When a node is processed (i.e., added to the removal list), set removed[node] = True.\n\n- When popping a node from the heap, check if it's not removed and its degree is 1. If yes, process it. Else, skip.\n\nSo, modifying the algorithm:\n\nInitialize:\n\n- degree array (initial degrees)\n\n- removed array (all False)\n\n- heap with nodes that have degree 1.\n\nFor each step:\n\n   while True:\n\n      pop node from heap.\n\n      if node is removed, continue.\n\n      if degree[node] == 1:\n\n          break\n\n      else:\n\n          continue\n\n   add node to removal list.\n\n   mark removed[node] = True.\n\n   for each neighbor in adjacency list of node:\n\n      if not removed[neighbor]:\n\n          degree[neighbor] -= 1\n\n          if degree[neighbor] == 1:\n\n              add neighbor to heap.\n\nThis way, the node is only processed once, and the heap may have multiple entries, but when popped again, it's checked against the removed array.\n\nThis approach should work.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut for n up to 1e6, using a priority queue (heapq) may be feasible, but with some care. Because heapq in Python is a min-heap, and inserting and extracting elements takes O(log n) time. However, with n up to 1e6, and each node possibly being inserted into the heap multiple times, the total time could be O(n log n), which is acceptable.\n\nBut how to handle the heap? For example, in the initial step, we have to add all the nodes with degree 1. Then, during processing, when a neighbor's degree becomes 1, we add it to the heap.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead n-1 edges. Build adjacency list as a list of lists.\n\nCompute degrees for each node.\n\nInitialize a min-heap. For each node, if degree is 1, push it into the heap.\n\nInitialize a removed array (boolean) of size n+1 (since nodes are numbered from 1 to n).\n\nInitialize the removal list.\n\nThen, for _ in range(k):\n\n   while True:\n\n      if the heap is empty: break (but this shouldn't happen)\n\n      current_node = heappop(heap)\n\n      if removed[current_node] is True: continue\n\n      if degree[current_node] == 1: break\n\n      else: continue\n\n   add current_node to removal list.\n\n   mark removed[current_node] as True.\n\n   for each neighbor in adjacency list of current_node:\n\n      if not removed[neighbor]:\n\n          degree[neighbor] -= 1\n\n          if degree[neighbor] == 1:\n\n              heappush(heap, neighbor)\n\nOnce all k nodes are removed, output the removal list sorted in increasing order.\n\nBut wait, the code may have to process multiple nodes from the heap until it finds one that is not removed and has degree 1.\n\nBut for the sample input, this works.\n\nTesting the sample input again:\n\nAfter removing node 1, the heap has 3,4,5, and node 2 is not in the heap. Then, when we process next, we pop 3 (which is not removed and has degree 1). Then, after processing, node 2's degree is 3-1=2? Wait, let me recheck:\n\nOriginal degrees:\n\nnode 1: 1, node 2:4, node 3:1, node 4:1, node 5:1, node 6:2.\n\nAfter removing node 1:\n\nneighbors of 1 is node 2. So for neighbor 2:\n\ndegree[2] was 4. Now, subtract 1 → 3. Since 3 != 1, no addition to heap.\n\nThen, the next step, the heap contains 3,4,5. When we pop 3, check if removed is False. Yes. Its degree is 1. So process. Then, for neighbor 2, degree becomes 3-1=2. Not 1, so no addition to heap. So heap now has 4,5.\n\nThen, pop 4. Check, not removed. degree is 1. Process. For neighbor 2, degree is 2-1=1. So add neighbor 2 to the heap. Now, heap has 5 and 2. Next iteration, we pop 2 (since it's the smallest number). Check if it's not removed. Yes. Check degree: 1. So process. Add to removal list. But in this case, we have already removed 3 nodes (1,3,4) and k is 3, so the loop would stop here.\n\nWait, but in the first sample, the correct answer is to remove 1,3,4. So the code would have processed three nodes, and that's correct.\n\nBut in this case, the code would have processed 1,3,4. So the code would stop after three steps. So the code works.\n\nAnother example: if after removing 1,3,4, the code would have processed three nodes. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, considering edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=2, k=1. The tree is 1-2. The initial degrees are 1 and 1. The heap has both 1 and 2. The code would remove the smaller node (1), leaving 2. Which is correct.\n\nCase 2: n=3, k=1. The tree is 1-2-3. Initial degrees: 1 (node 1), 2 (node 2), 1 (node 3). The heap has 1 and 3. The code removes 1. The remaining tree is 2-3, which is connected. The sum is 2^2 + 2^3 = 12. Alternatively, if we removed 3, the sum is 2^1 + 2^2 = 6. So the code correctly removes 1.\n\nAnother case: n=3, k=1. The code would remove the smallest node (1 or 3). Which one is chosen? Since the heap is a min-heap, the first popped is 1, which is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the second sample input:\n\nSample input 2:\n\n8 4\n\nEdges:\n\n2 6\n\n2 7\n\n7 8\n\n1 2\n\n3 1\n\n2 4\n\n7 5\n\nSo the tree is:\n\nLet me try to draw it.\n\nThe edges are:\n\nBetween 2-6, 2-7, 7-8, 1-2, 3-1, 2-4, 7-5.\n\nSo node 2 is connected to 6,7,1,4.\n\nNode 7 is connected to 2, 8, 5.\n\nNode 1 is connected to 2, 3.\n\nThe initial degrees:\n\nnode 1: connected to 2 and 3 → degree 2.\n\nnode 2: connected to 1, 6, 7, 4 → degree 4.\n\nnode 3: connected to 1 → degree 1.\n\nnode 4: connected to 2 → degree 1.\n\nnode 5: connected to 7 → degree 1.\n\nnode 6: connected to 2 → degree 1.\n\nnode 7: connected to 2, 8",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and the total number of fans is maximized. The districts are connected in a tree structure, and each district's fan count is given by $2^i$, where $i$ is the district number.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given districts form a tree, which means there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since the fan count for each district increases exponentially with the district number, we aim to keep the districts with higher numbers as much as possible.\n3. **Leaf Removal Strategy**: To ensure the remaining districts form a connected subtree, we iteratively remove the smallest valued (by district number) leaf nodes from the tree. This ensures that the tree remains connected while removing the least significant nodes in terms of fan count.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        adj[a].append(b)\n        adj[b].append(a)\n    \n    degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        degree[i] = len(adj[i])\n    \n    heap = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if degree[i] == 1:\n            heapq.heappush(heap, i)\n    \n    removed = [False] * (n + 1)\n    res = []\n    \n    for _ in range(k):\n        while True:\n            if not heap:\n                break\n            current = heapq.heappop(heap)\n            if removed[current]:\n                continue\n            if degree[current] == 1:\n                break\n        # Now process current\n        res.append(current)\n        removed[current] = True\n        for neighbor in adj[current]:\n            if not removed[neighbor]:\n                degree[neighbor] -= 1\n                if degree[neighbor] == 1:\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, neighbor)\n    \n    res.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into an adjacency list representing the tree structure.\n2. **Degree Calculation**: Each node's initial degree is calculated based on its connections in the tree.\n3. **Heap Initialization**: A min-heap (priority queue) is initialized with all leaf nodes (degree 1) from the initial tree.\n4. **Iterative Removal**: We repeatedly remove the smallest valued leaf node (by district number) from the heap, ensuring the tree remains connected. After removing a node, we adjust the degrees of its neighbors and add any new leaf nodes to the heap.\n5. **Result Preparation**: The removed nodes are collected, sorted, and printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the remaining districts form a connected subtree while maximizing the total number of fans by prioritizing the removal of nodes with the smallest values.",
