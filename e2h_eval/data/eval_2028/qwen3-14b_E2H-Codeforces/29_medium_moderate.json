Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where there's a string of digits and a series of substitution queries. After all substitutions, I have to compute the number modulo 1e9+7. The challenge is to handle the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. Directly applying each substitution step by step would be too slow because each substitution could involve replacing every occurrence of a digit in the current string, which could take O(n) time per query, leading to O(n^2) time overall. That's probably not going to work for large inputs.\n\nHmm. So I need a smarter way to represent the substitutions. Let me think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But if substitutions are done in sequence, then later substitutions might affect earlier ones. For example, if first we replace '2' with '00', then replace '0' with '1', then the original '2's would become '11's. So the order of processing queries matters. Therefore, we can't just process them in some arbitrary order; we have to process them as given.\n\nBut how to model the substitutions efficiently. Maybe we can track for each digit, what it's currently being replaced with. But since substitutions can be applied multiple times, we need to track the current replacement for each digit. However, when a substitution is applied, it's replacing all instances of a digit in the current string. But if we track the replacements as a mapping, maybe we can model the transformations in terms of their effect on the final value.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the substitutions are applied in sequence, and each substitution affects the string. So for example, if we have a digit 'd' that's replaced with some string, and then later another substitution replaces some other digit, but maybe that other substitution could include digits that were previously substituted. So, perhaps we need to model the substitutions in reverse order. Or maybe track for each digit, the expansion that it would undergo based on the substitutions applied so far.\n\nWait, here's an idea: instead of thinking about the string as being modified directly, think of each substitution as defining a replacement rule. But since substitutions can be applied multiple times, we need to track for each digit, what it expands to. However, when a substitution is made, say, replacing 'd' with 't', then any future substitutions that affect digits in 't' will affect the expansion of 'd'. So, if we process the substitutions in reverse order, perhaps we can build up the expansions.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Suppose we have a mapping from each digit to its replacement. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when a substitution is applied (say, d -> t), we update the mapping for d to be t. However, when building the final string, each occurrence of a digit in the original string would be expanded according to the current mappings. But wait, no. Because substitutions are applied in sequence. For example, if the first substitution is d -> t1, and then later substitution is e -> t2, and t1 contains e, then when expanding d, we need to replace e in t1 with t2. So the order in which substitutions are processed affects the expansion.\n\nSo, the problem is that each substitution affects the current state of the string, and subsequent substitutions are applied to the modified string. Therefore, the order of substitutions is important.\n\nBut trying to simulate this directly would be computationally expensive. For example, if we have a string of length 1e5 and n substitutions, each substitution could take O(k) time where k is the length of the string. Which would be O(1e10) operations in the worst case. That's way too slow.\n\nTherefore, we need a way to model the substitutions without actually expanding the string each time.\n\nLet me think about this. Let's consider that each substitution replaces a certain digit with a string. But if we can track, for each digit, what it's currently replaced with, then when processing the substitutions, we can model the expansion of the original digits in terms of the current mappings.\n\nBut how to compute the final value of the string after all substitutions. Since the final value is the number represented by the string, modulo 1e9+7. So, perhaps we can model the expansion as a series of transformations, and compute the value using dynamic programming or some kind of tree structure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's model the substitutions in a way that for each digit, we track the current expansion. When a substitution is made, we update the expansion of that digit. However, when a substitution replaces a digit d with a string t, then the expansion of d is now t, but the expansion of t's digits may have been updated by previous substitutions. Wait, but substitutions are applied in order. So, when we process a substitution, we need to make sure that the expansion of d is the current t, which may include digits that have their own expansions.\n\nWait, but if we process substitutions in the order they are given, then for each substitution, when we set the expansion of d to t, then any subsequent substitutions would affect the expansion of digits in t. However, the problem is that when we need to compute the value of the original string, each character in the original string would be expanded into their current expansions, which may themselves expand further.\n\nWait, but if we can represent each digit's expansion as a function that returns the current string, then when a substitution happens, we can update that function. However, for efficiency, we need a way to compute the value of the expansion without actually building the entire string.\n\nLet me think about the modulo part. The final answer is the value of the string mod 1e9+7. So, perhaps instead of tracking the actual string, we can track for each digit, the value of the expansion of that digit as a number mod MOD, and also the length of the expansion (in terms of digits, which affects the way numbers are combined).\n\nFor example, suppose we have a digit 'd' which is replaced by a string t. The value of t mod MOD can be precomputed, and the length of t (number of digits). Then, when another substitution replaces a digit 'e' with a string s, which may contain 'd's, we can compute the value of s as the combination of the values of each digit in s, taking into account their positions.\n\nBut how to handle that. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a mapping for each digit, which gives us two things: the value of the expansion of that digit mod MOD, and the length of the expansion (i.e., the number of digits in the expansion). Then, when a substitution is made for digit d, replacing it with string t, we need to compute the value of t and the length of t. However, the string t may contain digits that have their own expansions. So, during the substitution, we need to compute the value of t by expanding each of its digits.\n\nWait, but the substitution is applied to the current string. So, when a substitution is processed, it replaces all occurrences of d in the current string with t. But in terms of the expansion rules, the current expansion of d is whatever was set before. So, when we process a substitution for d, we need to overwrite the expansion of d to be t. However, the t string may contain digits that have their own expansions. Therefore, when we compute the value of t, we need to expand each of its digits according to their current expansions.\n\nWait, but if we have for each digit, the current expansion's value and length, then when a substitution replaces d with t, we can compute the value of t by expanding each character in t. For example, if t is \"abc\", then the value of t is the value of a's expansion multiplied by 10^{length of b's expansion + length of c's expansion} plus the value of b's expansion multiplied by 10^{length of c's expansion} plus the value of c's expansion. Similarly for the length of t's expansion, which is the sum of the lengths of each digit's expansion in t.\n\nBut how do we compute this? Let's formalize this. For each digit d, we'll track two values:\n\n- val[d]: the value of the expansion of d mod MOD.\n- len[d]: the length of the expansion of d (number of digits).\n\nInitially, val[d] = d (as a number), len[d] = 1 for each digit d.\n\nWhen a substitution is made: \"d -> t\", we need to compute the new val[d] and len[d] based on the current expansions of the digits in t.\n\nFor example, suppose the substitution is d → t. Let's process each character in t. For each character c in t, we look up val[c] and len[c]. Then, we need to compute the value of the entire t string as a number, which is the concatenation of the expansions of each c in t.\n\nThe way to compute the value of the concatenation is as follows. Suppose we have a current value V and length L. Adding a new part with value v and length l, the new value becomes V * 10^l + v. The new length is L + l.\n\nSo, for the substitution, we can compute the value of t by iterating over each character in t, and for each character, use the current val and len of that character. Then, accumulate the total value and length.\n\nOnce we compute the new val and len for d, we can update our mappings.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's think through an example.\n\nTake the first sample input: initial string is \"123123\", and one substitution: 2 → 00.\n\nInitially, for each digit, val is the digit, len is 1.\n\nProcessing substitution 2 → \"00\". We process each character in \"00\" (which is '0' and '0').\n\nFirst character is '0', val[0] is 0, len[0] is 1. So the initial value is 0, length is 1.\n\nSecond character is '0', again val[0] is 0, len[0] is 1. The new value is 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0, length is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo the new val[2] is 0, len[2] is 2.\n\nNow, the original string is \"123123\", which has digits 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3. Each of these digits will be expanded according to their current val and len.\n\nSo for each digit in the original string, we compute their contribution. The final value is the concatenation of all these expansions. How to compute this?\n\nWe can process the original string's digits in order, and for each digit, compute the contribution to the final value. Let's say we have a variable current_val and current_len. Initially, current_val is 0, current_len is 0.\n\nFor each digit d in the original string:\n\n- Take the val[d] and len[d].\n- The new current_val is current_val * (10^len[d]) + val[d]\n- The new current_len is current_len + len[d]\n\nBut since we're working mod 1e9+7, we need to compute 10^len[d] mod MOD each time. However, exponentiating 10 each time might be expensive if done naively. But since len[d] can be up to something like 1e5 (if substitutions are adding a lot of digits), but for each substitution, we can precompute powers of 10 up to the maximum possible length.\n\nWait, but how do we compute 10^k mod MOD quickly? Well, we can compute it on the fly using modular exponentiation. But for each step, when we need to multiply current_val by 10^len, we can compute pow(10, len, MOD), but that's O(log len) time. However, if we precompute all possible exponents up to the maximum possible len, which could be up to 1e5, then we can do it with precomputed powers.\n\nAlternatively, for each step, when we need to compute 10^len, we can compute it as pow(10, len, MOD), but that's O(log len) per operation. But considering that the maximum len is up to 1e5, and the total number of operations is O(1e5), this might be manageable.\n\nWait, but in the case of the original string, which is up to 1e5 characters, and for each character, we need to compute 10^len[d], which depends on the len[d] of that digit. So for each digit in the original string, during the final processing, we compute the contribution.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Maintain for each digit (0-9) their current val and len.\n\n- For each substitution query, process it by computing the new val and len for the target digit, based on the current val and len of the digits in the replacement string.\n\n- Once all substitutions are processed, process the original string's digits, and compute the final value by combining their val and len, as described above.\n\nBut how to compute the new val and len for a substitution.\n\nLet me formalize:\n\nSuppose we have a substitution: replace digit d with string t. For each character in t, we have to compute the value of the entire string t, considering that each character in t is replaced by their current expansion.\n\nSo, for example, if t is \"abc\", then the value of t is (value of a's expansion) * 10^{len(b) + len(c)} + (value of b's expansion) * 10^{len(c)} + (value of c's expansion).\n\nSimilarly, the length is len(a) + len(b) + len(c).\n\nSo, for the substitution, the new val for d is the value of the string t, computed by expanding each character in t, and the new len for d is the sum of the len of each character in t.\n\nThus, during substitution processing, for each query, we need to compute this value for the replacement string t.\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently.\n\nLet me think. For the string t, we can process each character in order, and for each character, we can compute the cumulative value and length.\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose t is \"abc\".\n\nInitialize current_val = 0, current_len = 0.\n\nFor the first character 'a':\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * 10^len_a + val_a → val_a\n\ncurrent_len = 0 + len_a → len_a\n\nFor the second character 'b':\n\ncurrent_val = val_a * 10^len_b + val_b\n\ncurrent_len = len_a + len_b\n\nFor the third character 'c':\n\ncurrent_val = (val_a * 10^len_b + val_b) * 10^len_c + val_c\n\ncurrent_len = len_a + len_b + len_c\n\nSo, for the entire t string, the new val is current_val, and the new len is current_len.\n\nSo, during substitution processing, for the replacement string t, we can compute this step by step.\n\nSo, for each substitution query, we can process the replacement string t, and compute the val and len for the new substitution.\n\nThis seems manageable. Now, the key is to compute for each step the current_val and current_len as we process the characters in t.\n\nBut how to compute 10^len_b mod MOD? Well, during the substitution processing, for each character in t, we can compute the power of 10 needed. For example, when processing the next character, we need to multiply the current_val by 10^len_of_next_char, then add the val_of_next_char.\n\nBut how to compute 10^len_of_next_char mod MOD. Well, for each character in t, we can compute pow(10, len_of_current_char, MOD) on the fly. However, since len_of_current_char can be up to, say, 1e5 (if substitutions are adding many digits), but for each step, calculating pow(10, len, MOD) can be done with the built-in pow function with three arguments (which is efficient).\n\nWait, but calculating pow(10, len, MOD) each time could be O(log len) time. However, since the sum of the lengths of all ti across queries is up to 1e5, the total time for all substitution steps is acceptable.\n\nSo, for each substitution query, processing the replacement string t would take O(len(t)) time, which is acceptable.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, then the original string is processed, which is O(len(s)) time.\n\nSo, the overall time complexity would be O(n + len(s) + sum(len(ti))), which is acceptable for the constraints.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this logic.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize for each digit 0-9, their val and len.\n\n   Initially, val[d] = int(d), len[d] = 1.\n\n2. Process each substitution query in order.\n\n   For each query, parse the digit d and the replacement string t.\n\n   Compute the new_val and new_len for d based on t.\n\n   How?\n\n   For the replacement string t, process each character in order, and compute the cumulative value and length.\n\n   Initialize current_val = 0, current_len = 0.\n\n   For each character c in t:\n\n      get the val_c = val[c], len_c = len[c]\n\n      compute power = pow(10, len_c, MOD)\n\n      current_val = (current_val * power + val_c) % MOD\n\n      current_len += len_c\n\n   Then, set val[d] = current_val, len[d] = current_len.\n\n   Wait, but this is not correct. Because the way to compute the value of the string t is to concatenate the expansions of each character in t. So, for example, if t is 'ab', then the value is (value of a's expansion) * 10^{len(b)} + value of b's expansion.\n\n   So, during the processing of the replacement string t, for each character in t, we need to compute the cumulative value as:\n\n   current_val = current_val * 10^{len_c} + val_c.\n\n   So, for the first character, current_val starts at 0. Multiply by 10^len_c (which is 10^len of the first character?), but wait, the first character's len is len_c. So, initial current_val is 0, and after processing first character, it's 0 * 10^len_c + val_c = val_c. Then, for the next character, we multiply current_val by 10^len_c_new (the len of the next character) and add the val_c_new.\n\n   Yes. So the code for processing the replacement string t is:\n\n   current_val = 0\n\n   current_len = 0\n\n   for c in t:\n\n       val_c = val[c]\n\n       len_c = len[c]\n\n       power = pow(10, len_c, MOD)\n\n       current_val = (current_val * power + val_c) % MOD\n\n       current_len += len_c\n\n   Then, set val[d] = current_val and len[d] = current_len.\n\n   Wait, but what if the replacement string t is empty? Like in the example where a query is \"3->\", which replaces 3 with empty string. In that case, the new_val for d is 0, and len is 0. But how to handle that?\n\n   For example, if t is empty, then the new_val is 0 (since the empty string represents zero), and new_len is 0. But when processing the replacement string t, which is empty, the loop over c in t will not run, so current_val remains 0, current_len remains 0. Which is correct.\n\n   So, that case is handled.\n\n3. Once all substitutions are processed, process the original string s.\n\n   For the original string, each character is processed in order, and we compute the final value.\n\n   Initialize total_val = 0, total_len = 0.\n\n   For each character c in s:\n\n       val_c = val[c]\n\n       len_c = len[c]\n\n       power = pow(10, len_c, MOD)\n\n       total_val = (total_val * power + val_c) % MOD\n\n       total_len += len_c\n\n   However, there's a catch here. What if the total_len is zero? That would happen if the original string is empty, but according to the problem statement, the original string has length at least 1. However, substitutions can lead to the entire string becoming empty. For example, if the original string is \"1\", and substitution is \"1->\", then the resulting string is empty. According to the problem statement, in that case, the number is considered zero.\n\n   So, in our code, after processing the original string, if total_len is zero, then the result is 0. Otherwise, the total_val is the value mod MOD.\n\n   But wait, the code above would compute total_val as 0 in that case. Let's see:\n\n   Suppose the original string is \"1\", and substitution is \"1->\" (empty string). Then, for the original string, the processing is:\n\n   For each character c in s (which is '1'):\n\n       val_c is val[1] which is 0 (since the substitution replaced 1 with empty string, which has val 0 and len 0).\n\n       len_c is 0.\n\n       power = pow(10, 0, MOD) = 1.\n\n       total_val = 0 * 1 + 0 = 0.\n\n       total_len = 0 + 0 = 0.\n\n   So, the code returns 0, which is correct.\n\n   Another example: original string is \"0\", and no substitutions. The code processes it as val[0] is 0, len is 1. So, total_val is 0, total_len is 1. So the result is 0, which is correct.\n\n   However, when the total_len is zero, the code returns 0. So that's handled correctly.\n\n   So, the code for processing the original string is as described.\n\n   Now, the problem is that for each character in the original string, we have to compute pow(10, len_c, MOD). However, len_c can be up to ... well, for each substitution, the len can be as big as the sum of the len of the replacement string. But since the sum of len of ti is up to 1e5, and each substitution can add up to that, the len for a digit can be up to something like O(1e5) in the worst case.\n\n   However, computing pow(10, len_c, MOD) for each step is O(log len_c) time. But since len_c can be up to say 1e5, and for each character in the original string (up to 1e5), the total time would be O(1e5 * log (1e5)), which is acceptable.\n\n   However, in Python, pow(10, len_c, MOD) is optimized and efficient, so this should be manageable.\n\n   Now, let's test this approach with the sample inputs.\n\n   Let's take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\nOriginal string is '123123'\nn=1\nquery: 2->00\n\nProcessing substitution for 2.\n\nThe replacement string is '00'.\n\nProcessing each character in '00':\n\nFirst character is '0', val[0] is 0, len[0] is 1.\n\ncurrent_val starts at 0.\n\npower = 10^1 = 10 mod MOD.\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * 10 + 0 = 0.\n\ncurrent_len is 1.\n\nSecond character is '0', val is 0, len is 1.\n\npower is 10^1 = 10.\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * 10 + 0 = 0.\n\ncurrent_len is 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nSo, val[2] becomes 0, len[2] is 2.\n\nThen, processing the original string '123123'.\n\nEach character is processed in order:\n\nCharacters are '1', '2', '3', '1', '2', '3'.\n\nFor each:\n\ndigit '1': val is 1, len is 1.\n\npower is 10^1 = 10. total_val is 0*10 + 1 = 1. total_len is 1.\n\ndigit '2': val is 0, len is 2.\n\npower is 10^2 = 100. total_val = 1 * 100 + 0 = 100. total_len is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\ndigit '3': val is 3, len is 1. power is 10^1 = 10. total_val = 100 * 10 + 3 = 1003. total_len 3+1=4.\n\ndigit '1': same as first, val 1, len 1. power is 10^1 = 10. total_val = 1003 * 10 + 1 = 10031. total_len 4+1=5.\n\ndigit '2': same as before, val 0, len 2. power 10^2 = 100. total_val = 10031 * 100 + 0 = 1003100. total_len 5+2=7.\n\ndigit '3': same as before, val 3, len 1. power 10^1 = 10. total_val = 1003100 * 10 + 3 = 10031003. total_len 7+1=8.\n\nWhich matches the sample output of 10031003 mod MOD. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample: the second input is '123123' with query 3-> empty string.\n\nProcessing substitution for 3: replacement is empty string.\n\nProcessing the replacement string (empty), so current_val is 0, current_len is 0.\n\nSo, val[3] is 0, len[3] is 0.\n\nProcessing the original string:\n\ndigits are '1', '2', '3', '1', '2', '3'.\n\ndigit '1': val 1, len 1. total_val is 1.\n\ndigit '2': val 2, len 1. total_val = 1*10 + 2 = 12.\n\ndigit '3': val 0, len 0. power is 10^0=1. total_val = 12 * 1 + 0 = 12. total_len is 1+1+0 = 2.\n\ndigit '1': same as before, total_val = 12 * 10 + 1 = 121. len 2+1=3.\n\ndigit '2': same as before, total_val = 121 * 10 + 2 = 1212. len 3+1=4.\n\ndigit '3': same as before, total_val = 1212 * 1 + 0 = 1212. len 4+0=4.\n\nSo the final value is 1212, which matches the sample.\n\nThird sample input: original string '222', n=2.\n\nQueries:\n\n2->0, then 0->7.\n\nLet's process substitutions.\n\nInitially, for each digit, val is digit, len is 1.\n\nFirst substitution is 2 -> '0'.\n\nProcessing '0' as the replacement string. For each character in '0' (which is '0'):\n\nval[0] is 0, len is 1.\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. current_len is 1.\n\nSo val[2] becomes 0, len[2] is 1.\n\nThen, second substitution is 0 -> '7'.\n\nProcessing replacement string '7'.\n\nFor each character '7' in the string:\n\nval[7] is 7, len is 1.\n\ncurrent_val = 0 * 10^1 +7 =7. current_len = 1.\n\nSo val[0] is 7, len[0] is 1.\n\nNow, processing the original string '222'.\n\nEach '2' has val 0, len 1.\n\nProcessing first '2': val 0, len 1. total_val starts at 0.\n\ntotal_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0. total_len is 1.\n\nSecond '2': same. total_val = 0 * 10^1 +0 = 0. total_len 2.\n\nThird '2': same. total_val is 0. total_len 3.\n\nBut wait, the sample output is 777. Wait, why?\n\nAh, because after substitution, the first substitution replaces 2 with 0. Then, the second substitution replaces 0 with 7. So, the original string is 222. After first substitution, it's 000. Then, after second substitution, each 0 is replaced with 7, so 777.\n\nBut according to our model, what is happening?\n\nLet me re-examine the substitution steps.\n\nFirst substitution is 2 → '0'. At that time, the replacement string is '0', which is processed as:\n\ncurrent_val = 0 (from processing '0').\n\nSo val[2] is 0, len[2] is 1.\n\nThen, the second substitution is 0 → '7'. So, processing the replacement string '7'.\n\nFor the '7' character, val[7] is 7, len[7] is 1. So the current_val is 7, len is 1. So val[0] is 7, len[0] is 1.\n\nNow, when processing the original string '222', each '2' is expanded to val[2] = 0, len[2] = 1. But the replacement for 2 is '0', which is then replaced by substitution 0 → 7. Wait, but according to our model, the substitution is processed in order. So when we process the substitution for 0, it affects the val[0], which is used when processing the original string's digits. But in the original string, the digits are 2's, which are mapped to val[2] = 0, which is the value of the expansion of 2. But the expansion of 2 is '0', which is then replaced by substitution 0 → '7'? No, that's not how the model works. Because the substitutions are processed in order. So when the first substitution is done (replacing 2 with 0), then the second substitution replaces 0 with 7. So, during the substitution processing, when we process the second substitution (0 → 7), the val[0] is updated to 7, len[0] is 1. So when we process the original string, each 2 is expanded to 0 (val[2] = 0, len[2] = 1). But that 0 is the expansion of 2, which is '0', which is then replaced by substitution 0 → 7. Wait, no. Because the substitution is applied in sequence. So the original string is processed through all substitutions. So the substitutions are applied in order, and the model captures that by updating the val and len for each digit as substitutions are applied.\n\nIn this example, the substitution for 2 is done first, then substitution for 0. So, when the substitution for 0 is done, the val[0] is updated to 7. However, the val[2] is still 0, which is the value of the expansion of 2 (which is '0'). But when the expansion of 2 is '0', which is then processed through the substitution for 0. However, the model accounts for that because when the substitution for 0 is processed, the val[0] is updated, and any future processing of digits that expand to 0 will use the new val[0].\n\nWait, but in the original string, the digits are 2's. Their expansion is '0' (from the first substitution). However, the '0' in that expansion is not processed by the second substitution, because the substitution is applied to the string. So the first substitution replaces 2 with 0, and then the second substitution replaces 0 with 7. So the original string is transformed first to 000, then to 777.\n\nBut according to our model, when processing the original string, each '2' is expanded according to val[2], which is 0 (the value of '0'), and len[2] is 1 (the length of '0'). But the '0' in the expansion is not processed further because the substitution for 0 was done after the substitution for 2. How does the model capture that?\n\nAh! Because when the substitution for 0 is processed, the val[0] is updated to 7. So, when the original string is processed, the expansion of 2 is '0', which is represented by val[2] = 0 (the value of '0') and len[2] = 1 (the length of '0'). However, the '0' in the expansion is not processed further, unless during the processing of the original string, we have to expand the 0's. But according to our model, the original string is processed once, using the current val and len of each digit. So the model assumes that all substitutions have already been applied, and the current val and len for each digit represents the full expansion of that digit after all substitutions.\n\nWait, but in this example, the substitution for 0 is done after substitution for 2. So when the substitution for 0 is processed, the val[0] is updated. However, the val[2] is still 0, which represents the expansion of 2 as '0', but the substitution for 0 has changed the expansion of 0. Therefore, the model is wrong here. Because the expansion of 2 is '0', and the expansion of 0 is now '7', so the expansion of 2 should be '7' (because the substitution for 0 is applied to the string after the substitution for 2). But according to our model, the expansion of 2 is '0', which is not updated. So our approach is incorrect here.\n\nOh no! There's a flaw in the approach. Because the substitutions are applied in sequence. So when a substitution is applied for a digit, it replaces all instances of that digit in the current string. But in our model, when we process substitutions, we are only updating the val and len for the current digit. However, if a previous substitution's expansion includes a digit that is later substituted, then the model doesn't account for that. Because the substitution for the previous digit was processed with the old expansion of the later substituted digit.\n\nSo in the example above, the first substitution is 2 → 0. At that time, the expansion of 0 is 0 (original value). Then, the second substitution is 0 → 7. So, the expansion of 0 is now 7. However, the expansion of 2 is still 0 (the value of '0' at the time of substitution). But the actual expansion of 2 should be '0', which is then replaced by substitution 0 → 7. Therefore, the expansion of 2 should be '7', not 0. But according to our model, the expansion of 2 is 0, which is wrong.\n\nThis indicates that the approach is incorrect. So what's wrong with the model?\n\nThe model assumes that when a substitution is applied for digit d, the replacement string t is expanded using the current val and len of the digits in t. However, when a later substitution changes the val and len of a digit that was in t, the expansion of d is not automatically updated. Therefore, the model does not account for substitutions that affect digits in previously processed substitutions.\n\nThis is a critical flaw. How can we fix this?\n\nThe problem arises because substitutions are applied sequentially. When a substitution for a digit d is processed, it's based on the current state of the mappings. However, if a later substitution changes the mappings for digits in the replacement string of d, then the expansion of d should be recomputed. But our current approach doesn't do that.\n\nThis suggests that our model is incorrect, and we need a different approach.\n\nAlternative approach: think of the substitutions as a series of transformations. Each substitution replaces a digit with a new string. However, when a substitution is processed, it's applied to the current string. Therefore, the order of substitutions is important, and each substitution affects the current state of the string.\n\nBut simulating this directly is not feasible for large strings and substitutions. Hence, we need a way to model the substitutions such that when a substitution is made, it's properly accounted for in the expansion of all previous substitutions that may refer to it.\n\nThis seems like a problem that requires maintaining for each digit, the current expansion, but ensuring that whenever a substitution is made for a digit, all previous expansions that reference that digit are updated. However, this is not feasible directly because it would require tracking dependencies between substitutions.\n\nAlternative idea: since substitutions are applied in sequence, and each substitution replaces a digit with a new string, we can model the expansion of each digit as a function of the latest substitution. But when a substitution is applied, we need to recompute the expansion of the digit being substituted, considering the current state of other digits. However, if other digits are later substituted, those substitutions do not affect the previous expansions. Because substitutions are applied to the current string. For example:\n\nOriginal string: 2.\n\nFirst substitution: 2 → 0. Now, the string is 0.\n\nSecond substitution: 0 → 7. Now, the string is ",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the final number modulo $10^9 + 7$. Directly applying each substitution step-by-step would be inefficient for large inputs, so we use a more optimized approach by tracking the value and length of expansions for each digit.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start with each digit (0-9) having its own value and length (initially the digit itself and length 1).\n2. **Processing Substitutions**: For each substitution query, update the value and length of the target digit based on the current expansion of the replacement string.
