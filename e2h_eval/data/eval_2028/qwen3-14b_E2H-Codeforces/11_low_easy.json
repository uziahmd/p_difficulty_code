A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So I need to find the maximum number of toasts each can make, given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (bottles of drink), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, the problem says each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl milliliters? Or is it per friend? Let me check the note.\n\nIn the first example: The note says that 4*5=20 ml of drink. For 3 friends, they can make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, that suggests that each toast requires 3 * nl (since each of the 3 friends needs nl per toast). Because 3 friends * 3 ml per toast (assuming nl=3) would be 9 ml per toast. But in the example, the input has nl=3. Let me check the first input:\n\nFirst input line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'. So n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml (nl=3) per toast. So per toast, 3*3=9 ml. 20 / 9 is 2.222... so floor to 2. Which matches the example's explanation where min(6, 80, 100) is 6, then divided by 3 gives 2. Oh right, because the 20 / 3 is 6.666... but wait why?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, why is that? Oh, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl. So total per toast is n * nl milliliters. So the total drink available is k*l. So the number of toasts possible from drink is (k*l) / (n * nl). But since you can't have fractions, you take the floor.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices. Total slices available is c*d. So number of toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: each toast requires np grams per friend. So per toast, n * np grams. Total salt is p. So toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of those three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nDrink: 4*5=20. n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9. 20 / 9 is 2.222, so floor to 2. But according to the note, they calculated 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait that seems conflicting. What's going on here?\n\nWait the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait why is that? Oh, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me re-examine the note.\n\nIn the first sample, the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. But according to my previous reasoning, that would be 20/(3 * 3) = 20/9 = 2.222. But according to the note, it's 20 / 3 = 6. So what's the correct way?\n\nAh! Oh wait, maybe I got the per toast calculation wrong. Let me think again. The problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl. So total per toast is n * nl. So the total number of toasts possible is (total_drink) / (n * nl). But in the note, they have total_drink is 20. For the first example, the nl is 3. So 20 / (3 * 3) = 20/9 = 2.222, which would be",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink, a slice of lime, and a certain amount of salt per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: \n   - **Drink**: The total amount of drink available is calculated as the product of the number of bottles and the volume per bottle.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total number of lime slices available is calculated as the product of the number of limes and the number of slices per lime.\n   - **Salt**: The total amount of salt available is given directly.\n\n2. **Determine Constraints for Each Resource**:\n   - **Drink**: Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink (since each of the `n` friends needs `nl` milliliters per toast). The number of toasts possible from the drink is the total drink divided by this value.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend). The number of toasts possible from the lime slices is the total slices divided by `n`.\n   - **Salt**: Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt (since each of the `n` friends needs `np` grams per toast). The number of toasts possible from the salt is the total salt divided by this value.\n\n3. **Determine the Minimum Constraint**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the resource that runs out first. Therefore, we take the minimum value from the constraints calculated for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\ntoast_by_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\ntoast_by_lime = total_lime_slices // n\ntoast_by_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(toast_by_drink, toast_by_lime, toast_by_salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated as `k * l`, where `k` is the number of bottles and `l` is the volume per bottle.\n- **Total Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is calculated as `c * d`, where `c` is the number of limes and `d` is the number of slices per lime.\n- **Toast Constraints**:\n  - **Drink**: The number of toasts possible from the drink is determined by dividing the total drink by the amount needed per toast (`n * nl`).\n  - **Lime Slices**: The number of toasts possible from the lime slices is determined by dividing the total slices by the number of slices needed per toast (`n`).\n  - **Salt**: The number of toasts possible from the salt is determined by dividing the total salt by the amount needed per toast (`n * np`).\n- **Result**: The final result is the minimum value among the constraints calculated for drink, lime slices, and salt, ensuring that all friends can make the same number of toasts without any resource running out.",
