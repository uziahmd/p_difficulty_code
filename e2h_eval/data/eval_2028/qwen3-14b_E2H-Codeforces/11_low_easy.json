A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible number determined by the available resources divided by the number of friends, right?\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (milliliters per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (milliliters per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nSo, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. But since there are n friends, each toast requires n * nl ml of drink, n slices of lime, and n * np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait, per toast, each friend makes one toast. So for one toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so n slices per toast. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the total number of toasts possible is limited by three factors:\n\n1. Total drink available: k * l ml. Divided by (n * nl) per toast. So total toasts from drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). But wait, since each toast requires n * nl ml. So the total possible toasts from drink is (total_drink) // (per_toast_drink). Where total_drink is k*l, per_toast_drink is n * nl.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: total slices is c * d. Each toast needs n slices. So total toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: total salt is p grams. Each toast needs n * np grams. So total toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nWait, but in the example given, let's check:\n\nFirst sample input: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink: 4 *5 =20 ml. Per toast, 3 friends *3 ml per toast per friend = 9 ml per toast. So 20 /9 is 2.222, floored to 2. Which matches the example's note.\n\nLimes: 10 limes cut into 8 slices each: 80 slices. Each toast needs 3 slices. 80 /3 is 26.666, floored to 26. But the example says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, what's going on here?\n\nWait wait, the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. But according to my calculation, it's (c*d) // n. Which would be (10*8)/3 = 80/3 = 26.666 → 26. But the note says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the note says: the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How?\n\nAh, perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nEach friend needs a slice of lime per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. Therefore, per toast, n slices are needed. So total number of toasts possible from the lime slices is (total_slices) // n. Because each toast requires n slices.\n\nIn the first example, total slices is 10 * 8 = 80. So 80 // 3 = 26. But the note says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. That contradicts. Wait, what's the note saying?\n\nThe note says: \"the limes are enough for 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, why is the min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3? Because the 6 is already the total possible toasts, but then divided by 3 friends? Or perhaps I have a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait the note says that the total drink is 20ml. For each toast",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink available from the bottles, the total number of lime slices, and the total amount of salt.\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**: For each resource, calculate how many toasts can be made given the constraints:\n   - **Drink**: Total drink divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total lime slices divided by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Salt**: Total salt divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The number of toasts each friend can make is limited by the minimum value among the constraints calculated for each resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoast_drink = n * nl\ntoasts_by_drink = total_drink // toast_drink\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\ntoasts_by_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\ntoast_salt = n * np\ntoasts_by_salt = total_salt // toast_salt\n\nresult = min(toasts_by_drink, toasts_by_lime, toasts_by_salt)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Total Resources Calculation**:\n   - **Drink**: Multiply the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle to get the total milliliters of drink.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Multiply the number of limes by the number of slices per lime to get the total number of slices.\n   - **Salt**: Use the given grams of salt directly.\n\n2. **Resource Constraints Calculation**:\n   - **Drink**: Divide the total milliliters of drink by the amount needed per toast for all friends (n * nl).\n   - **Lime Slices**: Divide the total number of slices by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends (n).\n   - **Salt**: Divide the total grams of salt by the amount needed per toast for all friends (n * np).\n\n3. **Determine the Limiting Factor**: The result is the minimum value among the three calculated constraints, as each toast requires all resources simultaneously. This ensures that the solution respects the most restrictive resource constraint.",
