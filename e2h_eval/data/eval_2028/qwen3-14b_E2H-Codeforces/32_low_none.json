    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum possible instability after removing exactly one element from the array. The instability is the max minus min of the array. So, the goal is to figure out which element to remove so that the new max and min of the remaining array give the smallest possible difference.\n\nFirst, let's think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to check for each element, remove it, then compute the max and min of the remaining elements and calculate the instability. But if I do this naively, for each element, it would take O(n) time, leading to O(n²) time overall, which isn't feasible for n up to 1e5. That's way too slow. So I need a more efficient approach.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the original array. The instability is max - min. When we remove one element, the new max and min could be affected. But maybe the optimal choice is to remove either the maximum or the minimum element? Not sure. For example, in the first sample input, removing the max (7) gives a lower instability. But if there are multiple maxima or minima, maybe removing one of them would help.\n\nWait, but what if the array has elements like [1, 2, 3, 4]. The original instability is 3. If I remove 4, the instability becomes 2-1=1. If I remove 1, it becomes 3-2=1. So in this case, removing either end gives better result. But what if there are multiple elements that are not at the ends?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal instability after removing one element can be found by considering the cases where the removed element is either the first or last element in the sorted array. Because when you sort the array, the max is the last element and the min is the first. So, if we remove the first element, then the new min is the second element, and the max remains the same. Similarly, if we remove the last element, the new max is the second last, and min remains the same. But what about other elements?\n\nBut wait, the problem is that when you remove an element that's not the first or last in the sorted array, how does that affect the max and min? For example, if the array is sorted as [a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}], and we remove a_i where 0 < i < n-1. Then, the max and min would still be a_0 and a_{n-1} unless the element removed is the only occurrence of the current max or min.\n\nWait, no. Suppose the array is [1, 3, 3, 7]. When sorted, it's [1,3,3,7]. The original instability is 6. If we remove 7, the new array is [1,3,3], instability is 2. If we remove 1, the array is [3,3,7], instability is 4. If we remove one of the 3s, the array becomes [1,3,7], instability is 6. So the best is to remove 7.\n\nSo in this case, the optimal is to remove the max. But if the array was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], then removing the max (5) gives instability 3 (from 1 to 4), removing the min (1) gives instability 4-2=2. Wait, no. Wait, if you remove 1, the array is [2,3,4,5], instability is 5-2=3. If you remove 5, the array is [1,2,3,4], instability is 3. So in that case, removing either end gives same result.\n\nBut how do I find the optimal element to remove?\n\nLet me think again. The key is that when you remove an element, the new max and min can be determined based on the original sorted array. So, if the array is sorted, then:\n\nFor each element, if we remove it, the new min is the min of the array except that element. Similarly for the max.\n\nBut for the sorted array, the min is a[0] and the max is a[-1]. If we remove any element except the first, the new min is still a[0] (unless the element removed is the first element). Similarly, if we remove any element except the last, the new max is still a[-1].\n\nSo, for the sorted array, the possibilities for the new instability after removing one element are:\n\nCase 1: Remove the first element. Then the new min is a[1], and the new max is a[-1]. Instability is a[-1] - a[1].\n\nCase 2: Remove the last element. Then the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to minimize the instability of an array after removing exactly one element. The instability is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array helps in efficiently determining the potential minima and maxima when elements are removed.\n2. **Evaluate Edge Cases**: By removing the first or last element of the sorted array, we can evaluate the instability of the resulting array. This is because removing the first element affects the minimum value, while removing the last element affects the maximum value.\n3. **Check All Possible Removals**: For each element in the sorted array, consider the instability when that element is removed. However, since the array is sorted, the optimal instability can be found by checking the instability when the first or last element is removed, or when an element in the middle is removed, which might not affect the overall min or max.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    a = list(map(int, input[1:n+1]))\n    \n    a.sort()\n    min_instability = float('inf')\n    \n    # Check removing the first element\n    if n > 1:\n        instability = a[-1] - a[1]\n        min_instability = min(min_instability, instability)\n    \n    # Check removing the last element\n    if n > 1:\n        instability = a[-2] - a[0]\n        min_instability = min(min_instability, instability)\n    \n    # Check removing elements in the middle\n    for i in range(1, n-1):\n        instability = max(a[i] - a[0], a[-1] - a[i])\n        min_instability = min(min_instability, instability)\n    \n    print(min_instability)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Array**: Sorting allows us to easily access the smallest and largest elements, which are crucial for calculating instability.\n2. **Edge Case Evaluation**: By removing the first or last element of the sorted array, we can directly compute the instability of the remaining array by considering the new min or max.\n3. **Middle Element Check**: For elements in the middle of the sorted array, removing them might not affect the overall min or max, so we check both the potential new max and min values around the removed element.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum possible instability by leveraging the sorted structure of the array, leading to an optimal solution with a time complexity of O(n log n) due to sorting, followed by a linear scan through the array.",
