He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our job is to assign each input string as either a prefix (P) or suffix (S) such that there exists at least one string s that is consistent with this assignment.\n\nThe output is a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, where each character corresponds to the input strings in order. The answer must be valid for some possible s.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, the key observation is that the correct string s must have all the prefixes and suffixes given. But since we don't know which is which, we need to find an assignment of P and S to the input strings such that there exists a string s that has all the assigned prefixes and suffixes.\n\nBut how do I find that?\n\nLet me think. For the correct s, the prefixes are the first k characters of s for k from 1 to n-1. Similarly, the suffixes are the last k characters of s for k from 1 to n-1.\n\nSo, for example, for the first sample input, the correct s is \"ababa\". The prefixes would be \"a\", \"ab\", \"aba\", \"abab\", and the suffixes would be \"a\", \"ba\", \"aba\", \"baba\". But the input includes all of these, but mixed up.\n\nBut how can I reconstruct s? Well, perhaps the longest prefix and the longest suffix can help. Because the longest prefix is of length n-1, which is s[0..n-2], and the longest suffix is of length n-1, which is s[1..n-1]. So if we can find which of the input strings are the longest prefix and longest suffix, then maybe we can combine them to get the full string.\n\nWait, for example, the longest prefix (length n-1) and the longest suffix (length n-1) must overlap in such a way that their combination gives the full string. For example, if the longest prefix is P and the longest suffix is S, then the full string s must be P + last character of S. But since the longest prefix is of length n-1, and the longest suffix is also of length n-1, the last character of the longest suffix is the last character of s. But the longest prefix's last character is s[n-2], and the longest suffix's first character is s[1].\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to find the longest prefix and longest suffix. Then, the full string s can be constructed by combining them. For example, the longest prefix (length n-1) is P, and the longest suffix (length n-1) is S. Then, the full string s is P concatenated with the last character of S. Wait, no. Because the longest suffix is the last n-1 characters of s. So if the longest prefix is P (length n-1), then the full string is P + x, where x is the last character of s. But the longest suffix is S (length n-1), which is the last n-1 characters of s, so it's x's first n-1 characters. Wait, maybe not. Let me think:\n\ns has length n. The longest prefix is s[0..n-2] (length n-1). The longest suffix is s[1..n-1] (length n-1). Therefore, the longest prefix and the longest suffix share n-2 characters. So the full string is the longest prefix plus the last character of the longest suffix. Because the longest suffix starts at position 1 of s, so the last character of the longest suffix is s[n-1], which is the last character of s. So the full string s is the longest prefix (length n-1) plus the last character of the longest suffix.\n\nBut how do I find which of the input strings are the longest prefix and longest suffix? Because there are two strings of length n-1 in the input. One of them is the longest prefix, and the other is the longest suffix.\n\nSo, the idea is: among the input strings, the two of length n-1 are one prefix and one suffix. We can try all possibilities for which is which, and check if they can form a valid s.\n\nOnce we have that s, we can then check for all the other input strings whether they are prefixes or suffixes of s. Then, assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how do I find which of",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct combination of the longest prefix and suffix from the input strings to reconstruct the original string `s`, and then validating all other strings against this reconstructed string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The two strings of length `n-1` in the input must be the longest prefix and suffix of the unknown string `s`. We try both possibilities (each string as prefix and the other as suffix) to reconstruct the potential string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct String `s`**: For each valid combination of the longest prefix and suffix, reconstruct the string `s` by combining the longest prefix with the last character of the longest suffix.\n3. **Validate Other Strings**: Once a valid `s` is reconstructed, check all other input strings to see if they are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n4. **Generate Result**: Based on the validation, generate the result string consisting of 'P' and 'S' for each input string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try both possibilities for the two candidates\n    for i in range(2):\n        prefix_candidate = candidates[i]\n        suffix_candidate = candidates[1 - i]\n        # Reconstruct s\n        s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n        # Now check if all other strings are prefixes or suffixes of s\n        # Also, check that the prefix_candidate is indeed a prefix of s\n        # and suffix_candidate is a suffix of s\n        valid = True\n        for s_str in strings:\n            if len(s_str) == len_n_minus_1:\n                continue\n            is_prefix = s.startswith(s_str)\n            is_suffix = s.endswith(s_str)\n            if not is_prefix and not is_suffix:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            # Now assign P and S\n            result = []\n            for s_str in strings:\n                is_prefix = s.startswith(s_str)\n                is_suffix = s.endswith(s_str)\n                # For the two candidates of length n-1\n                if len(s_str) == len_n_minus_1:\n                    if s_str == prefix_candidate:\n                        result.append('P')\n                    else:\n                        result.append('S')\n                else:\n                    # Check if it's a prefix or suffix\n                    if is_prefix:\n                        result.append('P')\n                    else:\n                        result.append('S')\n            print(''.join(result))\n            return\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Identifying Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Reconstructing String `s`**: Each candidate for the longest prefix and suffix is used to reconstruct the string `s`. The validity of this reconstruction is checked against all other input strings.\n4. **Validation**: Each string is checked to see if it is a prefix or suffix of the reconstructed string `s`.\n5. **Result Construction**: Based on the validation, the result string is constructed with 'P' for prefixes and 'S' for suffixes.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes by leveraging the properties of the longest prefix and suffix.",
