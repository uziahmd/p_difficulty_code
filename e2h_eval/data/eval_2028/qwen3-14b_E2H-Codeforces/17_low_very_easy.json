He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about determining which of the given 2n-2 strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of some unknown string s of length n. The input gives all the improper prefixes and suffixes (so for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings, one prefix and one suffix, but we don't know which is which). Our task is to assign 'P' or 'S' to each input string such that there exists at least one possible string s that matches the assignments.\n\nThe output should be a string of 'P's and 'S's of length 2n-2, with exactly n-1 P's and S's each. And if there are multiple possibilities, any valid one is acceptable.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the key idea is that the correct string s must have all the given prefixes and suffixes. But since the input strings are all the prefixes and suffixes, we need to find a way to assign which ones are prefixes and which are suffixes such that there's a consistent s.\n\nBut how do I find that?\n\nLet's think: For the correct string s, the prefixes are s[0..k] for k from 1 to n-1, and the suffixes are s[n-k..n] for k from 1 to n-1. So for each possible candidate s, the set of prefixes and suffixes would be known. However, since we don't know s, perhaps we can find s by looking for a string that has all the given strings as either prefixes or suffixes.\n\nBut since the input is given as a list of all prefixes and suffixes, but mixed, maybe the correct approach is to find the possible candidates for s, and then check which assignments are possible.\n\nBut how to find s? Well, for example, the longest possible prefix (of length n-1) and the longest possible suffix (also of length n-1) must be such that their combination gives s. Because for example, the longest prefix of length n-1 is s without the last character, and the longest suffix of length n-1 is s without the first character. So if we can find a pair of strings from the input (one of length n-1, which is a prefix, and another of length n-1 which is a suffix), then combining them could give us the original string s.\n\nWait, but how? Suppose we have a prefix of length n-1, say P, and a suffix of length n-1, say S. Then the original string s would be P + last character of S. But wait, the suffix of length n-1 is the original string minus the first character. So the original string s is (prefix of length n-1) + last character of s. But the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n], so the original string is the first character of the suffix plus the suffix. So if we take the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1, then the original string s must be equal to the prefix plus the last character of the suffix. But also, the original string must be equal to the first character of the suffix plus the suffix. Therefore, the prefix and the suffix must overlap in such a way that the first character of the suffix is the same as the first character of the prefix's first character? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think that the original string s must have the prefix of length n-1 as s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 as s[1..n]. Therefore, combining these two, the original string s is s[0] followed by the suffix of length n-1. Also, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], which is the original string minus the last character. So the original string can be formed by taking the prefix of length n-1 and appending the last character of the suffix of length n-1. But the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n], so its first character is s[1], and the last character is s[n], which is the last character of the original string. Wait, no, the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n], so the original string is s[0] + s[1..n], so the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n], which is the original string minus the first character. Therefore, if we have a prefix of length n-1 (let's call it P) and a suffix of length n-1 (call it S), then the original string s must be equal to P + S[-1], because the last character of S is the last character of s. But also, S must be equal to s[1..n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the correct string `s` by leveraging the longest possible prefixes and suffixes provided in the input.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify Longest Prefix and Suffix**: The longest proper prefix and suffix of `s` (each of length `n-1`) can help reconstruct the original string `s`. By combining these two, we can deduce the original string `s`.\n2. **Reconstruct Original String**: Using the identified longest prefix and suffix, we can form the original string `s` by ensuring that the last character of the suffix matches the last character of the original string.\n3. **Validate All Strings**: Once we have a candidate for `s`, we validate all given strings to check if they are either prefixes or suffixes of `s`.\n4. **Assign Labels**: Based on the validation, assign 'P' for prefixes and 'S' for suffixes to each input string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    strings = input[idx:idx + 2 * n - 2]\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    len_n_minus_1 = n - 1\n    candidates = []\n    for s in strings:\n        if len(s) == len_n_minus_1:\n            candidates.append(s)\n    \n    # Try all combinations of the two candidates as prefix and suffix\n    for prefix_candidate in candidates:\n        for suffix_candidate in candidates:\n            if prefix_candidate == suffix_candidate:\n                continue\n            # Reconstruct s\n            s = prefix_candidate + suffix_candidate[-1]\n            # Check if the suffix_candidate is indeed a suffix of s\n            if s[1:] == suffix_candidate:\n                # Now check all strings against s\n                result = []\n                for s_str in strings:\n                    if len(s_str) == 0:\n                        continue\n                    if s.startswith(s_str):\n                        result.append('P')\n                    elif s.endswith(s_str):\n                        result.append('S')\n                    else:\n                        break\n                else:\n                    print(''.join(result))\n                    return\n    \n    # If no combination found (though problem says it's guaranteed)\n    print('P' * (n-1) + 'S' * (n-1))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the length `n` and the list of strings.\n2. **Finding Candidates**: The two strings of length `n-1` are identified as potential candidates for the longest prefix and suffix.\n3. **Reconstructing the String**: By combining these candidates, we attempt to reconstruct the original string `s`.\n4. **Validation**: Each string from the input is checked against the reconstructed `s` to determine if it is a prefix or suffix.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with 'P' for prefixes and 'S' for suffixes based on the validation.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently determine the correct assignment of prefixes and suffixes by leveraging the properties of the longest proper prefixes and suffixes.",
