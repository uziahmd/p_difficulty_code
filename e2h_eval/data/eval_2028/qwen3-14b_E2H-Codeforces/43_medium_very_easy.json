He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps.\n\nSo the process is: A creates a string with some 'a's. Then B adds some 'b's to the end, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C adds 'c's equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. And the final string is what we're checking.\n\nSo the steps for validation would be:\n\nFirst, check the order of characters. Because the original string must have all 'a's first, then 'b's added, then 'c's. So the string should have a block of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's. If there's any 'c' before 'b's, or 'b's after 'c's, that's invalid. Also, the order of the letters must be a's first, then b's, then c's. So the string must be in the form a*b*c*.\n\nSo first step: check that the string is composed of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's. So for example, 'aabbc' is okay, but 'abac' is not. So how to check that?\n\nWe can split the string into parts. For example, check that all a's are before any b's, and all b's are before any c's. So the string should not have any a's after the first occurrence of b or c, and no b's after the first occurrence of c.\n\nSo perhaps, we can check the order by looking at the transitions between characters. Let me think. For example, the string should have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So the first occurrence of 'b' must be after all a's, and the first occurrence of 'c' must be after all b's.\n\nAlternatively, we can check that the string is in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, for example, the string can be divided into three parts: a_part, b_part, c_part. So the entire string is a_part + b_part + c_part. So, the counts of each character can be determined as:\n\ncount_a = len(a_part)\ncount_b = len(b_part)\ncount_c = len(c_part)\n\nBut also, the count_c must be equal to either count_a or count_b (or both). Also, since B added the b's, there must be at least one a and one b. So count_a >= 1, count_b >= 1. Also, since C added the c's, count_c must be >= 0? Wait, but the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. The problem says \"some number\" which implies that it's possible that zero? Wait, no. Wait, the note says that the string has at least one 'a' and 'b' after B's operation. But C appends some number of 'c's. But the problem says \"some number\" which could be zero? Or does it have to be at least one?\n\nWait, the problem statement says: \"C now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" So \"some number\" could be zero? But according to the note, in the third example, the input is 'aabc', which has two a's, one b, and one c. So the count of c's is 1, which equals the count of b's. So in that case, C added one 'c'.\n\nBut the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. So that number can be zero? Or does the problem require that there's at least one 'c'? Because the problem says that the original string after B's operation has at least one 'a' and 'b', but C may add zero 'c's. However, the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. But the problem says \"some number\" which could be zero? Well, the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. But the problem says that the original string (after B's step) has at least one a and one b. But when C adds the c's, the final string could have zero c's? But that's not possible because the problem says that C appends some number of letters. But maybe \"some number\" includes zero? Or does it have to be at least one?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\nWait, the number of 'c's appended is equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string (before adding the c's). So the number of c's added is either count_a or count_b. So, the count of c's in the final string is equal to count_a or count_b. But if the count is zero, that would imply that count_a or count_b is zero. But that's not possible because after B's step, there's at least one a and one b. So, when C appends the c's, the number of c's is either count_a (which is at least 1) or count_b (which is at least 1). Therefore, the final string must have at least one c. So the count_c must be at least 1.\n\nSo, the final string must have at least one a, one b, and one c. Wait, no. Because after B's step, the string has at least one a and one b. Then C appends some number of c's. So the final string must have at least one a, one b, and possibly some c's. But the problem says that C appends some number of c's. So the count_c is equal to the count_a or count_b. Which are at least 1. So the count_c is at least 1. Therefore, the final string must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nTherefore, the input string must have at least one of each character. So if the input string is missing any of a, b, or c, then it's invalid.\n\nSo, first step: check that the string contains at least one a, one b, and one c. If not, return NO.\n\nBut wait, let's think again. Let's take the example given in the problem. The third example is 'aabc', which has a's, b's, and c's. So yes. But what about if the string is 'aab'? Then there's no c. So that's invalid. So the first check is: the string must have at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\nSo that's a necessary condition. But also, the order must be correct.\n\nSo steps to check:\n\n1. Check that the string is composed of a's, followed by b's, followed by c's. So the order is correct. For example, the string must not have a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b' or 'a'.\n\nHow to check this? For example, the string can be split into three parts. Let's find the first occurrence of 'b' and 'c'. All characters before the first 'b' must be 'a's. All characters between the first 'b' and the first 'c' must be 'b's. All characters after the first 'c' must be 'c's.\n\nAlternatively, the string should not have any 'a's after the first 'b' or 'c', and no 'b's after the first 'c'.\n\nAnother approach is to check that the string is in non-decreasing order according to the order a < b < c. So for example, the string is valid if each character is not less than the previous one. But since the characters are only a, b, c, this would ensure that the order is correct. For example, 'aaabbbcc' is allowed, but 'abba' is not. So checking that the string is in non-decreasing order.\n\nWait, that's a good idea. Because the string must consist of a's first, then b's, then c's. So the order of the characters must be non-decreasing. So if the string is not in non-decreasing order, then it's invalid.\n\nSo for example, 'abac' would have a 'c' after 'a's and 'b's, but then another 'a' which is less than 'c', so it's invalid.\n\nSo step 1: check that the string is in non-decreasing order. If not, return NO.\n\nThen, step 2: check that the string has at least one a, one b, and one c. Because otherwise, it's invalid. For example, if there are no c's, then it's invalid. Because C added some c's.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that C appends some number of c's. So the final string must have c's. So the presence of at least one c is required.\n\nSo step 2: check that the counts of a, b, c are all >=1.\n\nThen step 3: check that the count of c's is equal to the count of a's or the count of b's.\n\nBut wait, the count of c's is the number of c's added by C. Which is equal to the count of a's or the count of b's in the string before adding the c's. Wait, the count of a's and b's before adding the c's is the same as the count of a's and b's in the final string. Because the c's are added after. So, for example, the count of a's in the final string is the same as the count of a's in the original string from A. Similarly for b's. The count of c's in the final string is equal to the number of c's added by C, which is equal to the count of a's (original) or the count of b's (original).\n\nSo, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo, for the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nCheck the following:\n\n- The string is in non-decreasing order (so a's followed by b's followed by c's).\n\n- The string contains at least one a, one b, and one c.\n\n- The count of c's is equal to count of a's or count of b's.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then output YES, else NO.\n\nLet me test this logic against the examples.\n\nFirst example: 'aaabccc' → counts are a:3, b:1, c:3. So count_c is 3, which equals count_a (3). So yes. Also, the order is correct. All conditions met → YES.\n\nSecond example: 'bbacc' → the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. The order is not non-decreasing. Because after the first 'b's, there is an 'a' which is less than 'b'. So the string is invalid. So output is NO. Which matches the example.\n\nThird example: 'aabc' → counts are a:2, b:1, c:1. The count_c is 1, which equals count_b (1). Order is correct. All conditions met → YES.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. c is equal to a (1) and b (1). So yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbbc' → count_c is 1, count_a is 1, count_b is 3. So c equals a → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcc' → count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=2. So count_c equals count_a. Yes.\n\nWhat about 'aabbcc'? count_c is 2. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So count_c equals both. So yes.\n\nWhat about 'abcc'? count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=2. So count_c is not equal to a or b. So output is NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aaabbbcc' → count_c is 2, count_a is 3, count_b is 3. So count_c is not equal to either. So output is NO.\n\nSo, the logic seems to work.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read the input string S.\n\nThen, check the order. How to check that the string is non-decreasing. For example, for each i from 1 to len(S)-1, check that S[i] >= S[i-1]. If any character is less than the previous, then invalid.\n\nThen, check that counts of a, b, c are all >=1.\n\nThen, check that count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nBut also, note that the count of a's is the number of a's in the entire string. Similarly for b's and c's.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead S.\n\nCheck order: for i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n   if S[i] < S[i-1], then invalid.\n\nIf order is invalid, return NO.\n\nElse:\n\ncount_a = S.count('a')\n\ncount_b = S.count('b')\n\ncount_c = S.count('c')\n\nif count_a == 0 or count_b ==0 or count_c ==0 → NO.\n\nelse:\n\nif count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b → YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbaacc'? Wait, the order check would fail here, since after the first two a's, there are b's, then a's again. So the code would detect that the string is not non-decreasing, so return NO.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nAnother case: 'abbccc' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=2, count_c=3. count_c is not equal to a or b. So output NO.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → counts a:3, b:1, c:3. So c equals a. So yes.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → the order is b, b, a, c, c. The third character is 'a' which is less than previous 'b', so order is invalid → output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is a, a, b, c. Correct. counts a:2, b:1, c:1. c equals b → yes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase where the string is 'abc' → yes.\n\nCase where the string is 'abcc' → count_c is 2, count_a is 1, count_b is 1. So 2 not equal to 1. So output NO.\n\nCase where the string is 'aabbcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → count_a=4, count_b=4, count_c=4. So count_c equals both a and b. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=1. So count_c is not equal to a or b. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → order is correct. But count_c is 1, which is not equal to a (2) or b (2). So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcbb' → no, because the order is not correct. Because after the c, there is a 'b' which is less than 'c'.\n\nSo the code would catch that.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nIn Python, read the string S.\n\nCheck the order:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n    if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit.\n\nThen check counts.\n\ncount_a = S.count('a')\n\ncount_b = S.count('b')\n\ncount_c = S.count('c')\n\nif any of them is zero → print NO.\n\nElse, check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b → yes else no.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'abba'? The order check would fail, since the third character is 'b' which is less than the previous 'a'? No, the string is 'a', 'b', 'b', 'a'. So the fourth character is 'a' which is less than the previous 'b'. So the code would detect that and return NO.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1. So count_c equals count_a → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbcc' → count_c is 2, count_a is 1, count_b is 3. So 2 not equal to 1 or 3. So output NO.\n\nSo code would return NO.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nCheck order:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n    if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit.\n\nThen check counts.\n\nBut in Python, how to exit early?\n\nProbably, we can do:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a ==0 or count_b ==0 or count_c ==0:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, exit() is not the best way. Because in code submission, perhaps using sys.exit() is better. But in code submission, perhaps the code can return early.\n\nBut in code submission, the code must read from stdin and write to stdout. So, for example, in Python, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n\nThen check the order.\n\nBut in code, for the code to exit early, perhaps:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nBut in Python, exit() may not be allowed. Wait, but in Python, the exit() function is in the sys module. So perhaps, using sys.exit().\n\nBut in code submission, perhaps the code can return early. So the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, the exit() function is not the same as sys.exit(). So perhaps, in the code, the code would need to use sys.exit().\n\nBut in the code, the code is written as:\n\nBut in Python, the exit() function is available in the standard environment, but perhaps it's better to use sys.exit().\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can check the order, and if invalid, print 'NO' and return. So in code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nBut in Python, the exit() function may not be available. For example, in some environments, using exit() may raise an error. So perhaps better to use sys.exit().\n\nBut in code submission, perhaps the code can do:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        sys.exit()\n\nThen proceed.\n\nBut in code submission, perhaps the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut in Python, when you use exit(), it's actually from the sys module. So perhaps, the code should import sys and use sys.exit().\n\nBut in the code, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\ns = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n\nvalid = True\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        valid = False\n\n        break\n\nif not valid:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\n    sys.exit()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nBut perhaps, the code can be written more concisely.\n\nBut the code seems correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample input 1: 'aaabccc' → order is correct. counts a=3, b=1, c=3. So 3 == 3 → yes.\n\nSample input 2: 'bbacc' → the order is checked. The third character is 'a', which is less than 'b' (the second character). So the loop will detect this and print NO.\n\nSample input 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. counts a=2, b=1, c=1 → yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' → order is invalid (the third character is 'b' which is same as previous, but the fourth is 'a' which is less than 'b' → invalid. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=2 → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → counts a=2, b=2, c=1 → no.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcc' → counts a=2, b=1, c=2 → yes.\n\nSo the code should handle all these cases.\n\nNow, think about the case where the string is 'ab' → but no 'c's. So the code will check that count_c is 0 → print NO.\n\nAnother case: 'ac' → no 'b's → print NO.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbcc' → yes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nThus, this approach should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. The string must follow a strict order of characters and meet certain count conditions.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Order Check**: The string must be in non-decreasing order of characters, i.e., all 'a's first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's. This ensures that the string follows the sequence of operations described.\n2. **Presence Check**: The string must contain at least one 'a', one 'b', and one 'c'. This is necessary because each step of the process ensures the presence of these characters.\n3. **Count Check**: The number of 'c's in the string must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's. This is derived from the requirement that the number of 'c's appended by C is equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's present before appending.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    s = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Check if the string is in non-decreasing order\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            print(\"NO\")\n            return\n    # Count the occurrences of each character\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    # Check if all characters are present\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0 or count_c == 0:\n        print(\"NO\")\n        return\n    # Check if count_c equals count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The loop iterates through the string to ensure that each character is not less than the previous one. If any violation is found, the string is immediately deemed invalid.\n2. **Presence Check**: After confirming the order, the code checks if there is at least one occurrence of each character ('a', 'b', 'c'). If any of these counts are zero, the string is invalid.\n3. **Count Check**: Finally, the code checks if the count of 'c's matches either the count of 'a's or 'b's.
