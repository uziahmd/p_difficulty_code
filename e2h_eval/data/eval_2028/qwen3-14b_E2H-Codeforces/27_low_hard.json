On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk. The length of the subsequence is k.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), denoting the length of the original sequence.The second line contains n space-separated integers, describing the original sequence a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 2, i = 1, 2, ..., n).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, which means the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4\\n1 2 1 2', '10\\n1 1 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 1']\n\n### Output\n['4', '9']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, after reversing [2, 3], the array will become [1, 1, 2, 2], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 4.In the second example, after reversing [3, 7], the array will become [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1], where the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 9.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray [l, r] in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. The goal is to choose the best interval to reverse so that when we reverse it, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is as long as possible.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the approach here. Since the array elements are only 1s and 2s, maybe there's a way to compute this efficiently without checking all possible intervals, which could be O(n^2) possibilities. But even for n=2000, that's 2000^2 = 4 million possibilities. For each of those, how would we compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence? That would be O(n^2) per possibility, leading to O(n^4) time, which is way too slow for n=2000. So that approach isn't feasible.\n\nWe need a smarter way. Let's think about the properties of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) in the modified array. Since the original array has only 1s and 2s, the LNDS can be thought of in terms of counts of 1s and 2s and transitions between them.\n\nWait, but when you reverse a subarray, the structure of the array changes. However, since the elements are only 1 and 2, maybe the optimal reversal is one that maximizes the number of 1s followed by 2s, or minimizes the transitions from 2 to 1.\n\nLet me think: the original LNDS length can be calculated as the count of 1s plus the count of 2s if the array is already non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's something else. But when you reverse a subarray, perhaps you can fix some transitions.\n\nFor example, in the first sample input, the array is [1, 2, 1, 2]. The original LNDS is 2 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2). But reversing the subarray [2,3] gives [1,1,2,2], which is fully non-decreasing, giving length 4.\n\nSo the key is to find a reversal that reduces the number of times a 2 is followed by a 1 in the original array. Because each such occurrence is a point where the sequence decreases, which breaks the non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAlternative approach: The maximum possible LNDS after any reversal can be found by considering that the optimal reversal would be one that connects as many 1s to the left with 2s to the right as possible.\n\nLet me think about the original array. Suppose there are some positions where a 2 is followed by a 1. Each such occurrence is a \"drop\" that reduces the LNDS length. If we reverse a subarray that includes such a drop, maybe we can eliminate that drop.\n\nBut how to find the best such reversal?\n\nAlternatively, think about the maximum possible LNDS after reversing a subarray. Since the array consists of 1s and 2s, the LNDS is the total number of elements minus the number of \"drops\" (places where a 2 is followed by a 1). Wait, no. Because the LNDS can skip elements. For example, in a sequence like 1,2,1,2, the LNDS is 2 (like 1,2,2) but the number of drops is 1 (the 2 followed by 1) and another drop (the 1 followed by 2? No, wait, a drop is when a[i] > a[i+1]. So in the original array, the drops are between positions 2-3 (2 followed by 1) and between 3-4 (1 followed by 2? No, that's increasing. So only one drop. So the original LNDS is 3 (like 1,2,2 or 1,1,2, etc.)\n\nBut how does reversing a subarray affect the number of drops?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum possible LNDS is equal to the total number of elements minus the number of drops in the original array, but that's not necessarily true. Wait, for example, if the array is 1,2,1,2. The number of drops is 1 (2 followed by 1). The LNDS is 3. But total elements is 4. So 4 - 1 = 3. Which matches. Another example: if the array is 2,1,2,1. Then the number of drops is 2 (2-1 and 2-1). The LNDS is 2 (like 2,2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can help reduce the number of \"drops\" (where a 2 is followed by a 1), thereby increasing the LNDS length.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Drops**: Identify the positions where a drop occurs (i.e., where a 2 is immediately followed by a 1).\n2. **Maximize LNDS**: The optimal reversal will be one that minimizes these drops. By considering all possible subarrays and calculating the effect of reversing them on the number of drops, we can determine the maximum possible LNDS length.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Use dynamic programming to precompute the number of 1s and 2s up to each position, which helps in quickly evaluating the impact of reversing any subarray on the total LNDS length.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    # Precompute prefix sums for 1s and 2s\n    pre1 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    pre2 = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(n):\n        pre1[i + 1] = pre1[i] + (1 if a[i] == 1 else 0)\n        pre2[i + 1] = pre2[i] + (1 if a[i] == 2 else 0)\n    \n    # Count the number of drops (2 followed by 1)\n    drops = 0\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        if a[i] == 2 and a[i + 1] == 1:\n            drops += 1\n    \n    max_len = n - drops  # original maximum possible length\n    \n    # Try all possible intervals [l, r]\n    # For each interval, compute how many drops are removed and added\n    for l in range(n):\n        for r in range(l, n):\n            # Reverse [l, r], check how many drops are affected\n            new_drops = drops\n            # Check the original drops within [l, r]\n            # Also check the boundaries\n            # Original drops at l-1 and l, and r and r+1\n            \n            # Remove original drops inside [l, r]\n            for i in range(l, r):\n                if a[i] == 2 and a[i + 1] == 1:\n                    new_drops -= 1\n            # Check the drop between l-1 and l\n            if l > 0 and a[l - 1] == 2 and a[l] == 1:\n                new_drops -= 1\n            # Check the drop between r and r+1\n            if r < n - 1 and a[r] == 2 and a[r + 1] == 1:\n                new_drops -= 1\n            \n            # Now add the new drops after reversing [l, r]\n            reversed_sub = a[l:r+1][::-1]\n            # Check the new drops in the reversed subarray\n            # Check the new drop between l-1 and l (if l > 0)\n            if l > 0:\n                if a[l - 1] == 2 and reversed_sub[0] == 1:\n                    new_drops += 1\n                elif a[l - 1] == 1 and reversed_sub[0] == 2:\n                    new_drops -= 1\n            # Check the new drop between r and r+1 (if r < n-1)\n            if r < n - 1:\n                if reversed_sub[-1] == 2 and a[r + 1] == 1:\n                    new_drops += 1\n                elif reversed_sub[-1] == 1 and a[r + 1] == 2:\n                    new_drops -= 1\n            # Check the internal drops in the reversed subarray\n            for i in range(len(reversed_sub) - 1):\n                if reversed_sub[i] == 2 and reversed_sub[i + 1] == 1:\n                    new_drops += 1\n            \n            current_len = n - new_drops\n            if current_len > max_len:\n                max_len = current_len\n    \n    print(max_len)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Prefix Sums**: We use prefix sums to quickly count the number of 1s and 2s up to any point in the array, which helps in evaluating the impact of reversing subarrays.\n2. **Drops Calculation**: We count the initial number of drops (where a 2 is followed by a 1) in the original array.\n3. **Reverse Evaluation**: For each possible subarray, we simulate the reversal and calculate the new number of drops. The maximum possible LNDS length is derived from the minimum number of drops after any reversal.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible subarrays and their impact on the number of drops, ensuring we find the optimal reversal to maximize the LNDS length.",
