He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that a string is formed in a specific way. Let me break down the steps:\n\n1. A starts with some number of 'a's. So the initial string is all 'a's, and there's at least one 'a' here.\n2. B appends some number of 'b's to the end. So after this step, the string has 'a's followed by 'b's. Also, there's at least one 'b' here. So the total string after B's step has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3. Then C appends some number of 'c's. The number of 'c's added must equal either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string at that point. Also, it's possible that the count of 'c's equals both, but that's a special case.\n\nOur task is to check if a given string could have been formed through this process.\n\nSo, given a string S, we need to determine whether it meets these conditions.\n\nLet me think about the constraints:\n\nFirst, the string must consist of a's followed by b's followed by c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order must be all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So any valid string must have the characters in the order a...ab...bc...c. If there's any 'c' before 'b's, or 'b's after 'c's, it's invalid.\n\nSo first, check that the string is in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's. For example, \"aaabccc\" is okay. But \"abbaacc\" would not be, because after the initial a's and b's, there's a 'a' again.\n\nSo the first thing to check is that the string is composed of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. So, the characters should not change order. Like, once a 'b' appears, there should be no 'a's after that. Similarly, once a 'c' appears, there should be no 'a's or 'b's after that.\n\nSo how to check that? Well, we can check that the string is in non-decreasing order according to the letters. Because 'a' comes before 'b', which comes before 'c'. So the string must be such that each character is >= the previous one. For example, 'aabbc' is okay, but 'abac' is not.\n\nSo the first check is that the string is in the form of a's followed by b's followed by c's. If not, return NO.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, then we can proceed to check the counts.\n\nNow, let's think about the counts.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ncount_a = number of a's in the string.\n\ncount_b = number of b's.\n\ncount_c = number of c's.\n\nNow, according to the problem:\n\nAfter A and B's steps, the string has some a's (count_a_initial) and some b's (count_b_initial). Then C adds count_c = count_a_initial or count_b_initial.\n\nBut wait, when C adds the c's, the count of a's and b's in the string is the same as before adding the c's. Because the c's are added after. So the count of a's is count_a_initial, and the count of b's is count_b_initial. So the count_c must be equal to either count_a_initial or count_b_initial.\n\nBut in the final string, count_a_initial is equal to the total a's in the string (since no a's were added after), same for count_b_initial. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, but count_a_initial is the original number of a's. Which is exactly the count_a in the final string. Because no a's were added after. Similarly for count_b_initial. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, but the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string at that time. At that time, the string is the original a's and b's. So the count of a's and b's is the same as in the final string. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo for the final string, the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, the original steps require that after B's step, there is at least one a and one b. So count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1. Because the original string from A had at least one a, and B added at least one b.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The string is in the form a* b* c* (i.e., all a's first, then all b's, then all c's).\n\n2. The count of c's is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\n3. count_a >= 1 and count_b >= 1.\n\nBut wait, what about the count_c? For example, suppose the string is \"aabbcc\". Then count_a is 2, count_b is 2, count_c is 2. So count_c equals both count_a and count_b. That's allowed.\n\nBut what if the count_c is equal to count_a, but count_b is zero? Then that's invalid, because B must have added at least one b. So the count_b must be at least 1. Similarly for count_a.\n\nSo the steps for checking are:\n\nCheck that the string is in the correct order (a's followed by b's followed by c's).\n\nThen, check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1.\n\nThen check that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all those conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is \"abc\"? Let's see:\n\ncount_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1. So count_c equals count_a (1) and count_b (1). So that's allowed. So yes.\n\nAnother example: \"aaabccc\" → count_a=3, count_b=1, count_c=3. So count_c equals count_a. So yes.\n\nAnother example: \"bbacc\" → the string is \"bbacc\". Wait, the order is a's followed by b's followed by c's. Let's check. The string is \"bbacc\" → the first two are 'b's, then 'a's? No. So the order is invalid. Because after the initial a's (there are none here), then the first characters are 'b's. But then there's an 'a' later. So the string is not in the correct order. So the second example in the sample input is \"bbacc\", which would have the order of 'b's followed by 'a's followed by 'c's. Which is invalid. Hence, output is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nThird example: \"aabc\" → the order is a's, then b's, then c's. So that's okay. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. So count_c equals count_b. So yes.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Check the order of characters. For example, the string must be in non-decreasing order (since a < b < c). So each character must be >= the previous one. So for example, the string can't have a 'b' followed by an 'a'.\n\nHow to check that?\n\nWe can loop through the string and check that each character is not less than the previous one. For example, for each i from 1 to len(s)-1, check that s[i] >= s[i-1]. If any of them is not, then return NO.\n\nOnce that is done, we can proceed to check the counts.\n\nSo, steps:\n\n1. Check that the string is in non-decreasing order. If not, return NO.\n\n2. Check that the count of a's is at least 1, count of b's is at least 1. Because A and B added at least one each.\n\n3. Check that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all of these are true, return YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string has only a's and c's? For example, \"aacc\". Then, the string is in order. But count_b is zero. So step 2 would fail. Hence, return NO.\n\nAnother example: \"aabbc\" → count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So count_c is neither equal to count_a nor count_b. So returns NO.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nFirst, check the order.\n\nThen, check that count_a >=1, count_b >=1.\n\nThen check count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut how to compute count_a, count_b, count_c?\n\nWe can count them by looping through the string.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nIn Python, for the input string S, we can:\n\ncount_a = S.count('a')\n\ncount_b = S.count('b')\n\ncount_c = S.count('c')\n\nThen, check the order.\n\nBut how to check the order? For example, the string must be all a's, then all b's, then all c's. So, the order can be checked by ensuring that the string is in non-decreasing order. Because 'a' < 'b' < 'c'.\n\nSo, for example, 'aaabbbccc' is valid. 'aabcc' is valid. But 'abba' is invalid.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n    if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n        return 'NO'\n\nBut wait, that's not correct. Because the string can have a's followed by b's followed by c's. So, the characters can be non-decreasing. So, the check is that the string is non-decreasing. So, for example, 'aabbc' is non-decreasing. So, the code for checking the order is:\n\nprev_char = S[0]\n\nfor char in S[1:]:\n\n    if char < prev_char:\n\n        return False\n\n    prev_char = char\n\nSo, that's how to check the order.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\ndef is_ordered(s):\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    return True\n\nSo, if this returns False, then the string is invalid.\n\nOnce that is done, check the counts.\n\nSo, putting it all together.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc'\n\nCheck order: a a a b c c c → yes.\n\ncount_a = 3, count_b=1, count_c=3. count_c equals count_a. So yes.\n\nSample Output: YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → the string is b b a c c. The order is not correct. Because the third character is 'a', which is less than the previous 'b'. So the order check fails. So returns NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is a a b c → yes. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. count_c equals count_b. So yes.\n\nSo sample outputs are correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=1. count_c equals both. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' → order is correct. count_c is 1. count_a=2, count_b=2. So count_c is not equal to either. So returns NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → order is correct. count_c is 0. So count_c is not equal to count_a (1) or count_b (1). So returns NO. Because the third step requires that C appends some c's. So the string must have at least one c. Because C appends some number of c's. So the original string after B's step has a's and b's, then C appends some c's. So the final string must have at least one c. So in the case where the string is 'ab', count_c is 0. Which would not satisfy the condition.\n\nWait, but the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. So the number of 'c's added is at least 1? Or can it be zero?\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string.\"\n\nSo, the number of 'c's added is equal to the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string (before adding the 'c's). So, the number of 'c's added is equal to count_a_initial or count_b_initial. But count_a_initial is at least 1 (from A's step), and count_b_initial is at least 1 (from B's step). So the number of 'c's added is at least 1. Therefore, the final string must have count_c >= 1.\n\nSo in our code, we need to check that count_c is at least 1. Because if the string has no 'c's, then it's invalid.\n\nWait, but the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. So the string must have at least one 'c'?\n\nYes. Because the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. So even if the count of 'c's is zero, that's invalid.\n\nSo in our code, we need to check that count_c is at least 1.\n\nBut in our previous conditions, the count_c is equal to count_a or count_b. So if count_c is zero, then that would not be equal to count_a (which is >=1) or count_b (which is >=1). So the code checks that count_c is equal to count_a or count_b, which implies that count_c is at least 1.\n\nBut in the case where count_c is zero, the code would check that count_c equals count_a (which is 1) or count_b (which is 1). But count_c is zero. So the code would return false. So the code is already handling that case.\n\nSo in the case of 'ab', the count_c is zero. So the code would check if 0 == count_a (1) or count_b (1). Which is false. So returns no. So the code is okay.\n\nAnother example: 'aabbcc' → count_a=2, count_b=2, count_c=2. So count_c equals both. So yes.\n\nBut what if the string is 'aabcc'? Then count_c is 2. count_a is 2, count_b is 1. So count_c equals count_a. So yes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aaaabbbcc' → count_a is 4, count_b is 3, count_c is 2. Then count_c is not equal to either. So returns no.\n\nSo the code would correctly return no.\n\nSo, putting all together, the code needs to:\n\nCheck:\n\n1. The string is ordered (non-decreasing, a's then b's then c's).\n\n2. count_a >=1, count_b >=1.\n\n3. count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all three are true, return yes, else no.\n\nSo now, code steps in Python.\n\nRead the input string S.\n\nCheck if the string is ordered. How?\n\nImplement the check for non-decreasing order.\n\nThen, count the a's, b's, c's.\n\nCheck that count_a >=1, count_b >=1.\n\nCheck count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf all, then yes, else no.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc'?\n\ncount_c is 2, count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So count_c equals count_a and count_b. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1. So count_c equals count_a. So yes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead S from input.\n\nThen:\n\ndef check(s):\n\n    # check order\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    # check counts\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a ==0 or count_b ==0:\n\n        return False\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        return True\n\n    else:\n\n        return False\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc'?\n\ncount_c is 2, which equals count_a (2) and count_b (2). So returns True.\n\nBut what if the string is 'aabbcc' but the count_c is 2, which is equal to count_a and count_b. So yes.\n\nSo the code would return True.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is 'aabcc'? count_a is 2, count_b is 1, count_c is 2. So count_c equals count_a. So returns True.\n\nBut what about the string 'aabbc'? count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So count_c is not equal to either. So returns false.\n\nSo code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'a'? Then, the code checks:\n\norder is okay (only one character). count_a is 1, count_b is 0. So returns false. Correct.\n\nAnother case: 'ab' → count_c is 0. So returns false.\n\nAnother case: 'abc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 1, count_b is 1. So count_c equals both. So returns true.\n\nSo code returns true. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that the input is a string. So, for example, in the sample input, the first input is 'aaabccc', which is passed as a string.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead S from input.\n\nCheck the order.\n\nThen check counts.\n\nSo, the code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen, check the order.\n\nBut in code:\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n\n    # check order\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    # check counts\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0:\n\n        return False\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        return True\n\n    else:\n\n        return False\n\nif is_valid(s):\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is 'abbbc'? Let's see:\n\ncount_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1. So count_c equals count_a. So yes.\n\nBut the code returns True.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the string 'abbcc'? The order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=2, count_c=2. count_c equals count_b. So yes.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the string 'abbcc'? The code returns True.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → code returns True → YES.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → order is invalid. So returns False → NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. count_c equals count_b → yes.\n\nSo code returns yes.\n\nSo sample outputs are correct.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → returns yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbaacc' → the order is not correct. Because after the first two a's, then two b's, then a's again. So the code returns false.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabcc'?\n\nThe order is a a b c c → correct. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=2. So count_c equals count_a → yes.\n\nSo code returns yes.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. count_a=2, count_b=2. So count_c is not equal to either. So returns no.\n\nSo code returns no.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aaaabbbbcccc'? Then count_a is 4, count_b is 4, count_c is 4. So count_c equals count_a and count_b. So returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat if the string is 'aaaabbbbcc'? count_c is 2. count_a=4, count_b=4. So count_c is not equal to either. So returns no.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc'? count_c is 2, which equals count_a (2) and count_b (2). So returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: 'ab' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=0. So count_c is not equal to either. So returns no.\n\nEdge case 2: 'abc' → count_c is 1, which equals count_a and count_b. So returns yes.\n\nEdge case 3: 'ac' → order is correct? Let's see. 'a' followed by 'c' → yes. But count_b is 0. So returns no.\n\nEdge case 4: 'aacc' → order correct. count_a=2, count_b=0 → returns no.\n\nEdge case 5: 'abcc' → count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=2. So count_c is not equal to either. So returns no.\n\nEdge case 6: 'abbbc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 1, count_b is 3. So count_c equals count_a → yes.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: 'a' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=0 → returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'b' → same as above.\n\nAnother case: 'c' → same as above.\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 1, count_b is 1. So count_c is not equal to either. So returns no.\n\nAnother case: 'abbcc' → count_c is 2. count_b is 2. So returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all these cases.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut note that the input is read as a single line. So, the code can be written as:\n\nRead the input string, then perform the checks.\n\nNow, code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n\n    # Check order\n\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n            return False\n\n    # Check counts\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0:\n\n        return False\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nif is_valid(s):\n\n    print(\"YES\")\n\nelse:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So count_c is not equal to either, so returns false. So code returns false.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the string is 'aabbc' → the code returns false. Which is correct.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → returns yes.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → order check fails (the third character is 'a', which is less than 'b' (second character). So returns false.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is correct. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. So count_c equals count_b. returns yes.\n\nSample outputs match.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → returns yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbcc' → returns yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbcc' → returns yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabcc' → returns yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abba' → order check fails.\n\nAnother test case: 'abbc' → order is correct. count_a=1, count_b=2, count_c=1. count_c equals count_a → yes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by appending 'a's, followed by 'b's, and then 'c's in a specific manner. The key constraints are that the string must be in non-decreasing order of characters ('a' followed by 'b' followed by 'c'), and the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: Ensure the string is in non-decreasing order of characters. This means all 'a's must come first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string.\n3. **Validate Counts**: Ensure there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. Additionally, check if the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ns = input().strip()\n\ndef is_valid(s):\n    # Check if the string is in non-decreasing order\n    for i in range(1, len(s)):\n        if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n            return False\n    # Count the occurrences of each character\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    # Check if there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0:\n        return False\n    # Check if the number of 'c's equals count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return True\n    return False\n\nif is_valid(s):\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The loop checks if each character in the string is not less than the previous character, ensuring the string is in non-decreasing order.\n2. **Character Counting**: Using `count` method, we determine the number of 'a', 'b', and 'c' characters.\n3. **Validation**: We ensure there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' (since the problem states that both A and B added at least one of their respective characters). Finally, we check if the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's, which is required by the problem constraints.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all necessary conditions with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, making it suitable for the input size constraints.",
