The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks and the circular arrangement.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The explanation says she moves 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Start at 1. First task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise, that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Then task 1 is done. Then task 2 is at 2. But she's currently at 3. To get to 2, since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. So that adds 3. Then task 2 is done. Then task 3 is at 3 again. She's at 2, so moving clockwise to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach here is to track her current position and accumulate the time needed to move from her current position to the next task's house, considering the direction (clockwise only).\n\nBut how to compute the time between two positions?\n\nLet's think: For each consecutive pair of tasks (current position and next task's position), the time taken is the minimal steps moving clockwise. Wait, but since the movement is only allowed clockwise, the number of steps between current position (curr) and target (next) is (next - curr) mod n? No, wait. Because if curr is 3 and next is 2 in a 4-house setup, then moving clockwise would require 3 steps (3→4→1→2). Which is (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4 = ( -1 +4 ) = 3. So in general, the steps between curr and next is (next - curr) if next >= curr, else (next - curr + n). But since we can't go backward, the steps are (next - curr) if next is larger than curr, else (n - curr + next). Which is equivalent to (next - curr) % n if the movement is allowed only clockwise. Wait, no. Let me think: if curr is 3 and next is 2, then (next - curr) is -1, mod 4 would be 3. Which is correct. So the formula for the steps between curr and next is (next - curr) if next >= curr, else (next - curr + n). Which can be written as (next - curr) % n if the modulo is positive. Wait, but in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative result. So (next - curr) % n gives the correct number of steps. For example, when next is 2 and curr is 3, (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nWait, but what if next is equal to curr? Then the steps are zero. So that's handled correctly.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Start at position 1.\n\n- For each task in the order given (from a_1 to a_m), compute the steps needed to get from the current position to the task's position, add that to the total time, then update the current position to the task's position.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then the steps between them is zero. So the code should process all tasks in order, and for each, compute the steps from the previous position (which could be same as current task's position, leading to zero steps).\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n    steps = (a_i - current_pos) % n ?\n\n    Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose n is 4. If current_pos is 3 and a_i is 2. Then (2 - 3) mod 4 is 3, which is correct. But if current_pos is 3 and a_i is 3, then steps is 0. Correct.\n\nYes. So the steps between current_pos and a_i is (a_i - current_pos) if a_i >= current_pos, else (a_i - current_pos + n). Which is equivalent to (a_i - current_pos) % n. However, since in Python, the modulo operator returns a non-negative value, this would be correct.\n\nWait, let's test some examples:\n\nCase 1: current_pos = 3, a_i = 2, n=4. (2-3) is -1. -1 % 4 is 3. Correct.\n\nCase 2: current_pos = 3, a_i = 3. (3-3) is 0. 0%4=0. Correct.\n\nCase 3: current_pos = 1, a_i = 3. (3-1) is 2. 2%4=2. Correct.\n\nCase 4: current_pos = 4, a_i = 1. (1-4) is -3. -3 mod 4 is 1. Which is correct: moving from 4 to 1 is one step clockwise.\n\nYes. So the formula (a_i - current_pos) % n gives the correct steps needed.\n\nBut wait, let me check. For example, when current_pos is 4 and a_i is 1, the steps are 1. Which is correct. So the formula works.\n\nTherefore, for each task, compute (a_i - current_pos) % n and add to the total_time, then set current_pos to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the tasks must be completed in order. So the first task is a_1, then a_2, etc. So the code must process the tasks in the order given.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's (m elements).\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each a in the list:\n\n    steps = (a - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current_pos = a\n\nreturn total_time\n\nWait, but let's test this with the first example.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3, 2, 3]\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 3. steps = (3-1) mod 4 = 2. total_time is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond a is 2. steps = (2-3) mod 4 = (-1) mod 4 = 3. total_time is 2+3=5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird a is 3. steps = (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total_time is 5+1=6. Which matches the example. Correct.\n\nAnother example given is input '4 3\\n2 3 3' which outputs 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst a is 2. steps = (2-1) mod 4 = 1. total is 1. current_pos is 2.\n\nSecond a is 3. steps = (3-2) mod4=1. total is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nThird a is 3. steps = 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: All tasks are in the same house. For example, n=5, m=3, a=[1,1,1]. Then steps between them are 0, 0, 0. Total time is 0.\n\nEdge case 2: When moving around the ring multiple times.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a = [1,2]. Steps: first step is (1-1) mod 2 = 0. Then (2-1) mod 2 = 1. Total is 1. Which is correct: start at 1, move to 2 (1 step).\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a = [2,1]. Steps: first step is (2-1) mod 2 = 1. Then (1-2) mod 2 = ( -1 ) mod 2 = 1. Total is 2. Which is correct: 1 →2 (step 1), then 2 →1 (step 1). Total 2 steps.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct.\n\nNow, considering the constraints: n and m can be up to 1e5, which is manageable. The code will process m elements in O(m) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead the input. The first line is n and m. The second line is m integers.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. Wait, the sample input shows two examples. But the problem says that the input is given as per the problem's input format. Wait, the user provided two examples, but in the actual problem, the input is one test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and m. The second line contains m integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows two examples, like:\n\nInput:\n\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\nBut that's probably part of the problem's example, but in reality, the code needs to read one input. So perhaps the user is providing two test cases, but in the actual problem, the code should read one input.\n\nWait, the problem's input is as follows: the first line contains n and m, the second line contains m integers. So the code should read two lines. But in the sample input, there are two examples. But perhaps that's part of the problem's sample input, but in practice, the code should process one input.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin. So in Python, the code can read the first line as n and m, then the second line as the list of a_i.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example's input is:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nWhich gives output 6.\n\nSo the code would process that.\n\nSo the code in Python would be:\n\nRead n and m from input. Then read the list of a's.\n\nBut in Python, sometimes reading inputs can be tricky. So perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut need to make sure that the second line has exactly m numbers.\n\nOnce that is read, then process as per the algorithm.\n\nNow, code:\n\ncurrent_pos = 1\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    steps = (num - current_pos) % n\n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current_pos = num\n\nprint(total_time)\n\nWait, but let's test this with the sample input.\n\nSample 1: n=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]. The code would compute:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst num is 3: steps (3-1) mod 4 is 2. total is 2. current_pos is 3.\n\nSecond num is 2: (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3. total is 5. current_pos is 2.\n\nThird num is 3: (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total is 6. Correct.\n\nSample 2: n=4, m=3, a = [2,3,3]. \n\ncurrent_pos is 1.\n\nFirst num is 2: steps (2-1) mod4 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond num is 3: (3-2) mod4 = 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird num is 3: steps 0. total remains 2. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: when n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. The code would compute:\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst num is 2: steps (2-1) mod 2 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond num is 1: (1-2) mod 2 = -1 mod 2 = 1. total is 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about when the list is empty? Well, m is at least 1. Because according to the input constraints, m is >=1? Wait, the input says m can be 1. Because the constraints are 1 ≤ m ≤ 1e5. So m is at least 1.\n\nSo the code is okay.\n\nBut what if the list is empty? Well, the problem says m is at least 1.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nSo the Python code is straightforward. Now, implement that.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operation for negative numbers returns a positive value. For example, (-1) % 4 is 3. So that's correct.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, write the code accordingly.\n\nThe code would be:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the list of a's.\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1, total_time as 0.\n\nLoop over each element in a:\n\n   steps = (num - current_pos) % n\n\n   total_time += steps\n\n   current_pos = num\n\nPrint total_time.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is simple. Let's test with the sample input.\n\nNow, the code should be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\ncurrent = 1\ntime = 0\nfor num in a:\n    diff = (num - current) % n\n    time += diff\n    current = num\nprint(time)\n\nThat's the code.\n\nLet me check for the case where n=2, m=2, a=[1,1]. The code would compute:\n\ncurrent starts at 1. first num is 1: diff is 0. time is 0. current is 1. second num is 1: diff 0. total is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=5, m=2, a=[3, 5]. Starting at 1.\n\nFirst step: (3-1) mod5 = 2. time is 2. current is 3. Next step: (5-3) mod5= 2. total is 4. So total time is 4. Which is correct: 1→2→3 (steps 2), then 3→4→5 (steps 2). Total 4.\n\nYes.\n\nLooks good. So this should handle all cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the time required to move between houses in the correct order, considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia can only move clockwise around the ringroad. The time taken to move from one house to another is calculated based on their positions in this circular arrangement.\n2. **Modulo Operation for Circular Movement**: To handle the circular nature of the ringroad, we use the modulo operation. The time to move from the current position to the next task's position is computed as `(next_position - current_position) % n`, where `n` is the number of houses. This ensures that we correctly handle wrap-around movements.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from house 1, we iterate through each task in the given order, updating the total time and current position after each move.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    current = 1\n    total_time = 0\n    for num in a:\n        diff = (num - current) % n\n        total_time += diff\n        current = num\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read using `sys.stdin.readline()` for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1 and initialize the total time to 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, we calculate the time required to move from the current house to the task's house using the modulo operation to handle circular movement. This time is added to the total time, and the current position is updated to the task's house.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, the accumulated total time is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad, resulting in an optimal O(m) time complexity where m is the number of tasks.",
