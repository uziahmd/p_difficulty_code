The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Xenia moving around a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement. But how?\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are at 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1, first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise, that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Time taken is 2.\n- Then, the second task is at 2. But since she's currently at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around. From 3 to 4 (1 step), then 4 to 1 (another), then 1 to 2 (another). That's 3 steps. So total time now is 2 + 3 = 5?\nWait, but the example says the total is 6. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the example again. The example says the total steps are 6. Let me recount:\n\nThe sequence is 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. Let's count the steps between each move:\n\nFrom 1 to 2: 1 step (time 1)\nThen 2→3: another (total 2)\nThen 3→4: (3)\nThen 4→1: (4)\nThen 1→2: (5)\nThen 2→3: (6). So total 6 steps. Oh right. So the first task is at 3, which requires moving from 1 to 3. But how many steps? Well, in the example, the first move is from 1 to 3. But in the path given, that's two steps. So that's 2 steps. Then the second task is at 2. So from 3 to 2, which is clockwise? Wait, no. Because the ringroad is clockwise. So moving clockwise from 3 to 2 would require going around the entire circle. Because moving clockwise, the next houses after 3 are 4, then 1, then 2. So from 3 to 2, moving clockwise is 3 steps. So that's adding 3 steps. Then the third task is at 3 again. So from 2 to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the problem is to calculate the sum of the distances between consecutive tasks, where each distance is the minimal number of steps moving clockwise from the current position to the next task's house.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nLet me think. Let's say Xenia is currently at position prev. The next task is at a_i. How to compute the steps needed to get from prev to a_i clockwise?\n\nIf prev is less than a_i, then the steps are a_i - prev. But if prev is greater than a_i, then it's (n - prev) + a_i. For example, if prev is 3 and a_i is 2, then steps are (4 - 3) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3. Which matches the example.\n\nWait, but in that case, for prev=3 and a_i=2, the steps are (n - prev) + a_i? Let me check. n is 4. So 4-3 is 1, plus 2 is 3 steps. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if prev is 4 and a_i is 1? Then steps would be (4 -4) + 1 = 0 +1 = 1. Which is correct. Because moving from 4 to 1 is one step clockwise.\n\nSo the formula for steps between prev and current a_i is (a_i - prev) if a_i >= prev, else (n - prev + a_i).\n\nAlternatively, this can be written as (a_i - prev) if a_i >= prev else (n - prev + a_i). But how to compute that in code?\n\nAlternatively, the steps can be calculated as (a_i - prev) % n? No, because for example, when prev is 3 and a_i is 2, (2 -3) mod 4 is (-1) mod 4 = 3. Which is correct. So yes! So the steps between prev and a_i is (a_i - prev) if a_i >= prev, else (a_i - prev + n). Which is equivalent to (a_i - prev + n) % n. Wait, but (a_i - prev) could be negative. So for example, if a_i is 2 and prev is 3, (2-3) is -1. Adding n (4) gives 3, which is correct. So the steps between prev and a_i is (a_i - prev + n) % n. Wait, but if a_i is larger than prev, then (a_i - prev) is positive, and mod n would be same as a_i - prev. So yes, that formula would work.\n\nBut wait, let's test:\n\nCase 1: prev=3, a_i=2. (2-3 +4) = 3. mod 4 is 3. Correct.\n\nCase 2: prev=1, a_i=3. (3-1) = 2. mod 4 is 2. Correct.\n\nCase 3: prev=4, a_i=1. (1-4 +4) = 1. mod 4 is 1. Correct.\n\nYes, so the steps between prev and a_i is (a_i - prev + n) % n. But since in Python, modulo can handle negative numbers, but perhaps we can compute it as (a_i - prev) if a_i >= prev else (a_i - prev + n). But perhaps the formula (a_i - prev) % n would give the same result. Wait, for example, (2-3) is -1. mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So (a_i - prev) % n would give the correct steps.\n\nWait, but (a_i - prev) can be negative. But in Python, the modulo operation returns a non-negative result. So yes, (a_i - prev) % n would give the correct steps. So for example, if prev is 3 and a_i is 2, (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the steps between prev and a_i is (a_i - prev) % n. But wait, let me check with another example. If prev is 2 and a_i is 3, then (3-2) mod 4 is 1. Correct. If prev is 2 and a_i is 2, then (2-2) mod 4 is 0. Which is correct. So yes, that formula works.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So for example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then the time added is zero. So that's handled correctly by this formula.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Initialize current position as 1 (since she starts there).\n\n- For each task in the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m:\n\n   - Compute the steps from current position to a_i, using (a_i - current) % n.\n\n   - Add that to the total time.\n\n   - Update current position to a_i.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the tasks must be completed in order, and that you can't do task i unless all previous tasks (with numbers less than i) are done. So the order of the tasks is fixed. So the list a_1, a_2, ..., a_m is the order in which the tasks must be done. So even if a_1 is 3, then a_2 is 3, then a_3 is 3, etc., we have to process them in order. So the steps between each consecutive pair of tasks is calculated as per the formula above.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward. Let's take the first example:\n\nn=4, m=3, a = [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent = 1\n\nFirst task is 3. steps = (3-1) mod 4 = 2. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nSecond task is 2. steps = (2-3) mod 4 = (-1) mod 4 = 3. total is 2+3=5. current is 2.\n\nThird task is 3. steps = (3-2) mod 4 = 1. total is 5+1=6. Which matches the example.\n\nAnother example given is input ['4 3\\n2 3 3'], output is 2.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=4, m=3, a=[2,3,3]\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 2. steps = (2-1) mod4 = 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3. steps (3-2) mod4=1. total 2. current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3. steps (3-3) mod4=0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to work.\n\nNow, the problem is to read the input, process the list of a_i's, and compute the sum of steps between consecutive positions, starting from 1.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nRead n and m. Then read the list of m integers.\n\nInitialize current = 1, total_time = 0.\n\nFor each ai in the list:\n\n   steps = (ai - current) % n\n\n   total_time += steps\n\n   current = ai\n\nAt the end, print total_time.\n\nBut wait, let me check for some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=2, m=1, a=[1]. Then steps is (1-1) mod2=0. So total is 0. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[1,2]. Steps from 1 to 1 is 0. Then from 1 to 2: (2-1) mod2=1. Total is 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. Steps from 1 to 2: (2-1) mod2=1. Then from 2 to 1: (1-2) mod2 = (-1) mod2=1. Total is 2.\n\nWhich is correct. Because moving from 2 to 1 clockwise is one step.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead the first line as n and m. Then the second line as list of integers.\n\nBut note that in the input, the second line is m integers. So for example, in the first sample input, the second line is '3 2 3'.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead from stdin. Let's use input().split().\n\nBut for Python, the code could be:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    diff = (ai - current) % n\n\n    total += diff\n\n    current = ai\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what about when n is 1? Wait, according to the problem statement, n is at least 2. Because the first line says 2 ≤ n ≤ 1e5. So no problem.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the first example:\n\nInput:\n\n4 3\n\n3 2 3\n\nProcessing:\n\ncurrent is 1.\n\nai=3: (3-1) mod4= 2 → total 2. current=3.\n\nai=2: (2-3) mod4 is (-1) mod4=3 → total 5. current=2.\n\nai=3: (3-2) mod4=1 → total 6. Output is 6. Correct.\n\nSecond example:\n\n4 3\n\n2 3 3.\n\ncurrent=1.\n\nai=2: (2-1) mod4=1 → total 1. current=2.\n\nai=3: (3-2)=1 mod4=1 → total 2. current=3.\n\nai=3: (3-3)=0 → total remains 2. Output 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, m=2, a=[2,1]. The code would compute:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nai=2: (2-1) mod2=1 → total 1. current=2.\n\nai=1: (1-2) mod2= (-1) mod2=1 → total 2. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what if the list a has elements that are not in order? Like, for example, a = [3, 1, 2], n=4. Let's see:\n\ncurrent starts at 1.\n\nFirst ai is 3: steps (3-1) mod4=2 → total 2. current=3.\n\nSecond ai is 1: (1-3) mod4 = (-2) mod4= 2 → total 4. current=1.\n\nThird ai is 2: (2-1) mod4=1 → total 5. So total steps is 5.\n\nWhich would be the correct path:\n\n1→3 (2 steps), then 3→1 (2 steps: 3→4→1), then 1→2 (1 step). Total 2+2+1=5. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as described.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the time required to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and must complete tasks in the given order. Each task requires her to be at a specific house, and moving from one house to an adjacent house takes one unit of time. The movement is clockwise.\n2. **Circular Movement Calculation**: To calculate the time taken to move from the current house to the next task's house, we use modular arithmetic. The formula `(ai - current) % n` gives the correct number of steps needed to move clockwise from the current position to the target house, where `n` is the total number of houses.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: For each task, compute the steps required from the current position to the task's house, update the total time, and adjust the current position to the task's house for the next iteration.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor ai in a:\n    diff = (ai - current) % n\n    total_time += diff\n    current = ai\n\nprint(total_time)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The first line of input contains the number of houses `n` and the number of tasks `m`. The second line contains the list of task positions.\n- **Initialization**: Start at house 1 with a total time of 0.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the steps required to move from the current house to the target house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road. Update the total time and current position after each task.\n- **Output Result**: After processing all tasks, print the total accumulated time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement, resulting in an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
