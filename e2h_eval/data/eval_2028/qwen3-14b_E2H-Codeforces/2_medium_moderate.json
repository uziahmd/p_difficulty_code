Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, for each cell in the grid, determine if it's on either of the two diagonals. For a square of size n x n (where n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). \n\nFor each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So, any cell that is on either of these two lines is part of the diagonals.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's say the diagonal character is 'd'.\n- Check that all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same, and that this character is different from 'd'.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal characters. Then check that they are all the same. Then collect all non-diagonal characters and check they are all same and different from the diagonal.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the two diagonals have different characters. For example, if the main diagonal is 'x' and the anti-diagonal is 'y'. Then the first condition fails. So, the first step is to check that all diagonal cells (both diagonals) have the same character.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nStep 1: Check all diagonal cells (both diagonals) have the same character.\n\nHow to collect them? For each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\nIf i == j or i + j == n-1, then it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo, collect all these characters, and check that they are all the same.\n\nBut wait, for the center cell (since n is odd), it's part of both diagonals. So, in that case, it's counted once, but it's same as others.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, then collect all the non-diagonal cells. Check that they are all the same, and that they are different from the diagonal character.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Check all diagonal cells are same. Let's call this char D.\n2. Check all non-diagonal cells are same. Let's call this char N.\n3. Check that D != N.\n\nIf all three conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, read input. The first line is n, then n lines of strings.\n\nBut the input is given as a list of strings. Wait, the sample input shows something like ['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', ...]. Wait, perhaps the input is read as multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of inputs, and the output is a list of outputs. But in the problem statement, the input is supposed to be read from standard input. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given as per the first line being n, then n lines of letters. However, the sample input seems to be given as multiple test cases. But perhaps the user is supposed to process multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is the first line containing integer n, then n lines of letters. But the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases. For example, the sample input is given as a list of three inputs, each with their own n and grid. The output is a list of three outputs.\n\nBut that's probably because the sample input is given in a way that represents multiple test cases. However, in the actual programming problem, the input is for a single test case. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the problem statement's input description:\n\nThe first line contains integer n. Then n lines follow. So, the input is for a single test case. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of inputs for multiple test cases. But in reality, when the code is run, it's supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases? Or is the sample input just an example of multiple test cases?\n\nWait, the original problem's input is for one test case. But the sample input shows three different inputs. However, the way the sample input is presented is perhaps as a list of inputs for multiple test cases. But in the actual programming problem, the code should process a single test case. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the problem statement's input description again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\nSo, the input is for one test case. But in the sample input, there are three separate test cases. So perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases, each with their own input. But in reality, the code should process a single test case. But perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that is not the actual input format. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of inputs, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\xpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nThis suggests that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. So perhaps the sample input is formatted in a way that each test case is given as a string. But in reality, the code is supposed to read from standard input, which may have multiple test cases. But that's not clear from the problem statement.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's input and output sections. The problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains integer n ... \n\nOutput:\n\nPrint string \"YES\" ... \n\nSo, the input is for a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input and output are given as lists, but that's probably for the purpose of the example. For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the sample input is shown as multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process one test case. However, in this problem, perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, the problem's sample input and output show that for three different inputs, the outputs are given. But in the problem's input description, it's unclear whether the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, looking at the problem's original source, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case.\n\nWait, looking at the original problem's sample input and output. For example, the first input is 5, followed by 5 lines. Then another input for 3, etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line is n. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases until EOF. But that's not clear.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description does not mention that. This is confusing. However, the user's note says that the code should read input from standard input and print to standard output. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sample input is presented as a list of inputs for multiple test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input's structure is not clear. For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the sample input is given with multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to process one. But in this case, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line is n, so perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases. How can that be?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is given in the form of a list of strings, where each string represents a separate test case. For example, the first test case is:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n3\nwsw\nsws\nwsw\n\nThird test case:\n\n3\nxpx\npxp\nxpe\n\nSo, the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each given in the input. But how is that determined? How many test cases are there? The problem's input description does not mention that. So perhaps the sample input is written in a way that's not the actual input format. Maybe the original problem's input is for a single test case, and the sample input shows three different examples. However, in the problem's original statement, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case, and the sample input is given as three separate test cases, but in reality, the code would process one at a time.\n\nBut how to reconcile this? Well, looking at the problem's original input and output, the sample input shows that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear. However, looking at the original problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how to read them?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented in a way that the code is supposed to process a single test case, and the sample input is given as a list of possible test cases. But in the code submission, the code would read from stdin, which would be one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original statement, the sample input is given as a list of inputs and outputs. But the code is supposed to read from standard input. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each of which is given as per the input description. For example, the code reads until EOF, processing each test case. However, the problem's input description does not mention that. This is a bit ambiguous.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read input from stdin and print to stdout. So, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. For example, in the sample input, the code would read three test cases. However, the problem's original input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. So, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each starting with an n, then n lines.\n\nIn that case, the code would read all test cases until EOF. For example, in the sample input, there are three test cases. So, the code would read each one, process, and output the corresponding result.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nWell, for example, in programming competitions, sometimes the code is expected to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is unclear. However, the sample input shows that the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in Python, the code could read all lines from stdin, split them into test cases, and process each.\n\nBut how to parse that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that is not the actual input format. For example, perhaps the sample input is a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input and output show that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? For example, in the sample input, each test case is given as a string that starts with n, then n lines. So, for example, the first test case is:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nSo, the code needs to read lines until there are no more lines. So, perhaps the code can read all lines first, then process them in groups.\n\nBut how to handle that in code?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process each test case. For example, the code can read all lines into a list, then process them in a loop.\n\nBut for each test case, the first line is n, then n lines follow. So, the code can process the lines in groups of (n+1) lines.\n\nBut how to handle multiple test cases?\n\nBut the problem's original input description says that the first line is n, then n lines. So, perhaps the code is supposed to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. So, perhaps the sample input is given as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample output shows that the code returns multiple outputs. Therefore, this suggests that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is conflicting. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking back at the problem's original sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nSo, each element in the input list represents a test case. For example, the first test case is a string that starts with 5, followed by 5 lines. The code would process each test case and output the corresponding result. So, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should read from standard input, which may contain multiple test cases. But how to read them?\n\nIn programming competitions, when multiple test cases are present, the input is usually given as follows: the first line contains the number of test cases T, followed by T test cases. However, in this problem's input description, there is no such line. Therefore, perhaps the code is supposed to read until EOF. So, for example, in the sample input, there are three test cases, each given as per the input description.\n\nThus, the code needs to read all lines from stdin, and process each test case as per the input format.\n\nSo, the code will process each test case as follows:\n\nRead n from input. Then read n lines, each of length n.\n\nBut how to read multiple test cases? For example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them in a loop.\n\nBut how to handle the lines. For example, for each test case:\n\nThe first line is n. Then next n lines are the grid.\n\nSo, the code can read all lines into a list, then process them.\n\nLet me think of the code structure.\n\nIn Python, we can read all lines as:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nThen, process the lines as per test cases.\n\nBut how to process them. Let's imagine that the lines list is:\n\nFor the first test case, the first line is '5', then next 5 lines are the grid. Then, the next line is '3', then next 3 lines are the grid, etc.\n\nSo, the code can process the lines as follows:\n\ncurrent_line = 0\n\nwhile current_line < len(lines):\n\n    n = int(lines[current_line])\n\n    current_line += 1\n\n    grid = []\n\n    for _ in range(n):\n\n        grid.append(lines[current_line])\n\n        current_line += 1\n\n    # process the grid here\n\nBut in the sample input, each test case is given as a single string, but in practice, when reading from stdin, each line is read as a separate entry. However, the sample input is given as a list of strings, but perhaps that's just a way to represent multiple test cases in the sample. For example, the first test case is a string that includes the n and the grid lines.\n\nBut in reality, when the code is run, the input is provided as per normal input. For example, the first line is n, then n lines for the grid, then another line for the next test case's n, etc.\n\nBut this is not clear. However, given the sample input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. Therefore, the code should read all test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut how to handle that in code? Let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nNow, the code must process each test case and output YES or NO for each.\n\nNow, back to the problem's logic.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCheck that all diagonal cells are same.\n\nCheck that all non-diagonal cells are same and different from diagonal.\n\nSo, for a grid of size n x n.\n\nLet me think about how to collect the diagonal characters.\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\nif i == j or i + j == n - 1 → diagonal.\n\nElse → non-diagonal.\n\nSo, for each cell in the grid, check if it is in the diagonal.\n\nSo, for the first part, collect all the diagonal characters. Check that they are all the same.\n\nFor example, for the first sample input:\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=5\n\ngrid:\n\nx o o o x\n\no x o x o\n\ns o x o o\n\no x o x o\n\nx o o o x\n\nSo, the diagonals are:\n\npositions (0,0) → x, (0,4) → x\n\n(1,1) → x, (1,3) → x\n\n(2,2) → x, (2,2) → x (since i + j = 2+2=4 = n-1 (n=5, n-1=4). So yes.\n\n(3,3) → x, (3,1) → x.\n\n(4,4) → x, (4,0) → x.\n\nSo all diagonal cells are x. But in the second row, the third cell (i=1, j=2) is o. Wait, no, the second row is 'oxoxo' → positions (1,0) is o, (1,1) is x, (1,2) is o, (1,3) is x, (1,4) is o. So the diagonal cells for row 1 are (1,1) and (1,3) → x and x.\n\nBut in the third row (i=2), the grid is 'soxoo' → positions (2,0) is s, (2,1) is o, (2,2) is x, (2,3) is o, (2,4) is o. So the diagonal cells are (2,2) (i=2, j=2) and (i=2, j=2) since i + j = 4. So that's x. So the diagonals are all x. However, the non-diagonal cells include the s in (2,0). So the non-diagonal cells are not all same. Hence, the output is NO.\n\nSo the code would check that.\n\nSo, for the first test case, the code would check:\n\nAll diagonals are same (x), then check non-diagonal cells. For example, the cell (2,0) is s, which is different from other non-diagonal cells. Hence, the output is NO.\n\nSo, the code must collect all diagonal characters, check they are same, collect all non-diagonal, check same and different.\n\nNow, how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of steps for each test case:\n\nRead the grid as a list of strings.\n\nCheck that n is odd (but according to the problem statement, n is given as odd, so perhaps no need to check).\n\nFor the diagonals:\n\nCollect all characters where i == j or i + j == n-1.\n\nCheck that all of them are same.\n\nIf not, return NO.\n\nElse, collect all non-diagonal characters. Check that all are same and different from the diagonal character.\n\nIf both conditions are met, return YES, else NO.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nfor each test case:\n\nn = ... \n\ngrid = list of n strings.\n\ndiagonal_chars = set()\n\nnon_diagonal_chars = set()\n\nfor i in 0 to n-1:\n\n    for j in 0 to n-1:\n\n        if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n            diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        else:\n\n            non_diagonal_chars.add(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n    print NO\n\nelse:\n\n    d_char = diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n    if len(non_diagonal_chars) != 1:\n\n        print NO\n\n    else:\n\n        n_char = non_diagonal_chars.pop()\n\n        if d_char != n_char:\n\n            print YES\n\n        else:\n\n            print NO\n\nWait, but this approach would work?\n\nYes. Because:\n\n- All diagonal characters must be same. So, the set diagonal_chars must have size 1.\n\n- All non-diagonal must be same, so set non_diagonal_chars must have size 1.\n\n- And the two sets must be different.\n\nBut what about cases where there are no non-diagonal characters? For example, when n=1. But n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut for n=3, the diagonals have 3 + 3 - 1 = 5 cells (since the center cell is in both diagonals). So, for n=3, the diagonals have 5 cells. The non-diagonal cells are 9-5=4 cells.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nBut let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThe grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\ni=0, j=0 → w. i + j = 0 → 0+0=0, n-1 is 2. So no. Wait, n is 3. So for i + j == 2.\n\nSo for (0,0): i=0, j=0 → i ==j → yes. (0,2) → i + j = 0+2=2 → yes.\n\nSimilarly, (1,1) is on both diagonals. (2,0) → i + j = 2+0=2 → yes. (2,2) → i==j → yes.\n\nSo the diagonal cells are:\n\n(0,0) w, (0,2) w.\n\n(1,1) w.\n\n(2,0) w, (2,2) w.\n\nSo all diagonals are 'w'.\n\nNon-diagonal cells:\n\ncells not on diagonals. For example, (0,1) is s. (1,0) is s. (1,2) is s. (2,1) is s. So all non-diagonal cells are 's'. So the non-diagonal set is {'s'}, which is different from 'w'. So output YES. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nSo grid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e\n\nCheck diagonals:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x.\n\n(1,1) x.\n\n(2,0) x, (2,2) e.\n\nSo, the diagonal characters are x, x, x, x, e. So the set diagonal_chars is {x, e} → len is 2. So output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for the diagonals, we collect all characters in the diagonals. So, for the third test case, the diagonals have x, x, x, x, e. So the set has size 2. So the code returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, in Python, for each test case, read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut how to read from stdin? For example, in Python, using input() function. However, when multiple test cases are present, the code can read until EOF.\n\nBut how to handle that? For example, in some programming competition platforms, the code can read all lines at once.\n\nBut for the code to handle multiple test cases, the code can read all lines first, then process them as per the test cases.\n\nBut how to read the lines? Let me think of the code.\n\nThe code can be structured as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    while ptr < len(lines):\n\n        n = int(lines[ptr])\n\n        ptr +=1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            grid.append(lines[ptr])\n\n            ptr +=1\n\n        # process grid here\n\n        # compute diagonals and non-diagonals\n\n        diagonal = set()\n\n        non_diagonal = set()\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if i == j or i + j == n-1:\n\n                    diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\n                else:\n\n                    non_diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        if len(diagonal) != 1:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            d_char = diagonal.pop()\n\n            if len(non_diagonal) != 1:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n            else:\n\n                n_char = non_diagonal.pop()\n\n                if d_char != n_char:\n\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n                else:\n\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first test case has n=5, and the grid lines. So, the code would process that correctly.\n\nBut what if the input has leading or trailing spaces? According to the problem statement, each of the next n lines contains n small letters. So, the lines should be read as is, but in the code, the line.strip() would remove leading and trailing whitespace. However, the problem says that each line contains exactly n letters. So, perhaps the code should read the line as is, but perhaps the line.strip() is not needed. However, in practice, when reading from stdin, the lines may have trailing newlines. So, using line.strip() would remove any leading/trailing whitespace, which could be problematic if the input lines have leading or trailing spaces. But according to the problem statement, each line contains exactly n letters. Therefore, perhaps the code should read the line as is, but using line.rstrip('\\n') to remove the newline character, but not other whitespace. However, in practice, the code may read the line with line.strip(), but that could cause issues if the input lines have leading or trailing spaces. But according to the problem statement, each line has exactly n letters, so the code can safely read each line as line.strip().\n\nBut perhaps it's better to read the entire line except for the newline. For example, using line.rstrip('\\n').\n\nBut in practice, for programming competition problems, the code can read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut in the code above, the lines are read as [line.strip() ... ].\n\nBut in the case of the input lines, for example, the first line is '5', then the next lines are the grid. So, for example, if a grid line is 'xooox', then line.strip() would return that as is.\n\nSo, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, testing the code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThe code would read n=5, then the grid. For the diagonals:\n\nCheck all cells. For example, (2,0) is 's' which is not on the diagonal. Wait, for i=2, j=0: i + j = 2 + 0 = 2. n-1 is 4. So 2 != 4. So not on diagonal. So the cell (2,0) is non-diagonal. So, in the code, the non_diagonal set includes 's', which is different from others. So the non_diagonal set would have multiple elements. Hence, the code would output NO.\n\nSample Input 2: 3, wsw, sws, wsw → code outputs YES.\n\nSample Input 3: 3, xpx, pxp, xpe → code outputs NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where n=3, and all diagonals are same, and non-diagonals are same.\n\nExample:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals: a, a, a, a, a → all a. Non-diagonal: positions (0,1) is a, (1,0) is b, (1,2) is b, (2,1) is a. So non-diagonal has {a, b} → len is 2 → output NO.\n\nAnother case:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa → non-diagonal cells are (0,1)=a, (1,0)=b, (1,2)=b, (2,1)=a. So non-diagonal set has a and b. So output NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal is same. For example:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\nbaa\n\naaa\n\nDiagonals are (0,0) a, (0,2) a; (1,1) a; (2,0) a, (2,2) a. So diagonals are all a. Non-diagonal cells are (0,1) a, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) a. So non-diagonal set is {a, b} → len is 2 → output NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal is same. For example:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa → non-diagonal cells are (0,1) a, (1,0) b, (1,2) b, (2,1) a. So non-diagonal set has a and b. So output NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal is same. For example:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\nbbb\n\naaa → diagonals are a, a, a, a, a. non-diagonal cells are (0,1) a, (1,0) b, (1,2) b, (2,1) a. So non-diagonal set is {a, b} → output NO.\n\nAnother case where non-diagonal is same. For example:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\nbaa\n\naaa → non-diagonal cells are (0,1) a, (1,0) b, (1,2) a, (2,1) a. So non-diagonal has a and b → len 2 → output NO.\n\nSo, how to get non-diagonal to be same?\n\nFor example:\n\nn=3\n\naaa\n\naba\n\naaa → no. What if non-diagonal is all b?\n\nLike:\n\nn=3\n\nabb\n\nbab\n\nbba → diagonals are a (0,0), b (0,2), b (1,1), b (2,0), a (2,2). So diagonals have {a, b} → len 2 → output NO.\n\nNot good.\n\nAnother example where diagonals are all same, non-diagonal are same and different.\n\nn=3:\n\nxxx\n\nxox\n\nxxx → diagonals are x, x, x, x, x. non-diagonal cells are (0,1) x, (1,0) x, (1,2) x, (2,1) x. So non-diagonal is all x. So d_char is x, n_char is x → same. So output NO.\n\nSo, the code correctly returns NO.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=3:\n\nxxx\n\noxo\n\nxxx → diagonals are x, x, x, x, x. non-diagonal cells are o, o, o, o. So non-diagonal is o. So d_char is x, n_char is o. So output YES.\n\nYes. So code would output YES.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother case: n=3, all cells are same. Then diagonals are same, non-diagonal same. But same as diagonals. So output NO.\n\nSo, code handles that.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the non-diagonal is empty? Well, n is at least 3. For n=3, the number of non-diagonal cells is 9 - 5 = 4. So no.\n\nNow, code can be written as described.\n\nNow, the code reads all lines, processes each test case.\n\nBut in the code, the lines are read as [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]. But in the case where a line is empty, it's skipped. However, according to the problem statement, the input is properly formed. So, perhaps the code can read all lines, including empty ones. But in practice, for programming competition input, each test case is properly formed. However, the code may need to process lines properly.\n\nBut perhaps the code should read all lines, even empty ones. However, the code uses line.strip() which removes leading and trailing whitespace, and if the line is empty after stripping, it is excluded. But this could cause issues if the input has empty lines. However, according to the problem statement, the input is correct. So, perhaps the code can process the lines as:\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n\nBut for the purposes of code, perhaps the code should read all lines, including those with leading/trailing spaces, but according to the problem statement, each line has exactly n letters.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps the code should read each line as input().strip().\n\nBut for the code to read multiple test cases, the code may need to read lines until EOF.\n\nBut in the code above, the code reads all lines into a list, and then processes them. So, the code should work.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, the code must be written in Python, reading from stdin, and outputting the correct answers.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample input:\n\nThe sample input is given as three test cases. However, in practice, when the code is run, the input is passed as per the standard input. For example, the first test case is:\n\n5\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\nThen the second test case is:\n\n3\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThird test case:\n\n3\n\nxpx\n\npxp\n\nxpe\n\nThe code would process each of these, and output NO, YES, NO.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The code uses line.strip(), which may cause problems if a line has leading or trailing whitespace. However, according to the problem statement, each line contains exactly n letters, so it's safe.\n\nAnother potential issue: when reading the lines, the code may have a line that is not properly read. For example, if the input is given with multiple lines, but the code reads them correctly.\n\nAnother possible problem: when the grid lines are read. For example, for n=5, the code reads 5 lines after the n line.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nBut in Python, the code may need to read from stdin, which can be done with sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the code to handle multiple test cases, the code is as follows.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n\n    ptr = 0\n\n    while ptr < len(lines):\n\n        # Read n\n\n        if not lines[ptr]:\n\n            ptr +=1\n\n            continue\n\n        n = int(lines[ptr])\n\n        ptr +=1\n\n        grid = []\n\n        for _ in range(n):\n\n            if ptr >= len(lines):\n\n                # invalid input, but assume it's not the case\n\n                break\n\n            grid.append(lines[ptr])\n\n            ptr +=1\n\n        # process grid\n\n        diagonal = set()\n\n        non_diagonal = set()\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            for j in range(n):\n\n                if i == j or i + j == n -1:\n\n                    diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\n                else:\n\n                    non_diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n\n        if len(diagonal) != 1:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\n        else:\n\n            d_char = diagonal.pop()\n\n            if len(non_diagonal) != 1:\n\n                print(\"NO\")\n\n            else:\n\n                n_char = non_diagonal.pop()\n\n                if d_char != n_char:\n\n                    print(\"YES\")\n\n                else:\n\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, the code may have a problem if the lines are not properly read. For example, if after reading the n, there are not enough lines for the grid. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct.\n\nBut in practice, the code may need to handle that, but assuming the input is correct.\n\nNow, in the code, the lines are read with rstrip('\\n'), which removes the newline character. However, for example, if the line is 'xooox', then lines[ptr] would be 'x",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter \"X\" based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all letters on both diagonals of the grid must be the same, and all other letters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the letters on the diagonals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer `n` (the size of the grid) followed by `n` lines each containing `n` lowercase letters.\n2. **Check Diagonals**: For each grid, we check if all characters on both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n3. **Check Non-Diagonal Elements**: We then check if all characters not on the diagonals are the same and different from the characters on the diagonals.\n4. **Output Result**: Based on the checks, we print \"YES\" if both conditions are satisfied, otherwise \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n    ptr = 0\n    while ptr < len(lines):\n        # Skip empty lines\n        while ptr < len(lines) and not lines[ptr]:\n            ptr += 1\n        if ptr >= len(lines):\n            break\n        n = int(lines[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        grid = []\n        for _ in range(n):\n            if ptr >= len(lines):\n                break\n            grid.append(lines[ptr])\n            ptr += 1\n        # Process the grid\n        diagonal = set()\n        non_diagonal = set()\n        for i in range(n):\n            for j in range(n):\n                if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n                    diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n                else:\n                    non_diagonal.add(grid[i][j])\n        if len(diagonal) != 1:\n            print(\"NO\")\n        else:\n            d_char = diagonal.pop()\n            if len(non_diagonal) != 1:\n                print(\"NO\")\n            else:\n                n_char = non_diagonal.pop()\n                if d_char != n_char:\n                    print(\"YES\")\n                else:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into lines. This allows handling multiple test cases efficiently.\n- **Diagonal Check**: Using sets, we collect all characters on the diagonals. If the set size is 1, all characters on the diagonals are the same.\n- **Non-Diagonal Check**: Similarly, we collect characters not on the diagonals into another set. If this set size is 1 and its element is different from the diagonal character, the grid forms an \"X\".\n- **Efficiency**: The solution efficiently checks each cell in the grid once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2) per test case, which is optimal for the given constraints (n < 300).",
