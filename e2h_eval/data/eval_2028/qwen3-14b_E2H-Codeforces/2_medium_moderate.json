Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms an 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals must have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all other cells.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1). The other diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). All cells on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all cells on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all other cells (non-diagonal) are the same, let's call this 'o_char'.\n3. Ensure that d_char != o_char.\n\nBut how do I check these?\n\nFirst, collect all the diagonal characters. For each cell (i,j) in the grid, check if it's on either diagonal. For the main diagonal, i == j. For the other diagonal, i + j == n - 1. So for each cell, if it's on either of these, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nSo, first, collect all the diagonal characters. Then check that they are all the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are all the same and different from the diagonal's.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, n is at least 3. For example, when n=3, the diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping in the center. So total diagonal cells are 2n - 1. For n=3, 5 cells. The total cells is 9. So non-diagonal is 4 cells. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate through all cells in the grid.\n- For each cell, check if it's on a diagonal.\n- Collect the characters from diagonals and non-diagonals into separate sets.\n\nWait, but for the diagonals, all must be same. So the set of diagonal characters should have size 1. Similarly for non-diagonal, their set should have size 1. And the two sets must be different.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think:\n\nInitialize two variables: diag_char and other_char.\n\nBut perhaps, first collect all diagonal characters. Check that they are all the same. Then collect all non-diagonal characters, check they are all same and different from diag_char.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nFor example:\n\nLoop through each row and column:\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            # part of diagonal\n            add to diag_chars\n        else:\n            add to other_chars\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diag_chars)) != 1 → no\nif len(set(other_chars)) != 1 → no\nif diag_chars[0] == other_chars[0] → no\nelse yes.\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, the other_chars is not empty. For example, n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4. So no problem.\n\nBut for n=1? Well, the input constraints say n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen collect the diag_chars and other_chars.\n\nCheck:\n\nif all diag_chars are same, and all other_chars are same, and the two are different.\n\nBut how to collect the diag_chars and other_chars?\n\nLet me code this.\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen, for each cell:\n\ndiag_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diag_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen check:\n\nif len(set(diag_chars)) != 1 → NO\n\nelse:\n\nif len(set(other_chars)) != 1 → NO\n\nelse:\n\nif diag_chars[0] != other_chars[0] → YES else NO.\n\nBut wait, what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, other_chars is not empty. For example, n=3, the non-diagonal cells are 4. So no problem.\n\nBut let's think for n=3, the diagonals have 2*3 -1 = 5 cells. The other cells are 9-5=4.\n\nSo yes, other_chars is non-empty.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's test with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n5\nxooox\noxoxo\nsoxoo\noxoxo\nxooox\n\nSo the grid is:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → positions (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x. So the first row's diagonal elements are x and x. But for the other positions, like (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) are o's. Then, for row 1: o x o x o. The diagonals are (1,1) and (1,3). So x and x. Then row 2: s o x o o. The diagonals are (2,2) which is x. Also (2, 0) is s? Wait, i + j for row 2 (i=2) and j=0: 2+0=2. n-1 is 4. So 2+0=2 !=4. So (2,0) is not on the diagonal. Wait, the diagonals are i==j or i +j == n-1. For n=5, n-1 is 4. So for i=2, j=2: i==j → yes. For i=2, j=2 is part of the diagonal. What about (2, 0)? i + j is 2 + 0 = 2, not equal to 4. So not part of the diagonal. So in row 2, the diagonal elements are (2,2) and (2, 2) (since i+j=4 would be 2 + j =4 → j=2. So (2,2) is on both diagonals. So for row 2, the cell (2,2) is part of the diagonals.\n\nSo in the sample input 1, the diagonals are:\n\nLooking at each cell in diagonals:\n\nFor i=0, j=0 → x.\n\ni=0, j=4 → x.\n\ni=1, j=1 → o? Wait, the second row is \"oxoxo\". So row 1 (0-based) is o x o x o. So (1,1) is x. (1,3) is x. So those are part of the diagonals.\n\ni=2, j=2 → row 2 is 'soxoo' → third character (index 2) is x. Also, for i=2, j=2 is part of the diagonal. Also, for i=2, j=2 is on both diagonals.\n\nThen for i=3, j=1: i +j = 3+1=4 → yes. So (3,1) is part of the diagonal. Row 3 is 'oxoxo' → (3,1) is x, (3,3) is x.\n\ni=4, j=0 → 4+0=4 → yes. So (4,0) is x. Also (4,4) is x.\n\nSo the diagonals have x's and o's? Wait, in row 1, (1,1) is x and (1,3) is x. So for the diagonals, are all characters same?\n\nWait, the first row's (0,0) is x, (0,4) is x. Then row 1's (1,1) and (1,3) are x and x. Row 2's (2,2) is x. Row 3's (3,1) and (3,3) are x and x. Row 4's (4,0) and (4,4) are x and x. So all the diagonal cells are x? Then why does the sample output say 'NO'?\n\nWait the first input is:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', ...]\n\nSo the third row is 'soxoo'. Let me check the (2,2) cell. The third row is 's o x o o'. So index 2 is x. So that's okay. But then, what about the (2, 2) cell. So all the diagonals are x's. Then what about the other cells?\n\nOther cells are the ones not on the diagonals. For example, in row 0, the cells (0,1), (0,2), (0,3) are o's. Then row 1: (1,0) is o, (1,2) is o. Row 2: (2,0) is s, (2,1) is o, (2,3) is o, (2,4) is o. Row 3: (3,0) is o, (3,2) is o. Row 4: (4,1) is o, (4,2) is o, (4,3) is o.\n\nSo the other_chars includes s, o's, etc. So the other_chars has s and o. So the set of other_chars is {s, o} which has size 2. Hence, the condition fails. So the output is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code would catch that.\n\nAnother sample input is '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw'.\n\nLet's see:\n\nn=3. The grid is:\n\nRow 0: w s w\n\nRow 1: s w s\n\nRow 2: w s w\n\nDiagonals:\n\ncells (0,0) → w, (0,2) → w.\n\n(1,1) → w.\n\n(2,0) → w, (2,2) → w.\n\nSo all diagonals are w. The other cells are:\n\ncells (0,1) → s.\n\n(1,0) → s, (1,2) → s.\n\n(2,1) → s.\n\nSo other_chars is all s. So diag_char is w, other is s. So different. So output YES.\n\nThird sample input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe.\n\nGrid:\n\nRow 0: x p x\n\nRow 1: p x p\n\nRow 2: x p e.\n\nDiagonals:\n\n(0,0) x, (0,2) x.\n\n(1,1) x.\n\n(2,0) x, (2,2) e.\n\nSo the diagonals have x, x, x, x, e. So the set of diag_chars is {x, e} → len is 2. So condition fails. So output NO.\n\nSo the code would correctly process these.\n\nNow, code-wise, in Python, the code would read n, then read n lines.\n\nBut in the input, the first line is n, then n lines. But in the sample input given, the input is given as a list of strings, but in actual code, the input is read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is given as follows: first line is n, then n lines each with n letters.\n\nSo the code would read n as int(input()), then read n lines via [input().strip() for ...].\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\nThen collect diag_chars and other_chars.\n\nThen check.\n\nBut for the case where n is 3, and the grid is:\n\nwsw\n\nsws\n\nwsw\n\nThen diag_chars would be:\n\n(0,0) w, (0,2) w; (1,1) w; (2,0) w, (2,2) w. So diag_chars is [w, w, w, w, w]. So set is {w}.\n\nother_chars: (0,1) s; (1,0) s; (1,2) s; (2,1) s. So set {s}.\n\nSo code returns YES.\n\nAnother case: if the non-diagonal characters are all same, but same as the diagonal. For example, all cells are same. Then, the code would check that other_chars is same as diag_chars, so returns NO.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, possible edge cases.\n\nCase where all non-diagonal are same, but same as diagonal. Like:\n\nn=3:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen diag_chars is all a, other_chars is all a. So the code returns NO.\n\nAnother case where the diagonals have different letters. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the main diagonal is a, and the other diagonal is b. Then the code would check that the diag_chars are not all same. So returns NO.\n\nSo code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut wait, for the code, in Python:\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines. Each line is a string of length n.\n\nThen, for each cell, check if it's on the diagonals.\n\nSo:\n\ndiag_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diag_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nThen:\n\nif len(set(diag_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif diag_chars[0] != other_chars[0]:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n >=3, other_chars is not empty. For n=3, there are 4 other cells.\n\nBut for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no problem.\n\nBut in code, for n=3, the other_chars is 4 elements. So the code is okay.\n\nBut what if other_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but the problem says n is at least 3. So no.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, testing the sample inputs.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=5, grid:\n\nxooox\n\noxoxo\n\nsoxoo\n\noxoxo\n\nxooox\n\ndiag_chars: let's see, for each cell:\n\ni=0, j=0 → x (diag)\n\ni=0, j=1 → no → other.\n\ni=0, j=2 → no → other.\n\ni=0, j=3 → no → other.\n\ni=0, j=4 → diag → x.\n\ni=1, j=0 → no → other.\n\ni=1, j=1 → diag → x.\n\ni=1, j=2 → no → other.\n\ni=1, j=3 → diag → x.\n\ni=1, j=4 → no → other.\n\ni=2, j=0 → no → other.\n\ni=2, j=1 → no → other.\n\ni=2, j=2 → diag → x.\n\ni=2, j=3 → no → other.\n\ni=2, j=4 → no → other.\n\ni=3, j=0 → no → other.\n\ni=3, j=1 → diag → x.\n\ni=3, j=2 → no → other.\n\ni=3, j=3 → diag → x.\n\ni=3, j=4 → no → other.\n\ni=4, j=0 → diag → x.\n\ni=4, j=1 → no → other.\n\ni=4, j=2 → no → other.\n\ni=4, j=3 → no → other.\n\ni=4, j=4 → diag → x.\n\nSo diag_chars is [x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x] ?\n\nWait, for n=5, the diagonals have 2n - 1 = 9 cells. Let's count:\n\nEach of the diagonals. For i=0, j=0 and j=4 → 2 cells.\n\ni=1, j=1 and j=3 → 2 cells.\n\ni=2, j=2 → 1 cell.\n\ni=3, j=1 and j=3 → 2 cells.\n\ni=4, j=0 and j=4 → 2 cells.\n\nTotal 2+2+1+2+2=9 cells. So diag_chars has 9 elements.\n\nIn the first sample input, the diag_chars would be:\n\nLooking at the grid:\n\nRow 0: x o o o x → diag cells are x (0,0) and x (0,4).\n\nRow 1: o x o x o → diag cells are x (1,1) and x (1,3).\n\nRow 2: s o x o o → diag cell is x (2,2).\n\nRow 3: o x o x o → diag cells are x (3,1) and x (3,3).\n\nRow 4: x o o o x → diag cells are x (4,0) and x (4,4).\n\nSo diag_chars is [x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, x]. So all x. So len(set(diag_chars)) is 1. Then other_chars is all the other cells. For example, in row 0, the middle three are o's. In row 2, the first cell is s. So other_chars includes s and o. So len(set(other_chars)) is 2. So code returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one: 3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw.\n\ngrid is:\n\nrow 0: 'wsw' → indexes 0, 1, 2 → w, s, w.\n\nrow 1: 'sws' → s, w, s.\n\nrow 2: 'wsw' → w, s, w.\n\ndiag_chars:\n\ncells (0,0) w, (0,2) w.\n\n(1,1) w.\n\n(2,0) w, (2,2) w.\n\nSo diag_chars is [w, w, w, w, w]. set is {w}.\n\nother_chars are:\n\ncells (0,1) s.\n\n(1,0) s, (1,2) s.\n\n(2,1) s.\n\nSo other_chars is [s, s, s, s]. set is {s}. So code returns YES.\n\nThird sample input: 3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe.\n\ngrid is:\n\nrow0: x p x → (0,0) x, (0,2) x.\n\nrow1: p x p → (1,1) x.\n\nrow2: x p e → (2,0) x, (2,2) e.\n\nSo diag_chars is [x, x, x, x, e]. So set is {x, e} → len is 2 → code returns NO.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input? The problem says that the input is given as first line n, then n lines.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, it's given as a list of strings. But in practice, the code will read from stdin.\n\nBut for the code submission, the code should read from stdin.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead n from input. Then read n lines.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiag_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diag_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\nif len(set(diag_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelif diag_chars[0] != other_chars[0]:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what if other_chars is empty? For example, n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut for n=3, other_chars is 4 elements. So code is okay.\n\nBut what if the other_chars is empty? Well, for n=1, but n is at least 3. So no.\n\nBut in code, for n=3, other_chars is 4 elements. So code is okay.\n\nBut in the case where other_chars is empty, but that's impossible here.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test another case where the non-diagonal characters are same, but same as diagonals. For example, n=3:\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\naaa\n\nThen diag_chars is [a, a, a, a, a], other_chars is [a, a, a, a]. So len(set(diag)) is 1, len(set(other)) is 1. But diag and other are same. So code returns NO.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, diagonals are a, others are b. Then code returns YES.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nNow, check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 2: '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw' → output YES.\n\nSample Input 3: '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe' → output NO.\n\nSample Input 1: output NO.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nThus, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid of characters forms the letter \"X\" based on specific criteria.
