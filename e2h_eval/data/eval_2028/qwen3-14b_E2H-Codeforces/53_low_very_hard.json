Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and the output is the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in 'ababa', the substring 'aba' occurs twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So the answer is 3.\n\nHmm. How do I check all possible substrings and their occurrences?\n\nAn initial idea is to generate all possible substrings for the given string, track their occurrences, and then find the maximum length where at least two occurrences exist.\n\nBut generating all substrings might be computationally intensive, but since the maximum length is 100, it's manageable. Let's think about the steps:\n\nFor each possible length L (starting from the maximum possible down to 1), check if there's any substring of length L that appears at least twice. Once found, return L as the answer. Because we start from the largest possible, the first occurrence would be the maximum.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Iterate possible lengths from min(len(s), max possible) down to 1.\n2. For each length L, generate all substrings of length L, track their positions, and check if any substring appears at least twice.\n3. If found, return L as the answer.\n4. If no such substring exists for any L, return 0.\n\nBut how to efficiently check for duplicates?\n\nFor each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and for each, check if it appears more than once. But how to do that?\n\nFor example, for a string of length N, for each L, there are N - L + 1 substrings. For each of these, we can store them in a dictionary where the key is the substring, and the value is a list of starting indices. Then, for each substring, if the list has at least two entries, then we know that it appears at least twice.\n\nBut since we are looking for the maximum L, once we find any L where this is true, we can return it immediately.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nLoop L from len(s) down to 1:\n\n   For each possible starting index i (from 0 to len(s)-L):\n\n       Take substring s[i:i+L]\n\n   Collect all these substrings, and check if any of them occurs at least twice.\n\n   If yes, return L.\n\nIf after checking all L down to 1, none are found, return 0.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently?\n\nFor each L, we can create a dictionary to count occurrences. However, since we just need to know if any substring occurs at least twice, maybe we can use a set to track seen substrings. For each substring, if it's already in the set, then we know it's appeared before. So for each L, we can iterate through all substrings, and check if any duplicates exist.\n\nWait, but for the same L, multiple substrings may be present. So for example, for L=3, the substrings could be 'abc', 'bcd', etc. So for each substring, when we process it, if we have seen it before, then we can immediately return that L is possible.\n\nSo for each L, we can loop through the substrings, and for each, check if it's already been seen. If yes, then return L as the answer. Otherwise, add it to the set. But since the order of processing is from left to right, even overlapping substrings can be checked.\n\nWait, but for example, in 'ababa', for L=3:\n\nsubstrings are 'aba' (positions 0-2), 'bab' (positions 1-3), 'aba' (positions 2-4). So when processing the first 'aba', add to the set. Then when processing the second 'aba', it's already in the set, so return True.\n\nYes. So for each L, we can check if there are duplicates by using a set. For each substring of length L, check if it's already in the set. If yes, then return L. Otherwise, add it to the set.\n\nBut for the same L, there could be multiple substrings that have duplicates. But we just need one occurrence of a duplicate substring to confirm that L is possible.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nfor L in range(len(s), 0, -1):\n\n    seen = set()\n\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            return L\n\n        seen.add(substr)\n\nreturn 0\n\nWait, but this would not work for cases where the same substring appears more than once, but not consecutively. For example, in the case where",
