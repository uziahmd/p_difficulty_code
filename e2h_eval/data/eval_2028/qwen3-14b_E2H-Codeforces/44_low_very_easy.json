He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Polycarp is dividing his list of problems into k days, each day solving consecutive problems starting from the beginning. The goal is to maximize the total profit, which is the sum of the maximum difficulty each day. Hmm.\n\nSo the first thing I need to think about is how to model this problem. Since the days are contiguous and must cover all problems, the problem is about partitioning the array into k segments. Each segment's contribution is the max of that segment. And I need to find the partition that gives the maximum sum of these maxes.\n\nLet me think about dynamic programming here. Because for each position and number of days, there might be overlapping subproblems. Like, for the first i problems divided into j days, what's the maximum profit?\n\nYes, dynamic programming seems like a good approach here. Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i problems divided into j days. Then, the recurrence would be:\n\nFor dp[i][j], we can look at all possible positions m where the previous day ends. So for each m < i, we can take dp[m][j-1] plus the max of a[m+1..i]. Then dp[i][j] is the maximum over all such m.\n\nBut wait, the constraints are n up to 2000 and k up to 2000. If I use this approach, the time complexity would be O(n^2 * k), which for n=2000 and k=2000 would be way too big. 2000^3 is 8e10 operations. That's impossible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a way to optimize this. Let's think again. For each j, when building dp[i][j], we need to find the best m. But calculating the max for each segment from m+1 to i can be expensive. However, if I precompute the max for all possible ranges, that would help. But even with that, the time complexity remains O(n^2 *k). Which for n=2000 and k=2000 is way too slow.\n\nWait, but perhaps the constraints are not that bad. Let's check: n is up to 2000, and k is up to n. Let's compute the worst case for O(n^2 *k). For n=2000, that's 2000^3 = 8e10 operations. That's way too big for Python. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a better way. Let's think about the problem again. What's the optimal way to split into k days? Well, since each day must take at least one problem, the minimal number of days is 1 (if k=1) and the maximum is n (each day one problem).\n\nBut the key observation here is that for the maximum sum of maxes, we want to have as many high-value elements as possible as the max of their day. For example, if there's a very large element in the array, it's better to have it as a single day's max, because otherwise, if it's grouped with other elements, it's still the max, but maybe we can get more maxes from other elements.\n\nWait, but when you split into k days, you have exactly k maxes. So the problem is to select k segments such that the sum of their maxes is maximized.\n\nAnother thought: the problem is similar to the problem of splitting the array into k parts, and each part contributes its maximum. How can we find the optimal split?\n\nLet me think about the case when k is 1. Then the answer is the max of the entire array. For k = n, each day has one problem, so the sum is the sum of all elements.\n\nBut how do we generalize?\n\nAnother approach: Since the days are contiguous and the order is fixed, perhaps we can find the positions where we split the array. For example, the first day ends at some position, then the second day ends at another, etc.\n\nBut how to model this efficiently.\n\nWait, considering that for each day, the max is the maximum of the segment. So when you split the array into k segments, the sum of the maxes of each segment.\n\nNow, the key idea here is that for each possible split, the max of each segment is determined by the maximum in that segment. So, perhaps, for the DP approach, we can precompute the max for any interval [i...j], which can be done with O(n^2) time and space.\n\nOnce we have that, then for each dp[i][j], we can consider all possible splits into j-1 days up to m, and then take the max between m+1 and i as the j-th day's max.\n\nBut again,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to distribute a list of problems into exactly `k` days such that the total profit, defined as the sum of the maximum difficulties of problems solved each day, is maximized. The solution involves dynamic programming (DP) with precomputed maximum values for subarrays.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum profit achievable by solving the first `i` problems in `j` days.\n2. **Precompute Maximums**: Precompute a 2D array `max_range` where `max_range[i][j]` stores the maximum value of the subarray from index `i` to `j`.\n3. **DP Transition**: For each possible number of days `j` and each possible end position `i`, compute the maximum profit by considering all possible previous splits and adding the maximum value of the current segment.\n4. **Reconstruct Path**: After computing the DP table, backtrack from `dp[n][k]` to determine the exact distribution of problems across days.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    \n    # Precompute max_range[i][j] = max(a[i..j])\n    max_range = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for i in range(n):\n        current_max = a[i]\n        for j in range(i, n):\n            current_max = max(current_max, a[j])\n            max_range[i][j] = current_max\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    INF = -1\n    dp = [[INF]* (k+1) for _ in range(n+1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 0\n    \n    # Fill DP table\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        for j in range(1, k+1):\n            if j > i:\n                continue\n            for m in range(j-1, i):\n                if dp[m][j-1] != INF:\n                    current_max = max_range[m][i-1]\n                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + current_max)\n    \n    # Reconstruct the answer\n    res = []\n    curr_i = n\n    curr_j = k\n    while curr_j > 0:\n        for m in range(curr_j-1, curr_i):\n            if dp[curr_i][curr_j] == dp[m][curr_j-1] + max_range[m][curr_i-1]:\n                res.append(curr_i - m)\n                curr_i = m\n                curr_j -= 1\n                break\n    \n    res.reverse()\n    print(dp[n][k])\n    print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Maximums**: The `max_range` array is used to quickly determine the maximum value of any subarray, which is crucial for efficiently calculating the profit of each segment during the DP transitions.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: The `dp` table is filled by considering all possible ways to split the first `i` problems into `j` days, ensuring each day has at least one problem.\n3. **Backtracking to Reconstruct Path**: After filling the DP table, we backtrack from `dp[n][k]` to determine the exact distribution of problems across days by checking which splits contributed to the maximum profit.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the optimal distribution of problems across days using dynamic programming, leveraging precomputed maximum values to keep the solution within feasible time complexity.",
