Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem says that we have a string of digits and a series of substitution queries. Each query replaces all occurrences of a certain digit with another string. After all substitutions, we need to compute the number modulo 1e9+7. But directly performing substitutions for each query on the string might be inefficient, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. If we process each substitution naively by replacing every occurrence in the string, that could lead to O(n * m) time where m is the length of the string, which might be too slow for large cases.\n\nSo, what's a smarter way to handle this? Let's think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But substitutions are applied in order. For example, if we first replace '2' with '00', then later replace '0' with something else, the original '2's would have been replaced by '00's, and then those 0s would be replaced again.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each query replaces all instances of di in the current string. So the order of processing queries matters. So, for example, if we have a query that replaces '2' with '00', then a query that replaces '0' with '1', then all the original 2s would become 00, then those 0s would become 1s, resulting in '11's.\n\nBut if we process the queries in reverse order, maybe we can model the substitutions more efficiently. Let me think: For each digit, we can track what it gets replaced with. However, when a substitution is done, any existing replacements for that digit are overwritten. Wait, no. Because each query replaces all instances of di in the current string. So, if a digit is replaced multiple times, only the latest substitution for that digit is active. For example, if we first replace 2 with 00, then replace 2 with 11, then the original 2s would be replaced with 11, not 00. Because the second query is applied after the first. Wait, no. Because the first query replaces all 2s with 00. Then, the second query replaces all 2s (which are now part of the 00s?) No, no. The query is to replace all instances of di in the current string. So if the first query replaces 2 with 00, then the string now contains 0s and other digits. Then, the second query is to replace 2s again, but there are no 2s left in the string. So the second query has no effect. But if the second query was to replace 0s with something else, that would affect the 0s generated by the first substitution.\n\nAh, so the key is that each substitution affects the current state of the string. So, for example, if we have a substitution sequence where a digit is replaced multiple times, only the last substitution for that digit is effective. But if another substitution replaces a different digit, that could affect the result.\n\nBut processing substitutions directly on the string would be too slow for large inputs. For example, if the string is 1e5 characters and each substitution replaces a digit with a long string, then after several substitutions, the string could become very long. So, we need a way to model the substitutions without actually building the entire string.\n\nLet me think of using a mapping for each digit. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, when a substitution is processed, we update the mapping for that digit. However, since substitutions can be applied in sequence, and each substitution replaces all instances of a digit with a new string, perhaps we can model the substitutions as a kind of replacement tree, and compute the final value using dynamic programming or memoization.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's think about each digit as being represented by some expression. For example, suppose that after processing all queries, the digit 'd' is replaced by a string t_d. However, if during the processing of queries, a digit 'd' is replaced by a string that includes other digits, which may themselves have been replaced in subsequent queries. But since the queries are processed in order, we need to track for each digit what it's currently mapped to. However, if we process the queries in reverse order, perhaps we can find a way to compute the contribution of each original digit in the initial string.\n\nAlternatively, think of it like this: each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But when you apply substitutions in order, each substitution can affect the future substitutions. However, if we track for each digit, the current replacement string, then when a substitution comes in, we can update the mapping for that digit. However, when a substitution is made, say, replacing 'd' with 't",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits. Each query replaces all occurrences of a specific digit with another string. After applying all substitutions, we compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\n---\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Direct String Substitution is Inefficient**:\n   Replacing characters in a string for each query directly would be too slow, especially when the string and number of queries are large (up to $10^5$).\n\n2. **Use of Digit Mapping**:\n   Instead of modifying the string directly, we can maintain a mapping from each digit to its replacement string. This allows us to efficiently propagate replacements without modifying the original string repeatedly.\n\n3. **Reverse Processing of Queries**:\n   Since substitutions can overwrite previous mappings, processing queries in reverse order helps ensure that we correctly capture the final value of each digit after all substitutions have been applied.\n\n4. **Modulo Arithmetic**:\n   We compute the final number modulo $10^9 + 7$, which requires careful handling of large numbers using modular arithmetic.\n\n---\n\n### Strategy:\n\n- Maintain a `digit_map` where each digit maps to the string it will eventually become after all substitutions.\n- Process the queries in reverse order and update the mapping accordingly.\n- Use dynamic programming to compute the contribution of each character in the original string to the final result, considering the current mapping.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Details:\n\n- The `digit_map` starts as `{d: d for d in '0123456789'}`.\n- For each query in reverse, we update the mapping for the source digit.\n- For each character in the original string, we recursively expand its value based on the current mapping and sum up its contribution using modular arithmetic.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\nimport sys\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().splitlines()\n    \n    s = data[0]\n    n = int(data[1])\n    queries = data[2:2+n]\n\n    # Initialize digit mapping: each digit maps to itself\n    digit_map = {str(d): str(d) for d in range(10)}\n    \n    # Process queries in reverse to build the correct mappings\n    for q in reversed(queries):\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        d = parts[0]\n        t = parts[1]\n        digit_map[d] = t\n\n    # Precompute the powers of 10 modulo MOD\n    max_len = len(s)\n    pow10 = [1] * (max_len + 1)\n    for i in range(1, max_len + 1):\n        pow10[i] = (pow10[i-1] * 10) % MOD\n\n    # Compute the final number using the digit map\n    result = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        # Expand the character's value recursively using the map\n        val = 0\n        def expand(c):\n            nonlocal val\n            if c not in digit_map:\n                return int(c)\n            replacement = digit_map[c]\n            if replacement == '':\n                return 0\n            # Recursively expand\n            total = 0\n            for digit in replacement:\n                expanded = expand(digit)\n                total = (total * 10 + expanded) % MOD\n            return total\n        val = expand(ch)\n        result = (result * 10 + val) % MOD\n\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Notes:\n\n- The `expand` function recursively expands a digit into its final form using the current mapping, ensuring that nested substitutions are handled correctly.\n- Modular arithmetic is used throughout to avoid overflow and ensure performance.\n- The `pow10` array is precomputed to help with modular exponentiation, although in this implementation, we use direct expansion instead of precomputing powers for every digit.\n\nThis approach ensures that we process the queries efficiently and compute the final number modulo $10^9 + 7$ without explicitly constructing the potentially enormous final string.",
