He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nSo the process is: \n\nOriginal string is some number of 'a's. Then B appends some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C appends 'c's equal to the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. Also, the count of 'c's could be equal to both, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the final string must have:\n\n- All 'a's first, then 'b's, then 'c's. Because each step appends to the end. So the order of characters must be all a's, followed by all b's, followed by all c's. Otherwise, it's invalid. For example, if there's a 'c' before a 'b', that's not possible.\n\nSo first thing to check: the string must consist of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. So any deviation from that order (like a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b', etc.) would make the answer NO.\n\nSo first, I need to check the order of characters. Let me think how to do that. For example, the string should have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So the characters must be in non-decreasing order according to their letters. Because 'a' comes before 'b', which comes before 'c'. So for example, the string can't have a 'b' followed by an 'a', or a 'c' followed by a 'b' or 'a'.\n\nSo the first check is that the string is in the form a* b* c*. So how to check that?\n\nWe can iterate through the string and check that once a 'b' is encountered, no 'a' comes after. Similarly, once a 'c' is encountered, no 'a' or 'b' comes after.\n\nAlternatively, we can check that the string is composed of a sequence of a's, then b's, then c's. So for example, the string can be split into three parts. Let me think of code for that.\n\nOnce that is confirmed, then we need to check the counts.\n\nLet me think about the counts. Let's denote:\n\ncount_a = number of a's in the string\n\ncount_b = number of b's\n\ncount_c = number of c's.\n\nBut according to the process, the original string was a's, then B added some b's. Then C added c's. So the count of c's must be equal to either the count of a's (original) or the count of b's (after B added them). But wait, when C appends the c's, the count of a's and b's are fixed. Because the original string had some a's, then B added some b's. So when C appends the c's, the number of a's is the original count (let's say A), and the number of b's is B. Then the number of c's must be equal to A or B. But since the original string had at least one a and one b (because B made sure that), then after adding the c's, the total counts are:\n\ncount_a = A\n\ncount_b = B\n\ncount_c = C, where C is equal to A or B.\n\nBut the problem says that C (the number of c's) is equal to the number of a's OR the number of b's in the string at that time. So when C appends the c's, the number of a's and b's is A and B respectively. So the count_c must be equal to A or B.\n\nSo in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a (original) or count_b (original). But the original count_a is the same as the final count_a, since no a's were added after the initial step. Similarly for count_b.\n\nSo in the final string, count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, the original count_a and count_b must be at least 1. Because when B added the b's, he made sure that there is at least one a and one b. So in the final string, count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The string is in the form a*b*c* (i.e., all a's first, then all b's, then all c's).\n\n2. count_a >= 1, count_b >= 1.\n\n3. count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nIf all these conditions are met, then output YES, else NO.\n\nSo let's test the examples.\n\nFirst example: aaabccc. So count_a is 3, count_b is 1, count_c is 3. So count_c equals count_a (3). So condition 3 is satisfied. Also, the order is correct. So output YES.\n\nSecond example: bbacc. The string is 'bbacc'. The order is b's, then a, then c. So the order is invalid. Because after the a comes a c, but there's a 'a' after 'b's. So the string is not in a*b*c* form. So output NO.\n\nThird example: aabc. count_a is 2, count_b is 1, count_c is 1. count_c is equal to count_b (1). So condition 3 holds. Also, order is correct. So output YES.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCheck the order of the string. If it's not in a*b*c*, return NO.\n\nElse, check count_a >=1, count_b >=1.\n\nThen check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all yes, then output YES else NO.\n\nNow, how to check the order? Let's think of the string as being in three parts. For example, the first part is all a's, then all b's, then all c's.\n\nSo, the string can be divided into three parts. Let me think of the transitions between characters. For example, the first occurrence of 'b' must be after all a's, and the first occurrence of 'c' must be after all b's.\n\nSo, for example, the string can be checked by ensuring that the characters are in non-decreasing order. Because 'a' < 'b' < 'c'. So if the string is in non-decreasing order, then it's a valid sequence. Wait, but that's not entirely correct. Because for example, the string 'aabbc' is allowed. But 'aabcc' is allowed. However, if the string is 'abba', then it's not allowed. But the non-decreasing order would check that each character is >= the previous. So, the entire string must be non-decreasing. Because, for example, the first part is a's, then b's, then c's. So the entire string is non-decreasing. So checking that the string is non-decreasing would ensure that the order is correct. Because any 'a' comes before 'b' and 'c', any 'b' comes before 'c', etc.\n\nSo for example, the string 'aabbcc' is valid. The string 'abac' would not be non-decreasing (since after 'a' comes 'b', then 'a' again, which is smaller than 'b').\n\nSo, the first step is to check that the string is non-decreasing. If not, return NO.\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc'? It's non-decreasing. So that's okay. But what if the string is 'aabbaa'? Then, the order is not correct. But the string is not non-decreasing. Because after the 'b's, there are 'a's again. So the check for non-decreasing would catch that.\n\nSo the first check is that the string is non-decreasing. Then, check the counts.\n\nSo how to check that the string is non-decreasing? For each character in the string, starting from index 1, check that it is >= the previous character.\n\nSo for example:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        return False\n\nSo that's a simple check.\n\nOnce that is done, then proceed to count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nThen, check that count_a >=1 and count_b >=1.\n\nThen, check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nIf all those conditions are met, return YES else NO.\n\nLet me think about some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: 'abc' → counts are 1,1,1. count_c is 1, which equals count_a (1) and count_b (1). So valid. Output YES.\n\nCase 2: 'ab' → but then there are no c's. So count_c is 0. But according to the problem statement, after C appends the c's, there must be at least one c. Because C appends some number of c's. So the problem says that the original string (after B appends the b's) has at least one a and one b. Then C appends some number of c's. So the final string must have at least one c. Because C appends some number of c's. So the count_c must be >=1?\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nC appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. So the number of c's added is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. So the number of c's added is at least 1? Because the number of a's and b's are at least 1.\n\nBecause, when C appends the c's, the number of a's is count_a (>=1), and the number of b's is count_b (>=1). So the number of c's added is equal to count_a or count_b, which is at least 1. So the count_c in the final string is at least 1. So in our code, we need to check that count_c is >=1.\n\nWait, but the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' (so the count of c's added is at least 1?), but the problem says that the number of c's is equal to the number of a's or the number of b's. So if the number of a's is zero, but that can't happen because in the initial step, B made sure that there's at least one a and one b. So the count_a and count_b are >=1. So the count_c is equal to count_a or count_b, which is >=1. So in the final string, count_c must be >=1.\n\nSo in our code, we need to check that count_c is at least 1. But wait, in the problem statement, the input string can have zero c's? No, because according to the process, C appends some number of c's. So the final string must have at least one c. So in the input string, if there are zero c's, then it's invalid.\n\nSo in our code, we need to check that count_c is at least 1.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose the input is 'ab'. Then the string is non-decreasing. count_a is 1, count_b is 1, count_c is 0. So according to the problem, this string cannot be formed. Because C must append some number of c's. So the count_c must be at least 1. So in our code, we need to check that count_c >=1.\n\nSo adding that as a condition.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n1. The string is non-decreasing.\n\n2. count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\n3. count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b.\n\nSo that's important. Because if the string is 'ab', then even though the order is correct, the count_c is zero, which is invalid.\n\nSo let's see the example given in the problem. The third example is 'aabc', which has count_c = 1. So that's okay.\n\nAnother example: 'abcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 1, count_b is 1. So count_c is 2, which is not equal to count_a or count_b. So output NO.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nWe need to count the number of a's, b's, c's.\n\nSo, steps for code:\n\nRead the string S.\n\nCheck if the string is non-decreasing. If not, return NO.\n\nElse:\n\ncount_a = number of 'a's in S.\n\ncount_b = number of 'b's in S.\n\ncount_c = number of 'c's in S.\n\nCheck if count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nIf not, return NO.\n\nElse, check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b. If yes, return YES else NO.\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's think about some test cases.\n\nTest case 1: 'aaabccc' → counts are a=3, b=1, c=3. So c equals a. So yes.\n\nTest case 2: 'bbacc' → the string is 'b', 'b', 'a', 'c', 'c'. The third character is 'a' which is less than previous 'b', so the string is not non-decreasing. So output NO.\n\nTest case 3: 'aabc' → counts are a=2, b=1, c=1. c equals b. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → counts a=1, b=1, c=1. c equals a and b. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → count_c is 0. So no.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So c is 1, which is not equal to a or b. So output no.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' → count_c is 1. So no. But if the string is 'aabbc' → the order is correct. But count_c is 1. So the code would check if count_c is equal to a (2) or b (2). No. So output NO.\n\nAnother case: 'aabcc' → count_a is 2, count_b is 1, count_c is 2. So count_c equals count_a. So yes.\n\nAnother case: 'abbccc' → count_a is 1, count_b is 2, count_c is 3. So count_c is 3, which is not equal to 1 or 2. So output NO.\n\nBut if the string is 'abbcc', then count_c is 2. count_b is 2. So yes.\n\nSo code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nIn Python, the code would be:\n\nRead S from input.\n\nCheck if the string is non-decreasing. How?\n\nFor i in range(1, len(S)):\n\n   if S[i] < S[i-1]:\n\n       return NO.\n\nThen count the number of a, b, c.\n\nCheck if count_a >=1, count_b >=1, count_c >=1.\n\nIf any of them is zero, return NO.\n\nElse, check if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b. If yes, return YES else NO.\n\nSo code:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\n# Check if the string is non-decreasing\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\ncount_a = s.count('a')\n\ncount_b = s.count('b')\n\ncount_c = s.count('c')\n\nif count_a ==0 or count_b ==0 or count_c ==0:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc'? Then count_c is 2, count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So count_c equals both. So it's allowed. So code returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: 'aaaabbbbcccc' → count_a is 4, count_b is 4, count_c is 4. So count_c equals both. So yes.\n\nBut what if the string is 'aabbc'? Then count_c is 1, count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So no. So code returns no.\n\nSo that's handled.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → counts a=3, b=1, c=3. So yes.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → the string is 'b','b','a','c','c'. The third character is 'a' which is less than previous 'b', so the loop will detect it and print NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → counts a=2, b=1, c=1. So count_c equals count_b. So yes.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → count_c is 0 → no.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbcc' → yes, since count_c is 2, which equals count_a (2) and count_b (2).\n\nAnother case: 'abcc' → count_a=1, count_b=1, count_c=2. So count_c is not equal to either. So output no.\n\nAnother case: 'abbbc' → count_a=1, count_b=3, count_c=1. So count_c equals count_a → yes.\n\nSo code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' but count_c is equal to count_a (2) and count_b (2). So code returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nWhat about a string like 'aabbcc' but count_c is 3? Then count_c is not equal to count_a or count_b. So code returns no.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the case where the string is 'aabbcc' but the count_c is 2. So code returns yes.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's think about the case where the string is 'aaaaabbbbbccccc' → count_a is 5, count_b is 5, count_c is 5. So yes.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, what about a string that has only 'c's? Like 'ccc'. The code would check for non-decreasing (yes). Then count_a is 0, which fails. So output no.\n\nAnother case: 'aabbaacc' → the string is not non-decreasing. Because after the 'b's, there are a's again. So the loop would find that the third character (b) is followed by a 'a' which is less than 'b'. So the code returns no.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that the input is read as a single line. So for example, the input may be something like 'aaabccc'.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the string, check for non-decreasing order.\n\nBut in Python, the code would be:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nThen check for the order.\n\nThen count the a, b, c.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the first check, perhaps the code can be written as:\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n        exit()\n\nBut in Python, exit() can be done via return, but in a script, perhaps using sys.exit() or breaking and then checking.\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\ns = input().strip()\n\nvalid = True\n\nfor i in range(1, len(s)):\n\n    if s[i] < s[i-1]:\n\n        valid = False\n\n        break\n\nif not valid:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n\n    if count_a ==0 or count_b ==0 or count_c ==0:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about the case where the string is empty? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is between 1 and 5000 characters. So no need to handle empty strings.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 'aaabccc' → the code checks order. All a's first, then b, then c's. So valid. count_a is 3, count_b is 1, count_c is 3. So yes.\n\nSample Input 2: 'bbacc' → during the order check, the third character is 'a' which is less than previous 'b'. So valid becomes false. Output NO.\n\nSample Input 3: 'aabc' → order is a, a, b, c → valid. count_a=2, count_b=1, count_c=1. So yes.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nAnother test case: 'ab' → order is valid. count_c is 0 → output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'abc' → count_c is 1, which equals count_a and count_b. So yes.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabbc' → order is valid. count_c is 1. count_a is 2, count_b is 2. So 1 is not equal to 2. So output NO.\n\nAnother test case: 'aabcc' → count_c is 2. count_a is 2. So yes.\n\nSo code works.\n\nSo this should be the solution.\n",
