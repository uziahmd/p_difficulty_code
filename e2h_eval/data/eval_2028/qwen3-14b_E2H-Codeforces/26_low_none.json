Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z such that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Oh right, and the triangle has to be non-degenerate, which means the triangle inequality must hold. So for any triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe there's a way to simplify that.\n\nWait, the problem says x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. Wait, the constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be from A to B, y is from B to C (since B ≤ y ≤ C?), wait no. Wait, the original condition says x ≤ B, and then B ≤ y, so y is at least B. And since y ≤ C, then y is between B and C. Similarly, z is between C and D. So the three sides are x (A to B), y (B to C), z (C to D). But also, the order of the sides in the triangle isn't specified. Wait, but the triangle's sides can be in any order, but for the triangle inequality, we need that the sum of the two smaller sides is greater than the largest side.\n\nBut given that x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z, so x ≤ y ≤ z? Wait, not necessarily. Because x can be up to B, and y starts at B. So x can be less than or equal to B, and y is at least B. So x ≤ y. Then y is up to C, and z is at least C. So y ≤ z. Therefore, x ≤ y ≤ z. So the three sides are ordered as x ≤ y ≤ z. So for a triangle to be non-degenerate, we need x + y > z. Because z is the largest side. Because if x + y > z, then the other inequalities (x + z > y and y + z > x) will automatically hold since z ≥ y ≥ x. So the key condition here is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where A ≤ x ≤ B, B ≤ y ≤ C, C ≤ z ≤ D, and x + y > z.\n\nSo how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nThe straightforward approach would be to iterate over all possible x, y, z and check the condition, but given that the ranges can be up to 5e5, that would be O(B*C*D) which is way too slow. So we need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think about the variables. Since x ranges from A to B, y from B to C, z from C to D. But for each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, D] that are less than x + y. Also, since z has to be >= C, the lower bound for z is max(C, ...). Wait, but for each x and y, the z must satisfy C ≤ z ≤ min(D, x + y - 1). Because z must be less than x + y. So the number of valid z for a given x and y is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y - 1) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C] of (number of z's for that x and y).\n\nSo the problem now is to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the possible ranges for x and y. Let's denote that for each x and y, the maximum value of z is min(D, x + y - 1). But since z must be >= C, the count is:\n\nif x + y - 1 < C → no z's → 0\n\nelse:\n\nthe count is min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1.\n\nSo for each x and y, we can compute this value and sum them all.\n\nBut even this approach would take O(B * (C - B + 1)) time. Let's see: for example, if B is 5e5, and C - B is 5e5, then it's O( (5e5)^2 ) = 2.5e11 operations. Which is way too slow. So this approach is not feasible.\n\nWe need a way to compute this sum more efficiently.\n\nSo perhaps we can find for each x, the range of y's such that x + y > C, and compute the contribution of those y's. Then, for each x, compute the number of z's for each y.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each x, the minimum y such that",
