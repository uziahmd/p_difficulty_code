Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about Vasily and his candles. So he starts with 'a' candles. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The thing is, every 'b' used candles can be turned into a new one. And this new one can be used again, which in turn becomes another used candle when it's done. The question is to find out how many total hours he can keep the room lit.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the example given. For input 4 and 2. So initially, he uses 4 candles, which gives 4 hours. Then, he has 4 used ones. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. So he lights those, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 used ones. Again, he can make 2 / 2 = 1 new candle. That adds 1 hour. Now he has 1 used candle. Which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Initial 6 hours. Then 6 /3 = 2 new. So +2 hours. Now he has 2 used. Not enough for 3. Wait, but wait. Wait, after burning the two new ones, he has 2 more used. So total used is 2. But 2 is less than 3, so no more. But wait the sample output is 8. Let me check. Original 6, then 6/3=2, so 6+2=8. Then the 2 used can't make another. So total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the number of used candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones. But how to model this?\n\nThe process is:\n\nTotal hours starts as 0.\n\nWe have a current number of candles (initially a). But wait, no. Wait, the initial step is that he uses all the candles. So the initial hours are a. Then, the used candles are a. Then, we can make new ones from those.\n\nBut then, each time we make new candles, they are added to the list of available candles. Wait, no. Wait, the process is:\n\nEach time you light a candle, it burns for an hour. So each time you use a candle, it's consumed, and then you get a used candle. So the process is:\n\nStart with a candles. Each time you light them, they burn for an hour. So the total hours is the sum of all the candles that have been burned. But then, after each burn, you collect the used ones, and when you have enough (b), you make a new one.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of it as:\n\nWe have a variable 'total_hours' which starts at 0.\n\nWe have a variable 'used_candles' which starts at 0.\n\nInitially, we have 'a' candles. So we can light them all. So total_hours += a. Then, used_candles += a.\n\nThen, while used_candles >= b:\n\n   new_candles = used_candles // b\n\n   total_hours += new_candles\n\n   used_candles = (used_candles % b) + new_candles \n\nBecause, when you make new candles, you take away (new_candles * b) used candles, and add new_candles new ones. So the remaining used candles is the remainder plus the new ones.\n\nWait, but the new candles are then used again. So each time, you can process the used_candles into new ones, and add the new ones to the used_candles again.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nused = a\n\ntotal_hours += used \n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b \n\n    total_hours += new \n\n    used = (used % b) + new \n\nreturn total_hours \n\nWait, but wait. Let me test this with the first example.\n\nFirst example: a=4, b=2.\n\nInitial used =4. total_hours is 4.\n\nLoop: used >=2. \n\nnew =4//2=2. total_hours becomes 4+2=6. \n\nused is 4%2=0 + 2 = 2. \n\nAgain, used >=2. new=2//2=1. total becomes 6+1=7. used is 0 +1 =1. Now loop ends. So total is 7. Correct.\n\nSecond example: a=6, b=3.\n\nused =6. total_hours starts as 6. \n\nloop: 6 >=3. new=6//3=2. total becomes 6+2=8. used is 6%3=0 +2=2. Now 2 <3. So loop ends. Total is 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. So initial used is 5. total_hours is 5. Then new is 5//5=1. total becomes 6. used is 0 +1 =1. Now loop ends. So total is 6. \n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2. \n\nInitial used is 5. total is 5. \n\nLoop: 5//2=2. total becomes 5+2=7. used is 5%2=1 +2=3. \n\nAgain, 3 >=2. new is 3//2=1. total is 7+1=8. used is 3%2=1 +1=2. \n\nAgain, 2//2=1. total is 8+1=9. used is 0 +1=1. Now loop ends. So total is 9. \n\nLet me check manually. \n\nStart with 5 candles. Burn them all: 5 hours. Now 5 used. Make 2 new (5//2=2, 5%2=1). So 2 new. Burn them: +2 hours. Now used is 1 + 2 =3. Make 1 new (3//2=1, 3%2=1). Burn that: +1. Now used is 1 +1 =2. Make 1 new. Burn it: +1. Now used is 0 +1 =1. So total is 5+2+1+1=9. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems correct. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nInitialize total = a\n\nused = a\n\nthen loop while used >= b:\n\n   new = used // b \n\n   total += new \n\n   used = (used % b) + new \n\nreturn total.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nRead the input line as two integers. Then process as per above.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where a is 1, b is 2. Then total is 1. Because after burning 1, used is 1, which is less than 2. So nothing else.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=2. Then initial total is 2. used is 2. Then new is 1. total becomes 3. used is 0 +1 =1. loop ends. So total 3.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. initial total 3. used is 3. new is 1. total 4. used is 1. loop ends. So total 4.\n\nAnother case: a=1, b=1000. So total is 1. \n\nWhat if a=0? Well, according to input constraints, a is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead input line as a and b. For example, the input may be given as a list of test cases, but according to the problem statement, the input is a single line with two integers. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nInput is a single line with two integers a and b. So for example, in the sample input, the first example is '4 2', and the output is 7. So the code needs to read two integers from stdin.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a line from input, split into two integers.\n\nThen compute as per the algorithm.\n\nSo code:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nused = a\n\nwhile used >= b:\n\n    new = used // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    used = used % b + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. Let's test the sample cases.\n\nSample 1: 4 2 → 7. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 6 3 → 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 5 2 → 9. Which we saw earlier.\n\nAnother test case: 5 5 → 6. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: 2 2 → 3. Correct.\n\nYes, looks like this should work.\n\nSo the code is simple and efficient. Even for a=1000, b=2, the loop would run log_b (a) times, which is manageable.\n\nThus, the Python code is as written.\n",
