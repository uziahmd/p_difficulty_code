A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all of them must make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per person such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl ml?\n\nYes. Because if each of the n friends has nl ml, then total per toast is n * nl.\n\nSimilarly, for lime slices: each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices are needed. Because each friend uses one slice. So total slices per toast is n.\n\nAnd for salt: each friend needs np grams per toast. So total per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the total resources available are:\n\nDrink: k * l ml.\n\nLime slices: c * d slices.\n\nSalt: p grams.\n\nNow, the number of toasts possible is determined by how much each resource can contribute. For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made with that resource, then take the minimum of those numbers.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor drink: total_drink = k * l. Each toast takes n * nl ml. So the number of toasts possible from drink is total_drink // (n * nl). But wait, since each toast requires that amount. So for example, if total_drink is 20, and n * nl is 3, then 20//3 is 6. Which matches the first example.\n\nSimilarly for lime slices: total_slices = c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So total toasts possible is (c*d) // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np grams. So toasts possible is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nInput is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. Drink total is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3*3=9 ml? Wait, no. Wait, nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs 3 ml. So total per toast is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222..., so floor is 2. Which is the first value. Then lime slices: c=10, d=8. Total slices 80. Each toast requires 3 slices. 80//3 is 26.666... so 26. But the example says that the min is 6. Wait, what's going on here?\n\nWait wait, in the first example's note, they said that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Wait, why is that?\n\nOh! Oh right! Wait, the note says that the drink is 4*5=20ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per friend. So 3*3=9 ml per toast. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But the note says that it's 6. Wait, that's conflicting. What's wrong here?\n\nWait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. Wait, why is the drink part 6?\n\nWait maybe I have a misunderstanding here. Let me re-examine the note.\n\nIn the first sample input: the numbers are n=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo the drink is 4*5=20 ml. Each toast requires each friend to have nl=3 ml. So per toast, each friend needs 3ml, so total per toast is 3 * 3 = 9 ml. So 20 /9 is 2.222, which would be 2 toasts. But according to the note, the drink is enough for 6 toasts. That's a discrepancy. So where is my mistake here?\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" Wait, why 20 divided by 3? Oh! Oh wait, perhaps I have the per toast calculation wrong. Maybe the problem says that each toast requires per friend nl ml, but the total per toast is nl ml. No, that can't be. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml. So for example, if there are 3 friends, each needing 3 ml, that's 9 ml per toast. But according to the note, they have 20 ml, which is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. Wait that would imply that each toast requires 3 ml total. Which would mean that per toast, each friend needs 1 ml. So why is the note saying that?\n\nWait the note says: \"the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts\". So 20 divided by 3 is 6.666... which is 6 when floored. So that suggests that the total drink per toast is 3 ml. Which would imply that per toast, each friend needs 1 ml (since 3 friends * 1 ml = 3 ml per toast). But according to the input, nl is 3. So that's conflicting.\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe I have misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl ml. But in the note, the first sample has n=3, nl=3. So per toast, total drink is 3 * 3 =9 ml. But the note says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6. So that's impossible. Therefore, there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait the note says: \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait why is it divided by 3? Because maybe per toast, each friend needs nl ml, but the total per toast is nl ml. That would be strange. For example, if there are 3 friends, and each needs 3 ml, then the total per toast is 3 ml. Which would mean that each friend only gets 1 ml. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem statement is different.\n\nWait perhaps the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for each toast, each friend drinks nl ml. So the total per toast is n * nl ml. But according to the note, the sample input has n=3, nl=3, so per toast, 3*3=9 ml. Then 20 / 9 is 2.222, which is 2. But the note says that the drink is enough for 6 toasts. So why is that?\n\nThis suggests that I have misunderstood the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement again.\n\nProblem statement:\n\neach friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. \n\nAh! Oh! Wait, maybe the problem is that for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. But the total number of toasts is t. So for each toast, each friend has their own portion. So for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl ml. So total drink required is n * t * nl ml. \n\nBut the total available is k*l. So the maximum t is (k*l) // (n * nl). \n\nBut in the first sample, k*l is 4*5=20. n * nl is 3 * 3=9. 20//9 is 2. Which would be the answer. However, the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. So why is that?\n\nWait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2. So 6 comes from 20/3. Which suggests that the drink is being divided by 3. So perhaps the problem is that for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink is nl ml. Not multiplied by n. That would be strange. But that's what the note suggests. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend. So for each toast, each friend has one toast, which requires nl ml. So for one toast, total drink is n * nl. But for t toasts, it's t * n * nl. \n\nBut in the note, the sample input has 20 ml, and the drink allows for 6 toasts. So 20 = t * 3 * 3 → t = 20/(9) = 2.222. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that per toast, the entire group uses nl ml. That is, per toast, the total is nl ml. Which would be very strange. Then for the first sample, 20 / 3 = 6.666, which would be 6 toasts. Which matches the note. But that would be a very strange way to phrase the problem.\n\nBut the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink. So if there are t toasts, then each friend has t * nl ml. So total drink is t * n * nl. \n\nBut according to the note, the sample input has t=6. Then total drink required is 6 * 3 * 3 = 54. But the available is 20. Which is impossible. So why does the note say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts?\n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding. Let me look at the note again. \n\nNote says: \"Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\"\n\nWait 20 / 3 is 6.666, which would be 6 toasts. So that implies that per toast, the total drink used is 3 ml. Which would be nl = 3, but divided by n? Or perhaps per toast, each friend uses nl / n ml? That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of drink. But the total per toast is nl milliliters. Which would be impossible unless n=1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl milliliters, but the total per toast is nl milliliters. Which would imply that nl is per toast, not per friend. But that's not what the problem says. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a typo and the actual requirement is that per toast, the entire group needs nl milliliters. But that's not what the problem says. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters, but the total per toast is nl milliliters. Which would be possible only if n=1. \n\nThis is very confusing. How can the note's explanation be correct?\n\nLet me recheck the note. \n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. \n\nSo n=3 friends, k=4 bottles, l=5 ml per bottle. So total drink is 4 *5=20 ml. \n\nThe note says that this is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. So 3 must be the total per toast. \n\nSo per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would imply that per toast, each friend needs 1 ml. But according to the input, nl is 3. So why is the note using 3 as the denominator?\n\nWait perhaps the problem statement is incorrect. Or maybe I'm misreading the parameters. Let me check the parameters again.\n\nThe problem says that the input is n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np. \n\nIn the first sample input, the parameters are 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1. So nl is 3, np is 1. \n\nSo according to the note, the drink is 20 ml, and each toast requires 3 ml. So 20 / 3 = 6. So that suggests that per toast, the total drink needed is nl. But that would be per toast, not per friend. \n\nSo perhaps the problem statement is wrong. Or perhaps I have misunderstood the problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that per toast, each friend needs nl milliliters, but the total per toast is nl milliliters. Which would imply that per toast, each friend has nl /n milliliters. But that would be strange. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that for each toast, the entire group needs nl milliliters. So for example, each toast requires nl milliliters in total. Then, for the first sample, 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which would match the note. \n\nBut that would contradict the problem statement. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total is nl * n. So the note is wrong. \n\nBut the note is part of the problem. So I must reconcile this. \n\nLet me think again. Let me look at the note's explanation. \n\nThe note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. \n\nSo the 6 comes from 20 / 3. Which suggests that the drink is 20 ml, and per toast, the total drink required is 3 ml. So for each toast, the total is 3 ml. \n\nWhich would mean that for each toast, each friend needs 1 ml. But according to the input, nl is 3. \n\nSo there's a contradiction here. How can this be? \n\nWait maybe there's a misunderstanding in the problem. Perhaps the parameters are nl and np per toast, not per friend. \n\nLet me re-read the problem statement:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nAh! So for each toast, each friend needs nl ml of drink. So for one toast, the total drink is n * nl ml. \n\nBut in the note, the sample input says that the drink is 20 ml, which allows for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which suggests that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. Which would be nl = 3, but divided by n=3. \n\nWait, 3 ml per toast, which is nl = 3 / n = 1. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement says that for each toast, the entire group needs nl milliliters. Which would be per toast, not per friend. \n\nBut that's not what the problem says. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a mistake and the parameters are per toast, not per friend. \n\nBut how can I reconcile this with the note? \n\nLet me think: the note says that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts. Which implies that per toast, the total drink is 3 ml. \n\nIf that's the case, then for each toast, the total drink is nl ml. So the parameters are nl is per toast, not per friend. \n\nBut then the problem statement says that each friend needs nl ml. Which would be conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement says that each toast requires nl ml per friend. So for one toast, each friend needs nl ml, and the total for all friends is n * nl ml. \n\nIn that case, for the first sample, the total drink is 20 ml. So the number of toasts is 20 / (n * nl) = 20/(3*3)= 20/9 = 2.222, which is 2. But according to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which is not matching. \n\nSo why is the note's explanation different? \n\nWait the note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. So the 6 comes from the drink. So the drink is allowing for 6 toasts. Which would be 6 toasts. \n\nSo for the drink, the total is 20 ml, and the per toast is 20/6 = 3.333 ml. \n\nWhich is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the number of toasts is t, and for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So the total drink is t * n * nl. \n\nBut the available drink is k*l. So t is floor( (k*l) / (n * nl) )\n\nIn the first sample, that would be 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222 → 2. \n\nBut according to the note, the drink allows for 6 toasts. So this suggests that the formula is (k*l) / nl, and then divided by n. \n\nLike, t = (k*l) // nl // n. \n\nIn the first sample, 20 /3 =6.666, floor to 6, then divided by 3 (n) → 2. Which matches the note's answer. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nLet me think: if each toast requires each friend to have nl ml, then for t toasts, each friend needs t * nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl. \n\nSo solving for t: t = (k*l) / (n * nl). \n\nBut the note says that t is (k*l / nl) / n. Which is the same thing. \n\nSo for the first sample, k*l is 20, nl is 3. 20/3 is 6.666, then divided by n=3 gives 2.222, which is 2. So that's correct. \n\nBut why is the note saying that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts? Because that's (k*l)/nl, which is 6.666, which is 6. Then, after dividing by n, it becomes 2. \n\nAh! So the note is saying that the drink is enough for 6 toasts, but then you have to divide by the number of friends. \n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense. Why would you divide by the number of friends? \n\nWait, the note says: the answer is min(6, 80, 100) /3 = 2. \n\nSo the 6 comes from the drink, the 80 from limes, and 100 from salt. Then, the minimum is 6, divided by 3 (number of friends?), giving 2. \n\nBut why would the drink allow for 6 toasts? \n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the problem is that the number of toasts per friend is t. So each friend makes t toasts. \n\nSo for each toast per friend, they need nl ml. So total per friend is t * nl ml. For all friends, total is n * t * nl ml. \n\nBut the available drink is k*l. So:\n\nn * t * nl ≤ k*l → t ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl) \n\nSimilarly for the other resources. \n\nBut the note says that the drink allows for 20/3=6 toasts. Which would be (k*l) / nl = 20/3 = 6.666 → 6. But that would be if the total is t * nl, not multiplied by n. \n\nSo perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, and the actual formula is that for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So the total per toast is nl ml. So for t toasts, total is t * nl. \n\nBut that would imply that each toast is for all friends. Which would be odd. \n\nBut in that case, the drink is sufficient for (k*l) // nl toasts. Then, the number of toasts per friend is that divided by n. \n\nWait, that would be the case if the total number of toasts possible is t_total, and each toast is for all friends. Then, each friend can make t_total / n toasts. \n\nBut that seems very strange. \n\nLet me try this approach. \n\nFor the first sample:\n\ndrink is 20 ml. nl is 3. So t_total_drink = 20 // 3 = 6. \n\nLimes: total slices is 10 * 8 = 80. Each toast requires n slices (since each friend needs one slice per toast). So for t_total_lime, it's 80 // n = 80 //3 = 26. \n\nSalt: p is 100. Each toast requires n * np = 3 * 1 = 3 grams. So t_total_salt = 100 //3 = 33. \n\nThen, the minimum of 6, 26, 33 is 6. Then, the number of toasts per friend is 6 // n? No, because if t_total is the number of toasts that can be made for all friends, then each friend can make t_total / n toasts. \n\nBut in this case, the answer would be 6 /3 = 2. Which matches the sample. \n\nBut why would t_total be the number of toasts that can be made for all friends? \n\nThis suggests that the problem's actual logic is that each toast is a single event where all friends participate. For example, one toast requires that each friend has their own portion. So for one toast, the total drink is n * nl, the total lime slices is n, and the total salt is n * np. \n\nThen, the number of toasts possible is the minimum of:\n\n- (k*l) // (n * nl) → total drink divided by per toast drink.\n\n- (c*d) // n → total slices divided by per toast slices.\n\n- p // (n * np) → total salt divided by per toast salt.\n\nThen, the answer is that minimum. \n\nBut in the first sample, this would give:\n\ndrink: 20 / (3 * 3) = 20/9 = 2.222 → 2.\n\nlime: (10 * 8) /3 = 80/3=26.666 → 26.\n\nsalt: 100 / (3 * 1) = 33.333 → 33.\n\nMinimum is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nBut the note says that the drink allows for 6 toasts. Which suggests that the original approach was wrong. \n\nSo why does the note say that the drink is enough for 6 toasts? \n\nBecause the note's explanation is wrong? Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding. \n\nLet me re-examine the note's explanation:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nAh! Now I see. The note is considering that each toast requires nl ml of drink per friend. But the note is calculating the total number of toasts that can be made for all friends, assuming that each toast is for one friend. But that's not the case. \n\nWait, the note says that the drink is enough for 20/3=6 toasts. But why 3? Because nl is 3. So for each toast, the drink required is 3 ml. Which would imply that each toast is for one friend. So if there are 3 friends, and each toast is for one friend, then the total number of toasts that can be made is 6, but since there are 3 friends, each can make 2 toasts. \n\nBut this seems to be a misunderstanding of the problem. \n\nThe problem states that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So if each friend makes t toasts, then the total number of toasts for all friends is n * t. \n\nBut for each toast (per friend), the requirements are:\n\n- nl ml of drink per toast.\n\n- 1 slice of lime per toast.\n\n- np grams of salt per toast.\n\nSo for n*t toasts (total across all friends), the requirements are:\n\nDrink: n*t * nl ml.\n\nLime: n*t slices.\n\nSalt: n*t * np grams.\n\nBut this would be the case if each toast is per friend. \n\nBut the note's explanation seems to suggest that the drink is enough for 20 /3 =6 toasts, which would be n*t =6 → t=2. \n\nWhich aligns with the correct answer. \n\nBut how to calculate that?\n\nSo for the drink, the total required is n*t * nl. Which must be ≤ k*l.\n\nSo solving for t:\n\nt ≤ (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nSimilarly for the other resources:\n\nt ≤ (c*d) / (n) → since each toast (per friend) needs 1 slice, and total is n*t slices.\n\nt ≤ p/(n * np) → since each toast (per friend) needs np grams, total is n*t * np.\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of the three values (k*l)//(n*nl), (c*d)//n, p//(n*np).\n\nAh! This is the correct approach. \n\nSo the answer is the minimum of those three values. \n\nIn the first sample:\n\nk*l = 20, n*nl = 3*3=9 → 20//9=2.\n\nc*d=80, n=3 → 80//3=26.\n\np=100, n*np=3*1=3 → 100//3=33.\n\nMinimum is 2. Which is the correct answer. \n\nThe note's explanation is wrong in the way it describes it. It says that the drink allows for 6 toasts, which is (k*l)/nl = 20/3 = 6.666. But that would be if the total number of toasts (per friend) is 6, which would require n*t = 6 → t=2. So the note's explanation is misleading, but the actual calculation is correct. \n\nSo the correct approach is to calculate for each resource the maximum t such that:\n\nt <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nt <= (c*d) / n \n\nt <= p / (n * np)\n\nThen take the minimum of these three values. \n\nThus, the steps are:\n\n1. Compute total_drink = k * l. The maximum t from drink is total_drink // (n * nl).\n\n2. Compute total_slices = c * d. The maximum t from slices is total_slices // n.\n\n3. Compute total_salt = p. The maximum t from salt is total_salt // (n * np).\n\n4. The answer is the minimum of these three values.\n\nSo the code needs to read the inputs, compute these three values, and output the minimum.\n\nLet me test this against the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\ntotal_drink = 4*5=20. n*nl=3*3=9 → 20//9=2.\n\ntotal_slices = 10*8=80 → 80//3=26.\n\ntotal_salt = 100 // (3*1) = 33. \n\nmin(2,26,33) → 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n['5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3']\n\nn=5, k=100, l=10 → total_drink = 100*10=1000. n*nl=5*4=20 → 1000//20=50.\n\nc=1, d=19 → total_slices=19. 19//5=3 (since 5*3=15 ≤19, 5*4=20>19).\n\nsalt: p=90, n*np=5*3=15 → 90//15=6. So min(50,3,6) is 3. Which matches the sample output of '3'.\n\nThird sample input:\n\n['10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total_drink=1,000,000. n*nl=10*50=500 → 1e6 /500 = 2000.\n\ntotal_slices: 25 *23=575. 575//10=57.5 → 57.\n\nsalt: p=1, n*np=10*1=10 → 1//10=0. So min(2000, 57, 0) → 0. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach works.\n\nSo the code needs to read the inputs, compute these three values, and output the minimum.\n\nNow, coding this in Python.\n\nThe input is a single line with the numbers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nSo the code will read the input line, split into integers.\n\nThen compute:\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nslices = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(drink, slices, salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nBut we need to handle cases where division is zero? Well, since all inputs are at least 1, n is at least 1, etc. So denominators are at least 1.\n\nBut for example, if n * nl is larger than k*l, then drink will be zero.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me code this.\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\ntoast_slices = total_slices // n\n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nans = min(toast_drink, toast_slices, toast_salt)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nInput line is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → \n\nn=3, k=4, l=5 → total_drink =20. n * nl =3*3=9 → 20//9=2.\n\ntotal_slices =10*8=80 → 80//3=26.\n\ntoast_salt: 100 // (3*1) = 33. min is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: third input line is 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → \n\nn=10, nl=50 → n*nl=500. k*l=1000*1000=1,000,000. 1e6//500=2000.\n\ntotal_slices =25 *23=575. 575//10=57. \n\nsalt: p=1, n*np=10*1=10 → 1//10=0. min(2000,57,0) → 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nMake sure to read the input correctly. The input is a single line, and the code reads from stdin.\n\nSo the code is:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts.\n\nThen compute the three values and print the minimum.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nslices = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(drink, slices, salt))\n\nYes.\n\nThat's the code. Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → outputs 2. Correct.\n\nSample input 2: 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → \n\ndrink: 100*10=1000. n*nl=5*4=20 → 1000//20=50.\n\nslices: 1*19=19 //5 → 3.\n\nsalt: 90 // (5*3) = 90//15=6. min(50,3,6) → 3. Correct.\n\nSample input 3: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → 0. Correct.\n\nSo this should work.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Requirements**: Each toast requires `nl` milliliters of drink, one slice of lime, and `np` grams of salt per friend. Therefore, for `t` toasts, each friend will need `t * nl` milliliters of drink, `t` slices of lime, and `t * np` grams of salt.\n2. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of each resource available:\n   - Total drink: `k * l`\n   - Total lime slices: `c * d`\n   - Total salt: `p`\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: Calculate the maximum number of toasts each friend can make based on each resource:\n   - Drink: `(k * l) // (n * nl)`\n   - Lime slices: `(c * d) // n`\n   - Salt: `p // (n * np)`\n4. **Result**: The answer is the minimum value from the three calculated maximums, as each resource limits the number of possible toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\nslices = (c * d) // n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(drink, slices, salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Drink Calculation**: The total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters (since each of the `n` friends needs `nl` milliliters per toast). The maximum number of toasts based on drink is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n- **Lime Slices Calculation**: The total number of lime slices is `c * d`. Each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend). The maximum number of toasts based on lime slices is `(c * d) // n`.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total salt available is `p` grams. Each toast requires `n * np` grams (since each of the `n` friends needs `np` grams per toast). The maximum number of toasts based on salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n\nThe final result is the minimum of these three values, ensuring that all resources are sufficient for the number of toasts each friend can make. This approach efficiently computes the solution using basic arithmetic operations and ensures optimal performance.",
