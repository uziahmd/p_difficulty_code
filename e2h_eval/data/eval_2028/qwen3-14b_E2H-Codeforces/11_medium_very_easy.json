A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible number based on the constraints of each resource.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each friend needs nl milliliters of drink per toast. So for one toast, all n friends would need n * nl ml? Or per friend? Wait the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" Oh right. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. Because each of the n friends has their own nl.\n\nSimilarly, each toast requires one slice per friend. So per toast, n slices are needed. And for salt, per toast, each friend needs np grams, so total per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the resources available:\n\nTotal drink: k * l ml. So the number of toasts possible based on drink is (k*l) // (n * nl). Because each toast requires n * nl ml.\n\nTotal lime slices: c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So number of toasts possible from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt: p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So toasts possible from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThen, the answer is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nWait, but the example given in the first case:\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, because each friend needs 3 ml per toast. So for one toast, 3 friends * 3 ml = 9 ml. So 20 / 9 is 2.222..., which floor to 2. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nYes. Then the limes: c=10, d=8. Total slices 80. Each toast needs 3 slices (since n=3). So 80 / 3 is 26.666, floor to 26. But the sample says that limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait wait, no. Wait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait why?\n\nAh, because the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Wait, but according to my calculation, each toast requires n slices. So for each toast, 3 slices. So 80 slices would allow 80 / 3 = 26 toasts. But in the sample explanation, they say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That suggests that maybe I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So per toast, each of the n friends needs a slice. So per toast, n slices. So for example, in the first sample, 3 friends per toast. So per toast, 3 slices. So total slices available is 10 * 8 = 80. So number of toasts is 80 / 3 = 26.666, which would be 26. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. That's conflicting. So where is the mistake here?\n\nWait looking at the sample explanation:\n\nIn the first sample: the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts. Oh, but that's only possible if each toast requires one slice. But that contradicts with the problem statement. Wait the problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, n slices. So the sample explanation must have a mistake? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"A comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait why is the limes allowing 80 toasts? According to this explanation, the limes are sufficient for 80 toasts. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires n slices. So why is the sample explanation using 80 as the number of toasts allowed by limes?\n\nAh! Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So for the first sample, n=3. So per toast, 3 slices. So total slices available is 10 * 8 = 80. So the number of toasts possible is 80 / 3 = 26.666... which would be 26. But according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which suggests that the sample explanation is considering that each toast requires one slice, not per friend. But that would contradict the problem statement.\n\nBut the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) divided by 3. Which gives 2. So why is that?\n\nAh! Wait the sample explanation says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3. So the 6 comes from (20 / 3) which is 6.666... floored to 6. Then the limes are 80, salt 100. Then they take the min of those three numbers (6, 80, 100) which is 6, then divide by 3 (the number of friends?) to get 2. But that seems to suggest that the initial numbers are calculated per friend. So perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the total number of toasts that can be made is determined by the resources divided by the per toast requirements. But how?\n\nLet me think again. Let's denote t as the number of toasts each friend can make. So each friend makes t toasts. So for all friends, total toasts is t * n (since each of the n friends makes t toasts). Or perhaps not. Wait, no. Each toast is made by all friends. Like, if they make one toast, each of them takes part. So the number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, all friends participate. So for t toasts, each friend makes t toasts. So the total amount of drink needed is t * n * nl. Because per toast, each friend needs nl, and there are t toasts. So for the drink, the total is t * n * nl. Similarly for the other resources.\n\nSo the constraints are:\n\nDrink: t * n * nl <= k * l\n\nLime slices: t * n <= c * d\n\nSalt: t * n * np <= p\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum of (k*l)//(n * nl), (c*d)//n, p//(n * np).\n\nBut in the sample input:\n\nFirst case:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nSo:\n\nDrink: (4*5) = 20. n * nl = 3 *3 =9. 20//9 = 2.222 → 2.\n\nLimes: c*d = 10*8=80. n is 3. 80//3 = 26.666 → 26.\n\nSalt: p is 100. n * np = 3 * 1 =3. 100//3 is 33.333 → 33.\n\nSo the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which is the correct answer. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be if the lime calculation was (c*d) // 1 (per toast). But that would be wrong.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would imply that the number of toasts is (c*d) divided by 1. But why?\n\nAh! Wait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which would be if each toast requires 1 slice. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires n slices. So what's going on here?\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\n\"the limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\"\n\nWait, according to this, the limes are allowing 80 toasts. But according to the problem statement, the limes should be allowing 80 / n toasts. So why is the sample explanation not dividing by n?\n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding in the way the problem is being interpreted. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nEach friend needs a slice of lime. So for each toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, there are n slices needed. So for t toasts, each friend makes t toasts, so total slices needed is t * n.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. So that would mean that the total slices required for t toasts is t. Which would be the case if each toast requires one slice in total, not per friend. But that contradicts the problem statement.\n\nSo why does the sample explanation say that the limes are enough for 80 toasts?\n\nLet me check the sample input again. The first input line is '3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1'.\n\nSo, the parameters are:\n\nn=3 friends.\n\nEach toast requires per friend: nl=3 ml of drink, a slice of lime, and np=1 gram of salt.\n\nSo for one toast, each friend needs one slice. So for one toast, 3 slices. So total slices available is 10 * 8 = 80. So how many toasts can be made? 80 / 3 = 26.666, so 26.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Which implies that the number of toasts is 80. Which would be the case if each toast requires one slice. So why is that?\n\nThis is a contradiction. So perhaps the problem statement has a different meaning. Maybe the problem says that each toast requires one slice per friend, but the sample explanation is wrong. Or perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is wrong. Or perhaps I have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait let's look at the note again. The note says that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. So why is 6, 80, 100 being taken as the possible numbers of toasts?\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe drink allows 20 / 3 = 6.666... which is 6 toasts. But why is that 6 toasts?\n\nBecause for the drink, the total required is t * n * nl. So t = (k*l) / (n * nl). For the first case, 20/(3*3) = 20/9 = 2.222, which would be 2. But the sample explanation says that the drink allows 6 toasts. Which is 20 / (3) = 6.666. Which would be the case if the drink is per toast, not per friend.\n\nWait this suggests that the sample explanation is considering that for each toast, each friend needs nl ml, but the total drink is divided by nl per toast. So for example, for one toast, each friend needs nl ml. So total per toast is n * nl. So the total number of toasts is (k*l) // (n * nl). But in the sample explanation, they have 20 / 3 = 6. Which would be the case if the per toast drink is nl, not multiplied by n. So that suggests that the sample explanation is wrong. But that's impossible. So there must be a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is considering that the number of toasts is the total number of toasts that can be made, and then divided by the number of friends. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nLet me re-express the problem.\n\nThe question is: How many toasts can each friend make? Let's say each friend makes t toasts. So the total number of toasts made is t (since each toast is made by all friends together). Wait, no. For example, if each friend makes t toasts, then each toast is made by all friends. So the number of toasts is t. So each friend makes t toasts. So for each toast, all friends are involved. So the total amount of drink needed is t * (n * nl) ?\n\nNo. Wait, per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink is n * nl. For t toasts, total drink is t * n * nl.\n\nSo the maximum t is the minimum between:\n\ntotal_drink // (n * nl), \n\ntotal_lime_slices // (n), \n\ntotal_salt // (n * np).\n\nBut in the first sample:\n\ntotal_drink is 4 *5 =20. \n\nn * nl is 3 *3 =9. 20//9 is 2. \n\ntotal_lime is 10 *8 =80. divided by n=3 → 80//3 =26.\n\nsalt is 100 divided by (3 *1) = 3 → 100//3=33.\n\nminimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which is the correct answer. \n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the drink allows 20/3 =6 toasts. Which would be the case if the drink is divided by nl, not by n * nl. So why is that?\n\nAh! Oh! Wait, perhaps the sample explanation is wrong. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\"\n\nSo for each toast, each friend needs these things. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So the total drink per toast is n * nl. \n\nSo the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Which would be if the per toast drink is 3 ml. But that would be only for one friend. So perhaps the sample explanation is wrong, or perhaps the problem statement is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the sample explanation is considering that the total number of toasts is 6, and then divided by the number of friends (3) to get 2 per friend. But that would be wrong logic. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is considering that the drink allows for 6 toasts, but that's the total number of toasts possible, not per friend. Then, since each friend makes the same number of toasts, the total number of toasts is divided by the number of friends. But that would be incorrect, because each toast involves all friends. So the number of toasts is t, and each friend makes t toasts. So the sample explanation's logic is wrong, but the actual answer is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nBut why does the sample explanation say that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3 = 2. Which suggests that the drink allows 6 toasts, limes 80, salt 100. Then the minimum is 6, divided by 3 friends gives 2. So that would be the case if the drink allows 6 toasts in total, and each friend can make 2 toasts (so total 6 toasts). But that would be the case if the drink allows for 6 toasts in total. Which would require that per toast, the drink is 20 / 6 = 3.333... ml. But according to the problem statement, per toast, the drink is n * nl = 3 *3 =9 ml. So 6 toasts would require 6 *9 =54 ml. But the total is 20. So that's impossible.\n\nSo clearly, the sample explanation is wrong, but the sample output is correct. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is wrong. But the actual correct approach is to compute the three values as I did earlier.\n\nBut then why does the sample explanation say that the drink allows 6 toasts?\n\nLet me re-calculate the first sample. The sample input is:\n\nn=3, k=4, l=5, c=10, d=8, p=100, nl=3, np=1.\n\nTotal drink is 4*5 = 20 ml. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend = 9 ml per toast. So the number of toasts possible is 20//9 = 2. So the drink allows 2 toasts.\n\nThe sample explanation says that the drink allows 20/3 =6 toasts. Which would be if per toast, the drink required is 3 ml. Which would be the case if each toast requires nl ml for all friends combined. But that's not the case.\n\nSo the sample explanation seems to be wrong. But the sample output is 2, which is the correct answer according to the calculation I did. So the sample explanation may have a typo. For example, perhaps the sample explanation says that the drink allows 6 toasts, but that's actually the total number of toasts possible if each toast requires 3 ml per friend. But that would be impossible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is different. Maybe the problem says that each toast requires nl milliliters per friend, but the total per toast is nl ml. But that would be a different scenario. For example, if each toast requires nl ml per friend, but the total per toast is nl ml for all friends. That would be a very different problem. But that's not what the problem says.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the sample explanation is wrong. But the sample output is correct. So regardless of that, I need to proceed with the correct approach.\n\nSo according to the problem statement, the correct approach is:\n\nCalculate the maximum number of toasts t such that:\n\nt * n * nl <= k*l \n\nt * n <= c*d \n\nt * n * np <= p \n\nSo t is the minimum of (k*l) // (n * nl), (c*d) //n, p//(n * np).\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\nk*l = 20, n * nl = 3 *3 =9 → 20//9=2.\n\nc*d = 80, n=3 → 80//3=26.\n\np=100, n*np=3*1=3 → 100//3=33.\n\nminimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2 → correct.\n\nWhich matches the sample output. So the sample explanation must be wrong. But why does the sample explanation say that the answer is min(6, 80, 100)/3?\n\nWell, maybe the sample explanation is wrong. But the code should be written according to the correct logic.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nRead the input numbers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCompute total_drink = k * l\n\nmax_toast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\nmax_toast_lime = total_lime_slices // n \n\ntotal_salt = p \n\nmax_toast_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_toast_drink, max_toast_lime, max_toast_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nYes.\n\nTesting this on the first sample:\n\nmax_toast_drink = 20 // (3*3) = 20//9=2\n\nmax_toast_lime = 80//3=26\n\nmax_toast_salt=100 // (3*1)=33 → min(2,26,33) =2 → correct.\n\nAnother sample input is the second one:\n\nInput: '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3'\n\nSo n=5, k=100, l=10 → total drink is 100*10=1000.\n\nn * nl =5*4=20 → 1000//20=50.\n\nc=1, d=19 → total lime slices 1*19=19. max_toast_lime =19//5=3 (since 19/5=3.8 → 3).\n\nsalt: p=90, n * np=5 *3=15 → 90//15=6. So min(50,3,6) is 3 → which matches the sample output of 3.\n\nThird sample input: '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1'\n\nn=10, k=1000, l=1000 → total drink is 1,000,000.\n\nn * nl =10 *50=500 → 1e6 // 500 = 2000.\n\ntotal lime slices: 25 *23=575. max_toast_lime =575//10=57 (since 575/10=57.5 → 57).\n\nsalt: p=1, n * np=10 *1=10 → 1//10=0. So min(2000,57,0) is 0 → sample output is 0. Correct.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nWe need to read the input line, split into integers, compute the three values, take the min, and print.\n\nBut the input is given as multiple lines? Wait the input description says that the first and only line contains the integers. But the example shows that the input is given as multiple lines. Wait looking back:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as:\n\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\nBut that's probably for testing purposes. The actual input is one line. Wait the problem says:\n\nInput: The first and only line contains positive integers ... So the code should read one line of input.\n\nWait but the example shows multiple lines. But that's probably for the test cases. For example, the first sample input is one line, but the user provided three examples. So when the code runs, it should read one line from stdin. So the code will read a single line, split into the 8 integers.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nThen compute:\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\n\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\n\nmax_lime = total_lime // n\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\nmax_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nprint(result)\n\nSo code:\n\nRead the input line as a list of integers.\n\nBut in Python, the input can be read via input().split().\n\nBut for example, in the first sample input line, the numbers are 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen compute:\n\ndrink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\n\nlimes = (c * d) // n\n\nsalt = p // (n * np)\n\nans = min(drink, limes, salt)\n\nprint(ans)\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if division is zero? For example, if n * nl is zero? But the problem says that all inputs are positive integers. So no division by zero.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\ninput line is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1 → output 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\ninput line is 5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3 → output 3.\n\nSample 3:\n\ninput line is 10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1 → output 0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, write the Python script.\n\nThe code should read from stdin, process the line, and print the result.\n\nSo:\n\nRead the input line, split into variables.\n\nThen compute the three values, take min, print.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntoast_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\ntotal_lime = c * d\ntoast_lime = total_lime // n\n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nprint(min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt))\n\nYes.\n\nThat's the code.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Requirements**: Each toast requires:\n   - `nl` milliliters of drink per friend.\n   - One slice of lime per friend.\n   - `np` grams of salt per friend.\n   \n2. **Calculate Total Resources**:\n   - **Drink**: Total available drink is `k * l` milliliters.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Total available slices are `c * d`.\n   - **Salt**: Total available salt is `p` grams.\n\n3. **Determine Maximum Possible Toasts**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available drink, considering each toast needs `n * nl` milliliters for all friends.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available lime slices, considering each toast needs `n` slices for all friends.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Calculate how many toasts can be made with the available salt, considering each toast needs `n * np` grams for all friends.\n\n4. **Result**: The answer is the minimum value from the three constraints calculated above, as it represents the limiting resource.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\ntoast_drink = (k * l) // (n * nl)\ntoast_lime = (c * d) // n\ntoast_salt = p // (n * np)\nprint(min(toast_drink, toast_lime, toast_salt))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Drink Calculation**: The total drink available is `k * l` milliliters. Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters for all friends, so the number of possible toasts is `(k * l) // (n * nl)`.\n- **Lime Calculation**: The total lime slices available are `c * d`. Each toast requires `n` slices for all friends, so the number of possible toasts is `(c * d) // n`.\n- **Salt Calculation**: The total salt available is `p` grams.
