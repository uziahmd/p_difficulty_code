The $$$i$$$-th chest has an integer $$$a_i$$$ written on it and the $$$j$$$-th key has an integer $$$b_j$$$ on it. Neko knows those chests contain the powerful mysterious green Grapes, thus Neko wants to open as many treasure chests as possible.The $$$j$$$-th key can be used to unlock the $$$i$$$-th chest if and only if the sum of the key number and the chest number is an odd number. Formally, $$$a_i + b_j \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2}$$$. One key can be used to open at most one chest, and one chest can be opened at most once.Find the maximum number of chests Neko can open.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integers $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n, m \\leq 10^5$$$) — the number of chests and the number of keys.The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the treasure chests.The third line contains $$$m$$$ integers $$$b_1, b_2, \\ldots, b_m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^9$$$) — the numbers written on the keys.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of chests you can open.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 4\\n9 14 6 2 11\\n8 4 7 20', '5 1\\n2 4 6 8 10\\n5', '1 4\\n10\\n20 30 40 50']\n\n### Output\n['3', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, one possible way to unlock $$$3$$$ chests is as follows:  Use first key to unlock the fifth chest,  Use third key to unlock the second chest,  Use fourth key to unlock the first chest. In the second example, you can use the only key to unlock any single chest (note that one key can't be used twice).In the third example, no key can unlock the given chest.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of chests Neko can open using the keys. The condition is that the sum of a chest's number and a key's number must be odd. So, for each chest and key pair, their sum has to be odd. \n\nHmm, so first, I need to figure out how to pair the chests and keys optimally. Let's think about the parity of the numbers. Because the sum is odd only when one is even and the other is odd. So, for a chest with an even a_i, we need a key with an odd b_j. And for a chest with an odd a_i, we need a key with even b_j. \n\nSo the approach would be to count how many chests are even and how many are odd. Similarly, count the number of even and odd keys. Then, the maximum possible pairs would be the minimum between the number of even chests and the number of odd keys, plus the minimum between the number of odd chests and the number of even keys. \n\nWait, right! Because each even chest can be paired with an odd key, and each odd chest can be paired with an even key. But each key can be used only once, and each chest can be opened once. So the total is the sum of those two minima. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Count the number of even and odd chests.\n2. Count the number of even and odd keys.\n3. The answer is min(even_chests, odd_keys) + min(odd_chests, even_keys).\n\nBut wait, let me check with the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nChests: 9, 14, 6, 2, 11. Let's check their parity.\n\n9 is odd, 14 even, 6 even, 2 even, 11 odd. So even_chests = 3 (14,6,2), odd_chests = 2 (9,11).\n\nKeys: 8,4,7,20. Let's see. 8 is even, 4 even, 7 odd, 20 even. So odd_keys = 1 (7), even_keys = 3 (others). \n\nSo min(3, 1) is 1 (even chests paired with odd keys). Then min(2, 3) is 2 (odd chests paired with even keys). Total 1+2=3. Which matches the first example's output of 3. \n\nSecond example input:\n\nChests: 2,4,6,8,10. All even. So even_chests =5, odd_chests=0.\n\nKeys: 5 (odd). So odd_keys=1, even_keys=0.\n\nSo min(5,1) is 1. min(0,0) is 0. Total 1, which matches the second example.\n\nThird example: chest is 10 (even). Keys are all even (20,30,40,50). So even_chests is 1, odd_keys is 0. So min(1,0) is 0. The other term is min(0, 4) is 0. Total 0. Which matches the third example.\n\nSo this logic seems correct. \n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For the list of chests, count how many are even (even_chest_count) and how many are odd (odd_chest_count).\n- For the list of keys, count how many are even (even_key_count) and how many are odd (odd_key_count).\n- The answer is min(even_chest_count, odd_key_count) + min(odd_chest_count, even_key_count).\n\nThis should be efficient since it's O(n + m) time, which is acceptable for n and m up to 1e5.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nIn Python, we can process the input as follows:\n\nRead n and m from the first line.\n\nThen read the list of a_i, then the list of b_j.\n\nThen count even and odd in a and in b.\n\nThen compute the sum of the two minima.\n\nBut wait, let me think about the code.\n\nFor example:\n\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = 0\nodd_chest = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chest +=1\n    else:\n        odd_chest +=1\n\neven_key = 0\nodd_key = 0\n\nfor num in b:\n    if num %2 ==0:\n        even_key +=1\n    else:\n        odd_key +=1\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(result)\n\nYes, that's straightforward. Let me test against the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nn=5, m=4.\n\na: 9 (odd), 14 (even), 6 (even), 2 (even), 11 (odd). So even_chest=3, odd_chest=2.\n\nb: 8 (even),4 (even),7 (odd),20 (even). So even_key=3, odd_key=1.\n\nmin(3,1)=1, min(2,3)=2. Total 3. Correct.\n\nSecond example: n=5, m=1. a is all even. even_chest=5, odd_chest=0. b is 5 (odd). even_key=0, odd_key=1. min(5,1)=1, min(0,0)=0. Total 1. Correct.\n\nThird example: n=1, m=4. a is 10 (even). even_chest=1, odd_chest=0. keys are all even. even_key=4, odd_key=0. min(1,0)=0, min(0,4)=0. Total 0. Correct.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nWhat if there are zero chests or keys? Well, according to constraints, n and m are at least 1. So no problem.\n\nAnother case: all chests even, and all keys even. Then answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: some chests even, some odd, and keys have some even and odd.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all cases correctly. So the code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of treasure chests Neko can open using the given keys. A chest can be opened by a key if their sum is an odd number, which means one must be even and the other must be odd.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count Parities**: First, count the number of even and odd numbers in both the list of chests and the list of keys.\n2. **Match Pairs**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by two possible pairings:\n   - Even chests paired with odd keys.\n   - Odd chests paired with even keys.\n3. **Calculate Result**: The result is the sum of the minimum counts of these two pairings.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\neven_chest = 0\nodd_chest = 0\n\nfor num in a:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_chest += 1\n    else:\n        odd_chest += 1\n\neven_key = 0\nodd_key = 0\n\nfor num in b:\n    if num % 2 == 0:\n        even_key += 1\n    else:\n        odd_key += 1\n\nresult = min(even_chest, odd_key) + min(odd_chest, even_key)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Input Reading**: The input is read and parsed into the number of chests `n`, the number of keys `m`, the list of chest numbers `a`, and the list of key numbers `b`.\n2. **Parity Counting**: We iterate through the chest numbers to count how many are even (`even_chest`) and how many are odd (`odd_chest`). Similarly, we count the even (`even_key`) and odd (`odd_key`) keys.\n3. **Pair Calculation**: The maximum number of chests that can be opened is determined by pairing even chests with odd keys and odd chests with even keys. The result is the sum of the minimum values of these two pairings, which ensures we use the available keys and chests optimally.\n\nThis approach efficiently counts the necessary parities and computes the result in linear time relative to the input sizes, making it suitable for large inputs up to the constraint limits.",
