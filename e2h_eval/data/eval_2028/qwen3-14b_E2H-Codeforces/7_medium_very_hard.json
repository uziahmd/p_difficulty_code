The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given number n can be the number of vertices in a snowflake as defined. Let's try to understand what a snowflake graph is.\n\nFrom the description, the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, that initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k > 1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those leaves) are each connected to k new vertices. This process must be done at least once. So, the construction is like building layers. \n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows with each step. Let's model the structure.\n\nLet's consider the initial step. The first layer is just the root node. Then, step 1 adds k children to the root. Now, the total nodes are 1 + k. But then, each of those k nodes is a leaf. So, in the next step, each of them adds k new nodes. So, the next step adds k * k nodes. Now, the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2. Then, if we do another step, each of those k^2 leaves adds k nodes, so adding k^3. Total becomes 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. And so on.\n\nBut the process requires that the step of adding new nodes to leaves is done at least once. So, the minimal snowflake would be when we have two steps: initial step (root), then add k children (step 1), then add k children to each of those (step 2). So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2. For example, when k=4, the minimal is 1+4+16=21? Wait but the example says for n=6, output is NO. Let me check the sample input.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n9\n1\n2\n3\n6\n13\n15\n255\n10101\n1000000000000000000\n\nSample Output:\nNO\nNO\nNO\nNO\nYES\nYES\nYES\nYES\nNO\n\nFor example, the fifth test case is n=13. The output is YES. Let's think: How can 13 be achieved?\n\nLet me see. Let's think of possible k and steps.\n\nSuppose that the snowflake has m layers. The total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i. Wait, but the initial step is 1 node. Then adding k nodes (step 1), then adding k^2 (step 2), etc. So the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. However, the process requires that after the initial step (which is the root), the step of adding to leaves is done at least once. So the minimal is when m is 2, giving 1 +k +k^2. But maybe there are other possibilities where some steps are done more than once. But the problem is to find for a given n, whether there exists some k>1 and some m≥2 (since the step must be done at least once), such that n equals sum_{i=0}^m k^i. Or wait, maybe not exactly. Because the steps are done in a way that each time you add to all leaves. So the process is that after the initial step (the root), you do the expansion steps. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe initial vertex is connected to k new vertices. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (i.e., the leaves) is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So the first expansion (adding k children to the root) is the first step. Then, the second step (adding k children to each leaf) is done once. So the minimal is 1 +k +k^2. But if you do the step again, then each of the leaves from the previous step (which were added in the second step) would have their children added. So the total would be 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m is the number of expansion steps. But since the expansion steps must be done at least once, m ≥ 1? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait the initial step is creating the root. Then the first expansion step is adding k children to the root. Then, the second expansion step is adding k children to each of the leaves (which are the k children of the root). So the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the minimal is when there's one expansion step. Wait no, the problem says \"this step should be done at least once\". The step is: each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected to k new vertices. So the first expansion (after the initial step) is that step. So the minimal is that we have to perform this step once. So the minimal number of nodes is 1 +k (initial step plus one expansion step). Wait, but that would be 1 +k. But according to the example, for n=6, the answer is NO. Let me check that. Suppose k=2. Then 1+2 =3. If we do the expansion step once, then adding k^2 =4. So total is 1+2+4=7. Which is more than 6. So for n=6, it's not possible. So perhaps the formula is that the snowflake can be constructed as a sum of a geometric series with m terms, where m ≥ 2. Because the initial step (the root) is 1, then the first expansion step adds k, then the second adds k^2. So the total is 1 +k +k^2. So the expansion steps are done once (so m=2 terms?), or maybe m is the number of expansion steps. So for m expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. But the expansion steps must be done at least once. So m ≥1. Then, for m=1, the total is 1 +k. But that would be the case when the expansion step is done once. But according to the problem statement, the step is done at least once. So that would be allowed. However, in that case, the snowflake would have 1 +k nodes. But according to the sample input, n=2 is not possible. Let's see: for n=2, k must be 1 (since 1 +k=2 →k=1). But k must be >1. So that's invalid. Hence, for n=2, answer is NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nBut then, if m=1 is allowed, then for any n ≥ 1 +k, where k>1, then it's possible. But for example, if n=3, then k=2 (1+2=3). So that would be allowed. But the sample input for n=3 outputs NO. Wait, that's conflicting. Let me check the sample input again. The third test case is n=3, output is NO. So why?\n\nAh, because the problem says that the step must be done at least once. But when m=1, that step is done once. So according to that, n=3 would be possible with k=2. But the sample says it's not. So there must be something wrong with my understanding of the problem.\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. \n\nSo the initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the step (adding k children to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the first step (adding k children) is part of the initial setup. Then, the step (adding to leaves) is done once. So the minimal snowflake is when you have the initial step (root + k children), then the step (each of the k children adds k new nodes). So the total nodes is 1 +k +k^2. Thus, the expansion step (adding to leaves) is done once. Therefore, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, but the initial step is part of the process. Let me think again.\n\nThe process is:\n\nStart with one node.\n\nThen, add k children to the root. (This is the first step.)\n\nThen, perform the step (adding k children to each leaf) at least once. So, the first expansion step is done once. So after that, the total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nSo the minimal snowflake is when the expansion step is done once, leading to 1 +k +k^2 nodes.\n\nSo, the formula for the number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m} k^i, where m is the number of expansion steps, and m ≥1. Because the expansion steps are done at least once. Wait, but the first step (adding k children) is not an expansion step. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the first part is the initial setup (adding k children to the root). Then, the step (adding k children to leaves) is done at least once. So the expansion step is done once. So the total nodes is 1 +k (from initial step) +k^2 (from the first expansion step). So for the snowflake to be valid, the number of nodes must be 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1. Wait, no. Let me think again. The initial step adds k nodes. Then the expansion step is done once. That expansion step adds k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2. If the expansion step is done again, then that adds k^3 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m is the number of expansion steps plus 1? Or perhaps m is the number of expansion steps. Let me think:\n\nOriginal structure: 1 node.\n\nAfter initial step (adding k children): 1 +k nodes. Then, the expansion step is done once (adding k^2 nodes). Then, the expansion step is done again (adding k^3 nodes), etc.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps (since the initial step is not counted as an expansion step). The expansion steps must be done at least once. So m ≥1. Hence, the total nodes is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). Because sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo for example, when m=1, the sum is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step is done once. But that would imply that the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Wait, no. Because when m=1, the expansion steps are done once. Wait, this seems confusing.\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nThe initial step is adding k children to the root. Then, the expansion step is done once. That expansion step is adding k children to each of the leaves. Since the leaves are the k children of the root, each of them adds k children. So the expansion step adds k *k =k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2. Then, if the expansion step is done again, each of the leaves (the k^2 nodes added in the previous expansion step) will have k children added. So the next expansion step adds k^3 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the number of expansion steps is m, and the total nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think of the expansion steps as follows:\n\nThe initial step (adding k children to root) is part of the construction. Then, the expansion steps are the steps where you add k children to each leaf. So for m expansion steps, the total number of nodes is:\n\nInitial: 1\n\nAfter initial step: 1 +k.\n\nAfter first expansion step (m=1): 1 +k +k^2.\n\nAfter second expansion step (m=2): 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo for m expansion steps, the total is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i -k^0? No. Wait, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No. Wait for m expansion steps, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No, for m=1 expansion steps, it's 1 +k +k^2. Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. So m expansion steps correspond to sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i? No. Because m=1 gives sum up to exponent 2 (i=0 to 2). So m expansion steps gives sum up to exponent m+1. But that would be sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i? No. Because for m=1, the exponents are 0,1,2. So the sum is (k^3-1)/(k-1). So the formula for the total number of nodes is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1) ? No. Wait, the sum from i=0 to m+1 is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). But for m expansion steps, the total is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i ?\n\nNo. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, each expansion step adds k^2, then k^3, etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 (original) + k (initial step) + k^2 (first expansion) + k^3 (second expansion) + ... +k^{m+1} (m-th expansion). So the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1} = sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i. Which equals (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). \n\nBut the problem requires that the expansion steps are done at least once. So m ≥1. Therefore, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i, where m ≥1. Which implies that the number of nodes is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1), with m ≥1. But since m can be any integer ≥1, this can be rewritten as for some integer t ≥2 (since m+2 ≥ 3?), no. Let me think: m ≥1 → m+1 ≥ 2. So the sum is sum_{i=0}^{t} k^i, where t ≥2. So the total number of nodes is S = (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1), where t ≥2. Wait, no. Because for m expansion steps, the sum is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i. So t = m+1. Since m ≥1, t ≥ 2. So S = (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, no. The formula for sum_{i=0}^n k^i is (k^{n+1} -1)/(k-1). So if the sum is up to exponent t, then it's (k^{t+1} -1)/(k-1). So in our case, the sum is up to exponent t, where t = m+1. For example, when m=1 (one expansion step), the sum is up to exponent 2 (t=2). So S = (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written as (k^{t} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and t ≥3. Because t = m+1 +1? Wait no. Let me rephrase:\n\nWait, the sum is S = (k^{t} -1)/(k-1), where t is the number of terms in the sum. For example, when the sum is 1 +k +k^2, that's three terms (t=3). So the formula is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2. So in this case, t is the number of terms. And the problem requires that the expansion steps are done at least once. Which corresponds to t ≥3? Because the minimal case is 1 +k +k^2, which is t=3 terms. So yes.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to: For a given n, does there exist integers k>1 and t ≥3 such that n = (k^t -1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, but what about cases where the expansion steps are done more than once. For example, if we have two expansion steps, then the sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. Which is (k^4-1)/(k-1). So t=4. So in general, the formula is n = (k^t -1)/(k-1), where t ≥3 and k ≥2.\n\nBut wait, let me check for t=2. Then the formula would be (k^2 -1)/(k-1) = k+1. Which would be 1 +k. But that's the case where the expansion steps are not done. Because the initial step (adding k children) is done, but the expansion steps (adding to leaves) are done zero times. Which is invalid according to the problem statement. Hence, t must be ≥3.\n\nSo the problem now is to check for a given n, whether there exists integers k ≥2 and t ≥3 such that n = (k^t -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut how do we check this for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nThe approach is to iterate over possible t values and check if there exists a k for that t such that the equation holds.\n\nBut considering that t can be up to log_2(n) (since for k=2, the minimal value for t is 3, which gives (2^3 -1)/(2-1) =7. So for n up to 1e18, t can be up to around 60, since 2^60 is around 1e18.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nCheck if there exists t ≥3 such that there exists an integer k ≥2 where n = (k^t -1)/(k-1).\n\nBut how to check this efficiently.\n\nLet me think about for each possible t (starting from 3 up to log_2(n)+1), check if there's a k that satisfies the equation.\n\nFor each t, we can perform a binary search on k to find if such k exists.\n\nBecause for a fixed t, the function f(k) = (k^t -1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing with k. So for each t, we can compute the minimal and maximal possible values of f(k) and see if n falls into that range, and then perform a binary search on k to find if there's a k that makes f(k) equal to n.\n\nBut first, for each t, what is the minimal and maximal possible value of f(k)?\n\nWell, for k=2, f(k) = 2^t -1 + ...? Wait, f(k) = (k^t -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1}.\n\nSo for example, for t=3, it's 1 +k +k^2. For k=2, this is 7. For k=3, it's 1+3+9=13, which is the sample input's fifth test case (n=13, output YES).\n\nSo for each t, the minimal possible value is when k=2, which is (2^t -1)/(2-1) = 2^t -1. The maximum possible value for a given t is unbounded, but for our purposes, since n is up to 1e18, we can find the upper bound for k.\n\nBut how to find for a given t, whether there exists a k such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\nLet me denote S = (k^t -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nMultiply both sides by (k-1):\n\nk^t -1 = n(k-1)\n\nRearranged:\n\nk^t - n*k + (n -1) = 0.\n\nBut solving this equation for k is difficult. However, for fixed t, we can use binary search on k.\n\nBut for a given t, the function S(k) increases with k, so binary search is feasible.\n\nFor example, for t=3:\n\nS(k) = 1 +k +k^2.\n\nWe can find the minimal k where S(k) >=n, and check if it's exactly equal to n.\n\nBut how to find the upper bound for k in the binary search.\n\nFor a given t, the minimal value is when k=2, which is 2^t -1. The maximum value of k for which S(k) ≤n can be found by noting that S(k) is roughly k^{t-1} (since the leading term is k^{t-1}).\n\nSo for example, for a given t, the upper bound for k can be set to n^(1/(t-1)) +1. Because when k is larger than that, S(k) will be larger than n.\n\nSo for each t, we can perform a binary search between low=2 and high=some upper limit (like n^(1/(t-1)) + 1). But how to compute that upper limit?\n\nAlternatively, since for fixed t, the value of k can't be larger than n, because even for k= n, S(k) = 1 +n +n^2 + ... +n^{t-1} which is way larger than n. So for binary search, we can set high to something like n, but that might be too slow for large t. However, given that t can be up to around 60, and for each t, the binary search would take O(log n) steps, and for each step, computing S(k) is O(t) time. But since t is small (up to 60), this is manageable.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nIf n is 1: output NO (since the minimal snowflake is 1 +k +k^2, which for k=2 is 7, but n=1 is only possible if t=1, which is invalid).\n\nElse:\n\nCheck for all possible t from 3 up to max_t (where max_t is such that 2^t -1 <=n). For each t:\n\n- Binary search for k in [2, ...] such that S(k) =n.\n\nIf for any t and k, this holds, return YES.\n\nElse, after checking all t, return NO.\n\nNow, the question is how to find the possible t's to check.\n\nWhat's the maximum possible t for which 2^t -1 <=n?\n\nSince for t=60, 2^60 is about 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, t can be up to 60.\n\nSo for each n, we can loop t from 3 up to 60 (or until 2^t -1 exceeds n).\n\nSo for example, for n=1e18, t can be up to log2(1e18 +1) ≈ 60.\n\nSo for each t in 3 to 60:\n\nCheck if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^t -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nNow, for each t, how to perform the binary search.\n\nLet me think about the binary search steps.\n\nFor a given t, the function S(k) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1}.\n\nWe can compute S(k) for a given k and t.\n\nBut for large k and t, this could be a big number. However, since n is up to 1e18, and t is up to 60, even for k=1e6, t=60, the sum would be 1e6^59 which is way larger than 1e18. So during the binary search, we can compute S(k) incrementally and stop early if it exceeds n.\n\nSo here's how to compute S(k, t):\n\nInitialize sum = 0.\n\nfor i in 0 to t-1:\n\nsum += k^i\n\nif sum >n: break and return something larger than n.\n\nBut calculating k^i for large exponents may be computationally expensive. However, since for each t, the maximum possible k is small (since S(k) increases rapidly with k), we can compute it with care.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute the sum as (k^t -1) // (k-1), but for large exponents, this can cause overflow. However, since in Python, integers are arbitrary precision, this isn't a problem. But we have to be cautious about the computation.\n\nBut for the binary search, perhaps it's better to compute the sum incrementally and check for overflow.\n\nBut let's proceed with the following approach for a given t and candidate k:\n\nCompute S = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{t-1}\n\nIf during the summation, the sum exceeds n, we can break early and return a value larger than n.\n\nSo for example, for t=3 and k=2, sum is 1 +2 +4 =7.\n\nSo during binary search, for each candidate k, compute the sum step by step.\n\nNow, for the binary search:\n\nWe need to find if there exists a k such that S(k) =n.\n\nThe lower bound for k is 2, upper bound can be found as follows: since S(k) is increasing with k, the maximum possible k for which S(k) could be <=n is when S(k) is approximately k^{t-1} <=n → k <=n^(1/(t-1)).\n\nThus, the upper bound can be set to n^(1/(t-1)) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute that in Python? Well, we can take the integer part of n^(1/(t-1)) and add 1.\n\nBut since for t=3, the upper bound is sqrt(n) +1.\n\nSo for each t, the binary search can be between low=2 and high=upper_bound.\n\nBut how to compute upper_bound?\n\nIn code, for a given t, upper_bound can be something like:\n\nupper = int(n ** (1/(t-1))) + 2.\n\nBut for cases where t-1 is large (like t=60, t-1=59), n^(1/59) could be 1 or 2 for small n. So this is manageable.\n\nOnce the binary search is set up, for each candidate k in [low, high], compute S(k) and compare with n.\n\nIf during the computation of S(k), the sum exceeds n, then we know that the current k is too big, and we can adjust the binary search accordingly.\n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nLet me think about writing a helper function for a given t and k, which returns the sum S(k, t) and whether it's equal to n, less than, or greater than.\n\nBut for the binary search, we can perform the following steps:\n\nFor a given t, perform binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound.\n\nInitialize low=2, high=upper_bound.\n\nWhile low <= high:\n\nmid = (low + high) // 2.\n\nCompute sum_val = 1 +k + ... +k^{t-1}.\n\nif sum_val ==n → return True.\n\nelif sum_val <n → need to increase k → low = mid +1.\n\nelse → decrease k → high = mid -1.\n\nBut how to compute sum_val?\n\nLet me write a helper function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for i in range(t):\n\n        total += k**i\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n    return total\n\nBut for large t and k, this could be slow. However, given that t is up to 60, and for each binary search step, this is O(t) operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for k=2 and t=60, the sum is 2^60 -1, which is about 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, this is manageable.\n\nAnother optimization: note that for k >=2, and t >=3, the sum is at least 1 +2 + 2^2 =7. So for n <7, the answer is NO.\n\nSo for example, in the sample input, n=1, 2,3,6 are all less than 7, hence output NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo, the steps for each test case:\n\nif n <7 → output NO.\n\nelse:\n\nfor t in 3 to max_t (max_t is up to 60):\n\n   compute upper_bound for k as floor(n^(1/(t-1))) +2.\n\n   perform binary search between 2 and upper_bound for k.\n\n   if any k found where compute_sum(k, t, n) ==n → return YES.\n\nif none found after all t → return NO.\n\nBut what about the case where t is larger than log2(n) +1?\n\nFor example, for t=60, 2^60 is 1.15e18. So for n=1e18, t=60 would have upper_bound for k as 1e18^(1/(59)) which is about 1. So upper_bound is 1+2=3. So for k=2, compute_sum(2, 60, n) is (2^60 -1)/(2-1) = 2^60 -1. Which is 1.15e18. So for n=1e18, this is larger than n. So the binary search would find that no k exists for this t.\n\nBut for t=3, let's say n=7. Then k=2, sum is 7. So returns yes.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample input 13:\n\nn=13.\n\nCheck for t=3:\n\nupper bound for k is 13^(1/2) ~3.6 → upper is 3+2=5.\n\nbinary search between 2 and 5.\n\nfor mid=2: sum is 1 +2 +4 =7 <13 → low=3.\n\nmid=(3+5)/2=4. sum for k=4: 1+4+16=21>13 → high=3.\n\nmid=3: sum is 1+3+9=13 → yes. So returns yes.\n\nHence, answer is yes.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is 15. Output is yes.\n\nLet me see for t=3:\n\nk=3: sum is 1+3+9=13 <15.\n\nk=4: 1+4+16=21>15. So no solution for t=3.\n\nCheck t=4:\n\nsum is (k^4-1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nLooking for this sum to be 15.\n\nTry k=2: 1+2+4+8=15. Yes. So for t=4, k=2, sum is 15. So answer yes.\n\nSo the sample input for n=15 outputs yes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nCheck if n is 1 → no.\n\nElse, check if n is 2,3,6 → no.\n\nBut for n >=7, check all possible t from 3 up to max_t.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut first, for each t, how to compute the upper bound for k.\n\nIn Python, we can compute the upper bound as:\n\nupper = int(n ** (1/(t-1))) + 2.\n\nBut for exponents, using floating point may have precision issues. For example, for large exponents, but perhaps for the purposes of binary search, even if upper is a bit larger than needed, it's okay.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n <7 → print 'NO'\n\nelse:\n\nfound = False\n\nfor t in 3 to max_t:\n\n   # compute max_t: the maximum t for which 2^t -1 <=n.\n\n   # but since for each t, we can check if 2^t -1 <=n.\n\n   # but how to find the upper limit for t?\n\n   # since 2^t -1 <=n → t <= log2(n+1)\n\n   # for example, for n=1e18, log2(n) is about 60.\n\n   # So for each n, loop t from 3 up to 60 (say, 60 is safe).\n\n   # So in code, loop t from 3 to 60:\n\n   # but for each t, check if 2^t -1 <=n. If not, break.\n\n   # because for higher t, 2^t -1 will be larger than n.\n\n   # So for example, for t=3, check if 2^3 -1 =7 <=n. If not, break.\n\n   # else proceed.\n\n   # So code:\n\n   # compute min_val = 2^t -1.\n\n   # if min_val >n → break the loop for t.\n\n   # else proceed.\n\n   # So in code:\n\n   # for t in range(3, 61):\n\n   #   min_val = 2**t -1\n\n   #   if min_val >n:\n\n   #       break\n\n   #   else:\n\n   #       perform binary search for k.\n\nBut how to compute 2^t for large t? Well, in Python, 2**t is manageable as long as t is up to 60.\n\nSo for each t in 3 to 60:\n\n   min_val = 2^t -1.\n\n   if min_val >n → break.\n\n   else:\n\n      compute upper_bound for k as int(n ** (1/(t-1))) +2.\n\n      perform binary search between low=2 and high=upper_bound.\n\n      during binary search, compute the sum for k and t.\n\n      if found, set found=True and break.\n\nOnce any t and k is found, return 'YES'.\n\nElse, after all t, return 'NO'.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nCase n=7 → t=3, k=2 → yes.\n\nCase n=15 → t=4, k=2 → yes.\n\nAnother case: n=31. For t=3, k=3: 1+3+9=13 <31. k=4: 1+4+16=21 <31. k=5: 1+5+25=31 → yes. So returns yes.\n\nAnother case: n=31 can also be represented as t=5, k=2: sum is 1+2+4+8+16=31. So yes.\n\nSo the code would find it for t=3 or t=5.\n\nNow, code implementation.\n\nBut for the code, how to compute the sum for k and t?\n\nImplementing the helper function as:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    for i in range(t):\n\n        term = k ** i\n\n        total += term\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return float('inf')\n\n    return total\n\nBut for large exponents, like t=60 and k=2, this would compute 2^59, which is a big number, but in Python, it's manageable.\n\nBut for the binary search, we can proceed.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each test case:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nif n <7:\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    found = False\n\n    for t_val in range(3, 61):\n\n        # compute min_val for k=2\n\n        min_val = (2**t_val -1) // (2-1)  # which is 2^t_val -1\n\n        if min_val >n:\n\n            break\n\n        # else, proceed to check for this t_val\n\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in such a way that it starts with one vertex and expands by adding layers of vertices according to specific rules. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A valid snowflake graph can be represented by the formula $ S = \\frac{k^t - 1}{k - 1} $, where $ k > 1 $ and $ t \\geq 3 $. Here, $ k $ is the number of new vertices added at each step, and $ t $ is the number of expansion steps.\n2. **Constraints Check**: For $ n < 7 $, it's impossible to form a valid snowflake graph since the minimum number of vertices required is 7 (when $ k = 2 $ and $ t = 3 $).\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Values**: For each possible value of $ t $ (from 3 up to 60), check if there exists an integer $ k $ such that the formula holds true for the given $ n $. This involves binary search over possible values of $ k $ for each $ t $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef compute_sum(k, t, n):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(t):\n        term = k ** i\n        total += term\n        if total > n:\n            return float('inf')\n    return total\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_t = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18\n    for t_val in range(3, max_t + 1):\n        # Check if 2^t_val - 1 <= n\n        min_val = (2 ** t_val) - 1\n        if min_val > n:\n            break\n        # Compute upper bound for k\n        exponent = 1.0 / (t_val - 1)\n        upper_k = int(n ** exponent) + 2\n        low = 2\n        high = upper_k\n        found = False\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            s = compute_sum(mid, t_val, n)\n            if s == n:\n                return True\n            elif s < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Minimum Value**: If $ n $ is less than 7, immediately return \"NO\".\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Expansion Steps**: For each possible number of expansion steps $ t $ from 3 to 60, check if the minimum possible value (using $ k = 2 $) exceeds $ n $. If it does, break out of the loop.\n4. **Binary Search for Valid $ k $**: For each valid $ t $, perform a binary search on $ k $ to check if there exists an integer $ k $ such that the sum formula equals $ n $.\n5. **Sum Calculation**: The helper function `compute_sum` calculates the sum of the geometric series incrementally to avoid overflow and early termination if the sum exceeds $ n $.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all possible configurations of $ k $ and $ t $ to determine if a valid snowflake graph can be formed for the given $ n $.",
