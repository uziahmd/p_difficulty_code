The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure of such a graph.\n\nSo, according to the problem statement:\n\nThe snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (i.e., the leaves) are each connected to k new vertices. This process must be done at least once. So, the construction has multiple layers.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows with each step. Let's consider the example given. For k=4, the smallest snowflake has 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21? Wait, maybe not. Let me re-examine the steps.\n\nThe initial step: one vertex. Then, we add k vertices connected to it. So after first step, total vertices is 1 + k. Then, each of those k vertices (which are leaves) are connected to k new vertices. So for each of those k vertices, we add k new ones. So that's k * k more vertices. So total vertices now is 1 + k + k^2. But wait, the problem says that this step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we do this once. So the minimal snowflake for k=4 would have 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1+4+16=21 vertices. But the example input says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Hmm. Let me check the sample input.\n\nIn the sample input, for n=13, output is YES. Let's think. How can 13 be achieved?\n\nLet me think about the possible structures. Let's model the number of vertices based on the number of layers.\n\nThe construction seems to be similar to a tree where each node added in a certain level has exactly k children. But the process is that each time, you take all the leaves (nodes with degree 1) and add k children to each. However, the process must be done at least once. So the initial step is creating the root with k children. Then, each of those children (the leaves) get k children. So the number of vertices would be:\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say the snowflake has m layers. Wait, but how many layers?\n\nLet me think about the structure as follows. The initial vertex is layer 0. Then, the first expansion adds layer 1 (k nodes). Then, the second expansion adds layer 2 (each node in layer 1 adds k nodes, so k^2 nodes). Then, if we do another expansion, layer 3 adds k^3 nodes. And so on. However, the process requires that after the initial step (layer 1), the expansion (adding layer 2) must be done at least once. So the minimum number of layers is 2 (so that the expansion step is done once).\n\nBut the total number of vertices would be 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of layers. Wait no, because the initial step is adding k nodes (layer 1), then each expansion step adds another layer. But the problem says that after the initial step (adding the first k nodes), the expansion step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we have two layers: initial (1 node), then layer 1 (k nodes), then layer 2 (k^2 nodes). So the total is 1 + k + k^2. Wait but the example input shows that for n=13, the answer is YES. Let's see: 1 + k + k^2 = 13. Let's solve for k. For example, k^2 +k +1=13. So k^2 +k -12=0. The solutions are [-1 ± sqrt(1+48)]/2 = [ -1 ±7 ]/2. Positive solution is (6)/2=3. So k=3. Then 1+3+9=13. So yes. So that's why n=13 is a yes. That makes sense.\n\nSo the snowflake can be constructed with any number of layers, as long as there's at least two layers (since the expansion step must be done once). So for example, the total number of vertices could be 1 + k + k^2 (two layers), or 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 (three layers), etc. Also, perhaps the expansion steps can be done multiple times, but the key is that the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) is done at least once.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex (i.e., the leaves) is connected to k new vertices. So, after the initial step (layer 1), the expansion step is done once (layer 2). Then, perhaps another expansion step (layer 3) can be done. So the total number of vertices is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of layers. But the expansion step is done m-1 times. Since the first expansion (from layer 0 to 1) is the initial step, then the expansion steps are done m-1 times. Wait, perhaps I need to model the number of layers.\n\nAlternatively, the snowflake can be built in such a way that the number of vertices is of the form:\n\nn = 1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{d}) ), where d >=1 ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the construction steps:\n\nStart with 1 node (root).\n\nFirst expansion: add k nodes connected to the root. Now, total is 1 +k. Each of these k nodes is a leaf (degree 1). Now, the expansion step (as per the problem's description) is to connect each of these leaves to k new nodes. This step must be done at least once. So after this, the total becomes 1 +k +k*k = 1 +k +k². Then, if we do another expansion step, each of the k² leaves (from the previous step) are connected to k new nodes. So adding k³ nodes. So the total would be 1 +k +k² +k³. And so on.\n\nSo the total number of vertices is 1 + k*(k^d -1)/(k-1), where d is the number of expansions. Because:\n\nThe initial step is 1 node.\n\nThen, each expansion adds k^i nodes, where i starts from 1.\n\nWait, for example, the first expansion (after the initial step) adds k nodes (i=1). The second expansion adds k^2 nodes (i=2). The third adds k^3 nodes (i=3). So the total number of vertices is 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i, where m is the number of expansion steps. But since the expansion step must be done at least once, m ≥ 1.\n\nWait, but the sum from i=1 to m of k^i is equal to (k^{m+1} -k)/(k-1). Let me check:\n\nsum_{i=1}^m k^i = k*(k^m -1)/(k-1). Because the sum of geometric series from 0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). Subtracting 1 (the term for i=0) gives sum from 1 to m as (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1) - 1 = [k^{m+1} -1 - (k-1)]/(k-1) ) = [k^{m+1} -k]/(k-1) = k(k^m -1)/(k-1). \n\nSo total vertices is 1 + [k(k^m -1)]/(k-1). \n\nBut m is the number of expansion steps. Since the expansion step must be done at least once, m ≥ 1.\n\nSo for the snowflake to exist, there must be some integer k>1 and m≥1 such that n equals 1 + [k(k^m -1)]/(k-1).\n\nAlternatively, simplifying the formula:\n\nLet me compute 1 + [k(k^m -1)]/(k-1) = 1 + [k^{m+1} -k]/(k-1) = [ (k-1) + k^{m+1} -k ] / (k-1) ) = [k^{m+1} -1 ] / (k-1) ?\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nOriginal expression is 1 + [k(k^m -1)]/(k-1) = [ (k-1) + k(k^m -1) ] / (k-1) \n\nExpanding numerator:\n\nk-1 + k^{m+1} -k = k^{m+1} -1 \n\nYes! So the total number of vertices is (k^{m+1} -1 )/(k-1). \n\nWait, that's interesting. Because that's the formula for the sum of a geometric series from 0 to m. For example, sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). But according to our previous analysis, the total number of vertices is that sum. Because:\n\nOriginal steps:\n\nStart with 1 node (sum up to i=0: 1).\n\nThen, adding k nodes (sum up to i=1: 1 +k).\n\nThen adding k^2 nodes (sum up to i=2: 1 +k +k²).\n\nAnd so on. So the total number of vertices is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥1 (since the expansion step must be done at least once). Because when m=1, the sum is 1 +k, but that would mean that the expansion step was done once? Wait, no. Because according to the problem statement, the expansion step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding the first k nodes) is the first expansion. Then the next step (adding k^2 nodes) is the second expansion. So for m=1, the total is 1 +k, but that's only after the initial step. However, according to the problem statement, the expansion step (adding the k^2 nodes) must be done at least once. So that would require m ≥ 2?\n\nWait, this seems conflicting with earlier analysis. Let me re-examine.\n\nProblem statement:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the initial step (adding k nodes) is the first part. Then, the expansion step (adding k nodes to each leaf) is done at least once. So after the initial step, the expansion step is done once. So the total vertices would be 1 +k +k^2. Which is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. So m is 2 in that case. So the sum from i=0 to m, where m is at least 2? Or perhaps m is the number of expansion steps. Let me think again.\n\nLet me think of the expansion steps:\n\nStep 0: Start with 1 node.\n\nStep 1: Add k nodes connected to the root. Now, the leaves are the k nodes. This is the first expansion. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step (the part where you add k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. So after step 1, we have to perform this expansion step once. So step 2: add k^2 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k^2. So the expansion step is done once. So in this case, the total is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i = (k^3 -1)/(k-1).\n\nSo the formula for the total number of vertices is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2. Because m is the maximum exponent. Because for m=2, the expansion step was done once (the step that added the k^2 nodes). So m must be ≥ 2. But wait, what if m is larger than 2? Like m=3, which would imply that after adding the k^2 nodes, another expansion step is done (adding k^3 nodes). So the expansion steps are done twice. So the condition is that m ≥ 2. Because the expansion steps are done m-1 times. Because:\n\nThe initial step (step 1) is adding k nodes. Then, the expansion steps (step 2, step 3, etc.) are done m-1 times. So for m ≥2, the expansion steps are done at least once.\n\nSo the total number of vertices is sum_{i=0}^m k^i = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m ≥ 2, and k ≥2.\n\nWait, but m can be any integer ≥ 1? No. Because for m=1, the sum is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k nodes) is not considered an expansion step. The expansion step is the process of adding k new nodes to each leaf. So in the case where m=1, the sum is 1 +k. But that would mean that the expansion step hasn't been done yet. Because the expansion step is the step that adds the k^2 nodes. Therefore, m must be ≥ 2.\n\nSo the formula for n is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where m ≥ 1, and k ≥ 2. Wait, no. Because when m is the number of expansion steps. Let me re-express.\n\nLet me rephrase the problem. The snowflake is built as follows:\n\n- Start with 1 node.\n\n- Then, add k children to it. (this is the first expansion)\n\n- Then, perform the expansion step (adding k children to each leaf) at least once. So after that, the number of nodes is 1 +k +k². Then, if you do more expansions, you add k^3, etc.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^d, where d ≥ 2. Because d is the maximum exponent. For example, if d=2, then the sum is 1 +k +k². If d=3, then 1 +k +k² +k³, etc.\n\nBut 1 +k +k² + ... +k^d = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). So the problem reduces to checking if n can be written in this form for some integers k ≥2 and d ≥2.\n\nSo the problem becomes: given n, check if there exists integers k ≥2 and d ≥2 such that (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) = n.\n\nAlternatively, since d+1 can be any integer ≥3 (since d ≥2), but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of exponents.\n\nBut how can we check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nLet me think about the possible approaches.\n\nFirst, for each test case n, we need to check whether there exists k ≥2 and d ≥2 such that the above equation holds.\n\nBut how to find k and d for a given n?\n\nLet me think about the equation:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1).\n\nWe need to find integers k ≥2 and d ≥2 such that this holds.\n\nNow, note that for fixed d, we can try to find k such that this equation holds. But since d can be up to log_2(n) (since k ≥2 and d ≥2, the minimal value for each d is when k=2, d=2: (2^3-1)/(2-1)=7. So for n ≥7, there's a possibility.)\n\nBut given that n can be up to 1e18, trying all possible d for each n might be feasible, because for each n, the maximum possible d is log_2(n). For example, for d=60, 2^60 is around 1e18. So for each n, we can iterate d from 2 up to log_2(n) (say up to 60), and for each d, check if there exists a k such that the equation holds.\n\nBut how to check for each d, if there's a k?\n\nFor a fixed d, the equation becomes:\n\nn = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) → which can be rewritten as:\n\nn = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d.\n\nBut solving for k here is challenging. However, for fixed d, the function f(k) = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) is strictly increasing with k. So for each d, we can perform a binary search over k ≥2 to see if there's a k such that f(k) = n.\n\nBut how to compute f(k) for a given k and d?\n\nFor example, for d=2, f(k) = 1 +k +k^2. For d=3, it's 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, etc.\n\nBut for large d, even if k is small, the value can be very big. So for each d, we can perform a binary search on k, starting from 2 up to some upper bound. The upper bound for k can be determined as follows: since f(k) increases with k, and for k ≥2, f(k) ≥1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^d = 2^{d+1} -1. So for a given n, the maximum possible k is such that f(k) ≤n. For example, for d fixed, the upper bound for k can be found as the maximum between 2 and the value where f(k) ≤n.\n\nBut how to compute f(k) without overflow? Well, since n is up to 1e18, and d is up to 60, even for k=2 and d=60, the value is 2^61-1/(2-1) = 2^61-1 ~ 2e18, which is manageable with Python's arbitrary precision integers.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\nCheck if n is 1: answer is NO (since the minimal possible is when k=2, d=2: 1+2+4=7).\n\nElse, for each possible d (starting from 2 up to max_d), check if there exists a k ≥2 such that (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) =n. If for any d and k this holds, return YES. Else, return NO.\n\nNow, the question is how to choose the range for d. Let's think about the maximum possible d. For example, for d+1 steps. Let's take k=2. For d=2, the value is 7. For d=3, it's 15. For d=4, it's 31. For d=5, 63. For d=60, 2^61-1/(2-1) = 2^61-1 ≈ 2.3e18. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum possible d is about 60. So for each n, we can loop d from 2 up to 60, and for each d, perform a binary search on k.\n\nBut how to handle the case where d is large? For example, for d=60, the minimal value is when k=2, which is 2^61-1/(2-1) = 2^61-1. For n=1e18, which is about 1e18, which is less than 2^60 (which is ~1.15e18). So for d=60, the minimal k=2 would give a value larger than 1e18. So for larger d, the minimal possible value may be larger than n, so we can stop early.\n\nSo the steps for each test case:\n\nIf n is 1: output NO.\n\nElse, for d in 2 to max_d (like 60):\n\n   compute the minimal possible value for this d (when k=2). If it's larger than n, break (since higher d will have even larger minimal values).\n\n   else, perform a binary search on k in [2, ... upper_bound] to see if there exists a k such that f(k) =n.\n\nIf any of these checks returns true, output YES. Else, output NO.\n\nNow, how to compute f(k) for a given k and d?\n\nWell, f(k) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). But calculating this directly can be done with exponentiation.\n\nBut for large d, even with k=2 and d=60, this is manageable in Python.\n\nBut during the binary search, we need to compute this value and compare it with n.\n\nBut there's a problem: for very large exponents, even with k=2 and d=60, the value can be up to 2^61-1, which is manageable.\n\nSo, during binary search, for a given k and d, compute the sum s = (k^{d+1} -1) // (k-1). But how to compute that?\n\nBut for k=1, the formula is invalid, but since k≥2, it's okay.\n\nBut during the binary search, for a given k and d, we can compute the sum as follows:\n\ns = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^d.\n\nBut for large d, this can be computed iteratively, and if during the computation it exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula (k^{d+1} -1) // (k-1).\n\nBut in code, for a given k and d, we can compute this.\n\nBut how to compute k^{d+1} efficiently? Well, in Python, pow(k, d+1) is straightforward.\n\nBut for large exponents, even for k=2 and d=60, this is 2^61 which is manageable.\n\nSo, during the binary search for a given d, we can compute the value of the sum for a given k, and compare it with n.\n\nBut what about possible overflows? Since Python uses arbitrary-precision integers, there's no issue.\n\nNow, the binary search for each d:\n\nFor a fixed d, the function f(k) is strictly increasing with k. So for each d, we can binary search k in the range [2, ... upper_bound], where upper_bound can be determined as follows: for k=2, the value is (2^{d+1} -1)/(2-1) = 2^{d+1} -1. For larger k, the value is larger. So for a given n, the upper bound for k can be found by finding the maximum k such that f(k) ≤n. However, since f(k) increases with k, we can set the upper bound as n (since for k ≥2, f(k) ≥1 +k, which is at least 3, and for k=n, f(k) would be way larger than n. But binary search can proceed with low=2 and high=some upper limit, like n. However, for large n (like 1e18), this may be slow. But considering that for each d, the maximum possible d is around 60, and for each d, the binary search would take O(log n) steps, which is acceptable for t=1e4.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way to find the upper bound for k. For example, since f(k) = 1 +k + ... +k^d ≥k^d. So k^d ≤n → k ≤n^(1/d). So for a given d, the upper bound for k can be up to n^(1/d) + 1. Which can be calculated as int(n ** (1/d)) + 2. But how to compute this in Python?\n\nAlternatively, during binary search, we can start with low=2 and high= something like 2, and increase high until f(high) exceeds n. But for efficiency, perhaps better to use the initial upper bound as n.\n\nBut for practical purposes, even if we set high to be 2e6 or something, for d up to 60, it's manageable. But for n=1e18 and d=2, the maximum k is such that 1 +k +k^2 =n. Solving for k, the maximum possible k is about sqrt(n). For n=1e18, sqrt(n) is 1e9. So binary search from 2 to 1e9 would take about 30 steps. For each step, compute the sum, which for d=2 is O(1) with the formula. So for each d, binary search is O( log (upper_bound) ) steps. For each step, the calculation of the sum can be done with the formula.\n\nBut how to compute the sum correctly? Let's think about possible overflows. But in Python, it's not an issue.\n\nSo, putting this together, the code outline is:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    read n\n\n    if n == 1:\n\n        print 'NO'\n\n        continue\n\n    found = False\n\n    for d in 2 to 60:\n\n        # compute the minimal possible value for this d (k=2)\n\n        # if this is already larger than n, break, since higher d will have even larger minimal values\n\n        min_val = (2^(d+1) -1) // (2-1) = 2^{d+1} -1\n\n        if min_val >n:\n\n            break\n\n        # else, perform binary search for k in [2, ... upper]\n\n        low = 2\n\n        high = ?\n\n        # upper can be something like n, but let's find a better upper bound.\n\n        # since for k >=2, f(k) >=k^d, so k^d <=n → k <= n^(1/d)\n\n        upper = int(n ** (1/d)) + 2\n\n        # but in Python, taking roots can be tricky for integers. Alternatively, we can use binary search with high as n.\n\n        # for the binary search, let's set high to n, but in practice, the actual upper bound is much smaller.\n\n        # perform binary search between low=2 and high= some upper limit.\n\n        # during binary search, for mid, compute the sum and compare with n.\n\n        # but how to compute the sum?\n\n        # compute sum = (mid^{d+1} -1) // (mid -1)\n\n        # but for mid=1, division by zero.

But since we are comparing to n, which is up to 1e18, and mid is up to n^(1/d), which for d=60 is small (since n^(1/60) is about 1e18^(1/60) = e^( (18 ln 10)/60 )) ≈ e^( (41.5)/60 ) ≈ e^0.69 ≈ 2. So for d=60, mid is up to 2 or 3.\n\n            # So in practice, mid is small, so mid ** (d+1) is manageable.\n\n            # So proceed.\n\n            try:\n\n                numerator = pow(mid, d+1) - 1\n\n                denominator = mid -1\n\n                s = numerator // denominator\n\n            except:\n\n                # handle division?

For example, for mid=2 and d=2, the formula gives (2^3 -1)/(2-1) = 7, which is correct. For mid=3 and d=2, (3^3-1)/2 = 26/2 =13, which is correct. So that works.\n\nBut what if during the calculation of pow(mid, d+1), the value is too large? In Python, it's okay, since it handles big integers.\n\nBut for some cases, even if mid is small and d is large, mid^(d+1) can be very big. However, since during the binary search, we have already ensured that the upper bound is such that the value is >=n, and for mid being in the binary search range, the calculation is manageable.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that for some values of mid and d, the formula may not be accurate due to integer division. Wait, no. Because the formula (mid^{d+1} -1) divided by (mid-1) is exactly equal to the sum 1 + mid + mid^2 + ... + mid^d. Because:\n\nsum_{i=0}^d mid^i = (mid^{d+1} -1)/(mid -1). So the formula is correct.\n\nBut in code, when we compute (mid ** (d+1) -1) // (mid -1), it's correct.\n\nBut there's a problem with the calculation when mid is 1. But since mid starts at 2, that's not a problem.\n\nAnother thing to note is that for some cases, the sum can be calculated as (mid^{d+1} -1) // (mid -1), but when mid is very large, even for small d, the value can be larger than n, but during binary search, we can check.\n\nBut what about the case where during the binary search, the calculation of s exceeds n? The binary search will adjust accordingly.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nTest case 1: n=1 → output NO.\n\nTest case 2: n=2 → output NO.\n\nTest case 3: n=3 → output NO.\n\nTest case 4: n=6 → output NO.\n\nTest case 5: n=13 → YES. Let's see.\n\nFor d=2:\n\nmin_val is 2^3 -1 =7. Which is <=13. So binary search for k.\n\nWe need to find k such that (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =13 → k^2 +k +1 =13 →k^2 +k -12=0 →k=3. So for d=2, k=3. So during the binary search, this will be found.\n\nSimilarly, for n=15:\n\nCheck for d=2: 1 +k +k^2 =15 →k^2 +k -14=0 →k=( -1 + sqrt(1+56 )) / 2 → sqrt(57)=~7.5 → (6.5)/2=3.25. So no integer solution. For d=3: sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 = (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =15. Let's see for k=2: (16-1)/1 =15 → yes. So for d=3, k=2. So the answer is YES.\n\nSo the code would find this.\n\nNow, for the sample input, the output for n=15 is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=255. Let's see. For example, 255 is 2^8 -1. So for k=2, d+1=8 →d=7. So sum is 1 + 2 + ... + 2^7 = 2^8 -1 =255. So yes. So code would find this.\n\nAnother sample input is 1000000000000000000 (1e18). The output is NO. Let's see why. We need to check if there's a k and d such that (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) =1e18. For example, let's check for d=2: 1 +k +k^2 =1e18. Solve for k. Approximately k^2 ~1e18 →k ~1e9. Let's compute for k=1e9: 1e9^2 +1e9 +1 = 1e18 + ... which is larger than 1e18. So maybe k is around sqrt(1e18) - something. But even if there is a solution for d=2, but perhaps there isn't. Alternatively, for d=3, (k^4 -1)/(k-1) = k^3 +k^2 +k +1 =1e18. For k=100, this is 1e6 + ... which is way smaller. For k= 1e6, the value is (1e6)^3 + ... which is 1e18 + ... So maybe for k=1e6, the value is 1e18 + ... which may be larger than 1e18. So perhaps there's no exact solution.\n\nBut according to the sample input, for 1e18 the output is NO. So the code would return NO.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle all these cases.\n\nBut what about cases where d is larger than 60? For example, for k=2 and d=60, the value is 2^61 -1 ≈ 2.3e18. Which is larger than 1e18. So for n=1e18, when d=60, the minimal value is 2.3e18 which is larger than n. So the code would break the loop for d.\n\nSo the code's loop for d from 2 to 60 is sufficient.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement for each test case:\n\nCheck if n is 1 → no.\n\nElse, loop d from 2 to 60:\n\n   compute min_val = 2^{d+1} -1. If min_val >n → break.\n\n   else:\n\n      perform binary search for k in [2, ... ].\n\nBut how to compute min_val? For d up to 60, 2^{d+1} can be computed as 1 << (d",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a snowflake graph as defined by the problem. The snowflake graph is constructed in a specific hierarchical manner, and we need to check if there exists any valid configuration of parameters $ k $ (number of children per node) and $ d $ (depth of the graph) such that the total number of vertices equals $ n $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands by adding layers of vertices. Each layer adds $ k $ new vertices to each leaf node from the previous layer. The total number of vertices after $ d $ layers is given by the formula $ \\frac{k^{d+1} - 1}{k - 1} $, which is the sum of a geometric series.\n\n2. **Constraints Check**: For each test case, we need to check if $ n $ can be expressed in the form $ \\frac{k^{d+1} - 1}{k - 1} $ for some integers $ k \\geq 2 $ and $ d \\geq 2 $.\n\n3. **Binary Search**: For each possible depth $ d $ (from 2 up to a maximum of 60, considering computational limits), we perform a binary search on $ k $ to check if there exists a $ k $ such that the formula holds true for the given $ n $.\n\n4. **Efficient Calculation**: Using properties of geometric series and binary search, we efficiently check all possible values of $ k $ and $ d $ without explicitly generating all possible configurations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_d = 60\n    for d in range(2, max_d + 1):\n        # Compute min_val for k=2\n        try:\n            min_val = (2 ** (d + 1) - 1) // (2 - 1)\n        except:\n            min_val = float('inf')\n        if min_val > n:\n            break\n        # Binary search for k\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find upper bound for high\n        while True:\n            try:\n                val = (high ** (d + 1) - 1) // (high - 1)\n            except:\n                val = float('inf')\n            if val >= n:\n                break\n            high *= 2\n        # Now binary search between low and high\n        found = False\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            try:\n                numerator = pow(mid, d + 1) - 1\n                denominator = mid - 1\n                s = numerator // denominator\n            except:\n                s = float('inf')\n            if s == n:\n                found = True\n                break\n            elif s < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n        if found:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Check for Special Case**: If $ n $ is 1, immediately return \"NO\" since the smallest snowflake has more than one vertex.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Depths**: For each depth $ d $ from 2 to 60, compute the minimum value of $ n $ for $ k = 2 $. If this minimum exceeds the current $ n $, break early as higher depths will only produce larger values.\n4. **Binary Search for $ k $**: For each depth $ d $, use binary search to find if there exists a $ k $ such that the geometric series sum equals $ n $.\n5. **Efficient Calculation**: Using Python's arbitrary precision integers and efficient exponentiation, we handle large values of $ n $ up to $ 10^{18} $ effectively.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible configurations without unnecessary computations, leveraging mathematical properties and binary search for optimal performance.",
