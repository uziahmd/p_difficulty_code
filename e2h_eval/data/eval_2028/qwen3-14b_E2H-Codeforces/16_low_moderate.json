Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about finding the minimum number of steps to move from the home block to the university block, where each step involves moving across a common border of non-zero length between two blocks. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what defines a block here. The blocks are regions divided by the infinite roads. Each road is a line, and the arrangement of these lines divides the plane into regions. The key thing is that moving between two blocks requires that they share a common boundary segment (not just a point). \n\nBut how do I model the blocks and their adjacency? Since directly representing all possible regions is impossible (as there can be exponentially many regions with n lines), I need a smarter approach. \n\nWait, the problem is similar to a graph where each node represents a block, and edges exist between adjacent blocks. But how can I model this without knowing all the blocks?\n\nAnother thought: For any given point (like the home or university), the position relative to each road determines which block it's in. So maybe we can model the blocks based on the signs of the equations of the roads. Because each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The combination of signs for all roads would determine which region the point is in. However, since each road is a line, the sign of the equation a_i x + b_i y + c_i tells us which side of the line the point is on. \n\nSo, if two points are in the same block, they must have the same sign for all roads. But since the home and university are not on any road, their sign vectors (for each road) will be unique for their respective blocks. \n\nBut how do I find the minimal steps between the two blocks? Well, each step corresponds to crossing a road. So moving from one block to another requires that the two blocks differ in exactly one road's sign. Because if you cross a road, you flip the sign of that road's equation. But if two blocks differ in more than one road's sign, then they are not adjacent. \n\nWait, that's an important insight. Let me think again. If two regions are adjacent, their boundaries must be separated by exactly one line. Because if you cross a line, you change the sign of that line's equation. So, two regions are adjacent if their sign vectors differ in exactly one road. Because that's the only way they can share a common boundary. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: model each block as a node, where the node's state is the vector of signs for each road. Then, two nodes are connected if their sign vectors differ in exactly one position. Then, the problem becomes finding the minimal number of steps (edges) between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector. \n\nBut how do I represent the sign vectors? For each road, compute the sign of (a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i) for the home point and for the university point. Then, the home's sign vector is a binary vector (or a vector of +1/-1) for each road, and similarly for the university. \n\nThe problem then becomes: find the minimal number of positions where the two vectors differ, but with the constraint that each step can flip exactly one bit. Wait, no. Because each step corresponds to moving across a road. So each step changes exactly one sign. So the minimal steps between the two sign vectors is the Hamming distance between them. Because each differing bit represents a road that needs to be crossed once. But wait, that's not necessarily correct. Because flipping one bit (i.e., crossing a road) can change the sign vector from the home to another block. So the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance between the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector. Because each differing bit requires crossing that road once. \n\nWait, no. Suppose the home's sign vector and the university's sign vector differ in k positions. Then, the minimal steps would be k, because each step can flip one bit. But is that possible? Let me think. For example, if two sign vectors differ in two positions, can you get from one to the other in two steps? Yes, because each step flips one bit. So the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. \n\nBut wait, that seems too simple. Let me check the example. \n\nLooking at the first example input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). There are 2 roads: 0x +1y +0=0 (which is y=0) and 1x +0y +0=0 (x=0). \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFor first road (y=0): 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0 → sign is positive. \n\nFor second road (x=0): 1*1 +0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving across a common boundary between two adjacent blocks.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Blocks and Roads**: Each road divides the plane into two half-planes. The position of a point relative to each road (whether it lies on one side or the other) determines which block it is in. This can be represented as a sign vector for each point relative to all roads.\n2. **Sign Vectors**: For both the home and university points, compute their sign vectors relative to each road. Each element of the vector indicates whether the point lies on the positive or negative side of the corresponding road.\n3. **Hamming Distance**: The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is equivalent to the Hamming distance between their sign vectors. This is because each differing sign in the vectors indicates a road that needs to be crossed, and each crossing corresponds to one step.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    \n    # Read home coordinates\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read university coordinates\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    # Read number of roads\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n    \n    # Compute sign vector for home\n    home_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        home_signs.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n    \n    # Compute sign vector for university\n    uni_signs = []\n    for a, b, c in roads:\n        val = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        uni_signs.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n    \n    # Calculate Hamming distance\n    diff = 0\n    for h, u in zip(home_signs, uni_signs):\n        if h != u:\n            diff += 1\n    \n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the coordinates of the home and university, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Sign Vector Calculation**: For each road, the sign of the value obtained by substituting the home and university coordinates into the road equation is calculated. This gives a sign vector for each point.\n3. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The Hamming distance between the sign vectors of the home and university points is computed. This distance represents the minimum number of roads that need to be crossed to move from the home block to the university block, as each differing sign indicates a necessary crossing.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps using the properties of linear equations and Hamming distance, ensuring optimal performance even with the upper constraint limits.",
