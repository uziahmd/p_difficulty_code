Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, moving through adjacent blocks. The adjacency here is defined by sharing a common border of non-zero length. So, the problem is essentially about finding the shortest path between two regions divided by lines.\n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacencies. But how can I represent each block? Since there are infinite regions, it's impossible to list them all. However, the key insight here is that the movement between blocks is determined by crossing roads. Each road divides the plane into two halves. The blocks can be represented by their position relative to each road.\n\nWait, but how do I determine if two blocks are adjacent? For two blocks to be adjacent, they must share a common boundary, which means that there's at least one road that separates them. But maybe the adjacency is determined by being on opposite sides of a single road. Wait, no. Because if two regions are separated by a single road, then they are adjacent. So, moving from one to another requires crossing that road. So each time you cross a road, you move to an adjacent block.\n\nBut how to model this as a graph? The idea is that each block can be represented by a set of signs (for each road, whether the block is on the positive or negative side of the road). But since there are n roads, the number of possible sign combinations is 2^n, which for n=300 would be way too big. But n is up to 300, so 2^300 is impossible. Therefore, we can't model each block directly.\n\nSo that approach is not feasible. We need another way.\n\nAlternative idea: Since the movement between blocks is allowed if they share a common border, which implies that they are separated by exactly one road. So, when moving from one block to another, you cross exactly one road. Therefore, the problem can be modeled as a graph where nodes are the blocks, and edges exist between blocks that are separated by exactly one road.\n\nBut again, the problem is how to represent the blocks. However, since the start and end points are given, maybe we can model the problem in terms of the positions of these points relative to each road. Let me think.\n\nEach block can be uniquely identified by the sign of each road's equation evaluated at a point in the block. For example, for each road i, the value a_i x + b_i y + c_i can be positive or negative. So, for the home point (x1,y1), we can compute for each road whether it's on the positive or negative side. Similarly for the university point (x2,y2). Then, the question becomes: what is the minimal number of roads that we need to cross to get from the home's region to the university's region?\n\nWait, but how does crossing roads affect the sign configuration? Each time you cross a road, you flip the sign for that particular road. So, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped to transform the home's sign configuration into the university's sign configuration. However, this is only true if each step corresponds to crossing exactly one road. Because each step moves you across a road, flipping exactly one sign. But the minimal steps would be the minimal number of roads that differ between the two configurations, but perhaps not exactly. Because if two configurations differ in k roads, then maybe you can reach the target in k steps. But maybe some roads are not independent. For example, if two roads are parallel, then crossing one doesn't affect the other. But perhaps the minimal steps is the number of differing roads divided by something. Wait, but how?\n\nWait, let's think of the problem as a graph where each node represents a sign configuration. Two configurations are connected if they differ in exactly one road (i.e., you cross that road). Then, the minimal steps between the home and university's configurations is the minimal number of steps needed to go from one to the other, changing one bit (sign) at a time. But this would be the Hamming distance between the two configurations. However, this is only true if the configurations are connected via such steps. But in reality, each step is crossing a road, which flips exactly one sign. Therefore, the minimal steps would be the Hamming distance between the two configurations. Because each differing road must be crossed once. But wait, suppose that the home and university are in configurations that differ in k roads. Then, you need to cross each of those roads once, so the minimal steps would be k. However, this seems too straightforward. But why is that?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose there are two roads. Home is in the region where both roads are positive. University is in the region where both are negative. The Hamming distance is 2. So you need to cross both roads. But",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a starting block (home) to a destination block (university) in a plane divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving from one block to another through a common boundary.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem can be transformed into finding the shortest path between two regions defined by linear equations. Each region can be uniquely identified by the sign of the result when evaluating the coordinates of a point against each road's equation.\n2. **Key Insight**: The regions (blocks) are separated by roads, and moving from one block to another requires crossing a road. This crossing changes the sign of the corresponding road's equation for the point.\n3. **Graph Representation**: Represent each block by the sign configuration of its position relative to all roads. The minimal number of steps required is equivalent to the Hamming distance between the sign configurations of the home and university points, as each differing sign indicates a necessary road crossing.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    x1, y1 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    x2, y2 = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    roads = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n            idx += 1\n        a, b, c = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        roads.append((a, b, c))\n        idx += 1\n\n    # Compute sign configuration for home and university\n    def get_signs(x, y, roads):\n        signs = []\n        for a, b, c in roads:\n            val = a * x + b * y + c\n            signs.append(1 if val > 0 else -1)\n        return tuple(signs)\n\n    home_signs = get_signs(x1, y1, roads)\n    univ_signs = get_signs(x2, y2, roads)\n\n    # Count the number of differing signs\n    diff = sum(1 for a, b in zip(home_signs, univ_signs) if a != b)\n    print(diff)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the coordinates of the home, university, and the list of roads.\n2. **Sign Configuration Calculation**: For both the home and university points, we calculate their sign configuration relative to each road. This configuration is a tuple where each element is either 1 or -1, indicating whether the point lies on the positive or negative side of the respective road.\n3. **Hamming Distance Calculation**: The minimum number of steps required is determined by counting the number of differing signs between the home and university configurations. Each differing sign corresponds to a road that needs to be crossed to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their sign configurations, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
