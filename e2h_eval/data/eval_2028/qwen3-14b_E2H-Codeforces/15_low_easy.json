They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find all the winning integers x for a playoff tournament based on the given string s. The problem says that each phase of the tournament has certain rules: in phase i (starting from 1?), if s_i is 0, the lower skill level team wins; if it's 1, the higher one wins. And I have to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion.\n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament works. For example, when n=3, there are 8 teams. The tournament has 3 phases. Each phase reduces the number of teams by half. The first phase has 4 games, then 2, then 1.\n\nThe key here is to model the tournament structure and determine for each possible x, whether it's possible for x to be the winner given the rules of each phase.\n\nBut how do I model this? Since the permutation p is arbitrary except that it's a permutation of 1..2^n, but the tournament's outcome depends on the rules of each phase. So for a given x, can we arrange the permutation p such that x can win through each phase according to the rules?\n\nWait, but the permutation p defines the initial arrangement of the teams. So for x to be the winner, during each phase, depending on the phase's rule (s_i), x must be able to win its matches according to that rule.\n\nBut how do I model the path that x takes through the tournament? Because the structure of the tournament depends on the initial bracket. For example, in the first round, the teams are paired as (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), etc. Then the winners are paired again in the next round.\n\nBut the problem allows us to choose any permutation p. So perhaps, for x to be a winner, we need to arrange the permutation such that in each phase, x is in a position where it can win according to the rules of that phase.\n\nBut how to model the required conditions for x to be the winner?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's consider the tournament as a binary tree. Each match in a phase is a node, and the winner proceeds to the next phase.\n\nFor x to be the champion, it must win all the matches in each phase. Each phase's matches depend on the previous rounds.\n\nBut since the permutation is arbitrary, perhaps we can model for each possible x, the minimal and maximal possible values that x must have in order to be able to win each round.\n\nAlternatively, think about the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the way the teams are arranged can be manipulated to allow x to proceed.\n\nLet me think about the rounds. Let's say that the tournament has n rounds. For example, for n=3, there are 3 rounds. The first round (phase 1) has 2^{n-1} games, then phase 2 has 2^{n-2}, etc., until phase n which has 1 game.\n\nIn each phase i (starting from 1 to n), the rule is determined by s[i-1] (since the string is of length n). For each phase, during that phase's matches, the winner is determined by the rule (higher or lower skill).\n\nSo for x to be the champion, during each phase i, when x is in a match, it must win according to the rule of that phase.\n\nBut how to model the possible opponents that x would face in each phase?\n\nLet's think about the structure. In the first round (phase 1), x is in a group of two teams. To win that match, x must have a skill that meets the rule. For example, if phase 1 is '1', then x must have higher skill than the other team in the first round. But since we can arrange the permutation, perhaps we can choose the other team to be as small as possible (if the rule is '1') so that x can win.\n\nWait, but the permutation is fixed once chosen. So for x to be the champion, the permutation must be such that during each phase, x's path through the tournament allows it to win according to the rules.\n\nSo, perhaps for x to be a winner, we need to ensure that for each phase i, the set of possible opponents that x could face in that phase can be arranged such that x can win according to the phase's rule.\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think of the tournament as a series of rounds. For each round, the number of teams halves. For x to reach the next round, it must win the current round's match. The question is, for each round, what constraints does the rule impose on x's skill relative to the other teams in its path.\n\nLet me think about the rounds in reverse. For example, in the final round (the nth phase), there are two",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which integers can be the winning team in a playoff tournament given specific rules for each phase. The tournament structure is such that each phase reduces the number of teams by half until only one champion remains. The rules for each phase dictate whether the team with higher or lower skill level wins each match.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tournament Structure**: The tournament consists of `n` phases, where each phase reduces the number of teams by half. The number of teams starts at `2^n` and halves each phase until only one team remains.\n2. **Skill Level Rules**: Each phase has a rule (either '0' for lower skill level winning or '1' for higher skill level winning). These rules determine the winner of each match in that phase.\n3. **Winning Constraints**: For a team with skill level `x` to be the champion, it must be able to win all matches in each phase according to the rules. This involves ensuring that `x` can be positioned in such a way that it can win each match based on the given rules.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    size = 1 << n  # 2^n\n    \n    # For each x in 1..size, check if it can be the winner\n    result = []\n    for x in range(1, size + 1):\n        # We need to check if x can be the winner under the rules in s\n        # For each round i (starting from 0 to n-1), we track the required min and max\n        # For each phase, depending on the rule, we adjust the constraints\n        # For example, in phase i (0-based), the rule is s[i]\n        # For the first phase (i=0), the team must win against one other team\n        # To do that, if s[0] is '1', then x must be larger than the opponent, so the minimal possible opponents are those smaller than x\n        # But since we can choose the permutation, we need to find if x can be placed in the bracket such that in each round, it can win\n        \n        # Let's model the required min and max values that x must have in each round\n        # For each round, we track the minimum and maximum value that x must have to proceed\n        # Initially, for the first round, the constraints depend on the rule\n        \n        # For each round, we'll compute the required min and max\n        # The idea is inspired by the following:\n        # For each round i (starting from 0), the number of teams is 2^(n-i)\n        # In each round, x must be able to win its match, which depends on the rule\n        # We can think of it as building up constraints on x\n        \n        # We'll track the lower and upper bounds for x in each round\n        # For example, in the first round (i=0), if the rule is '1', x must be higher than the other team in its match.

Let me think differently.\n                # For each phase, the number of teams that x must have beaten in previous phases is i. So, in the current phase, x must be able to win against one opponent.\n                # However, the opponents in each phase depend on the structure of the tournament.\n                # Another approach is to track the minimal and maximal possible values x can have to proceed through each round.\n                \n                # For example, in the first round (phase 0), if the rule is '1', then x must be the maximum in its pair. Therefore, x must be >= the other team. But since we can choose the permutation, we can make x the maximum in that pair. Thus, the minimal x can be is 2 (since it needs to be higher than one other team).\n                # However, if the rule is '0', then x must be the minimum in its pair, so x can be as low as 1, but must be lower than the other team. So the maximal value x can be is 2^{n} - 1 (but that's not helpful here).\n                # Wait, perhaps we can model the constraints as follows:\n                # For each round i (starting from 0), the number of teams in the bracket that x is part of is 2^{i+1} (since each round doubles the number of teams in the bracket). For example, in round 0, the bracket is size 2^1 = 2 teams. In round 1, the bracket is size 2^2 = 4 teams, etc.\n                # If the rule for this round is '1', then x must be the maximum in its bracket. Therefore, the minimal value x can take is (number of teams in bracket) - 2^i + 1? Or something like that.\n                # Wait, for example, in round 0 (i=0), the bracket is 2 teams. For x to be the maximum, it must be at least 2 (since there is one other team). But if there are multiple rounds, we need to ensure that x is the maximum in each bracket.\n                # Alternatively, for each round i, the number of teams that x must be able to beat in that round is 1. But the opponents in that round depend on the previous rounds.\n                # Maybe we can model the constraints for x as follows:\n                # For each round i, the number of teams in the bracket that x is part of is 2^{i+1}.\n                # If the rule for this round is '1', then x must be the maximum in this bracket. Therefore, the minimal value x can be is (number of teams in bracket) - 2^i + 1 = 2^{i+1} - 2^i + 1 = 2^i + 1. Wait, that seems off.\n                # For example, for a bracket of size 2^1 = 2, the maximum value is 2. So x must be >= 2.\n                # For a bracket of size 2^2 = 4, the maximum value is 4. So x must be >= 4.\n                # Wait, but that would mean that for x to be the maximum in a bracket of size 2^{i+1}, it must be at least 2^{i+1}. However, this is not possible because x can be up to 2^n.\n                # That suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n                \n                # Let's think again. For x to be the maximum in its bracket of size 2^{i+1} during phase i, there must be 2^{i} teams in the bracket that x must be greater than. But since we can arrange the permutation, we can choose the other teams to be smaller than x. So the minimal x can be is (number of teams in the bracket) - 2^i + 1?\n                # Wait, no. For example, in a bracket of size 2 (i=0), x needs to be the maximum. So x must be at least 2 (since there's one other team). For a bracket of size 4 (i=1), x must be the maximum, so it needs to be at least 4 (since there are three other teams). But that would require x to be the maximum among 4 teams, so x could be 4, and the others are 1,2,3. So yes, the minimal x can be is 2^{i+1}.\n                # But if the rule is '0', then x must be the minimum in the bracket of size 2^{i+1}, so the maximal x can be is 2^{i+1} - 1 (since there are 2^i other teams that must be larger than x).\n                # So, for each phase i, depending on the rule, we can update the lower and upper bounds for x:\n                # If the rule is '1', then x must be at least (2^{i+1}) in order to be the maximum in its bracket.\n                # If the rule is '0', then x must be at most (2^{i+1} - 1) in order to be the minimum in its bracket.\n                # However, this seems to be cumulative across all phases. For example, for the first phase (i=0), if the rule is '1', then x must be >= 2^1 = 2. For the second phase (i=1), if the rule is '1', then x must be >= 2^2 = 4. And so on. But this would imply that x must be at least 2^n, which is the maximum possible value. Hence, this approach might not be correct.\n                \n                # Let's consider an example. Take the sample input: n=3, s='101'.\n                # The output is 4 5 6 7.\n                # Let's see for x=4.\n                # Phases: phase 0 (s[0] = '1'), phase 1 (s[1] = '0'), phase 2 (s[2] = '1').\n                # For phase 0: x must be the maximum in its bracket of size 2^1 = 2. So x >= 2.\n                # For phase 1: rule is '0', x must be the minimum in its bracket of size 2^2 = 4. So x <= 3. But x=4 is not <=3. Contradiction. Wait, but this contradicts the sample output. So clearly, my earlier reasoning is wrong.\n                \n                # So I need to rethink this approach.\n                \n                # Alternative approach: think recursively. For each round, the team x must be able to win its match. The opponents in each match depend on the previous rounds.\n                # Let's consider the rounds in reverse order. Starting from the final round and moving backward.\n                # For example, in the final round (phase n-1), there are two teams. x must win against the other team. Depending on the rule for that phase, x must be higher or lower than the other team.\n                # However, since we can choose the permutation, we can choose the other team to be anything that allows x to win. For example, if the rule is '1', we can choose the other team to be smaller than x. If the rule is '0', we can choose the other team to be larger than x.\n                # But for earlier rounds, the number of teams that x must beat increases. For example, in phase i, x must win against one opponent, but that opponent must have passed their own matches in previous phases.\n                \n                # So for x to be the winner, it must be possible to arrange the opponents in each round such that x can win according to the rules. The key is to find the minimal and maximal possible values x can have while satisfying the constraints of each round.\n                \n                # Let's think of it this way: for each round i (starting from 0 to n-1), the number of teams that x must have defeated in previous rounds is i. So in the i-th round, x is competing against someone who has also won i matches. The question is, what constraints does the rule for round i impose on x relative to that opponent?\n                \n                # For example, if the rule in round i is '1', then x must be stronger than its opponent in that round. But since we can choose the opponents, we can choose the opponent to be as weak as possible. However, the opponent must have passed through previous rounds with their own rules.\n                \n                # This seems complex. Another approach is to model the constraints on x as follows:\n                # For each round i, the number of teams in the bracket that x is part of is 2^{i+1}. For x to win this round, depending on the rule, it must be either the maximum or the minimum in this bracket.\n                # Therefore, the minimal value x can be is determined by the rules of all rounds.\n                \n                # For example, for each round i, if the rule is '1', x must be the maximum in its bracket of size 2^{i+1}. So x must be at least (2^{i+1} - 2^i + 1) = 2^i + 1? Not sure.\n                \n                # Let's think of it this way: in the first round (i=0), the bracket size is 2. To be the maximum, x must be at least 2. In the second round (i=1), the bracket size is 4. To be the maximum, x must be at least 4. In the third round (i=2), the bracket size is 8. To be the maximum, x must be at least 8. But this would mean that x has to be 8, which is the maximum possible value. But in the sample input, n=3 and the output includes 4,5,6,7. So this approach is incorrect.\n                \n                # Let me look at the sample input:\n                # Sample Input 1: n=3, s='101'\n                # Output: 4 5 6 7\n                # For x=4, let's see:\n                # Phase 0 (s[0] = '1'): higher skill wins. So x must be higher than its opponent in round 0. Let's say opponent is 1. So x=4 can win.\n                # Phase 1 (s[1] = '0'): lower skill wins. So in this phase, x must be lower than its opponent. But how? Because in this phase, x is the winner of the previous phase, so it's facing another team that also won their previous matches. So for x to lose in this phase (wait, no, the rule says that during this phase, the lower skill wins. So x must be the lower one to win. So x must be lower than its opponent in this phase. So the opponent must have higher skill than x. But how can x win this match? Because during this phase, the rule is that lower skill wins. So if x is lower, it wins. So the opponent must have higher skill than x.\n                # Then, in phase 2 (s[2] = '1'), higher skill wins. So x must be higher than its opponent in this phase.\n                # So for x=4 to be the winner:\n                # - In phase 0: x=4 beats someone with lower skill (say 1).\n                # - In phase 1: x=4 must be lower than its opponent (say 5), so it wins.\n                # - In phase 2: x=4 must be higher than its opponent (say 5), which is not possible. Wait, but in the sample input, x=4 is a valid winner. So there's a contradiction here.\n                \n                # This suggests that my understanding of the problem is incorrect. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n                \n                # The problem says that in the i-th phase (the phase with 2^{n-i} games), if s_i is 0, then in each match, the lower skill level wins; if it's 1, the higher skill level wins.\n                # For example, for n=3, the phases are:\n                # Phase 1: 2^{3-1} = 4 games (first round)\n                # Phase 2: 2^{3-2} = 2 games (second round)\n                # Phase 3: 2^{3-3} = 1 game (third round)\n                # So for the sample input '101', the rules are:\n                # Phase 1: '1' (higher wins)\n                # Phase 2: '0' (lower wins)\n                # Phase 3: '1' (higher wins)\n                \n                # So for x=4 to be the winner:\n                # - In phase 1: x=4 must be higher than its opponent (so opponent is 1, 2, or 3).\n                # - In phase 2: x=4 must be lower than its opponent (so opponent is 5, 6, or 7).\n                # - In phase 3: x=4 must be higher than its opponent (which is the winner of the other half of the bracket, which must be higher than x=4).\n                # Wait, but in phase 3, the opponent is the winner of the other half. How can x=4 be higher than that opponent if that opponent must have passed through phases 1 and 2 with their own rules?\n                \n                # This is getting complicated. Perhaps the correct approach is to simulate the process for each x, determining if it can be the champion by considering the constraints imposed by each phase.\n                \n                # Another idea: For x to be the champion, in each phase i, it must be possible for x to be the winner of its match in that phase.

If the rule is '0', we can choose the other team to be larger than x.\n                # But for earlier rounds, the number of teams that x must beat increases. For example, in phase i, x must win against one opponent, but that opponent must have passed their own matches in previous phases.\n                \n                # So for x to be the winner, it must be possible to arrange the opponents in each round such that x can win according to the rules.

However, the opponent must have passed through previous rounds with their own rules.\n                \n                # This seems complex. Another approach is to model the constraints on x as follows:\n                # For each round i, the number of teams in the bracket that x is part of is 2^{i+1}. For x to win this round, depending on the rule, it must be either the maximum or the minimum in this bracket.\n                # Therefore, the minimal value x can be is determined by the rules of all rounds.\n                \n                # For example, for each round i, if the rule is '1', x must be the maximum in its bracket of size 2^{i+1}. So x must be at least (2^{i+1} - 2^i + 1) = 2^i + 1? Not sure.\n                \n                # Let's think of it this way: in the first round (i=0), the bracket size is 2.
