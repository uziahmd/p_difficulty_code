They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team $$$1$$$ plays against team $$$2$$$, team $$$3$$$ plays against team $$$4$$$, and so on (so, $$$2^{n-1}$$$ games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only $$$2^{n-1}$$$ teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where $$$2^{n-2}$$$ games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game \"$$$1$$$ vs $$$2$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$3$$$ vs $$$4$$$\", then the winner of the game \"$$$5$$$ vs $$$6$$$\" plays against the winner of the game \"$$$7$$$ vs $$$8$$$\", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains. The skill level of the $$$i$$$-th team is $$$p_i$$$, where $$$p$$$ is a permutation of integers $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$, ..., $$$2^n$$$ (a permutation is an array where each element from $$$1$$$ to $$$2^n$$$ occurs exactly once).You are given a string $$$s$$$ which consists of $$$n$$$ characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:   if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 0, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;  if $$$s_i$$$ is equal to 1, then during the $$$i$$$-th phase (the phase with $$$2^{n-i}$$$ games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins. Let's say that an integer $$$x$$$ is winning if it is possible to find a permutation $$$p$$$ such that the team with skill $$$x$$$ wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 18$$$).The second line contains the string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.\n\n## Output\nPrint all the winning integers $$$x$$$ in ascending order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n101', '1\\n1', '2\\n01']\n\n### Output\n['4 5 6 7', '2', '2 3']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo the problem is about a playoff tournament with 2^n teams. Each team has a unique skill level from 1 to 2^n. The tournament is structured in phases. In each phase, teams are paired, and the winner of each match proceeds to the next phase. The results of each phase depend on the string s. For each phase i (starting from 1?), if s_i is 0, the lower skill level wins; if 1, higher skill wins. The task is to find all integers x that can be the winning team for some permutation p.\n\nHmm. The key here is to determine for each possible x (from 1 to 2^n) whether there exists a permutation p where x ends up as the champion.\n\nBut how do we model this? Since the permutation p determines the initial arrangement of teams, but the structure of the tournament depends on the string s. The problem is to find all x such that there exists a way to arrange the initial teams so that x can win through the tournament according to the rules given by s.\n\nWait, but the permutation p is the skill levels of the teams. So the initial positions of the teams are arranged in some order, and the tournament proceeds with matches determined by the string s. But the problem says that the permutation p is given, and the string s determines the outcome of each phase.\n\nBut the question is to find all x such that there exists a permutation p where x is the champion. So for each x, can we arrange the initial bracket in such a way that x can win all the rounds according to the rules of s?\n\nLet me think about how the tournament works. Let's take an example. Suppose n=3, which means 8 teams. The first phase has 4 games. Then 4 teams remain. Then 2 games, then 1 game.\n\nEach phase is determined by the corresponding character in s. For example, if s is \"101\", then:\n\nPhase 1 (i=1) is the first phase, which has 2^(3-1) = 4 games. Since s[0] is '1', during this phase, the higher skill level wins.\n\nPhase 2 (i=2) has 2^(3-2)=2 games. s[1] is '0', so lower skill level wins.\n\nPhase 3 (i=3) has 2^(3-3)=1 game. s[2] is '1', higher skill level wins.\n\nSo the tournament is structured in such a way that each round's matches are determined by the phase's rule.\n\nNow, the challenge is to find all x where x can be the champion for some permutation p.\n\nHow can we model the possible paths that x can take through the tournament?\n\nAn approach is to think recursively. For each round (phase), the way the teams progress depends on the rules of that phase. But since the initial arrangement of the teams is arbitrary, perhaps we can model the necessary conditions for x to reach the final.\n\nLet me think about the tournament structure. Each round halves the number of teams. The tournament can be viewed as a binary tree. For example, in the first round, each match is between two teams, and the winner proceeds. The structure of the tournament is fixed (the pairing is fixed in each phase), but the initial positions of the teams can be arranged in any order. However, the problem allows us to choose the permutation p, which determines the initial positions. So the initial arrangement is flexible.\n\nWait, but the initial pairing is fixed as per the problem description. For example, in the first phase, team 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, etc. But when you arrange the permutation p, you are assigning the skill levels to the initial positions. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the permutation p is the skill levels of the teams. So the initial arrangement of the teams in the bracket is determined by the permutation. Wait, no. The problem says that the teams are split into pairs: team 1 plays against team 2, etc. So the initial positions are fixed, but the permutation p gives the skill levels of the teams. So the initial positions are numbered 1 to 2^n, and each position has a team with skill p_i. So the permutation p is the assignment of skills to positions.\n\nBut the problem says that the permutation p can be chosen arbitrarily. So the question is, for a given x, can we assign the skills to the positions such that x is the champion?\n\nBut how to model this? Because the initial arrangement of the skills can be arranged in any way, but the tournament structure (pairings in each phase) is fixed. However, the way that the winners proceed depends on the rules of each phase.\n\nSo for x to be the champion, it must win all the rounds. Let's think about each round's",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which team skill levels can win a playoff tournament given specific rules for each round. The tournament structure and rules are defined by a string `s`, where each character indicates whether the higher or lower skill level team wins in each phase.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The tournament is structured in phases where each phase halves the number of teams. For `2^n` teams, there are `n` phases.\n2. **Determine Winning Conditions**: For each possible team skill level `x`, we need to check if it can be the champion under some permutation of team skills.\n3. **Recursive Check with Constraints**: For each round, based on the rule (higher or lower skill level wins), we determine the constraints that the team `x` must satisfy to progress through each phase. This involves checking if `x` can be the minimum or maximum in its respective subtree of the tournament bracket.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    size = 2 ** n\n    \n    def get_min_max(x, phase):\n        # phase starts from 0 to n-1\n        # returns (min_required, max_required) for x to survive this phase\n        current = x\n        for i in range(phase, -1, -1):\n            if s[i] == '0':\n                # in this phase, lower skill wins.

These constraints depend on whether the phase requires the team with the lower or higher skill level to win.\n3. **Validation**: For each phase, we calculate the required minimum or maximum value for `x` based on the group size and the rule for that phase. If `x` meets all these constraints, it is considered a valid winning team.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks each possible team skill level against the constraints derived from the tournament rules, ensuring correctness and optimal performance.",
