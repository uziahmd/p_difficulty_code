He picked some string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. You don't know this string. Ivan has informed you about all its improper prefixes and suffixes (i.e. prefixes and suffixes of lengths from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$), but he didn't tell you which strings are prefixes and which are suffixes.Ivan wants you to guess which of the given $$$2n-2$$$ strings are prefixes of the given string and which are suffixes. It may be impossible to guess the string Ivan picked (since multiple strings may give the same set of suffixes and prefixes), but Ivan will accept your answer if there is at least one string that is consistent with it. Let the game begin!\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains one integer number $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\le n \\le 100$$$) — the length of the guessed string $$$s$$$.The next $$$2n-2$$$ lines are contain prefixes and suffixes, one per line. Each of them is the string of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$ consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. They can be given in arbitrary order.It is guaranteed that there are exactly $$$2$$$ strings of each length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n-1$$$. It is also guaranteed that these strings are prefixes and suffixes of some existing string of length $$$n$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint one string of length $$$2n-2$$$ — the string consisting only of characters 'P' and 'S'. The number of characters 'P' should be equal to the number of characters 'S'. The $$$i$$$-th character of this string should be 'P' if the $$$i$$$-th of the input strings is the prefix and 'S' otherwise.If there are several possible answers, you can print any.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nba\\na\\nabab\\na\\naba\\nbaba\\nab\\naba', '3\\na\\naa\\naa\\na', '2\\na\\nc']\n\n### Output\n['SPPSPSPS', 'PPSS', 'PS']\n\n## Note\nThe only string which Ivan can guess in the first example is \"ababa\".The only string which Ivan can guess in the second example is \"aaa\". Answers \"SPSP\", \"SSPP\" and \"PSPS\" are also acceptable.In the third example Ivan can guess the string \"ac\" or the string \"ca\". The answer \"SP\" is also acceptable.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where given a list of prefixes and suffixes of an unknown string, I have to assign each of them as either a prefix (P) or suffix (S) such that there's at least one possible original string that fits. The output is a string of P's and S's in the same order as the input.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to figure out which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of the original string. But since the original string is unknown, how do I determine this?\n\nFirst, I remember that for any string s of length n, the prefixes are all the substrings from the start up to each position (like s[0..i] for i from 1 to n-1), and similarly suffixes are from each position to the end (s[i..n-1], for i from 1 to n-1). But Ivan has given me all these prefixes and suffixes, but mixed up. My job is to assign each of them as P or S.\n\nThe main idea is that the original string must be such that all the assigned prefixes and suffixes are indeed its prefixes and suffixes. Also, the original string must be of length n.\n\nSo, how can I find the original string? Well, the original string's full length is n. For example, the longest prefix (length n-1) is the original string without the last character. Similarly, the longest suffix (length n-1) is the original string without the first character. Wait, but there are two strings of each length from 1 to n-1. So for length n-1, there are two strings. One of them must be the prefix of length n-1, and the other must be the suffix of length n-1. But how do I know which is which?\n\nBut the original string's prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So if we can find two strings of length n-1, then one is the prefix and the other is the suffix. But how to find which one is which?\n\nWait, but the original string must be such that the prefix of length n-1 and the suffix of length n-1 must overlap. For example, if the original string is s, then the prefix of length n-1 is s[:-1], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1:]. So combining these two, the original string must be the prefix plus the last character of the suffix. Or maybe the suffix plus the first character of the prefix? Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nSuppose the original string is s. Then the prefix of length n-1 is s[0...n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1...n-1]. So the original string is s = prefix + [last character], but also s = [first character] + suffix. So the prefix and suffix of length n-1 must agree on their overlapping parts. For example, the prefix of length n-1 is s[0..n-2], and the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1]. So the prefix of length n-1's last character (s[n-2]) must equal the suffix of length n-1's first character (s[1]). Wait, no. The suffix of length n-1 starts at index 1. So the suffix of length n-1 is s[1], s[2], ..., s[n-1]. The prefix of length n-1 is s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-2]. So the overlapping part between the two is s[1] to s[n-2]. Therefore, the two strings of length n-1 must agree on that part. So if we take the two strings of length n-1, then the one that is the prefix must have its last character equal to the first character of the suffix. Because the original string's prefix of length n-1 is followed by the last character of the original string, and the suffix of length n-1 starts with the second character of the original string.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct way to find the original string is to consider that the original string is the combination of the prefix of length n-1 and the last character of the suffix of length n-1. Wait, because the suffix of length n-1 is s[1..n-1], so the original string's last character is the last character of the suffix. So if the prefix of length n-1 is P, and the suffix of length n-1 is S, then the original string is P + (last character of S). Also, since the original string's suffix of length n-1 is S, which is s[1..n-1], then the original string is (first character of S) + S. But since the original string is also P + (last character of S), that implies that the first character of S must be equal to the first character of P. Because P is the original string's first n-1 characters, so the first character of P is the first character of the original string. The first character of S is the second character of the original string. So unless the original string is of length 2, but that's not helpful here.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe another approach: for each candidate pair of length n-1 strings, check if they can be combined into a valid original string. For example, take the two strings of length n-1. Let's say one is A and the other is B. Then the original string could be A + (last character of B), and also B's first character must be equal to A's first character? Or wait, no. Let's think:\n\nOriginal string s. The prefix of length n-1 is A = s[0..n-2], the suffix of length n-1 is B = s[1..n-1]. Then, the original string s is A concatenated with s[n-1], which is the last character of B. Also, B is s[1..n-1], so the original string is s[0] + B. Therefore, the first character of B must be equal to the first character of A. Because s[0] is the first character of A, and the first character of B is s[1]. Wait, no. That's not necessarily true. Wait, A is s[0..n-2], and B is s[1..n-1]. So the first character of A is s[0], the first character of B is s[1]. These two are different. So how can we find the original string from A and B?\n\nWell, the original string is A concatenated with the last character of B. Let's call that candidate string C = A + (B[-1]). Also, the original string must be equal to B's first character (s[1]) plus B. But since s is C, then s[1] is the second character of C, which is the second character of A. So for the candidate C to be valid, the first character of B must be equal to the second character of A. Because B starts with s[1], which is the second character of A (since A is s[0..n-2]).\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose n=5. Then the prefix of length 4 is s[0..3], the suffix of length 4 is s[1..4]. So the original string is s = s[0..3] + s[4], and also s = s[0] + s[1..4]. So the candidate C would be A + B[-1], which is s[0..3] + s[4]. Which is correct. Now, B is s[1..4], so B's first character is s[1]. But A is s[0..3], so its second character is s[1]. So B's first character is equal to the second character of A. Therefore, for the candidate C to be valid, when you take the two strings of length n-1, the first character of B (the suffix) must equal the second character of A (the prefix). \n\nSo given two strings of length n-1, A and B, if the first character of B is equal to the second character of A, then C = A + B[-1] is a possible original string. Also, B must be a suffix of C, which it is by construction. Similarly, A must be a prefix of C. \n\nSo for the two strings of length n-1, we can check if they can form a valid original string. Once we find that, then we can proceed to assign the rest of the strings as prefixes or suffixes.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find all the strings of length n-1. There are exactly two of them.\n\n2. For each possible pair (A, B), check if they can form the original string. That is, check if the first character of B is equal to the second character of A. Then, the original string would be A + B[-1].\n\nOnce we have that original string, we can check for all the given strings whether they are prefixes or suffixes of this string. Then assign 'P' or 'S' accordingly.\n\nBut wait, there's another possibility. The pair could be (B, A), meaning that B is the prefix and A is the suffix. So we need to check both possibilities.\n\nSo for the two strings of length n-1, say X and Y, we need to check both possibilities:\n\nCase 1: X is prefix (length n-1), Y is suffix (length n-1). Check if Y[0] == X[1]. If so, then original string is X + Y[-1].\n\nCase 2: Y is prefix, X is suffix. Check if X[0] == Y[1]. If so, original string is Y + X[-1].\n\nOnce we find such a candidate original string, we can proceed to check all the input strings against it.\n\nBut what if there are multiple possibilities? For example, if both cases are possible, then there are multiple possible original strings. However, the problem allows any answer that is consistent with at least one possible original string.\n\nSo the approach would be:\n\n- For each possible candidate original string (based on the two length n-1 strings), check if all the input strings are either prefixes or suffixes of it. Then, once such a candidate is found, assign the labels accordingly.\n\nBut how to generate the candidate original strings?\n\nLet me think. For the given input, collect all the strings of length n-1. Let's call them candidates. Then, for each pair (A, B) where A and B are the two candidates, check if A can be the prefix and B the suffix. If that's possible, then generate the original string as A + B[-1]. Similarly, check if B can be the prefix and A the suffix, generating B + A[-1].\n\nOnce we have a possible original string, we can check for all the input strings whether they are prefixes or suffixes of this string. Then, assign P or S accordingly.\n\nBut how do I know which of the input strings are prefixes and which are suffixes?\n\nOnce I have the original string s, for each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with that string) or a suffix (s ends with that string). However, note that some input strings may be both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the sample input where s is \"ababa\", the string \"aba\" is both a prefix and a suffix. However, in the problem statement, each input string is either a prefix or a suffix (but not both?), but the problem says that Ivan has given all the improper prefixes and suffixes. So for example, the string \"a\" (for n=5) would be a prefix and a suffix. So in the input, there are two copies of \"a\" (since for each length from 1 to n-1, there are exactly two strings). So in that case, each of the two \"a\" strings could be assigned as P or S, as long as there exists a valid assignment.\n\nBut for the problem, once we have the original string, we can check for each input string whether it is a prefix or a suffix of s. However, since each input string is a prefix or suffix of s, but there are two entries for each length. So for example, for the original string s, for each length l (from 1 to n-1), there are exactly two strings in the input. Each of those must be either a prefix or a suffix of s.\n\nBut how do I assign which one is P and which is S? For example, suppose for a certain l, there are two strings that are both prefixes of s. But according to the problem statement, the input is guaranteed to be valid, so that for the original string, each of the input strings is either a prefix or a suffix. So for each input string, it must be a prefix or a suffix of the original string. So once we have the original string, for each input string, we can check if it is a prefix or a suffix. However, for some strings, they may be both. But since the input has exactly two strings for each length, and for each length l, there are exactly one prefix and one suffix (except when the prefix and suffix of length l are the same string, which can happen if the original string has some repetition).\n\nBut in that case, for example, if the original string is \"aaa\", then for l=1, the prefix is \"a\" and the suffix is \"a\". So the input will have two \"a\" strings. Then, for each of them, we can assign one as P and the other as S. But since they are the same, it doesn't matter.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nOnce we have a candidate original string s, we can process each input string. For each input string, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s.startswith(string)) or a suffix (s.endswith(string)). However, since each input string is either a prefix or a suffix, but not necessarily both, but the input is guaranteed to be correct, so for each input string, at least one of these must be true.\n\nOnce that is determined, we can assign P or S accordingly. However, there's a problem: if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, how do we choose which to assign? For example, the string \"a\" in the sample input. But the problem allows any assignment as long as there exists at least one possible original string. So in this case, the assignment can be arbitrary as long as each input string is marked as P or S, and for the original string s, the counts of P and S are correct.\n\nBut how to handle this in code? For each input string, if it is a prefix, mark it as P, else S. However, if it is both, we can choose either. But how to ensure that the total number of P's and S's are equal (since there are exactly n-1 prefixes and n-1 suffixes, total 2n-2 strings, so the output must have exactly n-1 P's and n-1 S's.)\n\nBut for the code, once we have the correct original string, the assignment for each input string is straightforward: for each input string, check if it's a prefix or suffix. However, if it's both, we need to decide which one to pick. However, the problem states that the answer can be any valid assignment. So for example, in such cases, we can choose either. However, during the code's processing, we need to make sure that the counts are correct. But since the input is guaranteed to be valid, and the original string is correct, the code can just assign P or S for each input string, and the counts will be correct.\n\nBut how to handle when a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, the string \"a\" in the sample input. Suppose the original string is \"aaa\". Then for l=1, the prefix and suffix are both \"a\". So the two input strings are \"a\" and \"a\". For each of them, we can assign one as P and the other as S. But how to do that in code. Well, perhaps for each input string, if it is a prefix, assign it as P. Otherwise, assign as S. But if it is both, then it can be assigned as P or S. However, the problem says that the answer can be any valid assignment, so even if we assign both as P, but that would lead to more P's than allowed. Wait, but the input has exactly two strings for each length. For each length l, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix. So for example, if for a certain l, the prefix and suffix are the same, then the two input strings are that same string. So in that case, one must be assigned as P and the other as S. So in code, when checking for each input string, we need to make sure that for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is marked as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that? For example, suppose for a certain l, both strings are the same. How can we assign one as P and the other as S?\n\nBut perhaps the code can process all the input strings, and for each, assign P if it is a prefix, else S. However, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, then we need to decide which to assign. But since the input is guaranteed to be valid, the code can choose either, but in practice, the code may have to track which ones have been assigned as P or S to avoid overcounting.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps the code can proceed as follows: once the original string is determined, for each input string, check if it is a prefix. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. However, this may not work in cases where a string is both a prefix and a suffix. For example, in the sample input where the original string is \"ababa\", the input includes \"a\" (which is both a prefix and a suffix). So in that case, the code would assign P for the first occurrence, and S for the second. But how to track which ones are which?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code can generate a list of all prefixes and suffixes of the original string. Then, for each input string, check if it is in the prefixes list or the suffixes list. Then, assign P if it is in the prefixes list, else S. But since the original string's prefixes and suffixes are known, this would work.\n\nWait, but the original string's prefixes and suffixes are all the input strings. So the input is exactly the set of all prefixes and suffixes of the original string. So for each input string, it's either a prefix or a suffix of the original string. So for the code, once the original string is determined, the code can generate all prefixes (for lengths 1..n-1) and all suffixes (for lengths 1..n-1). Then, for each input string, check if it's in the prefixes list. If so, assign P, else assign S. However, since the input has exactly two strings for each length, and the original string has exactly one prefix and one suffix for each length, then the code can count the number of P's and S's correctly.\n\nBut how to generate the prefixes and suffixes of the original string? For example, for the original string s of length n, generate all prefixes of length 1 to n-1, and all suffixes of length 1 to n-1. Then, for each input string, check if it's in the prefixes list (then assign P) or in the suffixes list (assign S). However, since the input is guaranteed to be correct, each input string must be in either the prefixes or the suffixes list.\n\nBut how to handle duplicates? For example, if a string is both a prefix and a suffix, then it will appear in both lists. But the input has two copies of that string. So for each input string, if it is in the prefixes list, then it can be assigned as P, and if it is in the suffixes list, then it can be assigned as S. But since the input has two copies, and the original string's prefixes and suffixes include that string once as prefix and once as suffix, then the code can assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that in code? Let's think. Suppose the original string is s. Generate all prefixes (for l in 1..n-1, s[:l]) and all suffixes (for l in 1..n-1, s[-l:]). Then, for each input string, check if it is in the prefixes. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. However, if a string is in both prefixes and suffixes, then the code would assign P. But for the two copies of that string, both would be assigned P. Which would be invalid, because for that length, there should be exactly one P and one S.\n\nWait, that's a problem. For example, in the original string \"aaa\" of length 3. The prefixes of length 1 and 2 are \"a\" and \"aa\". The suffixes of length 1 and 2 are \"a\" and \"aa\". So for the input, there are two \"a\" strings (for length 1) and two \"aa\" strings (for length 2). Now, if the code checks for each input string whether it is in the prefixes list. The \"a\" is in the prefixes list. So for both copies, the code would assign P. But this would result in two P's for length 1, but there should be one P and one S. Hence, the code would produce an invalid answer.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect. Therefore, the code needs to assign each input string as P or S, ensuring that for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings is assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nHmm. How to do this?\n\nAlternative approach: For the original string s, create two sets: the set of all prefixes (each of length 1..n-1) and the set of all suffixes (each of length 1..n-1). Then, for each input string, check if it is in the prefixes set. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. However, for the cases where the input string is in both sets (i.e., it is both a prefix and a suffix), then the code must assign one of them as P and the other as S. But how to track that?\n\nBut the problem is that for the same string appearing twice in the input, the code needs to assign one as P and one as S. However, the code can't know which one is which unless it tracks the occurrences.\n\nSo perhaps the code needs to generate for each input string, whether it is a prefix or suffix, but considering that for each length, there is exactly one prefix and one suffix.\n\nWait, but for the original string, the prefixes and suffixes are unique per length. For example, for each length l, there is exactly one prefix of length l (s[:l]) and exactly one suffix of length l (s[-l:]).\n\nSo, for each input string, if it's a prefix of length l, then it must be exactly the same as s[:l]. Similarly for suffix. Therefore, for each input string, if it's a prefix, then there's exactly one occurrence in the input for that length. But the input has two strings for each length. So for each length l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix, and the other is a suffix. Therefore, for each input string, we can check if it is the prefix of length l. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S. But how to determine which is the prefix and which is the suffix for each length?\n\nBut how can we do that? For example, for the original string s, the prefix of length l is s[:l], and the suffix of length l is s[-l:]. So, for each input string, if it matches s[:l] for some l, then it is a prefix. Otherwise, it is a suffix. But how to find l for each input string?\n\nBut for the code, once we have the original string s, we can generate all the prefixes and suffixes. Then, for each input string, check if it's in the prefixes. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S. However, for the case where the input string is both a prefix and a suffix (for different lengths?), but that's not possible. Wait, for example, the string \"a\" can be a prefix of length 1 and a suffix of length 1. But for the same length, it's both. But for different lengths, like a longer string.\n\nBut the problem is that for the same string, it can be a prefix of length l and a suffix of length m. But for the input, each string is of length from 1 to n-1. So for the code, when processing an input string, it can be a prefix of some length, or a suffix of some length. But how to determine which?\n\nBut the original string has exactly one prefix of each length. So for each input string, it must be exactly one of the prefixes or exactly one of the suffixes. Therefore, for the code, once we have the original string, we can create a dictionary that maps each prefix string to its length, and similarly for suffixes. Then, for each input string, check if it is in the prefixes. If yes, assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut how to create that dictionary? For example, for the original string s, generate all prefixes (for l in 1 to n-1) and store them in a dictionary where the key is the string and the value is the length. However, if there are duplicate prefixes (unlikely?), but since the input is guaranteed to be valid, for each length l, the prefix is unique. So for example, for the original string \"aaa\", the prefixes for l=1, 2, 3 (if n=4) are \"a\", \"aa\", \"aaa\". So each is unique.\n\nBut for the input strings, for each length l, there are two strings. One is the prefix of length l, and the other is the suffix of length l. Therefore, for each input string, it's either the prefix of some length l, or the suffix of some length l.\n\nTherefore, for the code, once the original string is determined, we can generate for each input string, whether it's a prefix or a suffix. For example:\n\nFor each input string, check if it is equal to s[:len(string)]. If yes, then it is a prefix. Else, check if it is equal to s[-len(string):]. If yes, then it is a suffix. Since the input is guaranteed to be valid, one of these checks must be true.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nOnce we have the original string s, for each input string in the input list, check if it is a prefix of s (i.e., s starts with the string). If yes, assign P. Else, assign S.\n\nBut in cases where the string is both a prefix and a suffix, how does this code handle it? For example, the string \"a\" in the original string \"aaa\" (n=3). The input has two \"a\" strings. For each of them, checking if it's a prefix: yes. So both would be assigned as P. But this would result in two P's for length 1, but there should be exactly one P and one S. Therefore, this approach is wrong.\n\nAh, here's the problem. The code can't just check if the input string is a prefix. Because for a string that is both a prefix and a suffix, the code will assign it as P, but there's another occurrence that also is a prefix and needs to be assigned as S. How can the code handle this?\n\nThe solution is to find for each input string, whether it is a prefix or a suffix of the original string, and for each length, ensure that exactly one of the two input strings is marked as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative approach: For the original string s, generate all the prefixes (for each length l, 1 to n-1). Create a set of these prefixes. Similarly, generate all suffixes (for each length l, 1 to n-1). Create a set of these suffixes. Now, for each input string, if it is in the prefixes set, then it must be a prefix. If it is in the suffixes set, then it must be a suffix. However, if a string is in both sets, then it is both a prefix and a suffix. But since the input has two copies of the string, one must be marked as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to differentiate between them in the input list? For example, if the input list contains two copies of a string that is both a prefix and a suffix, how to assign one as P and the other as S?\n\nBut the problem says that the answer can be any valid assignment. So, perhaps for each input string, if it is in the prefixes set, we can assign it as P only if we haven't already assigned a P for that length. Otherwise, assign S.\n\nBut how to track that? For example, for each length l, we can keep track of how many times we've assigned P. Since for each l, exactly one of the two strings is a prefix and the other is a suffix.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\nOnce the original string s is determined, create for each length l, the prefix and suffix strings. Then, for each input string, check if it is the prefix of its length. For example, for a given input string, its length is l. Check if it equals s[:l]. If yes, then assign P. Else, assign S. This way, for each input string of length l, exactly one of the two strings is the prefix (and thus assigned P), and the other is the suffix (assigned S). This would work.\n\nWait, but for a given input string of length l, it's possible that it is not the prefix of length l, but it is the suffix of length l. So for example, for the original string \"ababa\" (n=5), the prefix of length 2 is \"ab\", the suffix of length 2 is \"ba\". Suppose the input has two strings of length 2: \"ab\" and \"ba\". So for the first string (\"ab\"), which is the prefix of length 2, assign P. For the second string (\"ba\"), which is the suffix of length 2, assign S.\n\nBut for a string that is both a prefix and a suffix of the same length l, like in the case of \"aaa\" (n=3). The prefix of length 1 is \"a\", the suffix of length 1 is \"a\". So for the input strings of length 1, both are \"a\". So for each input string of length 1, check if it equals the prefix of length 1. It does. So both would be assigned P. Which is wrong.\n\nAh, that's the problem again. How to handle this case.\n\nBut for the original string s, the prefix of length l is s[:l], and the suffix of length l is s[-l:]. So for a string of length l that is both the prefix and the suffix, the two input strings for that length are the same. So in that case, for the two input strings, one must be assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nSo the code needs to ensure that for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings of length l is assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to do that when the two strings are identical?\n\nIn this case, for each input string of length l, the code can check whether it is the prefix of length l. Since it is, but there are two such strings. So the code needs to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to track that? For example, for a given length l, if the two input strings are the same, then one must be P and the other S. But how to know which one?\n\nThe answer is that the code can't know, but the problem allows any valid assignment. So, for example, for the two identical strings of length l, we can assign the first occurrence as P and the second as S. Or vice versa.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nPerhaps, for each length l, we can track how many times we have assigned P for that length. For example, for each l, we can have a counter. When processing an input string of length l, if it is the prefix of length l, and the counter for that l is 0, assign P and increment the counter. Otherwise, assign S. Similarly, if it is not the prefix, assign S.\n\nBut how to know if it is the prefix of length l? For example, for a string of length l, check if it is equal to s[:l]. If yes, then it is the prefix of length l. Since for the original string, there's exactly one prefix of length l. So for the two input strings of length l, exactly one of them will match s[:l], and the other will match s[-l:].\n\nWait, but in the case where the prefix of length l is the same as the suffix of length l. For example, for s = \"aaa\", l=1. The prefix of length 1 is \"a\", the suffix of length 1 is \"a\". So both input strings of length 1 are \"a\". So when checking for each input string of length l=1, it will match the prefix (s[:1] is \"a\"). So for both input strings, the code would think they are prefixes. But in reality, one must be a prefix and the other a suffix.\n\nBut how to distinguish between them? The code can't, unless there's a way to find out that the input string is both a prefix and a suffix of length l. In that case, for the two input strings, one must be assigned as P and the other as S.\n\nSo, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nFor each input string:\n\n- Determine its length l.\n\n- Check if it equals the prefix of length l (s[:l]).\n\n- If yes, then it is a prefix. However, if there are two such strings, then we need to assign one as P and the other as S.\n\nBut how to track that?\n\nAn alternative idea: for each length l, we know that there is exactly one prefix and one suffix. So for each input string of length l, if it is the prefix of length l, then we can assign it as P, and the other string of length l must be assigned as S. However, if the two input strings are the same, then we have to assign one as P and one as S.\n\nSo, during processing, for each length l, we can track whether we have already assigned the prefix. For example, create a dictionary called prefix_assigned, initialized to False for all l. Then, for each input string of length l:\n\n- Check if it is the prefix of length l.\n\n- If yes, and prefix_assigned[l] is False, assign P and set prefix_assigned[l] to True.\n\n- Else, assign S.\n\nThis way, for each length l, exactly one of the two input strings will be assigned as P (the one that matches the prefix), and the other will be assigned as S.\n\nThis seems promising.\n\nLet's test this logic with the example where s is \"aaa\" (n=3). The prefixes of lengths 1 and 2 are \"a\" and \"aa\". The suffixes of lengths 1 and 2 are \"a\" and \"aa\".\n\nThe input for n=3 would have two strings of length 1 (\"a\", \"a\") and two of length 2 (\"aa\", \"aa\").\n\nFor the first input string of length 1, check if it equals s[:1] (\"a\") → yes. Since prefix_assigned[1] is False, assign P and set prefix_assigned[1] to True.\n\nFor the second input string of length 1, check if it equals s[:1] → yes. But prefix_assigned[1] is now True, so assign S.\n\nFor the two strings of length 2: first one is checked against s[:2] (\"aa\") → yes. Assign P, set prefix_assigned[2] to True. Second one is checked against s[:2] → yes, but prefix_assigned[2] is True → assign S.\n\nSo the assignments would be P, S, P, S. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: the original string is \"ababa\" (n=5). For length 1, the prefix is \"a\", the suffix is \"a\". So two input strings of \"a\". The first is assigned as P, the second as S.\n\nFor length 2, the prefix is \"ab\", the suffix is \"ba\". So the two input strings would be \"ab\" and \"ba\". The first would be assigned P, the second S.\n\nThus, this approach seems to work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nOnce we have the original string s:\n\n- For each length l from 1 to n-1, store the prefix (s[:l]) and suffix (s[-l:]).\n\n- For each input string, process them in order. For each string, check if it equals the prefix of its length l. If yes, and we haven't assigned the prefix for that length yet, assign P and mark that we have assigned it. Else, assign S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the correct original string s.\n\nSo the code's main challenge is to find the correct s.\n\nHow to find s?\n\nAs discussed earlier, the code can look at the two strings of length n-1. Let's call them A and B.\n\nWe need to check if A can be the prefix of length n-1 and B the suffix of length n-1, or vice versa.\n\nFor example:\n\nIf A is the prefix of length n-1, then the original string s would be A + (last character of B). But since B is the suffix of length n-1, which is s[1..n-1], then the first character of B must be equal to the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which of the given strings are prefixes and which are suffixes of an unknown string `s` of length `n`. The solution involves identifying the original string `s` from the given improper prefixes and suffixes and then classifying each input string as either a prefix (P) or a suffix (S).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Identify the Original String**: \n   - The original string `s` can be determined by considering the two strings of length `n-1` from the input. These strings must be the prefix and suffix of length `n-1` of `s`.\n   - By checking possible combinations of these two strings, we can derive potential candidates for the original string `s`.\n\n2. **Classify Input Strings**:\n   - Once the original string `s` is identified, we generate all its proper prefixes and suffixes.\n   - For each input string, check if it matches a prefix or suffix of `s`. Ensure that for each length, exactly one of the two input strings is classified as a prefix and the other as a suffix.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    strings = input[1:]\n    \n    # Collect all strings by their lengths\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    len_to_strings = defaultdict(list)\n    for s in strings:\n        len_to_strings[len(s)].append(s)\n    \n    # Find the two strings of length n-1\n    candidates = len_to_strings[n-1]\n    if len(candidates) != 2:\n        pass  # Should not happen as per problem statement\n    \n    # Try both possibilities for the original string\n    possible_s = []\n    for i in range(2):\n        a = candidates[0]\n        b = candidates[1]\n        if i == 0:\n            # Case 1: a is prefix, b is suffix\n            if len(a) == n-1 and len(b) == n-1:\n                if b[0] == a[1]:\n                    possible_s_candidate = a + b[-1]\n                    possible_s.append(possible_s_candidate)\n        else:\n            # Case 2: b is prefix, a is suffix\n            if len(b) == n-1 and len(a) == n-1:\n                if a[0] == b[1]:\n                    possible_s_candidate = b + a[-1]\n                    possible_s.append(possible_s_candidate)\n    \n    # Now check which candidate is valid\n    valid_s = None\n    for s_candidate in possible_s:\n        # Generate all prefixes and suffixes of s_candidate\n        prefixes = set()\n        suffixes = set()\n        for l in range(1, n):\n            prefixes.add(s_candidate[:l])\n            suffixes.add(s_candidate[-l:])\n        # Check if all input strings are in prefixes or suffixes\n        valid = True\n        for s_str in strings:\n            if s_str not in prefixes and s_str not in suffixes:\n                valid = False\n                break\n        if valid:\n            valid_s = s_candidate\n            break\n    \n    # Now generate the answer based on valid_s\n    if valid_s is None:\n        # This should not happen according to problem statement\n        print(''.join(['P' if i % 2 == 0 else 'S' for i in range(2*n - 2)]))\n        return\n    \n    # Prepare the prefix and suffix for each length\n    prefix_for_length = {}\n    suffix_for_length = {}\n    for l in range(1, n):\n        prefix_for_length[l] = valid_s[:l]\n        suffix_for_length[l] = valid_s[-l:]\n    \n    # Process each input string\n    result = []\n    prefix_assigned = [False] * (n)  # since max length is n-1\n    for s_str in strings:\n        l = len(s_str)\n        if s_str == prefix_for_length[l]:\n            if not prefix_assigned[l]:\n                result.append('P')\n                prefix_assigned[l] = True\n            else:\n                result.append('S')\n        else:\n            result.append('S')\n    \n    print(''.join(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into lines.
