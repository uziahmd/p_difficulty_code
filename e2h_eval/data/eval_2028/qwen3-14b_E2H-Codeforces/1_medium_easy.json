    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, for the i-th ring. So for each ring, we calculate the perimeter of that rectangle, but subtracting the inner part? Or wait, no. Wait, the ring is the border of that rectangle. So the number of cells in the ring would be the perimeter of that rectangle minus the corners? Or wait, how do you calculate the number of cells in a border?\n\nLet me think. For a rectangle of width W and height H, the number of cells in its border (the perimeter) is 2*W + 2*(H-2). Because the top and bottom rows have W cells each, and the left and right columns have (H-2) each (since the top and bottom are already counted). Alternatively, it's 2*(W + H) - 4. Because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(W + H), but since each cell is a unit, maybe that's not directly applicable. Let me take an example. For a 3x3 rectangle, the border is 8 cells. Which is 2*(3 + 3) -4 = 8. Yes. So the formula for the number of cells in the border is 2*(w + h) - 4. Wait, for a rectangle of size w x h. So for each ring, which is the border of a rectangle of size (w') x (h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1), h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for the i-th ring. So for each i from 1 to k, we calculate the perimeter of that rectangle and sum them all.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but for example, when i=1, it's the original rectangle. So the first ring is the border of the original rectangle. Then the second ring is the border of a rectangle that's 4 less in each dimension (since 4*(i-1) where i=2 is 4*1=4). So for each ring, we have to compute the perimeter of that rectangle and add it to the total.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that each ring is the border of that inner rectangle. So for each ring i, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). But for that rectangle, the border is the ring. So the number of cells for each ring is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because that's the perimeter formula.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the first sample input: 3 3 1. The rectangle is 3x3. The perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 8. Which matches the sample output of 8. So that's correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 7 9 2. Let's see. For the first ring, the rectangle is 7x9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16-4=28. Then the second ring is for i=2, so the rectangle is 7 - 4*(2-1) = 7-4=3, and 9-4*(2-1)=5. So 3x5. The perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. So total is 28+12=40. Which matches the third sample output. So that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is to loop for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle for that ring, and sum them all.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute the perimeter for each ring?\n\nFor each i-th ring:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) - 4\n\nAdd that to the total.\n\nBut wait, what if current_w or current_h becomes less than 1? Well, the problem says that k is given such that it's up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). So for example, if min(w,h) is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can't be larger than that. So for each i from 1 to k, the current_w and current_h will be at least 3 - 4*(i-1). Wait for i=1, it's 3. For i=2, 3-4= -1? But that's impossible. But the problem says that k is chosen such that it's valid. So the input will ensure that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3? Or perhaps not. Wait, let's think about the constraints.\n\nThe problem says that k is between 1 and floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let's take min(w, h) as m. So for example, if m is 3, then floor( (3+1)/4 ) = 1. So k can be 1. For that case, i=1: current_w = w - 4*(0) = w, which is >=3, same for h. For i=2, it would be 3-4*(1) = -1. But since k is limited to 1, that case can't happen.\n\nSo the input ensures that for all i from 1 to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 3. Because for i= k, the current_w is w -4*(k-1), and since k is up to floor( (m +1)/4 ), then for m being min(w, h), let's say m is the minimum. Then, for i=k, 4*(k-1) <= m - 1. Because for example, if m=7, floor((7+1)/4) is 2. So k can be 2. Then 4*(2-1) =4. m -1 is 6. 4 <=6. So for the current_w and current_h, when i=k, the dimensions are w -4*(k-1) and h -4*(k-1). Since m is min(w, h), then m -4*(k-1) >= m -4*( (floor( (m+1)/4 )) -1 ). Let's see for m=7, floor( (7+1)/4 ) is 2. So (k-1) is 1. 4*1=4. m-4=3, which is okay. For m=3, floor( (3+1)/4 ) is 1, so k=1. So 4*(k-1) is 0, so m -0 is 3.\n\nSo the code can safely compute for each i from 1 to k, the current_w and current_h, and compute the perimeter for each.\n\nThus, the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize total = 0\n\nfor i in 1..k:\n\n   current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n   perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n   total += perimeter\n\nreturn total\n\nSo that's the plan.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input: 3 3 1. So i=1:\n\ncurrent_w=3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: 7 9 1. So perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4= 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird sample input: 7 9 2. First ring is 7x9: 28. Second ring is 3x5: 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5) -4 = 16. Which is 16.\n\nAnother example: if w=5, h=5, k=2. Then for i=1: 5x5 → 16. For i=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. So current_w=1, current_h=1. But then perimeter is 2*(1+1) -4 = 0. But that's not possible. However, according to the constraints, k is limited to floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). For min(w, h) =5, (5+1)/4 is 1.5 → floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the input would not have that case.\n\nSo the code can proceed safely.\n\nSo the Python code would read w, h, k. Then loop for each i from 1 to k, compute current_w and current_h, compute perimeter, add to total.\n\nNow, implement that.\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then compute the sum.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead input line as w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check for i starting from 1 to k. For example, in the third sample input, k=2. So i=1 and 2.\n\nYes.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nNow, test with sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → 8. Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 → 2*(7+9) -4 = 28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5) -4 → 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. Output is 2*(5+5) -4 = 16. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: w=7, h=7, k=2. Then for i=1: 7x7 → perimeter 2*(7+7)-4= 28-4=24? Wait 2*(7+7) is 28, minus 4 is 24? Wait 7x7: perimeter is 2*(7+7) -4? Let me calculate. For 7x7, the border is 7*4 -4 (since corners are counted twice). Wait 7*4 is 28, but subtract 4 because the four corners are counted twice. So 28-4=24. Which is the same as 2*(7+7) -4 = 28-4=24. So yes. Then for i=2, current_w=7-4=3, current_h=7-4=3. So perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4= 8. So total is 24+8=32. And since for k=2, the min(w, h) is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2, so floor is 2. So allowed. So the code would output 32.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nRead input as w, h, k. Split the input line into three integers.\n\nThen compute the sum as explained.\n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input line. For example, in Python:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nThat's the code.\n\nTesting with the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8.\n\nSample Input 2:7 9 1 → 2*(7+9) -4 = 28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3:7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5) -4 = 28 + 12 =40. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should handle all cases. Edge cases like when k is maximum allowed.\n\nAnother edge case: when k=0? But according to the problem statement, k is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: when w and h are 3, and k=1. Which is allowed. Output is 8.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells that will be gilded on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that it forms a border around an inner rectangle, starting from the edge of the plate and moving inward.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring is formed by the border of a rectangle. The first ring is the border of the original rectangle, the second ring is the border of a rectangle that is 4 units smaller in both width and height (since each ring reduces the dimensions by 4 units on each side), and so on.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of cells in the border (perimeter) of a rectangle of dimensions `current_w` by `current_h` can be calculated using the formula: `2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4`. This formula accounts for the four corners being counted twice in the perimeter calculation.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: We iterate through each ring from 1 to k, adjusting the dimensions of the rectangle for each subsequent ring and summing up the perimeters.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The dimensions of the plate (width `w`, height `h`) and the number of rings `k` are read from the input.\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to k, we calculate the adjusted width and height of the rectangle considering the inward shift due to previous rings.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each adjusted rectangle, compute its perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4`.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and applying the perimeter formula, ensuring correctness and optimal performance within the given constraints.",
