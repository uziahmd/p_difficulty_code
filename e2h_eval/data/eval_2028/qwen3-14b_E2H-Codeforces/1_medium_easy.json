    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says that the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. Each ring has a width of 1 cell. Oh right, the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom?), so for each ring, the next inner rectangle is 4 less in both width and height. Because for example, the first ring is the outermost layer. The next ring would be 2 cells in from the edge, which would require that the rectangle is reduced by 2*2 = 4 in both dimensions. So for each ring i, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), but wait, maybe that's the size of the inner rectangle. But the ring itself is the perimeter of that rectangle. Wait, no. Because the ring is the bordering cells of that inner rectangle. Wait, the way it's described is that the i-th ring consists of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4(i-1)) × (h - 4(i-1)). Wait, perhaps that's not the correct way to think. Let me think again.\n\nLet me take the first example. Input is 3 3 1. The output is 8. Well, a 3x3 grid. The first ring is the edge. The perimeter of a 3x3 grid is 3*4 -4 (since each side is 3 cells, but corners are counted twice). Wait, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4, because each corner is counted once. Wait, for a rectangle of width w and height h, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*(w + h) - 4. Because each side has w cells (top and bottom) and h cells (left and right), but subtracting the 4 corners which are counted twice. So for 3x3, that would be 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Which matches the first example. So that's the formula for each ring.\n\nBut for each ring i, the dimensions of the rectangle for which we calculate the perimeter is (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1))? Wait, no. Because for the first ring, the rectangle is the original size. For the second ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(2-1)) = w-4, h-4. But wait, the second ring is two cells away from the edge. So for example, if the original plate is 7x9, then the first ring is the perimeter of 7x9. The second ring would be the perimeter of (7 - 4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, and 9-4=5. So the perimeter of 3x5? Wait, but that would be 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12? But in the third example, input is 7 9 2, output is 40. Let's check that.\n\nWait, the third example input is 7 9 2. So the first ring is perimeter of 7x9: 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 32-4=28. Then the second ring is perimeter of (7-4*(2-1)) x (9-4*(2-1)) = 7-4=3, 9-4=5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. Total is 28 + 12 = 40, which matches the sample. So yes, that seems correct.\n\nSo the approach is to compute for each ring i from 1 to k, the perimeter of the rectangle with width w_i = w - 4*(i-1), height h_i = h -4*(i-1). Then sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, what if the rectangle becomes too small? Like, for example, when i increases, the w_i and h_i must be at least 1. But according to the input constraints, k is given such that it's allowed. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(n,m)+1)/4 ), which probably ensures that for each i up to k, the w_i and h_i are at least 1. So we don't have to worry about invalid cases.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- For each i from 1 to k:\n\n   - calculate current width: w_i = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n   - current height: h_i = h -4*(i-1)\n\n   - compute perimeter: 2*(w_i + h_i) -4\n\n   - add to total.\n\nSo the code would loop from 1 to k, compute each perimeter and sum them.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nFirst example: 3 3 1. i=1: w_i=3, h_i=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3)-4 = 8. Correct.\n\nSecond example: 7 9 1. perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16-4= 28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example: 7 9 2. 28 + 12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother example: Let's say w=5, h=5, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1: 5x5. perimeter is 2*(5+5)-4 = 16. \n\ni=2: w_i =5-4=1, h_i=5-4=1. perimeter is 2*(1+1) -4 = 0. So total is 16 +0=16? But wait, that's possible. But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. For example, min(w,h) is 5. So floor( (5 +1)/4 ) = floor(6/4)=1. So k can't be 2. So the input would not have such a case. So the code can safely proceed.\n\nSo the code needs to read w, h, k. Then for each i in 1..k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle with dimensions (w -4*(i-1)) and (h -4*(i-1)), sum all those.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nRead w, h, k from input.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but let me check for another example. Let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. Then the perimeter is 2*(5+5) -4 = 16. Which is correct. If k=1, output is 16.\n\nAnother example: Let's take w=7, h=7, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1: 7x7. perimeter is 2*(7+7) -4 = 24.\n\ni=2: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3)-4= 8. Total 24+8=32.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work. Now, implement this in Python.\n\nThe input is three integers on one line. So read the input line, split into w, h, k.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a list of inputs, but in the problem statement, the input is a single line. For example, the sample input is given as ['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2'] but that's probably for multiple test cases. But in the actual problem, the input is a single line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput: The only line contains three integers w, h, k.\n\nSo for the code, we need to read a single line, split into three integers.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into parts, convert to integers.\n\nThen compute the sum as explained.\n\nSo the code:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h -4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, but what if current_w or current_h is less than 1? According to the problem statement, the input k is such that it's allowed. So the constraints on k ensure that for each i up to k, the current_w and current_h are at least 1. So no need to check.\n\nTesting the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1 → output 8. Which works.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16-4=28. Correct.\n\nSample Input 3: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5)-4 = 28 + 12 = 40. Correct.\n\nYes. So this code should work.\n",
