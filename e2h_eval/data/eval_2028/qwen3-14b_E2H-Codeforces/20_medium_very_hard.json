For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to find the number of ways to assign c_s values for all binary strings s of lengths 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to compute this count modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the description, for every binary string s (of length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. The maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f. So, our goal is to count the number of c assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. For each possible assignment of c_s, there's a maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset. We need to count those assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum? It seems like this is related to some kind of constraints on the c_s values. Maybe it's similar to a trie structure, where each node represents a binary string, and the constraints are that the number of times a node is used as a prefix is limited by its c_s.\n\nWait, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset would be determined by the constraints on the prefixes. For example, if you imagine building the multiset, each string added contributes to the counts of all its prefixes. So, the problem resembles a flow problem where each node (binary string) has a capacity, and the total number of elements in the multiset is constrained by these capacities.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this with inclusion-exclusion or dynamic programming. Alternatively, maybe the maximum size is determined by the minimum of certain values across the tree of prefixes.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For a given set of c_s values, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is equal to the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}), but I'm not sure. Or maybe it's something else.\n\nAlternatively, think of each binary string of length n as a leaf in a trie. Each node in the trie corresponds to a binary string. The constraints are that for each node s, the number of leaves in the subtree rooted at s (i.e., the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix) is at most c_s.\n\nBut since the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n, each such string is a leaf. So the problem becomes: assign capacities to all nodes (each c_s) such that the maximum number of leaves that can be chosen without violating any node's capacity is exactly f.\n\nThis sounds like a problem where the maximum possible number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s multiplied by the number of leaves in their subtree). Wait, no. Let me think again. For a node s, the number of leaves in its subtree is 2^{n - len(s)}. Because each node of length m can have 2^{n - m} leaves in its subtree. For example, the root (empty string?) isn't considered here, but the root here would be the strings of length 1, etc. Wait, the nodes are all binary strings of length from 1 to n. So the root could be considered as the empty string, but perhaps that's complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Suppose we have a node s of length m. The number of leaves in its subtree is 2^{n - m} (since each of the remaining positions can be 0 or 1). Now, the constraint is that the number of leaves in the subtree of s must be <= c_s. However, the leaves in the subtree of s are also part of the subtrees of their parent nodes.\n\nSo, to maximize the number of leaves selected, we need to choose as many as possible, but respecting all constraints. The maximum possible number of leaves is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}), but that doesn't seem right. Wait, no. Because for example, if a node s has a capacity of c_s, then the number of leaves in its subtree can't exceed c_s. However, the leaves in the subtree of s are also counted in the capacities of their ancestors. So the maximum number of leaves is determined by the constraints that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is at most c_s. But how do we compute this maximum?\n\nThis feels similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements that can be placed in a tree where each node has a capacity, and each element contributes to all capacities of its ancestors. The maximum is the minimal value of (capacity of node s) multiplied by the number of leaves in its subtree divided by the number of leaves in the subtree of its parent, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a tree where each node's capacity must be at least the number of leaves in its subtree divided by the number of leaves in the subtree of its parent. Wait, perhaps not. Maybe the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimum value of (c_s) multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree of s, but adjusted for overlapping constraints.\n\nWait, here's an approach. Let's consider that each leaf (string of length n) contributes 1 to all its prefixes. So the total number of leaves in the multiset is the sum over all leaves of 1, which is the size of the multiset. However, the constraints are that for each node s (prefix), the number of leaves in the multiset that have s as a prefix is at most c_s.\n\nThe maximum possible size of the multiset is the maximum number of leaves that can be selected such that for every node s, the number of selected leaves that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. How can we compute this maximum?\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum x such that for every node s, the number of leaves in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. To maximize x, we need to select x leaves such that for every node s, the number of leaves selected in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the maximum x where for each node s, the number of leaves in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s. However, since the leaves are in the subtree of their prefixes, the constraints are interdependent.\n\nBut how to find the maximum x? This seems like a problem that can be solved using the concept of the minimum of c_s multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree of s, divided by the number of leaves in the subtree of the root. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think of an example.\n\nTake the first sample input where n=1, k=42, f=2. The possible c_0 and c_1 must be chosen such that the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is exactly 2. For n=1, the strings are of length 1. The multiset is just the collection of 0s and 1s. The constraints are that for each string of length 1 (i.e., \"0\" and \"1\"), the number of times they appear in the multiset is ≤ c_0 and c_1 respectively. So the maximum possible size is min(c_0, c_1). So for the maximum to be exactly 2, we need min(c_0, c_1) = 2. Since c_0 and c_1 are between 0 and k (which is 42 here). The number of such pairs is the number of (c_0, c_1) where min(c_0, c_1) = 2. Which would be (number of pairs where c_0 ≥2, c_1 ≥2, and at least one of them is exactly 2). Wait, no. Wait, the maximum size is min(c_0, c_1). For this to be exactly 2, we need that min(c_0, c_1) = 2. So the possible cases are:\n\n- c_0 = 2 and c_1 ≥ 2\n\n- c_1 = 2 and c_0 ≥ 2\n\nBut subtracting the overlap where both are 2. So total is ( (k - 2 + 1) + (k - 2 + 1) ) - 1 = 2*(k-1) - 1 = 2k-1. Wait for k=42, that would be 2*42 -1 = 83. But the sample says the answer is 3. Wait, that contradicts. Oh wait, the sample input was n=1, k=42, f=2. But according to the note, the answer is 3. So clearly my reasoning is wrong here.\n\nWait the note says that for the first example, the three ways are when c_0=0 and c_1=2, c_0=1 and c_1=1, and c_0=2 and c_1=0. Wait, but according to that, the min(c_0, c_1) is 0, 1, 0, respectively. But the sample says that the maximum beautiful multiset is exactly 2. So my previous understanding is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this indicates that my initial approach is wrong. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nIn the first example, n=1. The multiset is of length exactly 1. So the multiset can contain any number of 0s and 1s, but for each string s (which is of length 1), the number of times it appears in the multiset must be ≤ c_s. So the maximum possible size is the sum of the counts of 0 and 1, but each count can't exceed their respective c_s. Therefore, the maximum possible size is c_0 + c_1. Because you can take all possible 0s and 1s up to their limits.\n\nWait that makes sense. For example, in the first sample, the maximum size is c_0 + c_1. But according to the note, when c_0=0 and c_1=2, the maximum is 2 (the multiset {1,1}), which is indeed 0 + 2 = 2. Similarly, when c_0=1 and c_1=1, the maximum is 1+1=2. When c_0=2 and c_1=0, maximum is 2+0=2. So the maximum is c_0 + c_1. Therefore, the condition for the maximum being exactly f is that c_0 + c_1 = f. But in the first sample, the answer is 3. Let's see: for n=1, the number of binary strings s of length 1 is 2 (0 and 1). So the possible c_0 and c_1 can be chosen from 0 to k (42). The number of pairs (c_0, c_1) where c_0 + c_1 = f. For f=2, that would be (0,2), (1,1), (2,0). So three possibilities, which matches the sample. So my previous reasoning was completely wrong. So the maximum possible size of the multiset is the sum of the capacities of all the leaves (strings of length n)? No, that can't be. Because for n=2, the sum of capacities of the leaves (strings of length 2) would be the maximum size? That doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no. Let's think again. The maximum size of the multiset is the largest possible number of strings of length n that can be selected such that for every prefix s (of any length up to n), the number of selected strings that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nSo for example, when n=2, the multiset is made of strings of length 2. Each such string contributes to the count of all its prefixes. For example, the string \"01\" contributes to the count of \"0\", \"01\".\n\nThe problem is to choose c_s for all prefixes (strings of length 1 to n) so that the maximum number of strings that can be selected (without violating any c_s constraints) is exactly f.\n\nSo how to compute this maximum number of strings given the c_s values?\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the maximum number of strings that can be placed in the multiset under the constraints. This is equivalent to finding the maximum x such that there exists a way to select x strings of length n, where for every prefix s, the number of selected strings with s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to compute x given the c_s's?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a trie structure. Each node in the trie represents a prefix. For a node s of length m, the number of selected strings that have s as a prefix is equal to the number of selected strings in the subtree rooted at s. The constraints are that for each node s, this number must be ≤ c_s.\n\nNow, the maximum x is the maximum number of leaves that can be selected such that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis problem is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves that can be selected under the constraints that each node's subtree has at most c_s leaves.\n\nThis is a classic problem in combinatorics and tree structures. Let me think of the following approach: For each node, the number of leaves in its subtree must be ≤ c_s. However, the leaves in the subtree of a node are also leaves in the subtrees of its children. So the constraints are hierarchical.\n\nTo maximize x, we need to ensure that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is as large as possible, but not exceeding c_s. However, the constraints for the children may limit the possibilities.\n\nAn approach here is to realize that the maximum x is determined by the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}). Wait, no. For example, take the case where all c_s are very large. Then x can be 2^n, which is the total number of possible strings. But for a node s of length m, the number of leaves in its subtree is 2^{n - m}. So if c_s is at least 2^{n - m}, then it's allowed. But if for some node s, c_s is less than 2^{n - m}, then the maximum x is limited by that node. However, this seems to suggest that the maximum x is the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) for all nodes s. But wait, why?\n\nBecause for each node s, the number of leaves in its subtree can't exceed c_s. The maximum possible number of leaves in the subtree of s is c_s. But the leaves in the subtree of s are exactly 2^{n - len(s)}. So if c_s >= 2^{n - len(s)}, then the entire subtree can be taken. If c_s < 2^{n - len(s)}, then only c_s leaves can be taken from that subtree. However, this depends on the constraints of the parent nodes.\n\nWait, but this seems like a contradiction. For example, if a node s has a capacity c_s that is smaller than the number of leaves in its subtree (say, 2^{n - len(s)}), then the maximum number of leaves that can be taken in the subtree of s is c_s. But this would imply that the maximum x is the minimum of all c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}? No, because that would be the case if each node's capacity is independent. But in reality, the capacities are hierarchical. For example, if a parent node has a capacity that allows more leaves than its children, but the children's capacities are lower, then the parent's capacity is not the limiting factor.\n\nSo perhaps the correct formula for x is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}), but that seems unlikely. Let's take an example.\n\nSuppose n=2, and consider the node \"0\" (length 1). Its subtree includes all strings starting with 0, which are \"00\" and \"01\". The number of leaves in its subtree is 2. Suppose c_0 is 1. Then, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of \"0\" is 1. However, the same applies to the children of \"0\": for example, the node \"00\" (length 2) has a subtree of size 1 (only itself). If c_{00} is 1, then that's okay. But if the capacity for \"00\" is 0, then the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of \"0\" would be 0, even though the capacity of \"0\" is 1. So the maximum x is determined by the minimum of the capacities along the path from the root to the leaves.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum x is determined by the minimum of c_s multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree of s, but adjusted for overlapping constraints.\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For each node, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is the minimum between its capacity and the sum of the maximum leaves from its children.\n\nWait, this seems promising. Let me think again. Let's say we have a node s of length m. The number of leaves in its subtree is 2^{n - m}. However, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in this subtree is constrained by two factors: the capacity c_s, and the capacities of the children. For example, the node s has two children, left and right. The maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves that can be selected in the left and right subtrees.\n\nBut how do we compute this? It seems like a dynamic programming approach where for each node, we compute the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree, given the capacities of all nodes.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. However, considering the problem from another angle: the maximum x is determined by the minimum value of c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)} over all nodes s. Wait, let's take the earlier example where n=2. Suppose for node \"0\" (length 1), c_s is 1, and for node \"00\" (length 2), c_s is 0. Then according to the previous idea, the value for node \"0\" is 1 * 2^(2-1) = 2, and for node \"00\" it's 0 * 2^(2-2) = 0. The minimum of these is 0, which would imply that x is 0. Which is correct, because the subtree of \"0\" can't have any leaves selected, since \"00\" has capacity 0. So this seems to hold.\n\nAnother example: n=2. Suppose all capacities are large enough. Then for each node, c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} is large. The minimum is 2^2 = 4, which is the total number of possible leaves. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2, node \"0\" has c_s = 1, and node \"00\" has c_s = 1. Then for node \"0\", the value is 1 * 2^(2-1) = 2. For node \"00\", it's 1 * 2^0 = 1. The minimum is 1. But the actual maximum x would be 1, since the subtree of \"0\" can have at most 1 leaf (due to node \"00\" and node \"01\" possibly having capacities allowing that). Wait, but if node \"0\" has capacity 1, and the subtree of \"0\" has two leaves (00 and 01), then the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of \"0\" is 1. But the capacities of the children may allow more. For example, if the capacities for \"00\" and \"01\" are both 1. Then the maximum leaves in the subtree of \"0\" is 1 (since the parent's capacity is 1). But if the capacities of the children are higher, then the parent's capacity would be the limiting factor. So the formula of taking the minimum over all nodes of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} seems to work here.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum x is the minimum of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} over all nodes s. This seems to fit the examples. Let me check the first sample again.\n\nIn the first sample, n=1. The nodes are of length 1. For each node s (0 and 1), the value is c_s * 2^{1 - 1} = c_s * 1 = c_s. The minimum of these is min(c_0, c_1). But earlier analysis showed that the maximum x is c_0 + c_1, which contradicts this. Wait, that's a problem. What's going on here?\n\nWait, the first sample's maximum x is c_0 + c_1. According to this formula, the minimum of c_0 and c_1. Which is different. So clearly, my assumption is wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me reevaluate. What's the correct formula for x given the c_s values?\n\nFor n=1, the maximum x is the sum of the capacities of the leaves (since each leaf is a string of length 1, and their capacities are the maximum number of times they can appear in the multiset). So x = c_0 + c_1. But according to the previous formula, the minimum of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} for all nodes s. For each node s of length 1, 2^{n - len(s)} is 2^0 = 1. So the formula would give min(c_0, c_1). Which is not equal to c_0 + c_1. So clearly, my previous reasoning was incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the formula is not correct. Therefore, I need to rethink this.\n\nAlternative approach: Think of the problem as a flow network. Each node in the trie represents a prefix. The constraints are that the number of leaves in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s. The maximum number of leaves x is the maximum possible such that all constraints are satisfied.\n\nBut how to model this? For example, the root (if we consider all strings of length 1 to n) is not a single node. Wait, perhaps the trie is built for all prefixes of the strings of length n. Each node corresponds to a binary string s of length m (from 1 to n). Each node has two children, except for those of length n.\n\nThe constraints are that for each node s, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s. The leaves are the nodes of length n.\n\nTo find the maximum x, we need to select x leaves such that for every node s, the count of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis seems like a problem of finding the maximum x such that there exists a way to distribute the leaves among the subtrees, respecting the capacities.\n\nThis feels similar to a problem where each node can have a certain capacity, and the capacity of a node is the sum of the capacities of its children. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: For each node s, the number of leaves in its subtree is equal to the sum of the leaves in its children's subtrees. But the capacity of s must be at least the number of leaves in its subtree. So, for the maximum x, we need to choose the capacities such that for every node s, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s. The maximum x is the maximum possible number of leaves that can be selected under these constraints.\n\nBut how to find x given the c_s's? It seems like a problem of determining the minimal capacities along certain paths.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For any string of length n, its path from the root (the empty string) to itself passes through all its prefixes. For example, the string \"01\" has prefixes \"\", \"0\", \"01\". But in our problem, the root is not considered (the prefixes are from length 1 to n). So for each string, the path goes through the prefixes of length 1, 2, ..., up to n.\n\nNow, the number of leaves in the subtree of a node s is equal to the number of leaves that have s as a prefix. For the maximum x, we need that for each node s, this count is ≤ c_s. So for each string in the multiset, it contributes 1 to all its prefixes. Therefore, the problem is to select x strings (leaves) such that for every node s, the number of selected strings that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nThis is equivalent to choosing x leaves, and ensuring that for every node s, the count of selected leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s. The maximum x for given c_s is the maximum number of leaves that can be selected while satisfying all these constraints.\n\nNow, the question is: How to compute x given the c_s's?\n\nLet me think of it as a constraint satisfaction problem. For example, the count for each node s is the sum of the counts of its children. But since the leaves are at the bottom, the constraints propagate upwards.\n\nBut how to model this? Perhaps, for each node, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is the minimum between its capacity c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves that can be selected in its children's subtrees. However, this seems recursive.\n\nLet me think recursively. For a node s of length m:\n\nIf m == n, then the subtree of s contains exactly one leaf (the string itself). So the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1 if c_s >= 1, else 0.\n\nFor a node s of length m < n, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves in the subtrees of its children.\n\nBut this seems to be a way to compute x. For example, for the root node (but in our case, the root is the strings of length 1?), wait no. For example, for n=2, the root would be the strings of length 1. Each of them has two children (strings of length 2).\n\nSo, for each node s of length m < n, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves in the subtrees of its children.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum x is computed as follows:\n\nDefine for each node s, the value f(s) as the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree, given the constraints. Then:\n\n- If s is a leaf (m = n), then f(s) = 1 if c_s >= 1, else 0.\n\n- Else, f(s) = min(c_s, f(left_child) + f(right_child)).\n\nThen, the maximum x is f(root), where the root is the empty string? No, the root would be the nodes of length 1. Wait, no. The root here is not defined. For example, the maximum x is the sum of the maximum leaves in the subtrees of all the nodes of length 1? Or is it the maximum leaves in the subtree of the root (which is not present)?\n\nWait, no. The entire set of leaves is the union of the subtrees of all the nodes of length 1. But since each leaf belongs to exactly one subtree of a node of length 1. However, the constraints for the nodes of length 1 are that their subtree's count (which is the number of leaves in their subtree) must be ≤ c_s. But the maximum x is the sum of the leaves in all subtrees of nodes of length 1, but ensuring that no node's constraints are violated. However, this seems conflicting. For example, the sum would be the total number of leaves, but the constraints for the nodes of length 1 may limit this sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum x is the value of f(root), where the root is the empty string. But in our problem, the root is not considered as a node. However, if we imagine the empty string as a root, then for each node of length 1, it is a child of the empty string. Then, the maximum x would be f(empty_string) = min(c_empty_string, sum of f(children)). But in our problem, the empty string is not part of the nodes considered. So this approach may not be applicable.\n\nBut this suggests that the maximum x is determined by the constraints of the nodes in a hierarchical way. For example, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the entire tree is determined by the minimum between the capacities of the nodes along the paths.\n\nBut how to compute this? It seems like we need to perform a dynamic programming approach on the trie structure, computing for each node the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree, given the capacities.\n\nBut given that n can be up to 15, the number of nodes is O(2^n) which is acceptable (since 2^15 is 32768, manageable).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor a given assignment of c_s values, compute the maximum x as follows:\n\n- For each node s (binary string of length 1 to n), compute f(s) as the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of s. For leaves (length n), f(s) is 1 if c_s >= 1, else 0. For non-leaf nodes, f(s) = min(c_s, f(left_child) + f(right_child)).\n\nThen, the maximum x is the sum of f(s) for all nodes of length 1? No. Wait, no. Because the entire multiset is a collection of leaves. The sum of all leaves is the total number of leaves selected. However, the root (if we imagine it) would have two children (the nodes of length 1). The maximum x is f(root) where root is the empty string. But since the empty string is not part of the nodes considered, perhaps the maximum x is the sum of f(s) for all nodes of length 1, but that seems incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum x is the sum of the leaves selected in the subtrees of all nodes of length 1, but ensuring that the constraints are satisfied. However, this sum would be the total number of leaves selected, which is x. But how to compute x?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, if we imagine that the entire tree is rooted at the empty string, then the maximum x is f(empty_string), which is the minimum between c_empty_string and the sum of f(left_child) + f(right_child). However, since the empty string is not part of the nodes considered in the problem (as the constraints are only for strings of length 1 to n), this approach may not be applicable. Unless we include the empty string as a node with c_s being something.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the constraints are for all binary strings of length from 1 to n. So the empty string is not considered. Thus, the maximum x is the sum of the leaves in the subtrees of all nodes of length 1, but ensuring that for each node s (including those of length 1), the number of leaves in their subtree is <= c_s.\n\nBut this seems to be a problem of overlapping constraints. For example, the leaves in the subtree of a node of length 1 are also part of the subtrees of its children (nodes of length 2), etc. So the constraints are hierarchical.\n\nBut the dynamic programming approach I mentioned earlier (computing f(s) for each node) gives for each node s the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree. For example, for a node of length 1, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is f(s) = min(c_s, f(left_child) + f(right_child)).\n\nBut the total x would then be the sum of the f(s) for all nodes of length 1? No, because each leaf is counted in multiple subtrees. For example, a leaf \"01\" is part of the subtree of \"0\" (length 1), and also of \"01\" (length 2). However, the f(s) for the node \"0\" would already account for the number of leaves in its subtree. So if we sum the f(s) for all nodes of length 1, it would be double-counting the leaves. Hence, this approach is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that the maximum x is the value of f(s) for the root of the entire trie (the empty string). But since the empty string is not part of the nodes, perhaps we need to imagine it as a virtual node. Let's proceed with this assumption.\n\nAssume that there is a virtual root node (empty string) with no constraints. Then, the maximum x is f(virtual_root), which is the sum of the f(s) of its children (nodes of length 1). But since the virtual root has no constraints, its capacity is effectively infinite. Thus, f(virtual_root) = sum of f(s) for its children (nodes of length 1). However, for each node of length 1, f(s) is min(c_s, sum of f(children of s)).\n\nThus, the maximum x is the sum of f(s) for all nodes of length 1, which equals f(virtual_root). But this seems to be the case.\n\nSo, for the first sample, where n=1, the virtual root has two children (nodes \"0\" and \"1\"). The f(s) for each of these nodes is min(c_s, ...). But since they are leaves (because n=1), their f(s) is 1 if c_s >= 1, else 0. So the maximum x is f(virtual_root) = f(\"0\") + f(\"1\") = (1 if c_0 >= 1 else 0) + (1 if c_1 >= 1 else 0). But in the first sample, the maximum x is supposed to be c_0 + c_1. Which contradicts this.\n\nWait, this suggests that my approach is incorrect again. For example, in the first sample, when c_0=2 and c_1=0, the maximum x should be 2 (as per the note), but according to this new approach, f(\"0\") would be 1 (since it's a leaf and c_0 >= 1), and f(\"1\") would be 0 (since c_1 is 0). So the total x is 1 + 0 = 1, which is not matching the sample.\n\nThis indicates that my approach is wrong. What's the issue here?\n\nAh! I think I made a mistake in defining f(s). For a node s of length m < n, the f(s) is the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree. For example, for a node of length m < n, its subtree has 2^{n - m} leaves. But the f(s) is the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree, given the constraints. For a node of length m, its children are the nodes of length m+1 that extend it by 0 or 1. The maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of s is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves that can be selected in the subtrees of its children. \n\nSo for n=1, the nodes are of length 1. They are leaves, so their f(s) is 1 if c_s >= 1, else 0. But the virtual root's f is the sum of f(s) for its children (the nodes of length 1). So for the first sample, when c_0=2 and c_1=0, the virtual root's f is 1 + 0 = 1. But according to the note, the maximum x is 2. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, my approach is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that my understanding of f(s) is wrong. What is f(s) really representing?\n\nMaybe f(s) is the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree of s, given that the constraints for s and all its descendants are satisfied. In that case, for a node of length m < n, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves of its children. For example, for n=1, the nodes are leaves, so their f(s) is 1 if c_s >= 1, else 0. The virtual root's f is the sum of f(s) for its children, which is the total number of leaves selected. But in the first sample, when c_0=2 and c_1=0, this sum is 1+0=1. But the sample says that the maximum is 2. So why is this discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because the constraints for the nodes of length 1 are that the number of leaves in their subtree is <= c_s. But for a node of length 1, its subtree contains exactly one leaf (the string itself). So if c_s >= 1, then the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1. But if we have c_0=2, then the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of \"0\" is 1 (since it's a leaf). However, the capacity c_0 is 2, but the subtree of \"0\" has only one leaf. So the constraint is satisfied. So why can't we select both \"0\" and \"1\"? Well, because for the virtual root's children, their f(s) are 1 and 0. The virtual root's f is 1 + 0 = 1, which is the total number of leaves selected. But in reality, we can select one \"0\" and zero \"1\", which is allowed. But the maximum x would be 1, but the sample says that it's 2. What's wrong here?\n\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to assign values to each binary string (prefix) such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset of binary strings of length exactly `n` is exactly `f`. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: For each binary string `s` of length from 1 to `n`, we must ensure that the number of strings in the multiset with `s` as a prefix does not exceed a given value `c_s`.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming on Trie Structure**: We model the problem using a trie structure where each node represents a binary string.

Let total be the number of assignments where the minimum is >= f, minus the number where it is >= f+1.\n        \n        # So, the answer is (number of assignments with min >= f) - (number with min >= f+1).\n        \n        # Now, how to compute the number of assignments where all c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= x.\n        \n        # For each node s of length m, c_s must be >= ceil(x / 2^{n - m}).\n        # But since c_s is an integer between 0 and k, inclusive.\n        \n        # However, if x / 2^{n - m} is not integer, we need to take ceiling.\n        # Wait, for the minimum to be >= x, all c_s * 2^{n - m} >= x => c_s >= ceil(x / 2^{n - m}).\n        \n        # Therefore, for a given x, the number of valid assignments is the product over all nodes s of (k - lower_bound + 1), where lower_bound is max(ceil(x / 2^{n - m}), 0), and if lower_bound > k, then zero.\n        \n        # However, for each node s of length m, the term is (k - lower_bound + 1) if lower_bound <= k, else 0.\n        \n        # Now, the number of nodes of length m is 2^{m-1} for m from 1 to n.\n        \n        # For example, for m=1: 2^0 = 1 node.\n        # m=2: 2^1 = 2 nodes.\n        # ...\n        # m=n: 2^{n-1} nodes.\n        \n        # So, for each m in 1..n, we have 2^{m-1} nodes of length m.\n        \n        # For a given x, for each m, we compute the lower bound for c_s: ceil(x / 2^{n - m}) for each node of length m.\n        # Then, the number of valid assignments is the product for each m of (number of choices for c_s for nodes of length m)^{number of nodes of length m}.\n        \n        # However, for each m, the lower bound is the same for all nodes of length m, since they have the same length m.\n        \n        # Thus, for each m, the number of choices per node is max(0, k - L + 1), where L = ceil(x / (2^{n - m}))).\n        \n        # So, the total is the product over m=1 to n of (max(0, k - L_m + 1))^{cnt_m}, where cnt_m = 2^{m-1}.\n        \n        # Now, to compute the answer, we need to compute:\n        # ans = F(f) - F(f+1), where F(x) is the number of assignments where all c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= x.\n        \n        # However, if f > k * 2^{n - 1} (since for m=1, 2^{n - m} = 2^{n-1}, and c_s <= k), then F(f) is zero.\n        \n        # So, the steps are:\n        # 1.
