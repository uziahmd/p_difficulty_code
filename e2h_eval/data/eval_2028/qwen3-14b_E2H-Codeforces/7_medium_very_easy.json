The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me try to understand the structure.\n\nThe construction rules are:\n\nStart with one vertex. Then, add k new vertices connected to it. Then, every vertex that has only one connection (so the leaves) get k new vertices each. And this process must be done at least once. So the snowflake is built in layers.\n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows with each step.\n\nLet's consider the example given. For k=4, the smallest snowflake has 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 +4 +16 = 21? Wait, but the sample input says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Hmm, maybe my understanding is wrong.\n\nWait the example input includes n=13 as a yes. Let's think. How can that happen?\n\nLet me re-examine the construction steps. The initial step is one vertex. Then, connect it to k new vertices. So after the first step, we have 1 + k vertices. Then, each of those k vertices (which are leaves) must be connected to k new vertices. So each of them adds k vertices. So the total becomes 1 +k + k*k. But this step must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do this once. So the total is 1 +k +k^2. But for k>1.\n\nBut wait, the example says that n=13 is possible. Let's see: 1 +k +k² = 13. Let's solve for k. k² +k +1 =13 → k² +k -12=0. The discriminant is 1 +48 =49. So roots (-1 ±7)/2. Positive root is (6)/2=3. So k=3. So 1+3+9=13. So yes. So that's why n=13 is possible. So for that case, the answer is YES.\n\nBut then what about other possibilities? Like, maybe there are multiple steps. For example, after adding the second layer, maybe you can add more layers. Let's think.\n\nSuppose the initial step is 1 node. Then, first expansion: add k nodes. Then, each leaf (the k nodes) gets k new nodes. Then, perhaps, the next step is that those new nodes (each of which is a leaf) get another k nodes added. But the problem says that the step of adding new nodes to the leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal is two steps (the initial step and then one expansion). Wait, the initial step is adding the first k nodes. Then, the step of adding k nodes to each leaf is done once. So the total is 1 +k +k*k. But maybe there are more steps. For example, after that, you can again add k nodes to each leaf. So the total would be 1 +k +k^2 +k^3? Or maybe not. Let's think.\n\nEach time you do the expansion step, you take all the current leaves (those that have only one connection) and add k new nodes to each. So, for example:\n\nInitial state: 1 node. It's not a leaf (since it's connected to k nodes, but maybe in the first step, after adding the first k nodes, the initial node has degree k, and the new nodes have degree 1. So in the next expansion, each of those k nodes (which are leaves) are connected to k new nodes. After that, the leaves are the new nodes added in that step. Then, if you do another expansion, each of those leaves would get k new nodes. So the total number of nodes would be:\n\nAfter step 0: 1 node.\n\nAfter step 1: 1 + k.\n\nAfter step 2: 1 +k +k*k.\n\nAfter step 3: 1 +k +k*k +k^3.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because when you do step 2, you add k^2 nodes. Then, step 3 would add k * k^2 =k^3 nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k² +k³. But this is only if you do the expansion step multiple times. However, according to the problem statement, the expansion step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the snowflake can have any number of expansion steps, as long as there's at least one.\n\nSo for a given n, we need to check if there exists some k>1 and some m ≥1 (number of expansion steps) such that the total number of nodes is equal to n.\n\nWait, but how does the formula look like?\n\nLet me think again. The initial node is 1. Then, each expansion step adds k^m nodes? No, perhaps not. Let's model the number of nodes after m expansion steps.\n\nLet me think of the expansion steps. The initial step is creating the first layer. Let's think of the expansion steps as follows:\n\n- The initial node is level 0. Then, after the first expansion (step 1), we have level 1 nodes (k nodes). Then, each expansion step adds a new level. Each level i has k^i nodes. But the total number of nodes after m expansion steps would be 1 + sum_{i=1}^m k^i.\n\nWait, no. Because the first expansion step (step 1) adds k nodes. The second expansion step (step 2) adds k * k =k² nodes. Because each of the k nodes from step 1 has k new children. Then step 3 adds k² *k =k^3. So the total is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m. But the expansion steps must be done at least once. So m ≥1. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, but since the initial node is 1 (k^0), and m steps. But for m ≥1.\n\nBut for the snowflake, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the total number of nodes is S = sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥1, and k>1.\n\nBut wait, the sum from i=0 to m is (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1). So for example, when m=1, the sum is 1 +k. When m=2, 1 +k +k². Which matches our earlier example.\n\nBut the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So the minimal case is m=1, which gives 1 +k. But for that case, the snowflake requires that the expansion step is done once. However, the problem says that the step (adding k new nodes to each leaf) should be done at least once. So the expansion steps must be done once or more. So the total nodes is 1 +k + ... +k^m, where m ≥1.\n\nBut for example, if m=1, then the total is 1 +k. But then, in this case, the expansion step was done once. But in this case, the initial node has k children. Then, the expansion step is done once, which is adding k children to each of the leaves (the k children of the initial node). But that would require that the expansion step is done once. So the total nodes is 1 +k +k*k = 1 +k +k². Wait, this contradicts my previous idea. What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Oh right. The expansion steps are the steps where each leaf is expanded. So the initial step (the first expansion) is adding the k children. Then, the second expansion step is adding the children to those leaves. So for m expansion steps, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m. Wait, but that would require that m is the number of expansion steps. Let me re-express the steps:\n\nOriginal step: 1 node. Then, the first expansion step (step 1) adds k nodes. Now, the total is 1 +k. Then, the second expansion step (step 2) adds k *k nodes. Now, total is 1 +k +k^2. Then, step 3 adds k^2 *k =k^3 nodes. So after m expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m. But the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So m ≥1. Therefore, the total number of nodes is S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where k>1 and m ≥1.\n\nWait, but for example, when m=1, the sum is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) =k+1. Which is 1 +k. But according to the problem's example, when m=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Which is allowed. So for the snowflake, the number of nodes can be written as S = (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), where k>1, m≥1.\n\nBut the problem says that the expansion step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. So for example, if m=1, that means that the expansion step was done once. Which would imply that after the initial step (adding k nodes), we do one expansion step. But in that case, the expansion step is adding k nodes to each of the leaves (which are the k nodes from the initial step). So adding k *k nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k². Which would be for m=2 steps? Or m=1?\n\nThis is confusing. Let me re-express the problem's construction steps:\n\nInitially, the graph has one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). This is step one. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (i.e., the leaves) is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So the step of adding the k new vertices to each leaf is done once. So, the initial step is adding the first k nodes. Then, the expansion step is done once. Which adds k *k nodes. So the total nodes is 1 +k +k². Thus, the total is 1 +k +k². So for this case, the number of expansion steps is 1. So the formula for the total is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut according to the formula (k^{m+1} -1)/(k-1), if m is the number of expansion steps. Then, for m=1, the sum is (k^2 -1)/(k-1) =k+1. Which is 1 +k. That's conflicting with the example. So clearly, I'm misunderstanding the steps.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nAh! So the first step is adding k new vertices connected to the initial. Then, the step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) is done once. So that step is done once. So the first expansion step is done once. So the total nodes is 1 +k + (k *k). Because the leaves are the k nodes added in the first step, and each is connected to k new nodes. So the total is 1 +k +k². So for this case, the number of expansion steps is 1. So the formula for the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k².\n\nBut according to the formula (k^{m+1}-1)/(k-1), when m=2, that's (k^3-1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k². Which is correct. So the m here is the number of expansion steps. So the initial step (adding k nodes) is not counted as an expansion step. The expansion steps are the steps of adding k new nodes to each leaf. So the initial step is the first part (adding k nodes to the initial node), and the expansion steps are the steps that follow. So the formula for the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps, and m ≥1. Because the expansion steps must be done at least once. So for example, when m=1, the total is 1 +k +k^1? No. Wait, the initial step is 1 node. Then, adding k nodes (so total 1 +k). Then, the expansion step (m=1) adds k *k nodes, so total is 1 +k +k². So the formula is 1 +k +k² = sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. Which is (k^3-1)/(k-1). So m is the number of expansion steps. So the formula is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i? No. Let me think again.\n\nLet me model the steps:\n\n- Initial step: 1 node. (level 0)\n- First expansion (step 1): add k nodes connected to the initial node. Now, the total is 1 +k. These k nodes are leaves.\n- Second expansion (step 2): add k nodes to each of the k leaves. So add k *k nodes. Now, total is 1 +k +k².\n- Third expansion (step 3): add k nodes to each of the k² leaves. So add k^3 nodes. Total is 1 +k +k² +k^3.\n\nSo the number of expansion steps is m. Then, the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i? No. Wait, the initial step is 1 node. Then, after m expansion steps, the total is sum_{i=0}^{m} k^i? No. Let's see:\n\nFor m=0 expansion steps: the initial node (1) plus the first step (adding k nodes) is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step must be done at least once. So m is the number of expansion steps. So the initial step (adding k nodes) is not an expansion step. The expansion steps are the ones after that. So the initial step is required. Then, the expansion steps are done m times. So the formula for the total nodes is:\n\nTotal = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? Or 1 +k + ... +k^m?\n\nWait, when m=1 expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k². Which is 1 +k +k^2 = sum_{i=0}^2 k^i. Which is (k^3 -1)/(k-1). So m=1 expansion steps corresponds to sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i. But that seems inconsistent. Alternatively, the sum is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, but with m being the number of expansion steps plus 1. I think I'm getting confused here. Let me think of m as the number of expansion steps. Then, the initial step (adding k nodes) is not part of the expansion steps. So the initial step is mandatory, and then the expansion steps are done m times (each time adding k new nodes to each leaf). So:\n\nTotal nodes = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No. Because:\n\n- After initial step: 1 +k nodes. Then, m expansion steps:\n\nFor m=1 expansion step: add k^2 nodes. So total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nFor m=2 expansion steps: add k^2 +k^3 nodes. So total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo the total is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No. Because for m expansion steps, the exponents go up to m+1?\n\nWait, the initial step adds k^1 nodes. Then, each expansion step adds k^2, then k^3, etc. So for m expansion steps, the total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} k^i? Or 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m} k^{i} ?\n\nNo. Let me think again. The initial step adds k nodes (k^1). Then, each expansion step adds k multiplied by the number of leaves. The leaves after the initial step are k. After the first expansion step, the leaves are k^2. After the second expansion step, leaves are k^3, etc. So the number of nodes added in each expansion step is k multiplied by the number of leaves before that step.\n\nSo the initial step is 1 node. Then, adding k nodes (total 1 +k). Then, expansion step 1: add k *k nodes (total 1 +k +k²). Expansion step 2: add k *k² nodes (total 1 +k +k² +k^3). So for m expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m+1}? Wait, no. Because the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, m expansion steps add k², k^3, ..., k^{m+1} ?\n\nYes. So the total is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{m+1} ? No, because for m=1 expansion steps, the total is 1 +k +k². Which is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} k^i. Wait, m=1 expansion steps, sum from i=1 to 2 (i=1 and 2) is k +k². Adding 1 gives 1 +k +k². So the formula is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} k^i? No, because m expansion steps would be adding k², k^3, ..., k^{m+1}? No. Because the first expansion step adds k² (which is k^2 = k^{1+1}), the second adds k^3 =k^{2+1}, etc. So for m expansion steps, the total added is sum_{i=1}^m k^{i+1} }, and the initial 1 node plus the initial k nodes (sum_{i=1}^1 k^i) ?\n\nAlternatively, the total is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} k^i. Because initial step adds k^1, then m expansion steps add k^2, k^3, ..., k^{m+1} ?\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + sum_{i=1}^{m+1} k^i = sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i. Which equals (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). \n\nBut this seems complicated. However, the problem says that the expansion steps must be done at least once. So m ≥1. So the total number of nodes is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nBut this seems hard to work with. However, looking back at the example where n=13, which is 1 +k +k². So for that case, the formula would be sum_{i=0}^2 k^i = (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =13. Which for k=3 gives (27-1)/2=13. Which works. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if there exists integers k>1 and m ≥1 such that n = (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). Wait, no. Because the formula sum_{i=0}^s k^i is (k^{s+1} -1)/(k-1). So for the example with m=1 expansion steps, the total is sum_{i=0}^2 k^i = (k^3 -1)/(k-1). Which equals 1 +k +k². So for that case, s=2. And s = m+1, where m is the number of expansion steps (m=1). So s = m +1. So the formula is n = (k^{s+1} -1)/(k-1) where s ≥2 (since m ≥1 implies s = m+1 ≥2).\n\nWait, no. If m is the number of expansion steps, then s is the maximum exponent. For example, m=1 expansion steps gives s=2. So s = m +1. So the formula is (k^{s+1} -1)/(k-1) = (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). But that seems complicated. However, the key point is that for any valid n, there exists some k>1 and s ≥2 such that n = (k^{s+1} -1)/(k-1). Wait, no. Because s is the maximum exponent. For example, when s=2, it's (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k² +k +1. Which is the case for m=1 expansion steps. So for any valid n, it must be expressible as (k^{s} -1)/(k-1) where s ≥2 and k ≥2. Because:\n\nIf s is the number of terms in the sum. For example, the sum from i=0 to s-1 of k^i is (k^s -1)/(k-1). So if the snowflake is built with m expansion steps, then the total number of nodes is sum from i=0 to (m+1) of k^i. Which is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). But that seems complex. However, the problem is to find for a given n, whether there exists some k>1 and s ≥2 (since m ≥1 implies s = m+1 ≥2) such that n = (k^s -1)/(k-1).\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because the sum from i=0 to s-1 is (k^s -1)/(k-1). So for example, if the sum is 1 +k +k², that's sum from i=0 to 2, which is s=3. So (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = 1 +k +k². So for that case, s is 3, and the formula is (k^s -1)/(k-1). So in general, for the snowflake to be possible, n must be equal to (k^s -1)/(k-1) where k ≥2, s ≥2.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires that the expansion steps are done at least once. So the minimal case is s=2? No. Wait, for s=2, (k^2 -1)/(k-1) =k+1. Which would be the case when the snowflake is constructed with only the initial step (adding k nodes) and no expansion steps. But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So that case is invalid. Therefore, the minimal s is 3. Because for s=3, (k^3-1)/(k-1) =k² +k +1, which is the case where there was one expansion step. So for the snowflake to be valid, n must be equal to (k^s -1)/(k-1) for some k ≥2 and s ≥3.\n\nWait, but the example given in the problem says that n=6 is output NO. Let's see. For example, if n=6, can we find k and s?\n\nCheck for s=3: (k^3 -1)/(k-1) =k² +k +1 =6. So solving k² +k +1=6 →k² +k -5=0 → discriminant is 1 +20=21 → sqrt(21) is irrational. So no integer solution. For s=4: (k^4 -1)/(k-1) =k^3 +k² +k +1. Let's set this equal to 6. Try k=2: 8+4+2+1=15>6. k=1 not allowed. So no solution. So n=6 is impossible. Hence output is NO, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is n=13. For s=3, k=3: 3² +3 +1= 9+3+1=13. Yes. So answer is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=15. Let's see. For s=3: k² +k +1=15 →k² +k -14=0. Discriminant 1 +56=57, not square. For s=4: k^3 +k² +k +1 =15. Let's try k=2: 8+4+2+1=15. Yes! So for k=2 and s=4. So yes. Hence output YES.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking whether n can be expressed as (k^s -1)/(k-1) for integers k ≥2 and s ≥3. But how to check this efficiently for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nThe challenge is to find for a given n, whether there exists integers k ≥2 and s ≥3 such that n = (k^s -1)/(k-1). \n\nBut how can we check this efficiently?\n\nFirst, note that (k^s -1)/(k-1) is equal to 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{s-1}. For example, s=3 gives 1 +k +k².\n\nSo for each n, we need to check if there exists k ≥2 and s ≥3 such that this sum equals n.\n\nNow, considering that n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to check for all possible k and s.\n\nLet's think about possible approaches.\n\nFor each possible s (starting from 3 up to some maximum value), check if there's a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible s for a given n?\n\nFor s ≥3, the minimal value of the sum is when k=2 and s=3: 1 +2 +4 =7. For larger s, the sum increases. So for a given n, the maximum possible s is log_2(n). For example, for n=1e18, log2(n) is about 60. So s can be up to around 60.\n\nSo for each test case n, we can iterate s from 3 up to log_2(n) + 1 (since for s larger than log_2(n), the minimal sum is 2^s -1 over 2-1 = 2^s -1, which is larger than n).\n\nSo for each possible s (from 3 up to say 60), we can check if there's a k such that the sum equals n.\n\nHow to check for a given s, if there exists a k ≥2 such that 1 +k +k² + ... +k^{s-1} =n.\n\nThis sum is equal to (k^s -1)/(k-1) =n.\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for k. For each s, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nBut for each s, what is the possible range of k?\n\nThe sum for k is strictly increasing with k. For fixed s ≥3, the sum increases as k increases. So for a given s, we can binary search for k in [2, ... , upper_bound], where upper_bound is such that the sum with k=upper_bound is greater than or equal to n.\n\nWhat is the upper bound for k for a given s?\n\nWell, since the sum is 1 +k + ... +k^{s-1} ≥k^{s-1} (since all terms are positive). So k^{s-1} ≤n →k ≤n^(1/(s-1)).\n\nThus, for binary search, the upper bound can be n^(1/(s-1)) +1.\n\nBut since n can be up to 1e18, and s can be up to 60, for each s, the upper bound for k is manageable.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- If n is less than 7 (the minimal possible sum for s=3, k=2: 1+2+4=7), then output NO.\n\n- Else, for s from 3 up to max_s (like 60):\n\n   - Compute the minimal possible sum for k=2: sum_2 = 1 +2 + ... +2^{s-1} = 2^s -1. If this is larger than n, then break (since for higher s, the sum will be even larger, but since s increases, maybe not. Wait, for a fixed k=2, increasing s increases the sum. So for example, for s=3, sum is 7; for s=4, sum is 15, etc. So for a given s, if the minimal sum (for k=2) is already larger than n, then higher s would have even larger sums, so we can break the loop.\n\n   - Else, perform a binary search on k in [2, upper] to find if there exists a k where sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and s efficiently?\n\nBut for large exponents, even with s=60 and k=2, the sum could be up to 2^60, which is about 1e18. So for each k and s, we can compute the sum incrementally, and check if it exceeds n. For example, for a given k and s, compute the sum 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1}.\n\nBut computing this sum directly may cause overflow. However, since n is up to 1e18, we can compute the sum step by step and stop if it exceeds n.\n\nSo the steps for checking for a given s:\n\nInitialize sum = 0.\n\ncurrent_term = 1 (k^0)\n\nfor i in 0 to s-1:\n\n   sum += current_term\n\n   if sum > n: break\n\n   current_term *=k\n\nBut wait, for the sum 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^{s-1}.\n\nSo for example, for s=3, the terms are 1, k, k^2.\n\nSo for each term, multiply by k each time.\n\nSo during the computation, if at any step the sum exceeds n, we can break early.\n\nSo for each s, we can perform a binary search on k between 2 and upper_bound, and for each candidate k, compute the sum and check if it equals n.\n\nNow, the question is, how to find the upper bound for k for a given s.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, since the sum is at least k^{s-1}, we have k^{s-1} ≤n →k ≤n^{1/(s-1)}.\n\nSo for binary search, the upper bound can be set to n^(1/(s-1)) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute that in Python?\n\nWe can compute it using integer exponentiation. For example, for a given s, the upper bound for k is something like int(n ** (1/(s-1))) + 2. But since exponents can be tricky with floating points, perhaps better to use binary search for k in [2, ... ] until the sum exceeds n.\n\nAlternatively, for each s, we can binary search k in the range [2, ... , upper], where upper can be determined as follows: since for the sum 1 +k + ... +k^{s-1} ≥k^{s-1}, and since this must be ≤n, then k ≤n^(1/(s-1)).\n\nBut for the binary search, perhaps we can start with low=2 and high= some value, say 2, and increase high until the sum for k=high and s is larger than n. But this may be time-consuming for some cases. However, given that s is up to 60, and t is up to 1e4, this may be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, for each s, we can compute the upper bound as follows: for k_max, we can take n^(1/(s-1)) + 2, but since in Python, we can use the math.pow function or ** operator.\n\nBut for very large exponents, even with n up to 1e18, the maximum possible s is about 60, so for each s, the upper bound for k is manageable.\n\nSo putting this all together, the algorithm for a single n is:\n\nCheck if n <7 → NO.\n\nElse:\n\nfor s in 3 to max_s:\n\n   if s is too big (e.g., 2^s exceeds n, but for s=3, 2^s=8, but the sum is 7. So maybe for s, check if 2^s -1 >n. Wait, the sum for k=2 and s is 2^s -1. So if for s, 2^s -1 >n, then for larger s, this will also be true. So for example, for a given s, if the minimal sum (k=2) is larger than n, then break the loop.\n\nSo for each s starting from 3 upwards, compute the minimal sum (k=2). If that sum is larger than n, break the loop, since higher s will have even larger minimal sums.\n\nOtherwise, for this s, perform a binary search on k in [2, ... upper_bound] to see if there exists a k where the sum equals n.\n\nIf any of these checks returns true, then answer is YES. Otherwise, after checking all possible s, answer is NO.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplement for each test case:\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n\n    if n < 7:\n\n        return False\n\n    max_s = 60  # since 2^60 is around 1e18, so for s up to 60, 2^s is 1e18.\n\n    for s in range(3, max_s +1):\n\n        # compute minimal sum for k=2: sum = 2^s -1\n\n        # if this is larger than n, break\n\n        min_sum = (2**s -1)\n\n        if min_sum > n:\n\n            break\n\n        # else, check for possible k in this s.\n\n        # find upper bound for k: k_upper = n^(1/(s-1)) + 1\n\n        # but compute it via binary search?\n\n        # alternatively, binary search between low=2 and high= some value.\n\n        low = 2\n\n        high = 2\n\n        # find a high such that the sum for k=high and s is >=n.\n\n        while True:\n\n            # compute sum for k=high and s.\n\n            # if sum <=n, then increase high.\n\n            # else break.\n\n            # but how to compute sum?\n\n            # compute sum for k=high and s.\n\n            # but for large high and s, it can be big.\n\n            # but for the purpose of finding upper bound, we can compute it as follows:\n\n            # sum = (high^s -1) // (high -1) ?\n\n            # but for large high and s, this could be expensive.

    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can be constructed based on specific rules. The snowflake graph is built in layers, starting from one vertex and expanding iteratively by connecting each leaf node to `k` new vertices. The challenge is to check if there exists a valid configuration for a given number of vertices `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A valid snowflake graph can be represented as the sum of a geometric series. For integers `k > 1` and `s ≥ 3`, the total number of vertices can be expressed as `(k^s - 1) / (k - 1)`.\n2. **Constraints Check**: For small values of `n` (less than 7), it's impossible to form a valid snowflake graph.\n3. **Iterate Over Possible Values of `s`**: We iterate over possible values of `s` starting from 3 up to a maximum value (determined by the constraints of `n`).\n4. **Binary Search for Valid `k`**: For each `s`, we perform a binary search on `k` to check if there exists an integer `k` such that the sum of the geometric series equals `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_possible(n):\n    if n < 7:\n        return False\n    max_s = 60  # since 2^60 is about 1e18, which is the upper limit for n\n    for s in range(3, max_s + 1):\n        # Check if the minimal sum for k=2 is larger than n\n        min_sum = (2 ** s) - 1\n        if min_sum > n:\n            break\n        # Now find if there's a k >=2 such that the sum equals n\n        # Find upper bound for k\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find a suitable high\n        while True:\n            # Compute the sum for current high and s\n            current_sum = 0\n            current_term = 1\n            for _ in range(s):\n                current_sum += current_term\n                if current_sum > n:\n                    break\n                current_term *= high\n            if current_sum > n:\n                break\n            else:\n                high *= 2\n        # Now binary search between low and high\n        left = 2\n        right = high\n        found = False\n        while left <= right:\n            mid = (left + right) // 2\n            # Compute the sum for mid and s\n            current_sum = 0\n            current_term = 1\n            overflow = False\n            for _ in range(s):\n                current_sum += current_term\n                if current_sum > n:\n                    overflow = True\n                    break\n                current_term *= mid\n            if overflow:\n                right = mid - 1\n            else:\n                if current_sum == n:\n                    found = True\n                    break\n                elif current_sum < n:\n                    left = mid + 1\n                else:\n                    right = mid - 1\n        if found:\n            return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_possible(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **is_possible Function**: This function checks if a given number `n` can be represented as the sum of a geometric series for some `k > 1` and `s ≥ 3`.
