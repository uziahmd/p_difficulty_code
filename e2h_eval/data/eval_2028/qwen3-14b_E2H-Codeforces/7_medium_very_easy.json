The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to determine for a given n whether there exists a snowflake graph with exactly n vertices. The snowflake is built in a specific way. Let me think about the structure of such a graph.\n\nThe construction rules are as follows: Start with one vertex. Then, connect it to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the previous step) must be connected to k new vertices. This process is done at least once. So, the snowflake is built in layers. \n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows with each step. Let's break down the steps:\n\nInitially, there's 1 vertex. Let's call this level 0.\n\nFirst expansion: Add k vertices connected to the initial one. Now total vertices is 1 + k. But each of these k vertices has degree 1 (since they're connected only to the central node). \n\nNow, according to the rules, each of these vertices must be connected to k new vertices. So, for each of the k nodes, we add k new nodes. So that's k * k new nodes. Now, the total vertices is 1 + k + k^2. \n\nBut wait, this step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) is done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would be when we do this once. For example, the example given for k=4 would have 1 + 4 + 4^2 = 21? Wait, but the sample input says for n=13, output is YES. Let me check that.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the steps. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe initial step: start with one vertex. Then, connect it to k new vertices (k>1). So after first step, there's 1 + k vertices. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (i.e., the ones added in the first step) must be connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So, this means that after the initial step, we perform this expansion once. \n\nSo the total number of vertices would be:\n\nInitial: 1\n\nAfter first expansion: 1 + k\n\nAfter second expansion (each of the k leaves gets k children): 1 + k + k*k.\n\nBut wait, what if there are more steps? Like, suppose after the second expansion, there are leaves again. For example, the second expansion adds k^2 nodes, each connected to their parent. Those nodes are leaves. Then, perhaps we can do another expansion step. But the problem says that the step (connecting each leaf to k new vertices) should be done at least once. So the minimal case is that we do it once. But the process could be done multiple times.\n\nSo the total number of vertices depends on how many times we do this expansion. Let's model this.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake as being built in layers. The first layer is the initial node. The second layer is the k nodes connected to it. The third layer is each of those nodes connected to k nodes. The fourth layer is each of those third-layer nodes connected to k nodes, etc. However, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the minimal depth is two steps (the initial step plus one expansion step).\n\nBut the problem allows for any number of expansion steps as long as it's done at least once. So the total number of vertices can be written as:\n\nn = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1?\n\nWait, no. Because the first expansion is adding k nodes (level 1), then the next expansion adds k * k nodes (level 2), and so on. But the expansion steps are applied to all leaves. So the expansion steps are applied once per level. Let's see:\n\nThe initial node is level 0. Then, after the first expansion, level 1 has k nodes. Then, the expansion step is applied once (so level 2 has k * k nodes). If we apply another expansion step, then each of the level 2 nodes would get k children, adding k^3 nodes. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. \n\nBut the problem says that the expansion step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal number of expansions is 1. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But perhaps there are more expansions. So for m ≥ 1 expansions, the total is sum_{i=0}^{m} k^i} ?\n\nWait, no. Because the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the first expansion step adds k^2 nodes. Then the next adds k^3, etc. So the total is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps. But since the expansion steps must be done at least once, m ≥ 1. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i} where m ≥ 1. But sum_{i=0}^m k^i} = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k-1). \n\nBut for this to be valid, the sum must be equal to n. However, the problem says that the expansion step must be done at least once. So m can be 1 or higher. So for example, if m=1, then sum is 1 + k + k^2? Wait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nWait the initial node is 1. Then, the first expansion (adding k nodes) gives 1 + k. Then, the first expansion step (the required step) adds k^2 nodes, giving 1 +k +k^2. Then, if we do another expansion step, we add k^3 nodes, making total 1 +k +k^2 +k^3. So the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, but the number of expansion steps is m. Wait, the first expansion (adding k) is not an expansion step? Or is it?\n\nLet me re-express the process:\n\nThe initial graph has 1 node.\n\nThen, the first step (adding k nodes connected to the initial) — this is part of the construction. Then, the expansion step is done once (so each of the k nodes is connected to k new nodes). So the expansion step is done once. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut what if we do more expansion steps? For example, after that, each of the k^2 nodes (which are leaves) are connected to k new nodes. That would add k^3 nodes. So total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^m, where m ≥ 1. Because the expansion step is done m times. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the expansion step (required at least once) adds k^2 nodes. Then, if we do another expansion step, that adds k^3 nodes. So the number of expansion steps is m ≥ 1. The total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m+1}? No, let me count:\n\nOriginal node: 1.\n\nAfter adding k nodes (step 1): 1 + k.\n\nAfter expansion step 1 (adding k^2 nodes): 1 +k +k^2.\n\nAfter expansion step 2 (adding k^3 nodes): 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo the total is sum_{i=0}^{m+1} k^i} where m is the number of expansion steps. But the number of expansion steps is m ≥ 1. So the sum is (k^{m+2} -1)/(k-1). Wait, no. Because sum_{i=0}^s k^i} is (k^{s+1} - 1)/(k-1). So for example, when m expansion steps are done, the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^{m+1}? No. Because the initial step (adding k nodes) is not an expansion step. The expansion steps are the ones that add k^2, k^3, etc. So the number of terms is:\n\nOriginal 1, then after adding k, then adding k^2, then adding k^3, etc. So the total number of terms is 1 (original) + (number of expansion steps + 1) ?\n\nWait, the initial step is adding k nodes. Then, the first expansion step adds k^2, the second expansion step adds k^3, etc. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^{m+1} }, where m is the number of expansion steps (≥1). But that would be sum from i=0 to m+1 of k^i minus the term for i=0 (since the original is 1, which is k^0). Wait, no. The sum is 1 (original) + k (first step) + k^2 (first expansion) + k^3 (second expansion) + ... + k^{m+1} (m-th expansion). So the sum is (k^{m+2} -1 )/(k-1) - (k^0 - 1)/(k-1) ? Not sure. Alternatively, the sum is 1 + k*(1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m ). Because the first step adds k, then each expansion adds k multiplied by the previous expansion's nodes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to model the total number of nodes as:\n\nTotal = 1 + k * (1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m ), where m ≥ 1. Because the first expansion adds k nodes (which is k*1), then each expansion step adds k multiplied by the number of leaves from the previous step. But the number of leaves is k * (k^0 + k^1 + ... +k^{m} ?) Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the total number of nodes as a geometric series. Let me think of the possible forms of n.\n\nFor example, for m expansion steps:\n\nThe initial node is 1.\n\nAfter the first step (adding k nodes), the total is 1 + k.\n\nThen, after one expansion step (adding k^2 nodes), the total is 1 +k +k^2.\n\nAfter another expansion step (adding k^3 nodes), the total is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3.\n\nSo the total is S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^d, where d ≥ 2 (since the expansion step is done at least once). Because for d=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. For d=3, 1 +k +k^2 +k^3, etc.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be expressed as S = (k^{d} -1)/(k-1) for some integers k>1 and d ≥ 2.\n\nWait, because the sum from i=0 to d of k^i is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). But in our case, the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). But for the snowflake, the sum must be for d ≥ 2. Because when d=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2, which corresponds to one expansion step (since the expansion step is done once). When d=3, that's two expansion steps, etc.\n\nSo the problem becomes: for a given n, does there exist integers k>1 and d ≥ 2 such that n = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nWait, no. Because when d is the maximum exponent, then the sum is up to k^d. So the formula is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) ?\n\nYes. For example, sum from i=0 to d of k^i is (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1). So for the snowflake, the sum must be for d ≥ 2. Because when d=2, the sum is (k^3 -1)/(k-1) = k^2 +k +1. Which is the case when there is one expansion step (as discussed earlier). So the problem reduces to checking whether n can be written in this form for some k>1 and d ≥ 2.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the expansion steps are not done all the way? For example, maybe there's a different way of building the snowflake. Wait, no. Because the expansion steps are done as per the rules. Each time you add a layer. So the total number of nodes must be such a sum. So the problem is equivalent to checking whether n can be written as (k^{d+1} - 1)/(k-1) for some k>1, d≥2. \n\nBut also, note that the sum can be written as 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^d. For example, when d=1, the sum is 1 +k. But according to the problem statement, the expansion steps must be done at least once. So for d=1, the sum is 1 +k, which would correspond to having done zero expansion steps. Which is invalid. Hence, the minimum d is 2. Therefore, the problem is to check if n can be written as (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) for k>1 and d ≥ 2.\n\nBut how do we check that for a given n?\n\nThe approach is: For each test case n, check whether there exists some k>1 and d≥2 such that n is equal to the sum S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... +k^d. \n\nBut considering that n can be up to 1e18, we need an efficient way to check this.\n\nLet me think of possible approaches. For each n, we need to find if there exists a k and d such that S equals n.\n\nLet me think about possible values of d. For each possible d, we can check if there exists a k such that S equals n.\n\nBut since d can be up to log_2(n), because for k=2, the sum for d is 2^{d+1} -1. So for n up to 1e18, d can be up to around 60.\n\nSo for each n, we can iterate over possible d from 2 up to log_2(n) (say up to 60), and for each d, check if there's a k>1 such that (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) = n. \n\nBut how to check for each d and n if such a k exists?\n\nLet me think for a fixed d. We can rewrite the equation as:\n\n(k^{d+1} -1) = (k-1)*n.\n\nWhich rearranges to:\n\nk^{d+1} - (k-1)*n -1 = 0.\n\nBut solving this for k is challenging. However, for a fixed d, we can perform a binary search on k.\n\nBecause for fixed d, the function f(k) = (k^{d+1} -1)/(k-1) increases with k. Since k>1, and for each d, as k increases, the sum increases. So for each d, we can perform a binary search on k to see if there exists a k such that f(k) equals n.\n\nBut what's the possible range for k?\n\nFor a fixed d, the minimal value of f(k) is when k=2. The maximum possible k for a given d is such that f(k) ≤ n. Since f(k) = 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d. For k ≥2, this sum is at least 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... +2^d = 2^{d+1} -1. So for each d, the minimal sum is 2^{d+1} -1. So for a given n, if n is less than that, then this d is not possible.\n\nSo for each d starting from 2 up to log_2(n), we can check:\n\nif n >= 2^{d+1} -1 ?\n\nIf not, skip this d. Else, perform a binary search on k between 2 and some upper bound.\n\nWhat's the upper bound for k for a given d?\n\nWell, since the sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d = n. Since all terms except the first are positive, the sum is greater than k^d. So k^d < n. Therefore, k < n^(1/d). So the upper bound for k is n^(1/d). But since n can be up to 1e18, and d can be up to 60, this is manageable.\n\nSo for each d from 2 to say 60:\n\n- compute the minimal sum for k=2: min_sum = 2^{d+1} -1. If n < min_sum, skip.\n\n- else, perform a binary search on k in [2, ... , upper], where upper can be n^(1/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute the upper bound for k? Well, since the sum for k is S = 1 +k + ... +k^d. For k ≥2, S is at least k^d. So k^d <= S =n → k ≤ n^(1/d). So we can take upper as n^(1/d) + 1.\n\nBut how to compute this in code? Well, for each d, we can compute the upper as something like int(n ** (1.0 /d )) + 2.\n\nBut since n can be very big (up to 1e18), we need to handle this carefully. Also, for binary search, we can compute the sum for a given k and d and compare to n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each test case n:\n\n- Check if n is 1: then no (since k>1, and the minimal sum is 1 +k +k^2, which is 1+2+4=7 when d=2, k=2. So for n=1, answer is no.)\n\n- Else, for d in 2 to max_d (like 60):\n\n   - compute the minimal sum for k=2: 2^{d+1} -1. If this is larger than n, skip.\n\n   - else, perform a binary search on k between 2 and upper to find if there exists a k where the sum equals n.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for given k and d? For example, for k=3 and d=2, the sum is 1 +3 +3^2 = 13. Which is the sample input case where n=13 outputs YES.\n\nBut for large k and d, computing the sum may overflow. However, since n is up to 1e18, and for each step, we can compute the sum incrementally and check if it exceeds n. For example:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1  # k^0\n\n    for _ in range(d+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return -1  # overflow\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nWait, but for d steps? Let me think. The sum is 1 +k +k^2 + ... +k^d. Which has (d+1) terms. So for each term from exponent 0 to d. So the loop runs d+1 times. So for each k and d, we can compute the sum, and during the computation, if it exceeds n, we can stop early and return something indicating overflow.\n\nThis way, even for large exponents, we can avoid overflows (since Python handles big integers, but for efficiency, we can check early).\n\nSo for each candidate k and d, compute the sum, and check if it equals n.\n\nSo the steps for each d:\n\n- Check if the minimal sum (for k=2) is <= n.\n\n- If yes, perform binary search on k between 2 and upper (as discussed).\n\nBut how to find the upper for binary search? Well, for the sum to be <=n, the maximum k can be such that k^d <=n. Because the sum is at least k^d. So k_max_candidate = floor(n^(1/d)).\n\nBut how to compute that in Python? We can use binary search for k, but perhaps using math.pow or something else. However, since we can compute the sum for k, we can use binary search between low=2 and high= something like n^(1/d) + 1.\n\nAlternatively, since for a given d, the sum increases with k, we can binary search for k in the range [2, ... , upper], where upper can be set as n (but that would be inefficient). However, since for k >=2, the sum for d is at least 1 +k + ... +k^d >= k^d. So k^d <=n → k <= n^(1/d). So for upper, we can take something like n^(1/d) + 2.\n\nIn Python, to compute n^(1/d), we can use pow(n, 1.0/d), but that's a floating point approximation. So for example, for n=1e18 and d=60, 1e18^(1/60) is 10^(18/60) = 10^0.3 ≈ 2. So the upper bound would be 2 or 3. But for exactness, perhaps we can use binary search for the upper bound.\n\nBut perhaps for the binary search, we can just use a high value of 2e9 (since for d=2, the maximum k would be sqrt(n), which for n=1e18 is 1e9. So for d up to 60, the upper bound for k would be up to 1e18^(1/2) = 1e9, which is manageable.\n\nBut given that for each d, the binary search for k is O(log n) steps, and for each step, the sum is computed in O(d) steps, which for d up to 60 is acceptable. Since t is 1e4, and for each test case, the maximum d is 60, the total steps would be 1e4 * 60 * log(1e18) * 60. Which is acceptable.\n\nSo the code outline would be:\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    n = input value\n\n    if n == 1:\n\n        print NO\n\n    else:\n\n        found = False\n\n        for d in 2 to 60:\n\n            # compute min sum for k=2\n\n            min_sum = 2^(d+1) - 1\n\n            if min_sum > n:\n\n                continue\n\n            # else, check if there exists k >=2 such that sum equals n\n\n            # binary search for k between 2 and upper\n\n            low = 2\n\n            high = ?\n\n            # find upper as something like n^(1/d) + 2\n\n            # but to avoid dealing with floating points, perhaps we can find the upper via binary search.\n\n            # Alternatively, set high to 2e6 or something, but for n up to 1e18 and d up to 60, the maximum possible k is 1e18^(1/2) = 1e9, which is manageable.\n\n            # So let's set high to 2e5 (but perhaps better to compute high as something like 2e5 for safety)\n\n            # Wait, but for d=2, the maximum k is sqrt(n). For n=1e18, sqrt(n) is 1e9. So setting high to 1e9 is possible. But in practice, for binary search, we can compute high as something like 2, and then multiply by 2 until the sum exceeds n.\n\n            # Alternative approach: find upper bound for k for this d.\n\n            # For example, start with high=2, and while compute_sum(high, d) < n, multiply high by 2.\n\n            # Then perform binary search between low=2 and high.\n\n            # This is a common technique to find the upper bound.\n\n            # So here's how:\n\n            # Find upper bound for k:\n\n            high = 2\n\n            while compute_sum(high, d) < n:\n\n                high *= 2\n\n            # Now, binary search between low=2 and high.\n\n            # Now perform binary search between low and high.\n\n            # But compute_sum is the function that returns the sum for k and d, and returns -1 if it exceeds n during calculation.\n\n            # So during binary search, for mid, compute the sum. If it is equal to n, return yes. If it is less than n, search higher.

Correct.\n\nSample Input 2:\n\nn=2: Output is NO. Because the minimal sum is 2^3-1/(2-1) = 7? Wait for d=2, the sum is 1+2+4=7. So for n=2, no.\n\nSample Input 3:\n\nn=6: Output is NO. Let's see. For d=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Let's see if there's a k.\n\nCheck for k=2: 1+2+4=7>6. For k=1, but k must be >1. So no. So no solution.\n\nAnother case: n=13. For d=2, the sum is 1 +k +k^2. Let's solve for k:\n\nk^2 +k +1 = 13 → k^2 +k -12=0 → roots (-1 ± sqrt(1 +48))/2 → (sqrt(49)-1)/2 = (7-1)/2=3. So k=3. So sum is 1+3+9=13. So yes. Hence output is YES.\n\nAnother sample input is n=15. Let's see. For example, d=2: 1 +k +k^2 =15. k^2 +k -14=0. Discriminant 1+56=57. sqrt(57) is ~7.5. ( -1 +7.5)/2 ~ 3.25. So no integer k. What about d=3? sum is 1 +k +k^2 +k^3 =15. Let's try k=2: 1+2+4+8=15. Yes! So for d=3, k=2. So answer is YES. Hence sample input 15 is YES.\n\nSo the code should handle these cases.\n\nNow, let's think about the code structure.\n\nBut first, what about the case where d is larger than log_2(n)? For example, if n is 3, and d=2: min sum for k=2 is 7>3, so skipped. So no solution.\n\nAnother case: n=7. For d=2, k=2: sum is 7. So output YES.\n\nSo the code needs to handle that.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nWe need to loop over d from 2 up to max_d. What is the maximum possible d? For example, for k=2, the sum is 2^{d+1} -1. For n=1e18, solving 2^{d+1} -1 <= 1e18. Let's see:\n\n2^60 is approx 1.15e18. So for d+1=60, d=59. So for d up to 60, we can check. So in code, we can loop d from 2 to 60.\n\nSo in code:\n\nfor d in range(2, 61):\n\nBut what if for larger d, there's a possible solution? For example, if k=1. But no, k must be >1. So for k=2, the sum for d=60 is 2^61 -1, which is about 2e18. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum d is 60.\n\nThus, the code can loop d from 2 to 60.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut for the case where n=1, the code returns NO.\n\nAnother edge case: n=3. The minimal sum for d=2 is 7>3. So no. So output is NO.\n\nAnother case: n=7. For d=2, k=2, sum is 7. So YES.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nImplementing compute_sum as a helper function.\n\nBut for each test case, we have to loop through d from 2 to 60. For each d, check if the minimal sum (k=2) is <=n. If yes, proceed to binary search.\n\nBut for the binary search, the code for finding upper bound is as follows:\n\nInitially, high is set to 2, and while compute_sum(high, d, n) <n, multiply by 2.\n\nBut compute_sum(high, d, n) returns -1 if during the sum calculation it exceeds n. So for example, if the sum is exactly n, returns n, else if it exceeds, returns -1.\n\nWait, the code for compute_sum is:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(d+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return -1\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nSo, for example, if the sum is exactly n, returns n. If during the computation, the sum exceeds n, returns -1. Otherwise returns the sum.\n\nSo, in the code for finding upper bound, when compute_sum(high, d, n) returns -1, it means that the sum exceeds n, so we can stop increasing high. But if it returns a value less than n, then we need to increase high.\n\nWait, but in the code for finding upper bound, the loop is:\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile compute_sum(high, d, n) < n:\n\n    high *= 2\n\nBut compute_sum returns -1 if the sum exceeds n. So, for example, if compute_sum(high, d, n) returns -1, then the sum is larger than n. So the condition (compute_sum(...) <n) would be false, because -1 is less than n. So the loop would stop. But that's not correct.\n\nWait, no. The code for compute_sum returns -1 when during the sum calculation, the total exceeds n. But in that case, the actual sum is larger than n. So compute_sum returns -1, which is less than n. So the loop condition is 'compute_sum(...) <n' → which is true. So the loop will keep multiplying high by 2. Which is not correct. Because the actual sum is larger than n, but compute_sum returns -1, which is less than n. So the loop would think that the sum is less than n, and keep increasing high. Which is wrong.\n\nSo this approach is flawed.\n\nAlternative idea: during the compute_sum, we can return the actual sum if it is <=n, else return something larger than n (like n+1). So that the code can correctly compare.\n\nLet me adjust the compute_sum function:\n\ndef compute_sum(k, d, n):\n\n    total = 0\n\n    current = 1\n\n    for _ in range(d+1):\n\n        total += current\n\n        if total > n:\n\n            return n + 1  # indicates that the sum exceeds n\n\n        current *= k\n\n    return total\n\nSo, for example, if the sum is exactly n, returns n. If during the calculation, the total exceeds n, returns n+1. Otherwise returns the total.\n\nSo now, during the upper bound finding:\n\nhigh = 2\n\nwhile compute_sum(high, d, n) < n:\n\n    high *= 2\n\nThis will work. Because compute_sum returns a value that is either:\n\n- exactly the sum (<=n) → if it is less than n, then we need to increase high.\n\n- or returns n+1 (sum exceeds n). So compute_sum(high, d, n) <n is false, and the loop stops.\n\nSo this would correctly find an upper bound.\n\nOnce the upper bound is found, the binary search proceeds between low=2 and high.\n\nSo during the binary search, for each mid, compute the sum. If it is equal to n → return yes. If it is less than n → search higher. Else → search lower.\n\nSo the code for the binary search part would be:\n\nlow = 2\n\nhigh = current_high\n\nwhile low <= high:\n\n    mid = (low + high) // 2\n\n    s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n    if s == n:\n\n        return True\n\n    elif s < n:\n\n        low = mid + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        high = mid -1\n\nSo this seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the code in Python.\n\nBut for handling very large exponents, the compute_sum function may take O(d) steps, but since d is up to 60, it's manageable.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in Python, for each test case, we need to process this.\n\nNow, considering that t can be 1e4, and for each test case, up to 60 iterations for d, and for each d, binary search steps, but each step is O(d) time.\n\nBut even for 1e4 * 60 * 40 (binary steps) * 60 (d steps), it's acceptable.\n\nNow, let's code.\n\nBut also, note that for some cases, the same n can be represented in multiple ways (different k and d). But once any is found, we can return YES.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead t test cases.\n\nFor each n:\n\nif n == 1 → print NO.\n\nelse:\n\n    flag = False\n\n    for d in 2 to 60:\n\n        # compute minimal sum for k=2\n\n        # sum is 1 + 2 + 2^2 + ... + 2^d = 2^{d+1} - 1.\n\n        # compute that value.\n\n        # but for d up to 60, 2^61 is about 2e18, which is manageable.\n\n        min_sum = (2 ** (d+1) -1)\n\n        if min_sum > n:\n\n            continue\n\n        # else, check for possible k.\n\n        # find upper bound for k.\n\n        # initial high is 2.\n\n        high = 2\n\n        while True:\n\n            s = compute_sum(high, d, n)\n\n            if s >= n:\n\n                break\n\n            high *= 2\n\n        # now perform binary search between low=2 and high.\n\n        low = 2\n\n        current_high = high\n\n        while low <= current_high:\n\n            mid = (low + current_high) // 2\n\n            s = compute_sum(mid, d, n)\n\n            if s == n:\n\n                flag = True\n\n                break\n\n            elif s < n:\n\n                low = mid +1\n\n            else:\n\n                current_high = mid -1\n\n        if flag:\n\n            break\n\n    print(\"YES\" if flag else \"NO\")\n\nBut how to compute 2^(d+1) -1?

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices $ n $ can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the problem constraints.
