Note than you cannot swap \"02\" $$$\\rightarrow$$$ \"20\" and vice versa. You cannot perform any other operations with the given string excluding described above.You task is to obtain the minimum possible (lexicographically) string by using these swaps arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).String $$$a$$$ is lexicographically less than string $$$b$$$ (if strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ have the same length) if there exists some position $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\le i \\le |a|$$$, where $$$|s|$$$ is the length of the string $$$s$$$) such that for every $$$j < i$$$ holds $$$a_j = b_j$$$, and $$$a_i < b_i$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains the string $$$s$$$ consisting only of characters '0', '1' and '2', its length is between $$$1$$$ and $$$10^5$$$ (inclusive).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single string â€” the minimum possible (lexicographically) string you can obtain by using the swaps described above arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['100210', '11222121', '20']\n\n### Output\n['001120', '11112222', '20']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum lexicographical string possible by swapping adjacent 0s and 1s, and adjacent 1s and 2s. But I can't swap 0 and 2 directly. Hmm.\n\nSo the allowed swaps are between 0 and 1 (adjacent), and between 1 and 2 (adjacent). So what does that mean for the order of characters?\n\nLet me think about the possible rearrangements. Since 0 can be swapped with 1, and 1 can be swapped with 2, but 0 and 2 can't be swapped directly. However, maybe through some steps? Like, if I have a 0 and a 2 separated by some 1s, can I move them past each other?\n\nWait, suppose I have 0 and 2 with some 1s in between. Let's say \"012\". Then, I can swap the 0 and 1 first to get \"102\", then swap the 1 and 2 to get \"120\". But then the 0 is now after the 2. Wait, but how can I get the 0 and 2 to swap positions? It seems like they can't. Because the 0 can only move through 1s, and the 2 can only move through 1s. So if there's a 0 and a 2 in the string, their relative order might be fixed depending on the 1s between them. Or maybe not?\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose the string is \"02\". Can't swap them. So they stay as is. If the string is \"012\", then the 0 can move to the right past the 1, and the 2 can move left past the 1. But can they cross each other?\n\nLike, for example, \"012\" can become \"102\" (swap 0 and 1), then \"120\" (swap 1 and 2). So the 0 ends up after the 2. But originally, the 0 was before the 2. So their order has changed. But how? Because they didn't swap directly. So in this case, the 0 and 2 can end up in different orders. So perhaps the 0s and 2s can be ordered in any way as long as there's a path through 1s?\n\nWait, but that's not possible. Because in the example above, the 0 and 2 can be swapped via moving through the 1. So maybe the 0s and 2s can be arranged in any order, but with the 1s in between?\n\nNo, that's not correct. Let me think again. Suppose I have \"02\". I can't do anything. So the order is fixed. But if there's a 1 between them, like \"012\", then we can arrange the 0 and 2 to be in any order? Like, in the example, we can get from 012 to 120. So the 0 is now after the 2. So in that case, the 0 and 2 can be swapped via moving through the 1s. But how about if there are multiple 1s?\n\nSo perhaps the key here is that 0s can be moved past 1s, and 2s can be moved past 1s. So the 1s can act as intermediaries. So the relative order between 0s and 2s depends on the 1s. But how can we arrange the entire string?\n\nLet me think about grouping the characters. Since 0s can be moved past 1s, and 2s can be moved past 1s, but 0s and 2s can't be swapped. So the 1s can be moved around between 0s and 2s. But the 0s and 2s can be ordered in any way as long as their positions are adjusted through the 1s?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's think of the 0s and 2s as being able to move freely, but only when there are 1s in between. For example, suppose you have a 0 followed by a 2. Since they can't be swapped directly, but if there are 1s between them, then maybe you can move them around.\n\nBut if there's no 1 between them, like \"02\", then you can't swap them. So their order is fixed. But if there are 1s, then maybe you can arrange the 0s and 2s in any order?\n\nWait, but how? Let's say you have \"012\". As discussed earlier, you can turn it into \"120\". So the 0 is now after the 2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest string possible by performing specific adjacent swaps on a ternary string (composed of '0', '1', and '2'). The allowed swaps are between '0' and '1', and between '1' and '2'. However, '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Swap Constraints**: \n   - '0' can be swapped with '1'.\n   - '1' can be swapped with '2'.\n   - '0' and '2' cannot be swapped directly.\n\n2. **Key Insight**:\n   - '0's can move freely through '1's.\n   - '2's can move freely through '1's.\n   - '0's and '2's can effectively be reordered through the use of '1's as intermediaries.\n\n3. **Strategy**:\n   - We can treat the '1's as movable elements that allow '0's and '2's to be rearranged around them.\n   - The optimal strategy is to first process all '0's, then all '1's, and finally all '2's, ensuring that the order is minimized.\n\n4. **Implementation Steps**:\n   - Traverse the string and collect all '0's, '1's, and '2's separately.\n   - Concatenate these groups in the order of '0's, '1's, and '2's to form the lexicographically smallest string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef min_ternary_string(s):\n    zeros = []\n    ones = []\n    twos = []\n    for char in s:\n        if char == '0':\n            zeros.append(char)\n        elif char == '1':\n            ones.append(char)\n        else:\n            twos.append(char)\n    return ''.join(zeros + ones + twos)\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    print(min_ternary_string(input_str))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Handling**: The input string is read from standard input.\n- **Character Separation**: The string is split into three separate lists for '0's, '1's, and '2's.\n- **Concatenation**: The lists are concatenated in the order of '0's, '1's, and '2's to form the lexicographically smallest string. This works because '0's are the smallest, followed by '1's, and then '2's, which ensures the minimum possible string when combined in this order.\n\nThis approach efficiently separates and reorders the characters based on their allowed movements, resulting in the desired minimum lexicographical string. The complexity is linear with respect to the input size, making it suitable for large strings up to 100,000 characters.",
