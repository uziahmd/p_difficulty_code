You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to replace digits in a number with some given digits to make it as large as possible. The problem says that each element in the sequence s can be used at most once. So, the idea is to choose the best possible replacements.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem again. The input is a number a (as a string, probably) and a string s which is a sequence of digits. For example, in the first sample input, a is '1024' and s is '010'. The output is '1124'. How does that work? Let's see: the s has digits 0,1,0. We can replace digits in a. But we want to maximize the number. So, for each position in a, we can replace it with a digit from s, but each digit in s can be used once. Also, the order of the digits in s matters? Or maybe not. Wait, no. Because the sequence s is given, but each element can be used once. So the problem is to select a subset of the digits in s (each used once) and assign them to positions in a to maximize the value.\n\nSo the approach should be to replace the leftmost digits as high as possible. Because changing a digit in a more significant position (like the first digit) has a bigger impact on the overall value.\n\nBut how to do that? Let's think. For example, for the original number a, we can process each digit from left to right. For each position, we want to replace it with the largest possible digit available in s. However, we can't just take the maximum digit from s, because maybe there are multiple digits in s and we need to use them optimally.\n\nWait, but the way to maximize the number is to replace the earliest possible digits with the largest possible digits. So here's the plan:\n\n- Sort the digits in s in descending order. That way, we can pick the largest available digits first.\n- Then, iterate through each digit of a from left to right. For each digit, if there's a digit in the sorted s that is larger than the current digit, replace it with the largest possible available digit. Then remove that digit from the sorted list (since it's used once). If there's no such digit, leave it as is.\n\nWait, but what if there are multiple digits in s that are larger than the current digit? For example, if the current digit is 3 and s has 5, 6, 7. Then we should pick the largest one (7) to replace the current digit. Because replacing the current digit with the largest possible gives the maximum gain.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nSort the s digits in descending order. Then, for each position in a, check if the current digit can be replaced by a larger digit from the sorted s. If yes, replace it with the first (largest) available digit in s, and remove that digit from the list. Otherwise, move on.\n\nThis way, we ensure that we're making the maximum possible changes starting from the leftmost digit, which gives the highest possible value.\n\nLet me test this logic with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\na = '1024', s = '010'\n\nSo s is ['0','1','0'], sorted in descending order would be ['1','0','0'].\n\nNow, process each digit of a:\n\nFirst digit is '1'. Check if there's a digit in s that's larger than '1'. The sorted s starts with '1', which is equal. So no replacement here. Move to next digit.\n\nSecond digit is '0'. The first element in sorted s is '1', which is larger. So replace '0' with '1'. Remove '1' from s. Now s is ['0','0'].\n\nThird digit is '2'. The next elements in s are '0' and '0', which are smaller than 2. So no replacement.\n\nFourth digit is '4'. Same as above. No replacement.\n\nResult is '1124', which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother sample input is '987' and s is '1234567'. So sorted s is ['7','6','5','4','3','2','1'].\n\nOriginal a is 987. Let's process each digit:\n\nFirst digit is '9'. The largest available in s is 7, which is smaller than 9. So no replacement.\n\nSecond digit is '8'. The largest available is 7, which is smaller than 8. No replacement.\n\nThird digit is '7'. The largest available is 7. So replace it with 7? But that's same. So no change. So the output is 987. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: suppose a is '1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we aim to maximize the value of a given number `a` by replacing its digits with a sequence of digits `s`, ensuring that each digit in `s` is used at most once. The optimal approach involves leveraging the leftmost digits for the largest possible replacements, as they contribute more significantly to the overall value of the number.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\n1. **Sort the Digits in `s`**: \n   - Convert the string `s` into a list of characters (digits), then sort it in descending order. This allows us to always pick the largest available digit first.\n\n2. **Iterate Through Each Digit of `a`**:\n   - For each digit in the number `a` from left to right, check if there exists a digit in the sorted `s` that is greater than the current digit.\n   - If such a digit exists, replace the current digit in `a` with the largest available digit from `s`, and remove that digit from the sorted list.\n   - If not, leave the digit as is and continue.\n\n3. **Construct the Result**:\n   - After processing all digits, join the resulting list of characters to form the final maximum number.\n\nThis greedy strategy ensures that the number is maximized by making the most significant changes first.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code Implementation**\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split('\\n')\n    \n    # Read the first input line as the number 'a'\n    a = data[0]\n    # Read the second input line as the sequence of digits 's'\n    s = data[1]\n    \n    # Sort the digits in 's' in descending order\n    sorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n    \n    # Convert 'a' into a list of characters for easy manipulation\n    a_list = list(a)\n    \n    # Index to track which digit in sorted_s we are using\n    s_idx = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each digit in 'a'\n    for i in range(len(a_list)):\n        if s_idx < len(sorted_s) and sorted_s[s_idx] > a_list[i]:\n            a_list[i] = sorted_s[s_idx]\n            s_idx += 1\n    \n    # Join the list back into a string and print\n    print(''.join(a_list))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Edge Case Handling**\n\n- **Leading Zeros**: The problem guarantees that the input number `a` does not contain leading zeros. Since we are only replacing digits with larger or equal values, the result will also not have leading zeros.\n- **Empty Input**: The constraints specify that both `a` and `s` are non-empty, so no need to handle empty strings.\n- **All Digits in `s` Are Less Than or Equal to `a`**: In such cases, no replacement is made, and the original number is returned.\n\nThis solution efficiently handles large inputs (up to 100,000 digits) due to its linear time complexity in processing the digits of `a` and sorting the digits of `s`.",
