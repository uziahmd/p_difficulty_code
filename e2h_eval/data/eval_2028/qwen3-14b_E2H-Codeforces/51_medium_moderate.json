Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem says that we have three lines of input. The first two lines are the guest's name and the host's name. The third line is a pile of letters found in the morning. We need to check if the pile can be exactly formed by combining the letters from the guest and host names. So, the total letters in the pile should exactly match the combined letters of the guest and host. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the concatenated string of guest + host has the same character counts as the pile string.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nWell, one way is to take the guest and host strings, combine them into one, then count the frequency of each character. Then do the same for the pile string. Then compare the two frequency dictionaries.\n\nIf they are the same, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Read three lines of input. But wait, the input is given as three lines. So for each test case, perhaps? Wait, looking at the example input, the first example input is a list of three strings. Wait, the sample input shows that the input is three lines. For example, the first input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', ... etc. Wait, maybe the actual input is three lines. So for each test case, the input is three lines. But in the example, there are three test cases, each with three lines. Wait, the sample input shows three test cases. For example, the first input line is the guest's name, second the host's, third the pile. Then the output is three answers.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is three lines. But the sample input shows that there are three test cases, each with three lines. Wait, perhaps the input is multiple test cases. But how is that handled? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input file consists of three lines. So for each test case, the input is three lines. But the sample input shows three different test cases. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. However, the problem's input description says that the input is three lines. Wait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as three lines. But how does that work when there are multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, perhaps the actual input is three separate test cases, each with three lines. So the first test case's three lines are:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nThen the second test case's three lines are:\n\nLine 1: PAPAINOEL\n\nLine 2: JOULUPUKKI\n\nLine 3: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nAnd so on. So the input is multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But how many test cases are there? The sample output has three outputs, which correspond to three test cases.\n\nBut how does the program read the input? Because in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, but the problem statement may not specify. However, looking at the problem's input description, it says that the input consists of three lines. Which suggests that there is only one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. That seems conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of three test cases, each with three lines. But in reality, the actual input is three lines per test case. But how many test cases are there?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is three lines. So perhaps the code needs to process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases, which implies that the code needs to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as three lines. For example, the first test case is the first three lines, the second test case is the next three lines, etc. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\nSo the sample input is three test cases. Each test case is three lines. So the actual input is three test cases. But how does that work? How does the program read them?\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is described as three lines. Which suggests that the program must read three lines. However, the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines. Therefore, perhaps the problem is expecting that the program reads multiple test cases. But how?\n\nThis is a bit confusing. However, looking at the problem's original statement, perhaps the input is three lines for each test case. However, in programming competitions, sometimes the input is given as multiple test cases, but the problem statement may not specify. But given the sample input, perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases. But how to read them?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is presented as a single test case. But the sample input is written in a way that the three lines are part of the same test case. But that doesn't make sense. For example, the first sample input is three lines. Then the output is YES. But the sample shows that there are three outputs. So the sample input must consist of three test cases.\n\nBut how can that be? How can the input be three test cases, each with three lines?\n\nAh, perhaps the input is given as three lines per test case, and the number of test cases is determined by the input. But how would the program know how many test cases there are? Unless the input is read until EOF.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is three test cases. So perhaps the code needs to process multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is written in a way that each test case is given as a list of three strings. But in reality, the input is three lines for each test case, and the code is supposed to process all test cases until the end of input.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nWell, perhaps the problem is that the user is to read three lines of input (guest, host, pile) and output YES or NO. But the sample shows that there are three test cases. Therefore, perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. So the code should read all lines from stdin, group them into triplets, and process each triplet.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is given as multiple test cases. For example, the code may read all lines, and process them in groups of three.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python? Let's think about the sample input. The sample input is three test cases, each with three lines. So the code needs to read three lines for each test case, process them, and output the result.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, if the input is given via standard input, the code can read all lines first, then process them in groups of three.\n\nSo, for example, in Python, the code could read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of three, and for each group, process the three lines as guest, host, pile.\n\nBut how to handle the input correctly?\n\nBut according to the problem's input description, the input is three lines. So perhaps the problem is expecting that there is only one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but in reality, the actual input is three lines. For example, the first test case is the three lines, and the output is one line. But the sample shows three outputs. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is three lines. The output is \"YES\" or \"NO\".\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases, each with three lines. The sample output shows three answers. So perhaps the problem is expecting that the code reads multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description is ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that each test case is given as a list of three strings. For example, the first test case's three lines are SANTACLAUS, DEDMOROZ, SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Then the output is YES. The second test case's three lines are PAPAINOEL, JOULUPUKKI, JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI, output is NO, etc.\n\nIn that case, the code must process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. Which is confusing.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the sample input is written as a list of three test cases, but in reality, the actual input is three lines. So perhaps the problem is a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases, which would imply that the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a critical point. If I can't figure this out, I can't proceed.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's example:\n\nThe input is given as three lines. The output is one line. But the sample input shows three test cases with three lines each, and the output is three lines. So perhaps the problem is that the actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. But the problem's input description is wrong? Or perhaps the problem is that the input is three lines for each test case, and the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to know how many test cases there are? Well, in programming competition problems, sometimes the number of test cases is not given, and you have to read until the end of input.\n\nSo perhaps the code should read all lines from input, group them into triplets, and process each triplet as a test case.\n\nBut how to do that in Python?\n\nFor example, in Python, reading all lines:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nThen, for each i in range(0, len(lines), 3), take lines[i], lines[i+1], lines[i+2] as the guest, host, pile.\n\nBut then, how to handle if the number of lines is not a multiple of 3? Probably, the problem ensures that the input is correct.\n\nBut according to the problem's sample input, each test case is three lines. So the code should process each group of three lines as a test case.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. So perhaps that's a mistake. For example, perhaps the problem is from a programming competition where the input is multiple test cases, each with three lines.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, it's clear that the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nTherefore, the code should read all lines from input, group them into triplets, and for each triplet, process as guest, host, pile.\n\nSo, the code structure would be:\n\nRead all lines from input.\n\nFor each group of three consecutive lines:\n\n   guest = line1\n\n   host = line2\n\n   pile = line3\n\n   check if the combined letters of guest and host equals the pile's letters.\n\n   print YES or NO accordingly.\n\nBut how to read the input correctly?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, stripping any leading/trailing whitespace (like newlines). Then, process them in groups of three.\n\nNow, the problem says that each line is not empty. So, each line is non-empty.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n\n    lines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n\n    # process each group of three lines\n\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n\n        guest = lines[i]\n\n        host = lines[i+1]\n\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n\n        combined = guest + host\n\n        if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, what if there are not enough lines? Like, if len(lines) is not a multiple of 3? But the problem's sample input shows that each test case is three lines, and the input is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects that there is only one test case. Then, the code would read three lines, and process them once.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, which shows three test cases, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to reconcile this with the problem's input description?\n\nWell, perhaps the problem's input description is incorrect, and the actual input is multiple test cases. Because the sample shows that.\n\nBut how to proceed?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's input is three lines for each test case, and the code must read all test cases until the end of input.\n\nSo, the code will read all lines, group them into triplets, and process each triplet.\n\nBut in the sample input, the three test cases are given as three triplets. So the code would process them correctly.\n\nBut the problem's input description says that the input consists of three lines. Which is confusing.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows three test cases, perhaps the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nSo, proceeding with that approach.\n\nNow, the code needs to read all lines from stdin, group them into triplets, and process each triplet.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first test case's guest is 'SANTACLAUS', host is 'DEDMOROZ', pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nCombined guest + host is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' ?\n\nLet me check the length.\n\nLength of guest: len('SANTACLAUS') is 10 letters.\n\nHost: len('DEDMOROZ') is 8 letters. Total 18 letters.\n\nPile: len('SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS') is let's see: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → let's count letters. Well, perhaps the length is 18. Let me check:\n\nOriginal guest + host is 10 + 8 = 18 letters. The pile must also be 18 letters. Let's check the sample input's first pile: 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' → let's count letters. Let me see:\n\nSANTAMOROZ is 10 letters (S A N T A M O R O Z). Then DEDCLAUS is D E D C L A U S → 8 letters. Total 18. So yes. So the code would compare the counts.\n\nSo the code would check if the combined guest and host has the same count as the pile.\n\nNow, the code uses Counter from collections. But in Python, comparing two Counters (which are dictionaries) would check if they have the same key-value pairs.\n\nBut what about if a character is present in the combined string but not in the pile? Or vice versa? The Counter would catch that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the case when the combined string and the pile have the same length but different characters?\n\nFor example, guest is 'A', host is 'B', pile is 'AB' → yes. But if pile is 'AA', then the counts would differ.\n\nSo the code would correctly return NO.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about the case where the combined string and the pile have the same letters but different counts?\n\nYes, the Counter would catch that.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to write a Python script that reads input from stdin, processes each test case (group of three lines) and outputs YES or NO.\n\nBut how to handle the input correctly?\n\nIn Python, reading from stdin can be done with sys.stdin. However, sometimes when reading lines, trailing newlines are present. So using rstrip('\\n') or strip() may be necessary. However, the problem says that all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So, perhaps leading and trailing whitespaces are not present. So, perhaps using line.rstrip('\\n') is sufficient.\n\nBut in practice, when reading lines from stdin, each line includes a newline character. So, for example, if the input is:\n\nABC\n\nDEF\n\nGHIJK\n\nThen lines would be ['ABC', 'DEF', 'GHIJK'].\n\nBut when reading with sys.stdin, each line is read with the trailing newline. So using .rstrip('\\n') to remove the newline.\n\nBut in Python, the code can read lines as:\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n\nBut perhaps using splitlines() would be better. However, the code can proceed as such.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nguest = 'SANTACLAUS'\n\nhost = 'DEDMOROZ'\n\npile = 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'\n\nCombined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' → let's check the letters.\n\nThe pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nBut the combined string is guest + host: 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ'.\n\nLet me check if the letters are the same. Let's think of the counts.\n\nBut perhaps the code would compare the Counter correctly.\n\nSo, the code would return YES for the first test case.\n\nIn the second test case:\n\nguest is 'PAPAINOEL', host is 'JOULUPUKKI', pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'.\n\nCombined guest + host is 'PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI'.\n\nLet's count letters.\n\nLet me think:\n\nguest: PAPAINOEL → letters: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → counts: P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nhost: JOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → counts: J:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nP: 2+1=3?\n\nWait guest's P is 2, host's P is 1 → total 3.\n\nA: 2.\n\nI: 1+1=2.\n\nN: 1.\n\nO: 1+1=2.\n\nE: 1.\n\nL: 1+1=2.\n\nJ:1.\n\nU:3.\n\nK:2.\n\nPlus other letters.\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's count letters.\n\nBut perhaps the code can compare the counts. But according to the sample output, the answer is NO. Because the pile is missing a P and has an extra L.\n\nSo the code would detect that.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code must be written.\n\nBut in Python, the code needs to read all lines, group into triplets, and process each.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut what if the number of lines is not a multiple of 3? For example, if there are 4 lines. But according to the problem statement, the input is correct, so the code can assume that the number of lines is a multiple of 3.\n\nBut in practice, the code may crash if len(lines) is not a multiple of 3. However, the problem's sample input shows that each test case has three lines, so the code can proceed.\n\nBut in the problem's input description, it says that the input consists of three lines. Which would imply that there is only one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the problem's input description is wrong, and the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nNow, the code is written as above.\n\nBut let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nFirst test case:\n\nguest: SANTACLAUS\n\nhost: DEDMOROZ\n\npile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ → let's check the letters.\n\nThe pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → let's check if the counts are same.\n\nBut the code would compare the Counter of the combined string and the pile.\n\nYes, in this case, they are same. So output YES.\n\nSecond test case:\n\nguest: PAPAINOEL\n\nhost: JOULUPUKKI\n\npile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is guest + host: PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nguest: PAPAINOEL → letters:\n\nP:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1.\n\nhost: JOULUPUKKI → J:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts:\n\nP: 2 +1 = 3.\n\nA: 2.\n\nI: 1 +1 = 2.\n\nN: 1.\n\nO: 1 +1 = 2.\n\nE: 1.\n\nL: 1 +1 = 2.\n\nJ:1.\n\nU:3.\n\nK:2.\n\nPlus others.\n\nNow, the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's count:\n\nLet me break down the pile string: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me write all letters:\n\nJ, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nLet me count:\n\nJ:1\n\nO: 2 (positions 2 and 9)\n\nU: 3 (positions 3, 14, 15?)\n\nWait let's count:\n\nLetters:\n\nJ → 1\n\nO → appears in positions 2, 9 → 2 times.\n\nU → positions 3, 14, 15? Let me recheck:\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nBreaking into letters:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nSo:\n\nJ: 1\n\nO: 2 (positions 2 and 9)\n\nU: positions 3, 14, 15? Let's see:\n\nThe letters are:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nSo after breaking down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → count U's:\n\nAt position 3 (U), then later at position 14 (U?), then position 15 (U?), perhaps. Let me count:\n\nLooking at the letters:\n\nAfter J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I:\n\nThe U's are at index 2 (third letter?), then after that, the letters are:\n\n... L E L U P U ... So that's two more U's. So total U's is 3? Or 2?\n\nWait, let's count:\n\nOriginal pile string: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nBreaking down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I\n\nLet me count each letter:\n\nJ → 1\n\nO → 2 (positions 2 and 9)\n\nU → positions 3, 14, 15?\n\nWait, the letters after 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' are:\n\nBreaking down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → let's count U:\n\n- The third character is U (count 1).\n\nThen, after that, the letters are N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U (count 2), P, U (count 3), K, K, I.\n\nSo U appears three times.\n\nSo in the pile, U count is 3.\n\nIn the combined guest + host, the U count is 3 (from host's JOULUPUKKI, which has three U's).\n\nSo that's okay.\n\nNow, what about the P count?\n\nIn the combined guest + host: guest has 2 P's, host has 1 P → total 3.\n\nIn the pile, how many P's?\n\nLooking at the pile string:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → P appears at position 6 (the 'P' in 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI'?), and then again at position 14 (the 'P' before the U's?), let's see:\n\nLooking at the letters:\n\nAfter JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI:\n\nThe letters are:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → P occurs at position 6 (the 'P' in 'JOULNAPAO...') and then again at position 14 (the 'P' in '...LUPUKKI'?), so two P's? Or three?\n\nWait, the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I → the letters:\n\nLooking for P's:\n\nThe 6th character (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's think of the letters as a sequence.\n\nLet me write the letters:\n\n1. J\n2. O\n3. U\n4. L\n5. N\n6. A\n7. P\n8. A\n9. O\n10. I\n11. L\n12. E\n13. L\n14. U\n15. P\n16. U\n17. K\n18. K\n19. I\n\nSo the P's are at position 7 and 15 → two P's. But the combined guest + host has three P's. So the pile has two P's. Hence, the code would detect that, and output NO.\n\nWhich matches the sample output.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother sample input is the third case.\n\nThird test case:\n\nguest: BABBONATALE\n\nhost: FATHERCHRISTMAS\n\npile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nCombined guest + host is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS.\n\nLet's count letters.\n\nBut the pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nLet me check the counts.\n\nThe combined guest + host has:\n\nguest: BABBONATALE → letters B, A, B, B, O, N, A, T, A, L, E → counts:\n\nB: 3, A: 3, O:1, N:1, T:1, L:1, E:1.\n\nhost: FATHERCHRISTMAS → F, A, T, H, E, R, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S → counts:\n\nF:1, A:2, T:2, H:2, E:1, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1.\n\nTotal combined counts:\n\nB:3, A:3+2=5, O:1, N:1, T:1+2=3, L:1, E:1+1=2, F:1, H:2, R:2, C:1, I:1, S:2, M:1.\n\nNow, the pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nLet me count letters:\n\nLet me break it down into letters.\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R.\n\nWait, the pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nLet me write all letters:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R.\n\nCounting letters:\n\nB: 3 (positions 1, 2, 13?)\n\nC: 1.\n\nH: appears in positions 5, 22, 24? Let's count:\n\nLooking for H:\n\nIn the pile:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R.\n\nH occurs at position 5 (the 'H' in 'CHRISTMAS'), then later in 'FATHER' there is an H. Let's count:\n\nH: 2 times? Or 3?\n\nWait, the pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nBABCHRISTMAS → B A B C H R I S T M A S\n\nThen BONATALLE → B O N A T A L L E\n\nThen FATHER → F A T H E R.\n\nSo the H's are in the first part (CHRISTMAS) and in the FATHER part.\n\nSo H occurs once in CHRISTMAS (CHRISTMAS has H?), yes. In CHRISTMAS, the letters are C H R I S T M A S → yes, one H. Then in FATHER, there is H. So total two H's.\n\nBut in the combined guest + host, H count is 2 (from host's FATHERCHRISTMAS). So that's correct.\n\nBut what about the L's?\n\nIn the combined guest + host, L count is 1 (from guest's BABBONATALE).\n\nIn the pile, the letters have LL in BONATALLE, so two L's. Hence, the pile has two L's. Thus, the code would detect that, and output NO. Which matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, in Python, the code must be written. Also, note that in some cases, the code may have to read from stdin, and the lines may be read with trailing newlines. Using rstrip('\\n') is correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nWe need to import sys and Counter.\n\nBut in some cases, the code may have to read from stdin, and the lines may be read properly.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in the sample input, the lines are given as three lines per test case. So the code will process each triplet.\n\nNow, writing the code.\n\nAnother thing: the code must read from stdin. So, for example, in the sample input, the three test cases are provided as three lines each. So, for example, the code would read all lines, and process each group of three.\n\nThus, the code is as follows.\n\nBut the problem says that the code must read from stdin and print to stdout. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.rstrip() for line in sys.stdin]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in Python, when reading lines from stdin, using line.rstrip() removes all trailing whitespace, including newlines. However, in the problem statement, each line is not empty and contains only uppercase letters. So, the code should be correct.\n\nBut why not use line.rstrip('\\n')? Because sometimes, the line may have other whitespace, but according to the problem statement, the lines contain only uppercase letters. So, the code can safely use rstrip() to remove any trailing whitespace (like newlines).\n\nBut perhaps using line.rstrip('\\n') is better. Because, for example, if a line ends with a newline, then rstrip() would remove all trailing whitespace, which could include spaces. However, the problem says that the lines contain only uppercase letters and are not empty. So, the lines should not have any trailing whitespace. Thus, using line.rstrip('\\n') would be better, as it only removes the newline character, not any other whitespace.\n\nBut in practice, when reading lines from stdin using the for line in sys.stdin loop, each line includes the newline character. So, for example, if the input is \"ABC\\nDEF\\nGHI\", then the lines would be \"ABC\\n\", \"DEF\\n\", \"GHI\".\n\nUsing line.rstrip('\\n') would give \"ABC\", \"DEF\", \"GHI\".\n\nBut if the code uses line.rstrip(), then it would remove all trailing whitespace, which is safe.\n\nBut perhaps the correct way is to use line.rstrip('\\n').\n\nSo modifying the code:\n\nlines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n\nBut in Python, the code may be written as:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nBut the problem says that the lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So stripping any whitespace (like leading or trailing) would not affect the data. However, if the input lines have leading or trailing whitespace, which they shouldn't according to the problem statement, then the code would process them incorrectly. But according to the problem statement, the lines contain only uppercase letters. So, perhaps the code can safely use line.rstrip('\\n') to remove the newline, but leave any other whitespace (though there shouldn't be any).\n\nBut for safety, perhaps using line.rstrip('\\n') is better.\n\nBut in practice, the code may work with just line.rstrip().\n\nBut regardless, the code as written earlier should work.\n\nTesting with the sample input.\n\nAnother possible edge case is when the guest and host are empty. But the problem says that all lines are not empty.\n\nAnother edge case: when the pile is exactly the same as the combined guest + host.\n\nAnother case: when the pile is longer than the combined guest + host. Then, the code would return NO.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if the letters found in a pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of a guest and a host. The solution involves checking if the character counts of the combined names match exactly with the character counts of the pile.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of multiple test cases, each containing three lines: the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Character Count Comparison**: For each test case, concatenate the guest's and host's names into a single string. Then, compare the character count of this concatenated string with the character count of the pile using Python's `collections.Counter`.\n3. **Output Result**: If the character counts match, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.rstrip('\\n') for line in sys.stdin]\n    for i in range(0, len(lines), 3):\n        guest = lines[i]\n        host = lines[i+1]\n        pile = lines[i+2]\n        combined = guest + host\n        if Counter(combined) == Counter(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line, stripping the newline characters to ensure clean processing of each line.\n2. **Combining Names**: For each test case, the guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string.\n3. **Character Counting**: Using `collections.Counter`, we count the occurrences of each character in both the concatenated string and the pile. If these counts match, it means the pile can be rearranged to form the combined names of the guest and host.\n4. **Result Determination**: By comparing the character counts, we determine if the pile can be rearranged correctly, outputting \"YES\" or \"NO\" accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the exact match of characters required, leveraging Python's built-in data structures for simplicity and clarity.",
