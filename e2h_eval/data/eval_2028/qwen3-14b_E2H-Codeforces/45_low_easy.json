There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. And there's this rule that two players can only play each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. So the key is to figure out how to structure the tournament so that the winner plays as many games as possible. Let's think about examples.\n\nIn the sample input, when n=3, the output is 2. The winner plays two games. How does that work? Well, the first game is between two players, say 1 and 2. Winner (say 1) then plays against 3. But wait, the rule says that when two players play, their number of previous games can differ by at most one. So for the second game, player 1 has already played once, and player 3 hasn't played any. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. So the maximum is 2.\n\nBut for n=4, the output is 2. Wait, why can't the winner play 3 games? Because in a knockout tournament with 4 players, normally it's two rounds. The first round has two matches, then the winners play each other. So the winner plays two games. But maybe there's a way to arrange it so that the winner plays more?\n\nWait, but the problem says that the tournament is arranged in a way that follows the rule. So perhaps the arrangement of matches affects how many games the winner can play. For example, maybe the structure of the tournament needs to be such that each time the winner plays, they are matched against someone who has played a similar number of games.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible number of games the winner can play, given that the tournament is structured optimally under the constraints.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose the winner plays k games. Each time he plays, he must have a match where his opponent has either the same number of games as him, or one less. So, for the winner to play k games, he must have a path where each step he can find an opponent that meets the condition.\n\nAlternatively, think about the structure of the tournament. For the winner to play as many games as possible, each time he plays, he must have opponents that have played as many games as possible. But how?\n\nThis feels similar to building a binary tree. For example, in a standard knockout tournament, each player plays log2(n) games. But that's when the tournament is a perfect binary tree. However, when n isn't a power of two, some players get byes. But here, the structure is different because of the rule.\n\nWait, but the problem's rule seems to enforce that the tournament structure is such that the players' number of games is balanced. So perhaps the maximum number of games the winner can play is determined by the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to n? Or something like that?\n\nWait, let's think about the maximum number of games. Let's denote f(n) as the maximum number of games the winner can play. Let's try to find a recurrence relation for f(n).\n\nFor example, when the winner plays k games, he must have defeated k opponents. Each of those opponents must have been in a subtree where they had played up to (k-1) games. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a tree where each node represents a game. The winner's path is the longest possible path from the root to a leaf. But each time, the opponent must have a path length that's either equal or one less than the current player's path length.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is similar to finding the maximum depth of a tree where each node has two children, and the number of nodes in the tree is n. But I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of the minimal number of players required for the winner to play k games. Let's denote this as m(k). Then, for the winner to play k games, he must have played in each round against an opponent. For each of these games, the opponent must have played (k-1) games, (k-2) games, etc. Wait, perhaps this is similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nFor example:\n\nTo have a winner play 1 game, you need 2 players. So m(1) = 2.\n\nTo have a winner play 2 games: the first game, he plays against someone. Then, for the second game, he needs an opponent who has played 1 game (so that the difference is 1). That opponent would have had to play one game, which requires that they had another player. So, the total players needed would be 2 + 1 = 3? Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose the winner plays two games. The first game is against",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given the constraint that two players can only compete if the number of games they have already played differs by no more than one.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is to recognize that the problem can be modeled using a recursive approach similar to the Fibonacci sequence. The idea is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play by considering the minimum number of players required for each possible number of games. This leads us to a recursive relation where the number of players required for the winner to play `k` games is derived from the sum of players needed for the previous two possible game counts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef max_games(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return 0\n    # We need to find the largest k such that f(k) <= n\n    # Where f(k) is defined recursively as f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2)\n    # with base cases f(1) = 2, f(2) = 3\n    a, b = 2, 3\n    k = 1\n    while b <= n:\n        a, b = b, a + b\n        k += 1\n    return k - 1\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    print(max_games(n))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Recursive Insight**: The problem can be thought of in terms of the Fibonacci sequence. For the winner to play `k` games, the minimum number of players required follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n2. **Base Cases**: \n   - For 1 game, 2 players are needed.\n   - For 2 games, 3 players are needed.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from the base cases, we iteratively compute the minimum number of players required for increasing numbers of games until we exceed the given number of players `n`. The maximum number of games is then determined by how far we can go without exceeding `n`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the result using an iterative method, ensuring it handles very large values of `n` (up to 10^18) efficiently.",
