Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the task is to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies certain flow conditions. The main points are:\n\n1. For each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. That's like conservation of flow.\n2. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The directed graph should not have cycles. Oh right, so the directed graph must be acyclic.\n\nHmm. Also, we're given the flow values for each edge, and we need to assign directions such that the flow is a valid maximum flow. But how do we approach this?\n\nFirst, I think we need to model this as a flow network where each edge's capacity is given, but the direction is to be determined. However, the problem states that the flow is already a maximum flow, but we just need to assign directions. Wait, no, the problem says that Emuskald's algorithm gives the flow volume for each edge but not the direction. Our job is to find the direction so that the flow is correct and maximum.\n\nBut how do we ensure that the direction assignment leads to a valid flow? Well, the flow conditions are that for every vertex except source and sink, inflow equals outflow. Also, the source has all edges outgoing (no incoming), and the sink has all edges incoming (or maybe not, but the sink can have outgoing edges as long as the flow is conserved? No, because the sink is the destination. Wait, the problem says that the source is vertex 1 and the sink is vertex n. So for the sink, there's no requirement on the inflow and outflow. Wait, no: the problem says that for each vertex v where 1 < v < n, the sum of incoming equals sum of outgoing. So the sink (vertex n) can have any inflow and outflow, but since it's the sink, perhaps the total outflow is zero? Or maybe not. Wait, the problem says that the flow should be a correct maximum flow. So the standard max flow conditions would apply: the source's outflow is equal to the sink's inflow, and all other nodes have conservation of flow. But in our case, the problem's conditions only require that for vertices between 1 and n, the inflow equals outflow. So for vertex n, there's no such condition. But the way the flow is structured, the sink's inflow would be the total max flow value, and outflow would be zero (assuming that the flow is properly directed). But maybe the problem allows for some outflow from the sink? Hmm, but the problem says that the flow must be a correct maximum flow. So the standard flow conditions must hold. Therefore, the sink's outflow must be zero. But how do we model that?\n\nWait, but the problem's note says that the given flow is a maximum flow. So the flow values ci are already such that they form a valid maximum flow. Our job is to assign directions to the edges so that the flow is valid. So the flow values are fixed, and we need to assign directions such that the flow is valid.\n\nSo the problem reduces to assigning directions to edges such that:\n\n- For each node except source and sink, the sum of the flows on incoming edges equals the sum of flows on outgoing edges.\n- Source has no incoming edges.\n- The directed graph is acyclic.\n\nNow, how to model this? Let's think about the flow conservation. For each node except source and sink, the net flow (outgoing minus incoming) is zero. But since the flow is directed, for each edge, if it's directed from u to v, then the flow contributes +ci to u's outflow and -ci to its inflow. Wait, no: the inflow for a node is the sum of flows on edges directed into it. Outflow is sum of flows on edges directed out of it. For conservation, inflow equals outflow. So for each node v (not source or sink), sum of flows on incoming edges = sum on outgoing edges. Which implies that the total flow leaving v is equal to the total flow entering it. Therefore, the net flow (outflow - inflow) is zero.\n\nBut the source's outflow is the total flow (since it's the source), and the sink's inflow is the same. The source's inflow is zero, and the sink's outflow is zero.\n\nSo the problem is to assign directions to edges such that these conditions are met, and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nNow, how to model this? One approach is to think of the directed graph as a DAG (directed acyclic graph) with the given flow constraints.\n\nBut how to assign directions? Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow conservation holds. But how?\n\nAnother thought: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each edge, the direction is from the node that comes earlier in the topological order to the one that comes later. But how to find such a topological order that also satisfies the flow conservation conditions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a flow problem where we need to assign directions to edges, which can be thought of as choosing for each edge whether it's contributing to the outflow of one node and inflow of another. Then, for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on outgoing edges must equal the sum on incoming edges. Wait, but that's equivalent to the total outflow equals the total inflow, which is the same as the net outflow being zero.\n\nLet me think of this as a system of equations. For each node v (not source or sink), sum over all edges incident to v of (direction * ci) equals zero. Wait, maybe not. Let me rephrase:\n\nEach edge (u, v) can be directed as u→v or v→u. Let's say for each edge, we choose a direction. Then, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of all flows on edges directed out of v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed into v. Let me denote for each node v, the total outflow is O_v and inflow is I_v. Then O_v = I_v. Also, for the source, I_1 = 0, and for the sink, O_n can be anything (but in reality, O_n is zero since it's the sink).\n\nBut how to compute the directions? Maybe we can model this as a flow network where each edge's direction is determined by the flow. But perhaps there's a way to model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is determined by some properties of the nodes.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Let's consider that the directed graph must be a DAG, so we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Then, for each node, all edges that are directed towards it come from nodes earlier in the order, and edges directed away go to nodes later in the order. Now, considering that, perhaps we can construct a directed graph where the nodes are ordered such that the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nBut how to find such an order? Alternatively, think of the flow as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has balance zero. So, for each node, the total flow going out equals the total flow coming in. But how to model that.\n\nAnother approach: For each node v (excluding source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. So, for each node v, the sum of flows on edges adjacent to v, multiplied by the direction (either +1 or -1), must be zero. Wait, more precisely, for each edge adjacent to v, if the edge is directed away from v, it contributes +ci to the outflow, and if directed towards v, it contributes -ci to the outflow. The total outflow for v is sum of (directions) * ci. For the node to have outflow equal to inflow, the total outflow must be equal to the total inflow. Which implies that the total outflow is equal to the total inflow. But since the outflow is equal to the inflow, the total outflow is equal to (sum of all flows on edges adjacent to v) / 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each node v, the total outflow is equal to the total inflow. Therefore, the total outflow is equal to the total inflow. Which means that the total outflow is equal to the total inflow, so the sum of all flows on edges adjacent to v is equal to twice the outflow. But since the sum of all flows on edges adjacent to v is fixed (each edge is counted once for each endpoint), but the direction determines how it's split between outflow and inflow.\n\nWait, let's take an example. Suppose a node v is connected to edges with flows c1, c2, c3. Then, for each edge, if it is directed away from v, then it contributes c to the outflow. If directed towards v, it contributes c to the inflow. So, the outflow is sum of (edges directed away from v) and the inflow is sum of (edges directed towards v). For the node to have outflow equal to inflow, the sum of edges directed away from v must equal the sum of edges directed towards v. Therefore, the total sum of all flows adjacent to v must be even? Because sum_out = sum_in => sum_out = sum_in = total_sum / 2. But the problem says that the input is such that a solution exists, so this must be satisfied.\n\nSo for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of all flows on edges adjacent to v must be even. But the problem says that the input is guaranteed to have a solution, so that's not something we need to check.\n\nSo, the key is to find for each edge a direction such that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from it equals the sum of flows directed towards it.\n\nBut how to find such directions?\n\nAnother thought: For each node v (except source and sink), the net flow (outflow - inflow) must be zero. But the net flow is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed away from v minus the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. Which is equal to (sum_out - sum_in) = 0. But since sum_out + sum_in = total_flow_adjacent_to_v, then sum_out = sum_in = total_flow_adjacent_to_v / 2. So, for each such node, the sum of flows on edges adjacent to it must be even. Which again, the problem says is guaranteed.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to assigning directions to edges such that for each non-source/sink node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it is exactly half of the total adjacent flow. And also, the directed graph is acyclic, and source has no incoming edges.\n\nNow, how to model this? Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where for each node, we need to have the sum of outgoing flows equal to half of the total adjacent flows. How can we compute this?\n\nThis seems similar to an Eulerian trail problem, but perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of zero, and the source has a balance of -total_flow (since all edges are outgoing), and the sink has a balance of +total_flow (all edges incoming). But how to model that?\n\nWait, in the standard flow problem, the source has a net outflow equal to the total flow, and the sink has a net inflow equal to the total flow. All other nodes have zero net flow. So, if we think of the direction of edges as determining the flow, then for each edge, the direction determines which node's outflow it contributes to. So, for the entire graph, the sum of all flows on edges directed away from the source must be the total flow value, and similarly for the sink.\n\nBut how to find the direction of edges to satisfy this?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow conservation holds. Then, the problem becomes similar to finding an orientation of the edges that makes the graph a DAG with the required flow properties.\n\nBut how to construct such an orientation?\n\nAn idea comes to mind: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Let's suppose that we have a topological order where the source is first, then the sink is last. Then, for each node in the order, we can direct edges to nodes that come after it. But how does this help with the flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the nodes are arranged in a DAG, and for each node, the sum of flows on outgoing edges equals the sum of flows on incoming edges. This seems complex.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the nodes are in a DAG, and for each node except the source and sink, the net outflow is zero. How can we construct such a graph?\n\nAnother thought: Since the graph must be acyclic, we can assign a potential (like a level) to each node such that all edges go from lower levels to higher levels. Then, the direction of each edge is determined by the difference in potentials. But how to choose the potentials to satisfy the flow conservation?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we assign to each node v a value p(v). For each edge (u, v), we direct it from u to v if p(u) < p(v), and from v to u otherwise. Then, the directed graph is acyclic if the potentials are assigned in such a way that there are no cycles. For example, if the potentials are unique and ordered in a way that forms a DAG.\n\nBut how to choose the potentials so that the flow conservation holds?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a flow problem where each edge's direction is determined by the flow. For example, if we imagine that the flow is directed along the edges in such a way that the flow conservation holds. But how?\n\nWait, here's an alternative approach. Let's think of the problem as building a directed graph that is a DAG and satisfies the flow conservation conditions. Let's imagine that the DAG is built by performing a BFS or DFS traversal, directing edges away from the source. However, this might not satisfy the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as constructing a directed tree structure where each node's flow is balanced. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Let's say the order is v1, v2, ..., vn, where v1 is the source (vertex 1), and vn is the sink (vertex n). For each node vi (i from 2 to n-1), we need to ensure that the sum of flows on edges directed away from vi equals the sum of flows directed into vi. How to do this?\n\nSuppose we process the nodes in the topological order. For each node, we can adjust the directions of the edges connected to it to satisfy the flow conservation. But how?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Find a topological order of the nodes. However, the order is not known yet, and depends on the direction of edges.\n\nThis seems like a chicken-and-egg problem.\n\nAlternative plan: Let's model the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG, and for each node (except source and sink), the sum of outgoing flows equals the sum of incoming flows.\n\nTo achieve this, perhaps we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the source, and direct edges in the direction of traversal. But how to ensure flow conservation?\n\nWait, here's a possible approach inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be a DAG. We can construct a directed tree where the source is the root, and the edges are directed away from the root. However, this may not account for all edges, especially those that are not part of the tree.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a DAG where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of zero. This seems similar to an Eulerian orientation, but in a DAG.\n\nWait, in an undirected graph, an Eulerian orientation is one where each node has equal in-degree and out-degree. But this is for an Eulerian trail. However, in our problem, the flow conservation requires that the sum of flows on outgoing edges equals the sum of incoming edges for each node (except source and sink). So, for each such node, the sum of flows on outgoing edges is equal to the sum of flows on incoming edges. Which is equivalent to saying that the total flow through the node is balanced.\n\nSo, if we think of each edge as having a certain flow, and we need to direct them such that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on outgoing edges equals the sum on incoming edges.\n\nThis seems similar to an Eulerian orientation, but with weights. How can we find such an orientation?\n\nIn the Eulerian orientation problem, each edge is directed such that for every node, the in-degree equals the out-degree. But here, it's weighted, and for each node, the sum of the weights on outgoing edges equals the sum on incoming edges.\n\nSo, for each node v (not source or sink), sum_{e outgoing} c_e = sum_{e incoming} c_e. Which implies that sum_{e adjacent} c_e = 2 * sum_{e outgoing} c_e. Therefore, for each such node, the sum of all adjacent flows must be even, which the problem guarantees.\n\nSo, how to find such an orientation?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph with certain constraints. But how?\n\nLet me think of it as a system of equations. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of the flows on edges directed away from v is equal to half the sum of all adjacent flows. So, for each such node, we need to select a subset of edges adjacent to it, with total flow equal to half of the sum of all adjacent flows.\n\nBut how to do this for all nodes simultaneously?\n\nThis feels like a flow problem again, but perhaps we can model it as a graph where we need to assign directions to edges such that the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nAnother idea: For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v must be exactly half of the total adjacent flow. Let's denote this value as S_v. So, for each such node, we have to choose edges to direct away from v such that their sum is S_v.\n\nBut how to do this globally for all nodes?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. For example, we could start with the source node and direct all edges away from it. Then, for other nodes, we adjust the direction of edges to balance the flow.\n\nBut how to ensure that this leads to a DAG?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG, and for each node (except source and sink), the sum of outgoing flows equals the sum of incoming flows.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of zero. To achieve this, we can perform a BFS or DFS traversal, and for each node, direct edges in a way that balances the flow. However, I'm not sure how to implement this.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed according to a potential function. For example, assign each node a potential value, and for each edge, direct it from the node with lower potential to the one with higher potential. This ensures that the directed graph is acyclic if the potentials are distinct. But how to choose potentials so that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nLet me think. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v must equal the sum of flows directed towards v. Let's assume that the potentials are assigned such that for each edge (u, v), the direction is from u to v if potential[u] < potential[v], else from v to u. Then, for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed away from v is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. How can this be achieved?\n\nThis seems challenging, but perhaps there's a way to model this as a system of equations. For example, the potential differences could be related to the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a flow network where each edge's direction is determined by the flow. For example, if we imagine that the flow is directed along the edges in a way that creates a DAG. But I'm not making progress here.\n\nLet me look for hints in the example provided.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n3 3\n\nEdges:\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nThe output directions are 1, 0, 1. So the edges are directed as follows:\n\nOriginal edges:\n\nEdge 1: 3-2, direction is 1 → meaning from 2 to 3 (since original is ai=3, bi=2, direction 1 would be bi→ai, i.e., 2→3).\n\nEdge 2: 1-2, direction 0 → ai→bi: 1→2.\n\nEdge 3: 3-1, direction 1 → bi→ai: 1→3.\n\nSo the directed edges are:\n\n1→2, 2→3, 1→3.\n\nNow, checking flow conservation:\n\nFor node 2 (which is between 1 and 3):\n\nIncoming edges: 1→2 (10), outgoing edges: 2→3 (10). Sum incoming is 10, sum outgoing is 10. Balanced.\n\nNode 1 has no incoming edges. Node 3 is the sink.\n\nThe directed graph is 1→2→3 and 1→3. It's a DAG.\n\nSo the directions are chosen such that the flow conservation holds, and the graph is acyclic.\n\nAnother example is given, but I think the idea is to find a way to assign directions that form a DAG and satisfy the flow conditions.\n\nNow, thinking about the DAG property. Since the directed graph must be acyclic, it must have a topological order. So, if we can find a topological order and assign directions accordingly, perhaps we can satisfy the flow conditions.\n\nLet me think: Suppose we arrange the nodes in a topological order. For each node, all edges from it go to nodes that come later in the order. Then, the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nNow, for each node v (not source or sink), we need to have the sum of flows on outgoing edges equal to the sum on incoming edges. How can we ensure this when arranging the nodes in a topological order?\n\nPerhaps during the construction of the topological order, we can assign directions based on the flow conservation.\n\nLet me think of the following algorithm:\n\n- Start with the source node (vertex 1) as the first in the topological order.\n\n- For each node in the topological order, process its edges to unprocessed nodes, directing them in a way that helps balance the flow.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has a balance of zero. This is similar to an Eulerian circuit, but in a directed graph. However, in our case, the graph is undirected and we need to assign directions.\n\nBut how to model this. Let me think of the following:\n\nFor each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges adjacent to v is even. Let's call this sum T_v. Then, the required outflow for v is T_v / 2.\n\nSo, for each node v (not source or sink), we need to select a subset of its edges whose total flow is T_v / 2, and direct them away from v. The remaining edges will be directed towards v.\n\nNow, the question is how to choose these subsets for all nodes simultaneously.\n\nThis sounds like a problem of finding an orientation of the edges that satisfies the flow conservation. This seems similar to a flow decomposition, but I'm not sure.\n\nBut how can this be done? One approach is to model this as a flow network where each node has a demand of T_v / 2, and we need to find a flow that satisfies this demand. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: For each node v (not source or sink), we can model the problem as needing to send T_v / 2 units of flow out of it. But how to model this with the existing edges.\n\nWait, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where we want to find an orientation of the edges such that for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on outgoing edges is T_v / 2. Then, the problem becomes finding such an orientation.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved using a modified DFS or BFS approach. For example, we can start with the source and propagate the necessary flows through the graph.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Compute for each node v (not source or sink) the required outflow, which is T_v / 2. Let's call this value required_out[v].\n\nFor the source, the required_out is the sum of all flows on its edges, since all edges are directed away from it. Similarly, for the sink, required_out is zero (since all edges are directed towards it).\n\nWait, but the sink is not required to have any flow conservation. However, the total outflow from the source must equal the total inflow to the sink. So, the sum of flows on edges directed away from the source equals the sum of flows on edges directed towards the sink.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me try to think of this as a flow problem. Imagine that each edge has a capacity equal to its flow value, and we need to find a flow that satisfies the demands for each node. For example, the source has a supply of total_flow, and the sink has a demand of total_flow. All other nodes have zero supply or demand.\n\nBut how does this relate to the direction of the edges?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed such that the flow conservation holds. For example, for each node v (not source or sink), the net flow (outflow minus inflow) is zero. The source has net outflow equal to the total flow, and the sink has net inflow equal to the total flow.\n\nBut how to find such a flow. Well, this is exactly the standard maximum flow problem. However, the problem says that the flow values are already given and we need to assign directions to the edges. So the flow is already determined, and we need to find the direction of the edges that corresponds to this flow.\n\nAh! That's a crucial insight. The flow values are already given, and we need to assign directions to the edges such that the flow is valid. This is essentially finding a feasible flow in the directed graph, given that the flow values are fixed.\n\nBut how to determine the direction of the edges. For each edge, the flow can be in either direction, but the sum of flows must satisfy the conservation laws.\n\nWait, but the flow values are already given as ci for each edge. So, the flow is fixed. The problem is to assign directions to the edges such that the flow is valid. So, the flow is already determined, and the direction of each edge must be such that the flow is directed along the edge. \n\nBut how to ensure that the flow is valid. For example, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v.\n\nThis is equivalent to saying that for each such node, the net flow (outflow - inflow) is zero.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding a direction for each edge such that the flow is valid. This is essentially the same as finding a flow decomposition, where the flow is directed along the edges. \n\nBut how to find such directions? Well, since the flow is already given, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the flow is the given ci, and the direction is such that the flow is valid. \n\nBut how to find this direction. One way is to construct a directed graph that represents the flow. This can be done by building a directed graph where for each edge, the direction is determined by the flow's direction. But how?\n\nWait, the flow is a valid maximum flow. So, the flow must be such that for each edge, the flow is either in one direction or the other. But since the flow is given as ci for each edge, we need to assign directions to the edges so that the flow is valid.\n\nBut how to determine the direction of each edge. Perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is determined by the flow's contribution to the node's balance.\n\nLet me think of it this way: For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed away from v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed towards v. So, for each node v, we can calculate the required outflow as (sum of flows on adjacent edges) / 2. \n\nNow, the problem becomes assigning directions to edges so that for each node, the sum of flows on outgoing edges is equal to this required outflow. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. For example, we can build a directed graph by traversing the nodes and adjusting the directions of edges to satisfy the required outflow.\n\nHere's an idea inspired by the BFS approach:\n\n1. Start with the source node (node 1). All edges connected to it must be directed away from it (since it has no incoming edges). This contributes to the outflow of the source.\n\n2. For each node processed, we can calculate how much more outflow is needed, and direct edges accordingly.\n\nLet me elaborate. For each node, we can track the current outflow. Initially, for the source, all edges are directed away, so the outflow is sum of all flows on edges connected to it. For other nodes, we need to ensure that their outflow equals the required value.\n\nBut how to do this. Let's think of the following steps:\n\n- For each node, calculate the required outflow (required_out[v] = sum of flows on edges adjacent to v) / 2.\n\n- For the source, required_out is sum of flows on edges adjacent to it. For the sink, required_out is zero (since all edges are directed towards it).\n\n- Initialize a variable for each node to track the current outflow. Initially, for the source, the current_outflow is zero. Then, we direct edges away from the source, adding their flows to the current_outflow of the source.\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let's think of the following algorithm:\n\nWe can model this as a directed graph where we process nodes in a certain order, and for each node, we direct the edges to unprocessed nodes in a way that helps balance the outflow.\n\nFor example, let's use a BFS-like approach:\n\n- Start with the source node (node 1). All edges connected to it are directed away from it. For each such edge (u, v), if v is not processed yet, we add it to the queue and process it next. \n\n- For each node being processed, we calculate the required outflow. The current outflow for the node is the sum of flows on edges directed away from it. We need to direct additional edges to reach the required outflow.\n\n- For each edge connected to this node that hasn't been directed yet, we decide its direction based on whether it helps to reach the required outflow.\n\nBut how to decide this direction. For example, if the current outflow of the node is less than the required outflow, we can direct the edge away from the node. Otherwise, we direct it towards the node.\n\nBut this might not work directly because directing an edge away from a node affects the outflow of both nodes involved. However, since we're processing nodes in a certain order, perhaps we can manage this.\n\nLet's try to formalize this:\n\nInitialize for each node, the current_outflow as 0.\n\nFor the source node (node 1), we direct all edges away from it. For each edge (u, v), if u is the source, we direct it as u→v. This adds ci to the current_outflow of the source. \n\nThen, for each node v that is connected to the source, we add them to a queue for processing.\n\nNow, for each node v processed from the queue:\n\n- Calculate the required outflow for v: required_out = total_adjacent_flows[v] / 2.\n\n- The current_outflow for v is the sum of flows on edges directed away from v so far.\n\n- For each edge connected to v that hasn't been directed yet, we need to decide its direction.\n\nLet's say the edge connects v to w. If w has not been processed yet, we can direct the edge from v to w. This increases the current_outflow of v by ci, and decreases the required_outflow of w by ci (since this flow is now directed away from v and into w, contributing to w's inflow).\n\nBut wait, for node w, when it is processed, its required_outflow is determined based on its adjacent edges. So, directing an edge from v to w adds ci to v's current_outflow and adds ci to w's inflow. But for w, when it is processed, its current_outflow starts at zero, and we need to direct edges to reach required_outflow.\n\nThis seems complex. However, perhaps this approach can work if we process nodes in a way that allows us to adjust the directions of edges connected to them.\n\nLet me think through an example. Take the first sample input:\n\nNodes are 1, 2, 3. Edges:\n\n3-2 (10), 1-2 (10), 3-1 (5).\n\nFor node 1, the adjacent flows are 10 (from 1-2) and 5 (from 3-1). Total_adjacent_flows[1] = 15. required_out[1] = 15/2? No, wait, node 1 is the source, so it doesn't need to have required_out equal to half of its adjacent flows. Wait, earlier analysis said that for nodes other than source and sink, required_out is half of their adjacent flows. For the source and sink, this isn't applicable.\n\nAh, right! For the source, all edges must be directed away from it. So, the current_outflow for the source is the sum of all flows on its edges. For the sink, all edges must be directed towards it, but this is not enforced by the algorithm. However, the sink's required_out is zero, but since it's the sink, it's allowed to have any inflow and outflow as long as the flow conservation holds for other nodes.\n\nSo, for the source, we direct all edges away from it. For the sink, we don't process it in the BFS, but the algorithm will handle it automatically.\n\nLet's continue with the example. For node 1, we direct both edges away. So:\n\nEdge 1-2 is directed 1→2 (contribution to current_outflow of 1 is 10).\n\nEdge 3-1 is directed 1→3 (contribution to current_outflow of 1 is 5). So total current_outflow of 1 is 15, which is the sum of its adjacent flows. This is correct, as the source's outflow is the total flow.\n\nNow, process node 2 and node 3. Let's say we start with node 2.\n\nFor node 2, adjacent flows are 10 (from 1-2) and 10 (from 3-2). Total_adjacent_flows[2] = 20. required_out[2] = 10. Current_outflow for node 2 is initially 0 (since the edge from 1-2 is directed away from 1, not from 2. Wait, no. The edge 1-2 is directed from 1 to 2. So for node 2, this edge is incoming. So the current_outflow of node 2 is 0. \n\nNow, node 2 has edges to 1 and to 3. The edge to 1 is already directed (from 1 to 2), so it's incoming. The edge to 3 is undirected yet. We need to decide its direction.\n\nThe required_out for node 2 is 10. Currently, current_outflow is 0. We need to increase it by 10. The only available edge is to node 3. So we direct it from 2 to 3. This adds 10 to current_outflow of node 2, making it 10, which matches required_out. \n\nNow, node 2 is processed. Next, process node 3.\n\nFor node 3, adjacent flows are 10 (from 3-2) and 5 (from 3-1). Total_adjacent_flows[3] = 15. But since it's the sink, we don't need to balance its outflow. However, the required_out for node 3 would be 15/2 = 7.5, which is not possible. But the problem states that the solution exists, which suggests that the sink's adjacent flows must be such that it's allowed to have unbalanced flows. \n\nWait, but the sink's adjacent flows may not be even. But the problem says that the solution exists. So, perhaps for the sink, the required_out is not enforced. \n\nSo, for node 3, the edges are:\n\n- Edge 3-2 directed as 2→3 (so for node 3, it's incoming, contributing 10 to its inflow).\n\n- Edge 3-1 directed as 1→3 (incoming, contributing 5 to its inflow).\n\nSo, the total inflow to node 3 is 15. Since it's the sink, there's no requirement on its outflow. \n\nThus, this",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conditions. The key requirements are that the flow conservation holds for all vertices except the source and sink, the source has no incoming edges, and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Flow Conservation**: For each vertex (except the source and sink), the sum of flows on incoming edges must equal the sum of flows on outgoing edges.\n2. **Acyclic Graph**: The directed graph must be acyclic, which can be achieved by ensuring a topological order where edges are directed from earlier nodes to later nodes in the order.\n3. **Greedy BFS Traversal**: We use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach starting from the source vertex.
