The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The problem is about calculating the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what configurations of towers allow such an assignment. Let's think about the conditions required for the towers.\n\nThe key points are:\n\n1. Towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower's signal. So, for any tower, its signal power can't reach beyond town 0 or n+1. For example, a tower at position i must have a power p such that i - p > 0 (since |0 - i| = i < p would mean that town 0 is covered). Wait, no: the signal reaches cities c where |c - i| < p. So for town 0 to not be covered by tower i, we need that |0 - i| >= p. Which implies that p <= i. Similarly, for town n+1, the tower's position i must have p <= (n+1 - i). Because |(n+1) - i| = n+1 -i < p would mean town n+1 is covered. So to prevent that, p must be <= (n+1 - i).\n\nBut when choosing the signal powers, the main thing is that the coverage of the towers must exactly cover towns 1..n, each exactly once.\n\nSo, how can we model the valid tower configurations?\n\nLet me think of the possible tower placements. For each tower configuration, there must be a way to assign signal powers such that:\n\n- Each town 1..n is covered exactly once.\n- Towns 0 and n+1 are not covered.\n\nThis seems similar to some kind of tiling or interval covering problem. Let's think of the towers as being arranged in a way that allows them to cover the towns without overlapping.\n\nAn important observation here is that each tower's coverage must be such that it covers a range of towns, and these ranges don't overlap. But since each town must be covered exactly once, the ranges must partition the towns 1..n.\n\nBut how does the tower's position and signal power relate to this? For example, if there's a tower at position i, then the maximum range it can cover is from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1), but since the signal power p must be chosen such that the coverage doesn't reach town 0 or n+1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each tower must cover a certain interval, and these intervals form a partition of [1..n], with the constraints that each interval is covered by exactly one tower.\n\nWait, but the tower's coverage can be adjusted by the signal power. For instance, a tower at position i can choose to cover a range [a, b] as long as a >= i - (p-1) and b <= i + (p-1), but with p being chosen such that the coverage doesn't reach 0 or n+1.\n\nBut perhaps there's a more straightforward way to model the valid configurations. Let's think about the necessary conditions for the towers.\n\nFor a configuration of towers to be valid, there must be a way to assign to each tower a range of towns that it covers, such that:\n\n- Each town is covered exactly once.\n- The ranges don't extend beyond the allowed boundaries (so for a tower at i, the leftmost town it covers must be >=1, and the rightmost must be <=n).\n- Also, the ranges must be such that the tower's coverage is exactly those towns.\n\nBut how can we model this? Maybe the towers must form a structure where each tower is responsible for covering a certain segment, and these segments are non-overlapping and cover all towns.\n\nThis reminds me of the problem where you have to arrange dominoes or something similar, but here it's more flexible because each tower can cover a range of varying lengths.\n\nAnother thought: For the coverage to be exactly once per town, the towers must be placed in such a way that they can be paired with ranges that form a partition of [1..n]. Let's think of the towers as being placed in positions such that between any two consecutive towers, there's a certain structure.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the towers must be arranged in a way that they can be assigned ranges such that each tower's range starts at some position and ends at another, and these ranges are non-overlapping and cover everything.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: For each tower, the signal power must be such that it covers exactly a certain set of towns. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that for a valid configuration, the towers must be placed in such a way that there's a way to assign to each tower a radius (signal power) so that the coverage is exactly the towns in their assigned segment. \n\nLet me think of the minimal case. For example, when n=2. The valid configuration is when both towns 1 and 2 have towers. Then, each can have power 1, covering only themselves. That's the only valid case. So the probability is 1/4, which matches the sample input.\n\nAnother example for n=3. The sample says the answer is 1/4. According to the note, this comes from two possibilities: either all three towns have towers (probability 1/8) and each has power 1, or only town 2 has a tower (prob 1/8) with power 2. So total 2/8 = 1/4.\n\nSo the valid configurations are those where the towers can be arranged in a way that each tower's coverage is a contiguous block, and these blocks are non-overlapping and cover all towns.\n\nBut how can we model this for general n?\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose we have a valid configuration for a certain arrangement. Let's imagine that the first tower (the leftmost tower) is at position i. Then, this tower must cover some range from 1 up to some position j, and then the rest of the problem reduces to solving for the remaining positions from j+1 to n.\n\nBut how can this tower cover from 1 to j? Well, the tower is at position i. The signal power must be such that the coverage includes 1 and j. The maximum distance from i to j is j - i. Since the signal power p must satisfy that |c - i| < p for all c in the coverage. So, for the coverage to include 1 and j, the tower's power p must be larger than max(i - 1, j - i). But also, since the tower's coverage cannot reach town 0, the power p must be <= i (since |0 - i| = i < p would imply that town 0 is covered. So to avoid that, p must be <= i. Similarly, the coverage cannot reach town n+1, so p must be <= (n+1 - i).\n\nBut in the case where the tower covers from 1 to j, the maximum distance from i is max(i-1, j - i). So the power must be at least max(i-1, j - i) + 1. But since p must be <= i (to avoid covering town 0), we have:\n\nmax(i-1, j - i) + 1 <= i → max(i-1, j - i) <= i - 1.\n\nWhich implies that j - i <= i - 1 → j <= 2i -1.\n\nBut since the tower is at position i, and the coverage must end at j, which is <= 2i -1. Also, the coverage must start at 1, which requires that i - (p-1) <= 1. Since p is the signal power. Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, for the tower at position i to cover from 1 to j, the maximum distance from i to 1 is i - 1, and to j is j - i. So the signal power p must be at least the maximum of these two values plus 1? Or wait, the signal power p must be such that all towns in the range are covered. For example, if the tower is at i and covers towns from a to b, then for every town c in [a, b], |c -i| < p. The maximum |c -i| in this range is max(i -a, b -i). Therefore, p must be at least max(i -a, b -i) + 1. But since p can be any integer as long as it's at least that value. However, since we can choose p, the minimal p is max(i -a, b -i) + 1, but higher values are allowed. However, the choice of p must also not cause the tower's signal to reach town 0 or n+1.\n\nBut for the purposes of checking whether a configuration is valid, we can choose p appropriately. So the question becomes: for a given set of towers, can we partition the towns 1..n into intervals, each assigned to a tower, such that for each interval [a, b] assigned to a tower at position i, the following holds:\n\n- i is in [a, b], since the tower must be in the interval it covers (otherwise, how would it cover it?)\n\nWait, no. The tower is located in town i. So the coverage can be any interval that includes i. For example, if the tower is at i, then the coverage could be from a to b, where a ≤ i ≤ b. But for the coverage to include a and b, the signal power must be sufficient.\n\nBut for the problem, the tower's coverage must be exactly the towns in [a, b], and each town is covered exactly once.\n\nSo, perhaps the key is that the towers must be arranged in such a way that they can be partitioned into intervals where each interval is covered by exactly one tower, and for each such interval, the tower is positioned in a way that allows it to cover that interval without extending beyond the boundaries.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of tiling with certain constraints.\n\nLet me think about the structure of such a configuration. For example, suppose that the towers are placed in positions such that they form a sequence where each tower covers a certain range, and the next tower starts after the previous one's coverage ends.\n\nIn particular, for a tower at position i, if it covers from a to b, then the next tower must be placed at a position greater than b. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire coverage as a set of non-overlapping intervals, each assigned to a tower, and covering all towns 1..n. Each such interval must have a tower in it. Moreover, for each interval [a, b] assigned to a tower at position i, the following must hold:\n\n- The tower i must be in [a, b], and the coverage must include all towns from a to b. Also, the coverage must not reach 0 or n+1.\n\nBut how can we model this? For each interval [a, b], the tower i must be such that:\n\n- The signal power can be set to cover exactly [a, b]. For that, the maximum distance from i to a or b must be less than p. So, p must be at least max(i - a, b - i) + 1. But also, since the coverage can't reach town 0, we have that i - p + 1 ≥ 1 (since the coverage starts at a ≥ 1). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the tower's coverage for [a, b] must not reach town 0. The coverage is [i - (p-1), i + (p-1)] (since |c - i| < p implies c is between i - (p-1) and i + (p-1)). So for the coverage not to reach 0, we need that i - (p-1) ≥ 1 → p-1 ≤ i - 1 → p ≤ i. Similarly, for coverage not to reach n+1, i + (p-1) ≤ n → p-1 ≤ n -i → p ≤ n -i + 1. But since p can be chosen, as long as the required p for covering [a, b] is within these bounds.\n\nBut for the interval [a, b], the required p must be at least (b - i) + 1 (if b is to the right of i), or (i - a) + 1 (if a is to the left of i). So, the minimal p for covering [a, b] is max(b - i, i - a) + 1. And this must be ≤ min(i, n - i + 1). \n\nBut since we can choose p as needed, perhaps the condition for the interval [a, b] to be covered by the tower at i is that:\n\nmax(b - i, i - a) + 1 ≤ min(i, n - i + 1).\n\nBut how does this translate into constraints on a, b, and i?\n\nAlternatively, for the tower at i to cover [a, b], the following must hold:\n\n- i - (p-1) ≤ a and i + (p-1) ≥ b. So, p must be ≥ (b - i) + 1 and p must be ≥ (i - a) + 1. Thus, p must be ≥ max(b - i + 1, i - a + 1). \n\nBut also, since the coverage cannot reach 0, we have that i - (p-1) ≥ 1 → p ≤ i. Similarly, i + (p-1) ≤ n → p ≤ n - i + 1. \n\nSo combining these, we have:\n\nmax(b - i + 1, i - a + 1) ≤ p ≤ min(i, n - i + 1).\n\nBut for there to exist such a p, the lower bound must be ≤ upper bound. Hence:\n\nmax(b - i + 1, i - a + 1) ≤ min(i, n - i + 1).\n\nThis is a bit complicated. However, perhaps there's a simpler way to think about the intervals that can be covered by a tower at i. For example, the tower at i can cover any interval [a, b] where a ≤ i ≤ b, and the following holds:\n\ni - a ≤ i → which is always true, and b - i ≤ i → b ≤ 2i. Also, since the coverage cannot reach n+1, we have that i + p - 1 ≤ n. But p is at least b - i + 1. So:\n\ni + (b - i + 1) - 1 ≤ n → b ≤ n. Which is always true since b is between 1 and n. Similarly, for the left side, a must be ≥ 1, which it is.\n\nWait, perhaps the key constraints are that for a tower at i, the interval [a, b] it covers must satisfy:\n\na ≥ 1, b ≤ n,\n\nand\n\nb ≤ 2i (since the maximum possible b is when p is i, which gives i + (i-1) = 2i -1. So the maximum b is 2i-1. So if the tower is at i, it can cover up to 2i-1. Similarly, for the left side, the tower can cover down to i - (p-1). If p is i, then it can reach down to i - (i-1) = 1. So the tower at i can cover any interval [a, b] where a ≥ 1, b ≤ min(2i-1, n), and a ≤ i ≤ b. \n\nBut if the tower is covering an interval [a, b] where a is 1 and b is 2i-1, then that's possible. However, for the interval to be covered by this tower, the tower must be placed in such a way that the entire interval is covered by the tower's signal. \n\nBut how does this help in modeling the problem?\n\nLet me think of the entire problem as follows: the valid tower configurations are those where the towers can be partitioned into intervals such that each interval is covered by exactly one tower, and for each interval [a, b] assigned to tower i, i is in [a, b], and b ≤ 2i - 1 and a ≥ i - (some value). Wait, perhaps the key is that each interval [a, b] must be covered by a tower in such a way that the tower is the \"center\" of the interval, and the interval is of length at most 2i-1 - a + 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the valid configurations are those where the towers form a structure similar to a valid parenthesis sequence, where each tower is responsible for covering a certain range that starts at some point and ends at a point that is determined by the tower's position.\n\nAnother idea: For the entire coverage to be possible, the towers must be placed in such a way that between any two consecutive towers, there is a certain relation. For example, if there is a tower at position i, then the next tower must be placed at a position j ≥ i + 1, but such that the coverage of the previous tower doesn't reach j. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a dynamic programming problem. Let dp[i] be the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (towns 1..i). Then, how can we compute dp[i]?\n\nFor example, for dp[0], it's 1 (base case). For dp[1], the configuration must have a tower in town 1, and it must cover town 1. The signal power can be 1. Also, town 0 and 2 (if n is 1, then n+1 is 2) must not be covered. For town 0, the signal power must be <= 1 (since i=1). For town 2, the signal power must be <= 1 (since n+1 - i = 2-1=1). So p=1 is acceptable. Thus, the only valid configuration is when there's a tower in town 1. So dp[1] = 1. The total possible configurations is 2^1 = 2. So the probability is 1/2.\n\nBut according to the sample input, when n=2, the answer is 1/4. Let's see. For n=2, the valid configurations are when towers are built in both 1 and 2. So the number of valid configurations is 1, and the total possible is 2^2 =4. So probability 1/4.\n\nSo, for the DP approach, perhaps dp[i] represents the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (i.e., towns 1..i) such that the coverage ends exactly at i. Then, the recurrence can be built based on how the last tower is placed.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose we want to compute dp[i], the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. How can we reach this state?\n\nFor the last tower (the one covering town i), it could be placed at position j, where j ranges from some value to i. For example, the tower at position j must cover up to i. For that to happen, the tower's coverage must reach i. Given that the tower is at j, the maximum distance to i is i - j. So the signal power must be at least i - j + 1. Also, the coverage must not reach town i+1 (but since our current problem is up to i, perhaps this is handled by the constraints on the tower's signal power).\n\nBut for the tower at j to cover up to i, the maximum possible coverage of this tower is 2j - 1 (as discussed earlier). So, i must be ≤ 2j - 1. Which implies that j ≥ (i + 1)/2. So j can be from ceil((i+1)/2) to i.\n\nFor each such j, if there's a tower at j, then the coverage of j must include i. Also, the part before j must be covered properly. So, the configuration up to j-1 must be valid, and then the tower at j covers from some a to i.\n\nWait, but how do we ensure that the tower at j covers from a to i, and that the part before a is covered properly?\n\nThis seems like a classic dynamic programming problem where the recurrence depends on previous states.\n\nLet me formalize this. Suppose that we have a tower at position j, which covers from position k to i. Then, the part from 1 to k-1 must be covered by towers in a valid way, and the part from k to i is covered by the tower at j. But how do we determine k?\n\nAlternatively, for the tower at j to cover up to i, the earliest town it can cover is j - (p-1), where p is the signal power. But since p must be at least i - j + 1 (to cover town i), the earliest town covered is j - (p-1) = j - (i - j + 1 - 1) = j - (i - j) = 2j - i. So the tower at j covers from 2j - i to i. But this must be ≥ 1. So 2j - i ≥ 1 → j ≥ (i + 1)/2. Which is the same condition as before.\n\nSo, for the tower at j to cover up to i, the coverage starts at 2j - i. Thus, the previous part of the configuration (from 1 to 2j - i - 1) must be valid. And the tower at j must be present.\n\nTherefore, the recurrence for dp[i] is the sum over all j where (i+1)/2 ≤ j ≤ i of (dp[2j - i - 1] * 1), multiplied by the probability that the tower is present at j and that the other towers are present in a way that allows the previous parts to be valid.\n\nWait, but this seems to model the count of valid configurations. However, since each tower is present with probability 1/2, the total number of valid configurations is the sum over all valid tower placements multiplied by 1 (since each is counted once in the DP). But how does this fit into the DP?\n\nActually, the DP approach here is to count the number of valid tower configurations for the first i towns. Then, the answer is dp[n] / 2^n, since each tower is present with probability 1/2.\n\nSo, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j = ceil((i+1)/2)}^i [ dp[2j - i - 1] ] * 1 ?\n\nWait, no. Because for each j, the tower at j must be present, and the previous part (up to 2j - i - 1) must be valid. However, the towers between 2j - i and j-1 may or may not be present, but they must not interfere with the coverage. But according to the logic above, the tower at j is covering from 2j - i to i. So the part before 2j - i must be covered by the previous towers, and the part from 2j - i to i is covered by the tower at j. Therefore, the DP[i] counts the number of ways to have a valid configuration for the first i towns, ending with a tower at j that covers up to i.\n\nBut then, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j} ( dp[2j - i - 1] * 1 ), where the sum is over j such that 2j - i >= 1 and j is present (i.e., the tower is present at j). However, how does the presence of the tower at j factor into the count?\n\nAh, because the DP[i] counts the number of valid configurations. For each j, the tower at j must be present. Also, the previous part (up to 2j - i - 1) must be valid. However, between 2j - i and j-1, there can be towers, but they must not be present. Because if there were towers in that range, they would have to be covered by other towers. Wait, no. Because the tower at j is covering up to i, and the previous part (up to 2j - i - 1) is covered by some configuration. The area between 2j - i and j-1 is covered by the tower at j. Therefore, there cannot be any towers in that area, because otherwise they would be covered by the tower at j, but also need to be covered by their own towers. Wait, but that's not possible. So, the presence of towers in that area would violate the requirement that each town is covered exactly once.\n\nTherefore, the area between 2j - i and j-1 must not contain any towers. Because if there was a tower there, it would have to be covered by some other tower. However, since the tower at j covers up to i, and the previous part is up to 2j - i - 1, then between 2j - i and j-1, the coverage is provided by the tower at j. Therefore, there cannot be any towers in that area. Otherwise, those towers would be covered by the tower at j, but they would need to be covered exactly once. However, if there is a tower in that area, then it would have to be covered by its own signal, but that's impossible because the tower's coverage would have to include itself (which it does), but also other towns. However, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the DP approach assumes that the tower at j is the only one covering the range [2j - i, i], and therefore, there are no towers in that range except j. Thus, for the configuration to be valid, the towers in the range [2j - i, i] must consist of exactly the tower at j, and the previous part (up to 2j - i -1) must be valid.\n\nThus, the recurrence would be:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j} ( dp[2j - i - 1] ) * (probability that the tower at j is present and no towers are present between 2j - i and j-1).\n\nBut since the towers are chosen independently, the number of configurations would be:\n\nfor each j, the number of ways is dp[2j - i - 1] multiplied by 1 (tower at j is present) multiplied by 1 (no towers in the range [2j - i +1, j-1]).\n\nBut how do we account for the absence of towers in that range? Because for each of those positions, they must not have a tower. The number of such possibilities is 2^{number of positions not in the range} ... Wait, no. The total number of configurations is the product of choices for each position. However, in this DP approach, the dp[i] counts the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. So, when we consider j, the tower at j must be present, and the positions between 2j - i and j-1 must not have any towers. The positions from 1 to 2j - i -1 are handled by dp[2j - i -1], which already accounts for their configurations. The positions between 2j - i and j-1 must not have any towers, which contributes a factor of 1 (since they are not present). The positions from j+1 to i are not present here (since i is the end of the current segment). Wait, I think I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me rephrase. The entire first i towns are covered by the previous part (up to 2j - i -1) and the tower at j covering from 2j - i to i. So, the positions from 2j - i to i must be covered by the tower at j. This means that there can't be any other towers in the range [2j - i, i] except for j. Because if there were, say, a tower at k in that range, then that tower would need to be covered by some other tower, but the tower at j is already covering it. However, since the tower at j's coverage includes k, the tower at k would be covered by the tower at j, but then the signal power for the tower at k would have to be set such that it doesn't cover any other towns. But this seems impossible unless the tower at k is not present. Hence, the conclusion is that in the range [2j - i, i], there can be no towers except for j.\n\nSo, for the tower at j to be the one covering the range [2j -i, i], the following must be true:\n\n- There is a tower at j.\n\n- There are no towers in positions 2j - i to j-1.\n\n- The positions from 1 to 2j - i -1 are covered by a valid configuration.\n\nThus, the number of ways for this scenario is dp[2j - i - 1] multiplied by 1 (tower at j is present) multiplied by 1 (no towers in positions 2j -i to j-1). But the positions from 2j -i to j-1 are (j-1) - (2j - i) + 1 = i - j positions. Each of these positions must not have a tower. The probability for this is (1/2)^{i-j} ?\n\nNo, because the DP counts the number of valid configurations, not probabilities. So, for the number of configurations, the number of ways for the positions between 2j -i and j-1 to have no towers is 1 (they are not present). But how does this integrate into the DP?\n\nActually, the DP counts the number of valid configurations. So, for the current scenario, the number of configurations is:\n\n(number of ways for the first 2j - i -1 towns) × (ways to have no towers in the range [2j -i, j-1]) × (tower at j is present).\n\nThe number of ways for the first 2j - i -1 towns is dp[2j -i -1].\n\nThe number of ways to have no towers in [2j -i, j-1] is 1 (since all those positions must not have towers). But since the presence of towers is independent, the number of configurations for those positions is 1 (all not present). However, the positions outside of the first 2j -i -1 towns and the current range are not considered yet. Wait, perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nThe entire configuration is for the first i towns. The first part is up to 2j -i -1 towns. The next part is from 2j -i to j-1 (must have no towers), and then the tower at j. Then, the rest of the towns (from j+1 to i) are covered by the tower at j. But how can the tower at j cover those towns? Because the tower at j's coverage is from 2j -i to i. So, the towns from j+1 to i are included in that range. Therefore, there can't be any towers in that range (from j+1 to i) except for j. Because if there were a tower at k in j+1 to i, it would be covered by the tower at j, but then it would need to be covered exactly once. However, the tower at k would have to be present, but then it's covered by the tower at j, which would require that its signal power is set so that it doesn't cover any other towns. But that's not possible unless k is the only town covered by the tower at j. But this seems conflicting.\n\nWait, this suggests that the entire range from 2j -i to i must be covered by the tower at j, and there can be no other towers in that range. Hence, the positions from 2j -i to i must contain exactly one tower (at j), and the rest are not present. Thus, the number of ways for this part is 1 (tower at j is present) multiplied by the product of (not present) for all other positions in that range. \n\nThe number of positions in that range is i - (2j -i) + 1 = 2i - 2j + 1 + 1? Wait, the range is from a = 2j -i to b = i. The number of positions is i - a + 1 = i - (2j -i) +1 = 2i - 2j +1.\n\nAmong these positions, exactly one is present (j), and others are not. The number of ways to choose this is 1 (since the tower at j must be present, and all others must not be present). Therefore, the number of ways for this part is 1.\n\nSo combining all of this, the recurrence for dp[i] is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j} dp[prev], where prev is 2j - i - 1, and j ranges from ceil((i+1)/2) to i.\n\nBecause for each j, the number of ways is dp[prev] multiplied by 1 (the current part's configuration).\n\nBut what is prev? It's the number of towns before the current range. The current range starts at a = 2j -i. The previous part ends at a-1 = 2j -i -1. Hence, dp[prev] is the number of valid configurations for the first prev towns.\n\nSo, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{j = ceil((i+1)/2)}^i dp[2j - i - 1]\n\nWith the base case dp[0] = 1 (empty configuration).\n\nLet me test this with the sample cases.\n\nSample 1: n=2.\n\nCompute dp[2].\n\nFor i=2, j ranges from ceil((2+1)/2) = 2 to 2. So j=2.\n\nprev = 2*2 - 2 -1 = 4 -3 = 1. dp[1] ?\n\nWhat is dp[1]?\n\nFor i=1, j ranges from ceil((1+1)/2)=1 to 1. So j=1.\n\nprev = 2*1 -1 -1 = 2-2=0. dp[0] =1. So dp[1] = 1.\n\nThen, dp[2] = dp[1] = 1. So total valid configurations is 1. The total possible is 2^2=4. So probability is 1/4, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample: n=3. The expected answer is 1/4. Let's compute dp[3].\n\ndp[0] = 1.\n\ndp[1] = 1.\n\ndp[2] = 1.\n\nFor i=3:\n\nj ranges from ceil((3+1)/2) = 2 to 3.\n\nFor j=2:\n\nprev = 2*2 -3 -1 = 4-4=0. dp[0] =1.\n\nFor j=3:\n\nprev = 2*3 -3 -1 =6-4=2. dp[2] =1.\n\nSo dp[3] = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nTotal valid configurations is 2. Total possible is 2^3=8. Probability is 2/8=1/4, which matches the sample. Great!\n\nAnother sample for n=5, the expected answer is 5/32. Let's see what dp[5] would be.\n\nWe need to compute dp[0] to dp[5].\n\ndp[0] =1.\n\ndp[1] = dp[0] =1.\n\ndp[2] = dp[1] =1.\n\ndp[3] = dp[0] + dp[2] =1 +1=2.\n\nFor i=4:\n\nj ranges from ceil((4+1)/2) = 3 to 4.\n\nj=3: prev = 2*3 -4 -1 =6-5=1 → dp[1] =1.\n\nj=4: prev = 2*4 -4 -1 =8-5=3 → dp[3]=2.\n\ndp[4] =1 +2=3.\n\nFor i=5:\n\nj ranges from ceil(6/2)=3 to 5.\n\nj=3: prev = 2*3 -5 -1 =6-6=0 → dp[0]=1.\n\nj=4: prev = 2*4 -5 -1 =8-6=2 → dp[2]=1.\n\nj=5: prev=2*5 -5 -1=10-6=4 → dp[4]=3.\n\nSo dp[5] =1 +1 +3=5. Total valid configurations is 5. Total possible is 2^5=32. 5/32 is indeed the sample answer. So this seems correct.\n\nSo the recurrence is correct. Therefore, the problem reduces to computing dp[n], where dp[i] = sum_{j = ceil((i+1)/2)}^i dp[2j - i -1}.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute dp[n] efficiently for large n (up to 2e5). The naive approach would be O(n^2), which is not feasible.\n\nLet's think about the recurrence and find a way to compute it efficiently.\n\nLet's note that for each i, the sum is over j from m to i, where m = ceil((i+1)/2). Let's denote m = floor((i+1)/2) ? Wait, ceil((i+1)/2) is equal to floor(i/2) + 1. For example, for i even: i=2k → ceil((2k+1)/2) =k+1. For i=2k-1 → ceil( (2k-1 +1)/2 ) = ceil(2k/2) =k.\n\nSo m = floor( (i+1)/2",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that after randomly building towers in towns from 1 to n (each with a 1/2 chance), there exists a way to set signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 receive no signal, and each town from 1 to n receives exactly one signal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: Define `dp[i]` as the number of valid configurations for the first `i` towns (towns 1 to i). The recurrence relation is derived based on the observation that a tower at position `j` can cover a segment ending at `i` if `j` is within a certain range.\n2. **Recurrence Relation**: For each `i`, the valid configurations are computed by summing over possible positions `j` from `ceil((i+1)/2)` to `i`. This ensures that the tower at position `j` can cover up to `i` without extending beyond the boundaries.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Use dynamic programming with prefix sums to efficiently compute the required sums, reducing the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    \n    max_n = n\n    dp = [0] * (max_n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1  # base case\n    \n    for i in range(1, max_n + 1):\n        m = (i + 1 + 1) // 2  # ceil((i+1)/2) is equivalent to floor((i+1)/2) when using integer division\n        # Wait, let me recompute:\n        # ceil((i+1)/2) can be written as (i + 1 + 1) // 2 in integer division\n        # For example, if i=2: (2+1+1)/2 = 4/2=2.
