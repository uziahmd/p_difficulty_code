Yuri also likes triangles and once he thought: how many non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ exist, such that $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds?Yuri is preparing problems for a new contest now, so he is very busy. That's why he asked you to calculate the number of triangles with described property.The triangle is called non-degenerate if and only if its vertices are not collinear.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains four integers: $$$A$$$, $$$B$$$, $$$C$$$ and $$$D$$$ ($$$1 \\leq A \\leq B \\leq C \\leq D \\leq 5 \\cdot 10^5$$$) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\n## Output\nPrint the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$z$$$ such that the inequality $$$A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$$$ holds.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\n### Output\n['4', '3', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 3, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$, $$$(2, 3, 3)$$$ and $$$(2, 3, 4)$$$.In the second example Yuri can make up triangles with sides $$$(1, 2, 2)$$$, $$$(2, 2, 2)$$$ and $$$(2, 2, 3)$$$.In the third example Yuri can make up only one equilateral triangle with sides equal to $$$5 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain constraints. The constraints are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. And the triangle must be non-degenerate, which means that the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, maybe I can find a way to check the triangle inequality efficiently.\n\nLet me think about the conditions. Since x ≤ y ≤ z, the triangle inequality requires that x + y > z. Because for a triangle with sides in order x ≤ y ≤ z, the sum of the two smaller sides must be greater than the largest side. So the main condition here is x + y > z.\n\nBut how do I count all possible triples (x, y, z) that satisfy the given constraints and x + y > z?\n\nThe problem is that the ranges can be up to 5e5, so brute-forcing all possibilities would be too slow. So I need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me break down the constraints:\n\n- x is in [A, B]\n- y is in [B, C], but since B ≤ y and y ≤ C, but also x ≤ B, so x ≤ B ≤ y. Wait, the problem says \"A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D\". So for each x, y must be ≥ B and ≤ C. And z must be between C and D, but also ≥ y. Wait, no: the constraints are that x ≤ B, then B ≤ y (since B ≤ y). So y ranges from B to C. And z ranges from C to D, but also z must be ≥ y. So for each y, z ranges from max(y, C) to D. But since y is ≤ C, max(y, C) is C. So z is in [C, D], but also z ≥ y. Wait, no. Because y can be up to C. For example, if y is C, then z must be ≥ y (since y ≤ z). But since z is ≥ C, then z is between C and D. So for any y in [B, C], z is in [y, D] but also since z ≥ C. Wait, no. Because the original constraint is that C ≤ z. So z is between C and D, but also z must be ≥ y. Since y can be up to C, then for z to be ≥ y and ≥ C, it's equivalent to z being in [max(y, C), D]. But since y is between B and C, and C is the upper bound for y, then max(y, C) is C. Therefore, z must be between C and D. Wait, but if y is less than C, then z must be ≥ y, but since z is already ≥ C, which is larger than y, that's automatically satisfied. So for any y in [B, C], z is in [C, D]. So the z range is fixed as [C, D], regardless of y. Wait, but that's not correct. Suppose y is 2, and C is 3, then z must be ≥ y (which is 2), but also ≥ C (3). So z is between 3 and D. So yes, z is always in [C, D]. So for each x, y, z, the constraints are:\n\nx ∈ [A, B]\n\ny ∈ [B, C]\n\nz ∈ [C, D]\n\nand also x ≤ y ≤ z. Wait, no. Wait the original problem says that A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be up to B, y starts from B (since B ≤ y) and goes up to C. So x ≤ B ≤ y, so x ≤ y. Also, since y ≤ C ≤ z, then y ≤ z. So the order x ≤ y ≤ z is guaranteed by the constraints. Therefore, the triangle inequality is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y in [B, C], z in [C, D], and x + y > z.\n\nBut how do I compute this efficiently?\n\nThe straightforward approach would be for each x and y, compute the number of z's in [C, D] that are less than x + y. But since z has to be at least C, and at most D, and for each x and y, the valid z's are those in [C, min(D, x + y - 1)].\n\nWait, because z must be ≤ x + y - 1 (since x + y > z → z ≤ x + y - 1). So for each x and y, the number of z's is max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y - 1) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], of (number of z's in [C, D] that are ≤ x + y - 1).\n\nBut considering that B and C can be up to 5e5, then the total number of x and y pairs is up to (5e5)^2 = 2.5e11, which is way too big. So iterating over all x and y is impossible. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the problem is to compute the sum for all x in [A,B], y in [B,C], of max(0, min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) if x + y -1 >= C else 0.\n\nBut how can we compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the variables. Let me denote S = x + y. Then for each x and y, the value of S is important. The minimum value of S is when x is A and y is B: S_min = A + B. The maximum value of S is when x is B and y is C: S_max = B + C.\n\nFor each S, the number of z's that are allowed is:\n\nif S > D: then z can be from C to D → count is D - C + 1.\n\nif S <= C: then there's no z (because z ≥ C and S -1 < C → z must be ≥ C, but z ≤ S-1 < C → no solution).\n\nif C ≤ S - 1 < D → then the number of z is (S-1) - C + 1 = S - C.\n\nif S -1 >= D → then the number of z is D - C + 1.\n\nSo for each x and y, the contribution is:\n\nif x + y > D → D - C + 1\n\nelif x + y > C → (x + y - 1) - C + 1 = x + y - C\n\nelse 0.\n\nSo the problem becomes, for all x in [A,B], y in [B,C], compute how many of them have x + y > C, and for those, compute the sum of (x + y - C) if x + y <= D, or add (D - C + 1) otherwise.\n\nSo the total sum can be broken into two parts:\n\nTotal = T1 + T2, where:\n\nT1 is the number of (x, y) pairs where x + y > D multiplied by (D - C + 1).\n\nT2 is the sum over (x, y) pairs where C < x + y <= D of (x + y - C).\n\nBut how do we compute these?\n\nAlternatively, we can think of T as:\n\nsum_{x, y} [ max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) ]\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{x,y} [ max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) ] \n\n= sum_{x,y} [ max(0, (min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1)) ]\n\nLet me define for each x and y:\n\nval = max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1)\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nLet me consider that for a given x and y, val depends on x + y. Let me think about the possible ranges of x + y.\n\nLet me denote S = x + y.\n\nThen, val is:\n\nif S <= C → 0\n\nif C < S <= D → S - C\n\nif S > D → D - C + 1\n\nSo, for all pairs (x, y) where S = x + y:\n\n- If S <= C → contribute 0.\n\n- Else, contribute (S - C) if S <= D, else (D - C + 1).\n\nTherefore, the total sum can be calculated as:\n\nsum_{S = S_low to S_high} (number of pairs (x,y) with x + y = S) * contribution(S)\n\nwhere S_low is A + B (minimum x + y) and S_high is B + C (maximum x + y).\n\nSo the problem now is to compute for each possible S, the number of (x, y) pairs that sum to S, and then multiply by the contribution based on S.\n\nNow, the question is, how to compute the number of pairs (x, y) where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], and x + y = S.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think of x and y ranges. x ranges from A to B, y ranges from B to C. So x can be from A to B, and y can be from B to C. Also, since x ≤ B and y ≥ B, x ≤ y. But that's not necessary for the sum, but perhaps helps in some way.\n\nBut for each S, the number of pairs (x, y) with x + y = S is equal to the number of integers x in [A, B] such that y = S - x is in [B, C].\n\nSo for each S, the count is the number of x in [A, B] where B ≤ S - x ≤ C.\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nS - C ≤ x ≤ S - B.\n\nBut x also has to be in [A, B].\n\nSo the valid x's are in the intersection of [A, B] and [S - C, S - B].\n\nSo for each S, the count is the number of x in [max(A, S - C), min(B, S - B)] ].\n\nBut how do I compute that for all S?\n\nBut since S can be up to B + C (which is up to 1e6?), and with A and B up to 5e5, perhaps precomputing for each S is feasible.\n\nBut even that might be O(S_high - S_low) steps. Let me see:\n\nS_low is A + B, which could be as low as 1 + 1 = 2, and S_high is B + C, which can be up to 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6. So the number of S values is up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo for each S in [S_low, S_high], compute the number of (x, y) pairs that sum to S, and then multiply by the contribution for that S. Sum all these up.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nCompute for each S in [A + B, B + C], the count of pairs (x, y) where x is in [A, B], y in [B, C], x + y = S.\n\nThen, for each such S, calculate the contribution based on S and multiply by the count, adding to the total.\n\nBut how to compute the count for each S?\n\nLet me think again. For each S, the possible x must satisfy:\n\ny = S - x must be between B and C.\n\nSo:\n\nB ≤ S - x ≤ C → rearranged:\n\nS - C ≤ x ≤ S - B.\n\nAlso, x must be between A and B.\n\nSo x must be in the intersection of [A, B] and [S - C, S - B].\n\nSo the lower bound for x is max(A, S - C).\n\nThe upper bound for x is min(B, S - B).\n\nIf lower bound > upper bound, then there are zero pairs for this S.\n\nOtherwise, the count is upper - lower + 1.\n\nSo for each S, the number of pairs is max(0, min(B, S - B) - max(A, S - C) + 1).\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for all S?\n\nThis seems manageable. Now, the problem is to iterate through all S in the range [A + B, B + C], compute for each S the count, then multiply by the contribution for S, and accumulate.\n\nSo the steps for the code would be:\n\n1. Compute the total as 0.\n\n2. Iterate S from S_min = A + B to S_max = B + C.\n\n   For each S:\n\n   a. Compute the lower_x = max(A, S - C).\n\n   b. upper_x = min(B, S - B).\n\n   c. if lower_x > upper_x: continue.\n\n   d. count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1.\n\n   e. Now, compute contribution for S:\n\n      if S <= C: contribution is 0.\n\n      elif S > D: contribution is (D - C + 1).\n\n      else: contribution is (S - C).\n\n   f. total += count_pairs * contribution.\n\nSo this approach would work, but what is the time complexity?\n\nThe loop runs from S_min to S_max. The maximum possible S_max is B + C. Since B and C are up to 5e5, S_max is up to 1e6. So the loop would run about 1e6 times, which is acceptable.\n\nBut let's check with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4.\n\nSo A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nS ranges from 1+2=3 to 2+3=5.\n\nSo S can be 3,4,5.\n\nFor each S:\n\nS=3:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 3 - 3) = max(1, 0) = 1.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 3 - 2) = min(2, 1) = 1.\n\ncount_pairs is 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.\n\ncontribution: S=3. Since C is 3. So S <= C → contribution is 0. So nothing added.\n\nS=4:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 4-3) = 1.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 4-2) = min(2, 2) = 2.\n\ncount_pairs is 2-1+1=2.\n\ncontribution: S=4 > C=3. Also, since D=4. So S=4 is <= D. Contribution is 4-3 = 1. So 2 * 1 = 2 added to total.\n\nS=5:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 5-3) = 2.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 5-2) = min(2, 3) = 2.\n\ncount_pairs is 1.\n\ncontribution: S=5. D=4. S > D. So contribution is D - C + 1 = 4 - 3 + 1 = 2. So 1 * 2 = 2 added.\n\nSo total is 2 + 2 = 4, which matches the first sample output. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: second input is 1 2 2 5. Output is 3.\n\nLet me check:\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nS ranges from 1+2=3 to 2+2=4.\n\nSo S can be 3,4.\n\nFor S=3:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 3 - 2) = 1.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 3 - 2) = 1. count is 1.\n\ncontribution: S=3, which is equal to C=2? No, C is 2. S=3 > C=2. So contribution is:\n\nif S > D? D is 5. S is 3 <5. So contribution is S - C = 3 - 2 = 1. So 1 * 1 = 1 added.\n\nFor S=4:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 4 - 2) = 2.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 4 - 2) = 2. count is 1.\n\ncontribution: S=4 <= D=5. So 4-2=2. 1*2=2. Total so far 1+2=3. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000.\n\nA=B=C=D=5e5.\n\nS ranges from 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6 to 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6. So only S=1e6.\n\nlower_x = max(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) = max(5e5, 5e5) = 5e5.\n\nupper_x = min(5e5, 1e6 - 5e5) = min(5e5, 5e5) = 5e5. count_pairs is 1.\n\ncontribution: S=1e6. C=5e5. D=5e5. So S is 1e6 > D=5e5. So contribution is D - C +1 = 5e5 -5e5 +1 = 1. So total is 1*1=1. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach works for the samples.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut first, need to compute S_min and S_max. Then loop through each S in that range.\n\nBut wait, what if S_min is larger than S_max? Well, since A ≤ B and B ≤ C, then S_min = A + B ≤ B + B ≤ B + C = S_max. So no problem.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nCompute S_min = A + B.\n\nS_max = B + C.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nFor S in S_min ... S_max:\n\n   compute lower_x = max(A, S - C)\n\n   upper_x = min(B, S - B)\n\n   if lower_x > upper_x: continue\n\n   count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n\n   if S <= C:\n\n       contribution = 0\n\n   elif S > D:\n\n       contribution = D - C + 1\n\n   else:\n\n       contribution = S - C\n\n   total += count_pairs * contribution\n\nReturn total.\n\nBut wait, what about the case when S - B is less than A? For example, if S is small. Then upper_x would be min(B, ...). But lower_x is max(A, ...). So in that case, lower_x could be higher than upper_x, leading to zero.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's think about the calculation of upper_x. For S - B: since y must be >= B, so S - x >= B → x <= S - B. So upper_x is min(B, S - B). But since x can't exceed B.\n\nBut S - B could be anything. For example, if S is small, like S = A + B. Then S - B = A. So upper_x is min(B, A) = A. lower_x is max(A, S - C) = max(A, (A+B) - C). Depending on the values.\n\nBut the code handles that.\n\nNow, the problem is the loop from S_min to S_max. For S_max up to 1e6, this is manageable.\n\nBut when A, B, C, D are up to 5e5, S_max can be up to 5e5 + 5e5 = 1e6. So the loop will run up to 1e6 iterations. Which is acceptable for Python, even with 1e6 steps.\n\nBut let's check the time. Each iteration is O(1), so 1e6 steps is acceptable.\n\nSo the code should be efficient enough.\n\nNow, testing edge cases.\n\nAnother test case: A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1. Then S_min = 2, S_max = 2. For S=2:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 2-1) = 1.\n\nupper_x = min(1, 2-1) = 1. count_pairs is 1.\n\ncontribution: S=2, C=1. So S > C. D=1. So S=2> D=1. contribution is D-C+1 = 1-1+1=1. So total is 1. Which is correct, since the triangle is (1,1,1).\n\nAnother case: A=1, B=1, C=2, D=2. So x can be 1, y can be 1 or 2. z must be between 2 and 2.\n\nFor S ranges from 1+1=2 to 1+2=3.\n\nS=2:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 2 - 2) = 1.\n\nupper_x = min(1, 2 - 1) = 1. count_pairs 1.\n\ncontribution: S=2. C=2. So S is not > C. So contribution is 0. So nothing added.\n\nS=3:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 3 - 2) = 1.\n\nupper_x = min(1, 3 - 1) = 1. count_pairs 1.\n\ncontribution: S=3. D=2. So S > D. contribution is 2-2 +1=1. So total += 1*1=1.\n\nSo total is 1. Which corresponds to (x=1, y=2, z=2). Check if x + y > z: 1 + 2 =3>2. Yes. So correct.\n\nAnother case: A=2, B=3, C=3, D=5. Let's compute.\n\nS ranges from 2+3=5 to 3+3=6.\n\nFor S=5:\n\nlower_x = max(2, 5-3) = max(2, 2) = 2.\n\nupper_x = min(3, 5-3) = min(3, 2) = 2. count_pairs 1.\n\ncontribution: S=5. C=3. So S> C. D=5. So S is 5 which is equal to D. So contribution is 5 -3 = 2. So 1*2=2.\n\nFor S=6:\n\nlower_x = max(2, 6-3) = 3.\n\nupper_x = min(3, 6-3) = 3. count_pairs 1.\n\ncontribution: S=6> D=5. contribution is 5-3 +1 = 3. So 1*3=3. Total is 2+3=5.\n\nWhat are the possible triangles?\n\nFor x in [2,3], y in [3,3], z in [3,5].\n\nPossible (x,y,z):\n\nx=2, y=3. z can be 3,4,5. For each z, check 2+3>z → 5>z. So z can be 3,4. Because 5>3 → yes. 5>4 → yes. 5>5 → no. So for z=3 and 4. So two options.\n\nBut according to our calculation, S=5 (x=2, y=3) contributes 2. Which is correct.\n\nFor x=3, y=3. S=6. So z can be 3,4,5. But 3+3>z → 6>z. So z can be 3,4,5. So three options. Which is the contribution of 3. So total 2+3=5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nSo the code logic seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, for S in the range from S_min to S_max. How to generate that?\n\nIn Python, for S in range(S_min, S_max + 1):\n\nBecause in Python, range is exclusive of the upper limit. So for example, if S_min is 3 and S_max is 5, then range(S_min, S_max+1) would be 3,4,5.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead A, B, C, D from input.\n\nThen:\n\ntotal = 0\n\ns_min = A + B\n\ns_max = B + C\n\nfor s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n\n    lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n\n    upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n    if lower_x > upper_x:\n\n        continue\n\n    count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n\n    if s <= C:\n\n        contribution = 0\n\n    elif s > D:\n\n        contribution = D - C + 1\n\n    else:\n\n        contribution = s - C\n\n    total += count_pairs * contribution\n\nprint(total)\n\nBut wait, what if s - B is less than A? For example, suppose s is very small. Then upper_x is min(B, s - B). But if s - B is less than A, then upper_x is less than A, and lower_x is max(A, ...) which is >=A. So lower_x > upper_x, so no contribution.\n\nYes.\n\nBut let's test for s_min = A + B. For example, when A=1, B=2, C=3, D=4. s_min is 3.\n\nSo for s=3, upper_x is min(2, 3 - 2) = 1. lower_x is max(1, 3 - 3) = 1. So count_pairs is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input where the answer is 4. The code gives that.\n\nBut what about when C is larger than D?\n\nWait, no. Because the input constraints say that A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So C is ≤ D. So in the code, the case where s <= C is possible. For example, when s is between s_min and C.\n\nBut in that case, contribution is 0. So no contribution.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when D is less than C? But according to the problem statement, C ≤ D. So that can't happen.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut in Python, for large ranges, looping from s_min to s_max can be up to 1e6 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut what if s_min is larger than s_max? Well, since A ≤ B and B ≤ C, then s_min = A + B ≤ B + B ≤ B + C = s_max. So no.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput: 1 2 3 4 → output 4.\n\nSample code:\n\ns_min = 1+2=3, s_max=2+3=5.\n\nLoop s=3,4,5.\n\ns=3:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 3-3=0) → 1.\n\nupper_x = min(2, 3-2=1) → 1. count_pairs 1. s=3 <= C=3 → contribution 0. total remains 0.\n\ns=4:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 4-3=1) → 1. upper_x = min(2, 4-2=2). count_pairs 2. s=4> C=3. s=4 <= D=4. contribution 4-3=1. total += 2*1=2.\n\ns=5:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 5-3=2). upper_x = min(2, 5-2=3) → 2. count_pairs 1. s=5> D=4. contribution is D - C +1 =4-3+1=2. total += 1*2 → 2+2=4. Correct.\n\nSample 2: input 1 2 2 5.\n\ns_min = 1+2=3, s_max=2+2=4.\n\ns=3:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 3-2=1) → 1. upper_x = min(2, 3-2=1) → 1. count_pairs 1. contribution: s=3 > C=2. s=3 <= D=5. contribution is 3-2=1. total += 1*1=1.\n\ns=4:\n\nlower_x = max(1, 4-2=2). upper_x = min(2, 4-2=2). count_pairs 1. contribution 4-2=2. total += 1*2 → 3. Correct.\n\nSample 3: 500000 500000 500000 500000.\n\ns_min = 500000 + 500000 = 1e6. s_max = 500000 + 500000 = 1e6. So loop once.\n\nlower_x = max(500000, 1e6 - 500000) = 500000. upper_x = min(500000, 1e6 - 500000) = 500000. count_pairs 1. s=1e6 > D=5e5. contribution is 5e5 - 5e5 +1 =1. total is 1. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python. The code needs to read from stdin, process multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the input is given as four integers in the first line. But in the example, the input is given as multiple lines. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided three examples:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nWait, but in the actual programming competition problem, the input is one line per test case. Or is it multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is the first line contains four integers. So the problem is for a single test case. However, in the sample input, there are three lines. But perhaps that's just the way the sample is presented. For example, perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. But looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the input is given as four integers. But the sample shows three input lines. So perhaps the problem expects multiple test cases. Wait, the original problem says:\n\nThe first line contains four integers... So perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. But the sample input shows three lines, but perhaps that's just the way the sample is presented. For example, perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line.\n\nBut looking at the problem statement again:\n\nIn the input section, it says:\n\nThe first line contains four integers...\n\nSo the code should read one line of input. However, in the sample input, there are three input lines. But perhaps the sample input is showing three different test cases. So the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', '500000 500000 500000 500000']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['4', '3', '1']\n\nSo the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the user has to read multiple test cases. But the original problem's input description may have been miswritten. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C and D (1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D ≤ 5·10^5) — Yuri's favourite numbers.\n\nSo the input is one line, with four integers. But the sample input shows three lines. That's confusing.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the sample input has three test cases. So perhaps the actual problem expects multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. That's a contradiction. But perhaps the original problem is from a programming competition where the input is multiple test cases. For example, perhaps the problem's actual input is multiple lines, each line being a test case.\n\nBut the problem's sample input shows that for three test cases, the outputs are given. So the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. Which suggests that it's a single test case. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as three lines, and the output is three lines. So the code must read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. Which is probably a mistake. Because in the sample input, there are three lines.\n\nSo perhaps the actual problem expects to read multiple test cases, each on a separate line. So the code must read all lines from stdin, process each line as a separate test case, and output the corresponding result for each.\n\nIn that case, the code should read all lines from input, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer, and print it.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nIn the code, the input is read via input() or sys.stdin. For example, in programming competitions, sometimes the code is expected to read from standard input, which may contain multiple lines. So the code should read all lines from stdin, process each line as a test case.\n\nBut the problem's original input description may have been incorrect. However, given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nSo in the code, we need to read all lines from stdin, for each line, split into A, B, C, D, compute the answer, and print the answer.\n\nBut how to do that in Python.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute the answer and print\n\nBut the problem's input may have multiple lines, each representing a test case. So the code should process each line as a separate test case.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, perhaps the sample input is given with multiple lines, but the actual input is one line. But given the sample input and output, it's better to assume that the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first line contains four integers. Which suggests that it's a single test case. However, the sample input shows three lines. Which is conflicting.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as three lines, and the output is three lines. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut why does the problem's input description say \"the first line contains four integers\"? Maybe that's a mistake. Perhaps the problem actually has multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the sample input has three lines, and the output three lines, the code must read multiple lines.\n\nSo, the code will read all lines from input, process each line as a separate test case.\n\nSo in Python, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n        # compute answer\n\n        total = 0\n\n        s_min = A + B\n\n        s_max = B + C\n\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n\n            lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n\n            upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n\n            if lower_x > upper_x:\n\n                continue\n\n            count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n\n            if s <= C:\n\n                contribution = 0\n\n            elif s > D:\n\n                contribution = D - C + 1\n\n            else:\n\n                contribution = s - C\n\n            total += count_pairs * contribution\n\n        print(total)\n\nBut this code may be too slow for large test cases. Let's think about the maximum possible s_max. For example, when B and C are 5e5, then s_max is 1e6. So for each test case, the loop runs 1e6 times. For multiple test cases, say T test cases, this would be O(T * 1e6) time. But if T is up to say 1e4,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with integer sides $x$, $y$, and $z$ that satisfy the constraints $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$. A triangle is non-degenerate if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. Given the constraints, we focus on ensuring $x + y > z$.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: The problem constraints ensure that $x \\leq y \\leq z$, so the critical check for a non-degenerate triangle is $x + y > z$.\n2. **Range of Sums**: For each possible sum $S = x + y$, we determine the valid range of values for $z$ such that $z \\leq S - 1$ and $C \\leq z \\leq D$.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: Instead of iterating over all possible values of $x$ and $y$, we iterate over possible sums $S$ from $A + B$ to $B + C$. For each sum $S$, we calculate how many valid $(x, y)$ pairs exist and then determine the valid $z$ values based on $S$.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        total = 0\n        s_min = A + B\n        s_max = B + C\n        for s in range(s_min, s_max + 1):\n            lower_x = max(A, s - C)\n            upper_x = min(B, s - B)\n            if lower_x > upper_x:\n                continue\n            count_pairs = upper_x - lower_x + 1\n            if s <= C:\n                contribution = 0\n            elif s > D:\n                contribution = D - C + 1\n            else:\n                contribution = s - C\n            total += count_pairs * contribution\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The code reads multiple lines from standard input, each representing a test case with four integers $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n2. **Sum Range Calculation**: For each test case, we determine the minimum and maximum possible sums $S = x + y$ (from $A + B$ to $B + C$).\n3. **Valid Pairs Calculation**: For each possible sum $S$, we compute the valid range of $x$ values that allow $y$ to be within the required bounds. This helps determine how many valid $(x, y)$ pairs exist for each $S$.\n4. **Contribution Calculation**: Depending on the value of $S$, we compute how many valid $z$ values exist such that $x + y > z$ and $C \\leq z \\leq D$. This is done by checking if $S$ is within the range of $C$ to $D$ or exceeds $D$.\n5. **Total Count**: The contributions from all valid $(x, y, z)$ triples are accumulated to get the final count of non-degenerate triangles for each test case.\n\nThis approach efficiently narrows down the valid ranges and leverages mathematical insights to avoid brute-force iteration, ensuring optimal performance even for large input values.",
