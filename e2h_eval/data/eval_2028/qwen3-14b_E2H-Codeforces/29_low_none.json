Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where we have a string of digits and perform multiple substitution queries. Then compute the number modulo 1e9+7. The challenge is to handle these substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be large and substitutions can be done multiple times.\n\nFirst, the straightforward approach would be to process each query by replacing all instances of di in the string with ti. But if the string is big and there are many queries, this could be very slow. For example, if the original string is 1e5 characters long and each query replaces a digit that appears many times, then doing this naively for each query would result in O(n * m) time where m is the length of the string, which might be too slow for the constraints given.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the sum of lengths of ti across all queries is up to 1e5. So maybe there's a smarter way to model this. Let me think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But if we process the substitutions in reverse order, perhaps we can track the value of each digit as it's being replaced. Wait, no. Because substitutions are applied in the order given. For example, if first we replace '2' with '00', then replace '0' with '7', then the original '2's would become '00' and then those zeros would be replaced by '7's. So processing in order is essential.\n\nBut trying to simulate the substitutions directly on the string would be too slow for large strings. For example, if the initial string is 1e5 characters and each query replaces a digit that appears in every position, then each substitution could take O(length of string) time. If there are 1e5 queries, that's O(1e10) operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo we need a more efficient way. Let's think about how each substitution affects the digits. Maybe we can model the substitutions using some kind of mapping, and track for each digit what it's currently mapped to. However, since substitutions can overwrite previous mappings, we need to process them in order.\n\nWait, but when you perform a substitution, say, replacing 'd' with 't', any existing mappings for 'd' would be replaced. So perhaps we can keep a map for each digit, which represents what it would be replaced with. But when you perform a substitution, you have to consider that the replacement string may contain digits that are themselves subject to further substitutions. However, the substitutions are applied in sequence. So for example, if we have a query '2->00' followed by '0->7', then the original '2's would first be replaced by '00', then each '0' in that would be replaced by '7', leading to '77'.\n\nBut if we model each substitution as a transformation, perhaps we can represent for each digit, what it expands to, considering all the substitutions that have been applied so far. However, the problem is that substitutions can be applied in sequence, and each substitution may affect the expansion of digits. So, for example, if we have a substitution for 'd' that changes it to 't', and later a substitution for a digit in 't', that would affect the expansion of 'd'.\n\nThis sounds like we need to track for each digit, the current expansion. But since substitutions can be applied in any order, we need to process them in the order given and update the expansions accordingly.\n\nSo here's an idea: maintain a dictionary (let's call it expand_map) where for each digit, we store the string it would be expanded into. Initially, each digit maps to itself. Then, for each query, when we process \"di -> ti\", we need to update expand_map[di] to be ti. However, when we do this, the ti might contain digits that have their own expansions. But since the substitutions are processed in order, when we replace di with ti, we need to make sure that when we later expand di, it uses the current ti, which may include other digits that have been substituted.\n\nWait, but how do we handle that? Suppose that after expanding di, we have ti which contains digits that are later substituted. For example, suppose we first do 2->00, then 0->7. Then, when we expand 2, we should get 00, but then those 0s would be replaced by 7s. However, if we have a way to track the expansion of each digit, considering all substitutions that have happened so far, then perhaps we can pre-process the expansion strings so that they are in terms of digits that have not been substituted yet.\n\nWait, no. Because substitutions are applied in sequence. So when you process a query, you replace all instances of di in the current string with ti. However, when you do this, the ti can contain digits",
    "response": "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to handle a series of substitution queries on a string of digits and compute the resulting number modulo $10^9 + 7$. The challenge is to avoid directly modifying the string for each query, which would be computationally expensive.\n\n---\n\n### Key Insight\n\nInstead of modifying the original string repeatedly, we can maintain a mapping of each digit to the current string it should expand into. This allows us to process substitutions in a way that avoids repeated string operations on potentially very large strings.\n\nFor example:\n- Initially, each digit maps to itself: `'0' -> '0', '1' -> '1', ...`.\n- When a query `\"d -> t\"` comes in, we update the mapping so that `d` now maps to `t`.\n- However, since `t` may contain digits that are also mapped, we must ensure that the expansion of `d` reflects all future substitutions by recursively applying the mapping.\n\n---\n\n### Efficient Expansion\n\nTo handle this, we can pre-process the mappings such that whenever we update a digit's expansion, it uses the current expansions of any digits in the target string. This ensures that the expansion of each digit is always up-to-date with the latest substitutions.\n\nThis approach avoids repeatedly scanning the entire string for replacements and instead computes the final result using the updated mappings.\n\n---\n\n### Modular Arithmetic\n\nSince the final result is the number formed by the string modulo $10^9 + 7$, we can compute the value incrementally as we build the expanded string from the original digits using the mappings. This allows us to avoid dealing with extremely large numbers directly.\n\nWe use modular arithmetic properties:\n- $(a \\cdot b) \\mod m = ((a \\mod m) \\cdot (b \\mod m)) \\mod m$\n- $(a + b) \\mod m = ((a \\mod m) + (b \\mod m)) \\mod m$\n\nThis ensures we never work with numbers larger than $10^9 + 7$.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Steps\n\n1. **Initialize a map** `expand_map` where each digit maps to itself.\n2. **Process each query** in order:\n   - For a query `\"d->t\"`, update `expand_map[d]` to the current expansion of `t`.\n3. **Compute the final value**:\n   - Iterate over each character in the original string.\n   - For each character, expand it using the current mapping.\n   - Compute the resulting number using modular arithmetic.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    s = input[0]\n    n = int(input[1])\n    queries = input[2:]\n\n    # Initialize the expansion map\n    expand_map = {str(d): str(d) for d in range(10)}\n\n    for q in queries:\n        # Parse the query\n        parts = q.split('->')\n        d = parts[0]\n        t = parts[1]\n        # Update the mapping for d to t, but expand t first\n        # Recursively expand t to its current form\n        expanded_t = ''\n        for ch in t:\n            expanded_t += expand_map[ch]\n        expand_map[d] = expanded_t\n\n    # Now compute the result\n    result = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        expanded = expand_map[ch]\n        for digit in expanded:\n            result = (result * 10 + int(digit)) % MOD\n\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation of Efficiency\n\n- **Time Complexity**: Each query is processed in $O(|t|)$ time where $t$ is the replacement string. The final computation is $O(|s|)$, where $|s|$ is the length of the original string.\n- **Space Complexity**: We store the mapping for 10 digits and the expanded strings, which is manageable.\n\nThis solution handles all edge cases, including empty strings and leading zeros, by treating the number as a decimal string and computing the result using modular arithmetic.",
