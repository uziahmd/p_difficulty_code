    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the smallest non-negative integer k such that the LCM of (a + k) and (b + k) is minimized. And if there are multiple k's with the same minimal LCM, pick the smallest one.\n\nHmm. Let me think about how to approach this. Let's first understand what's happening here. Since both numbers are being increased by the same k, maybe we can find some relationship between them.\n\nLet me denote x = a + k and y = b + k. Then, since k is the same, y - x = (b +k) - (a +k) = b - a. So the difference between the two numbers is fixed. Let's call this difference d. So d = b - a. Wait, but depending on which is bigger, a or b. Oh right, so if a and b are different, then d is their difference. But for example, if a is 6 and b is 10, then d is 4. So when k is added, the two numbers x and y are such that y = x + d. Or if a is larger than b, then x would be larger than y. So maybe we can assume without loss of generality that a ≤ b? Because if not, we can swap them. Wait, but the problem says that a and b can be any integers. So perhaps the first step is to compute the absolute difference between a and b. Let me think.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving the problem, perhaps we can assume that a ≤ b. Because if a > b, then swapping them would give the same problem. Because the LCM of (a +k) and (b +k) is the same as the LCM of (b +k) and (a +k). So maybe we can start by making sure that a ≤ b. Let me note that.\n\nSo let's say that a ≤ b. Then, the difference between the two numbers after adding k is (b +k) - (a +k) = b - a. Let me call this d. So d is fixed. So, the problem reduces to finding x such that x = a + k, and y = x + d. Then, the LCM of x and y is minimized. And since k is non-negative, x must be at least a. Also, since k can be zero, x can be as small as a.\n\nSo our problem is to find x ≥ a, such that LCM(x, x + d) is minimized, and then find the minimal k (which is x - a) that achieves this.\n\nNow, the question is: How do we find x that minimizes LCM(x, x + d)?\n\nLet me think about the properties of LCM. For two numbers x and y, LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y). So in this case, since y = x + d, we have LCM(x, x +d) = (x*(x +d)) / GCD(x, x +d).\n\nBut GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). Because GCD(x, x +d) = GCD(x, d). So the LCM becomes (x(x +d)) / GCD(x, d).\n\nSo the problem now becomes: Find x ≥ a such that (x(x +d)) / GCD(x, d) is minimized.\n\nHmm. How can I find such x?\n\nLet me think about possible values of x. Since d is fixed (d = b - a, assuming a ≤ b), perhaps we can find x such that x is a multiple of some divisor of d. Because GCD(x, d) would be maximized, which would minimize the LCM.\n\nWait, because the denominator is GCD(x, d), so maximizing that would reduce the overall value of the LCM. So perhaps we want to maximize GCD(x, d). Let me think.\n\nLet me denote g = GCD(x, d). Then, x can be written as g * m, where m is an integer. Also, since d = g * n, where n is some integer (because g divides d). Wait, since g is a divisor of d, right? Because GCD(x, d) is g, so g divides d.\n\nSo, substituting x = g * m, and d = g * n. Then, GCD(x, d) = g * GCD(m, n). Wait, no. Wait, x = g * m, d = g * n. Then GCD(gm, gn) = g * GCD(m, n). But since GCD(x, d) is g, then GCD(m, n) must be 1. Because GCD(x, d) = g * GCD(m, n) = g. Therefore, GCD(m, n) = 1.\n\nSo, with that, the LCM(x, x +d) becomes:\n\nx(x +d) / g = (g m)(g m + g n) / g = g m (g (m +n)) / g = g m * (m +n) * g / g? Wait, let me recompute:\n\nOriginal formula: [x * (x +d)] / GCD(x, d) = [x * (x +d)] / g.\n\nx is g*m, x +d is g*m + g*n = g*(m +n). So the numerator is g*m * g*(m +n) = g² m (m +n). Divided by g gives g m (m +n). So the LCM is g * m (m +n).\n\nBut since d = g * n, then n = d/g. Also, since GCD(m, n) = 1.\n\nSo the LCM becomes g * m (m + (d/g)).\n\nBut since d is fixed (d = b -a), and g is a divisor of d, perhaps we can find for each possible divisor g of d, the minimal possible value of m*(m + (d/g)), given that m is such that x = g*m >= a.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, since m and n are coprime (GCD(m, n) = 1), and n = d/g. Let me think. Since n = d/g, and since g is a divisor of d, then n is an integer.\n\nSo for each possible divisor g of d, we can find the minimal value of m*(m + n) where m is a positive integer (since x = g*m must be >= a) and GCD(m, n) = 1.\n\nWait, but m can be any positive integer as long as x = g*m >= a. But how to find the minimal m*(m +n) under these constraints?\n\nBut m*(m +n) = m^2 + m*n. To minimize this, for fixed n, we need to choose the smallest possible m. Because as m increases, the expression increases. So the minimal m would be the minimal m such that x = g*m >= a, and GCD(m, n) = 1.\n\nSo for each possible divisor g of d, we can compute n = d/g. Then, find the minimal m such that m >= ceil(a/(g)), and GCD(m, n) = 1. Then, the corresponding LCM is g * (m^2 + m*n). Then, among all possible divisors g of d, we can find the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nWait, but perhaps there are other possibilities. What if d is zero? Oh, right! If a and b are equal, then d is zero. Then, x and y are both equal to a +k, so their LCM is a +k. Which is minimized when k is zero. So in that case, the answer is zero. So that's a special case. So first, check if a == b. If yes, then return 0.\n\nSo the first thing in code is to check if a == b. If so, output 0.\n\nElse, proceed with the steps.\n\nSo, assuming that a != b. Let me proceed.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Compute d = |a - b|. Let's assume that a <= b, so d = b - a. If not, swap a and b. Because the problem is symmetric in a and b.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as two integers, a and b. So, in code, first, we can compute d as the absolute difference between a and b. Then, we can make sure that a is the smaller one. Let me think.\n\nSo, for example, if a is 10 and b is 6, then d is 4, and we can treat it as a = 6, b = 10. So in code, we can set a and b as min(a, b) and max(a, b) respectively. So that d = b - a.\n\nOnce that is done, d is fixed, and the problem reduces to finding x >= a, such that LCM(x, x +d) is minimized.\n\nSo, back to the plan.\n\nFor each divisor g of d, we can consider the case where GCD(x, d) = g. Then, x is a multiple of g, and since GCD(x, d) = g, then x/g and d/g must be coprime. Because x = g * m, d = g * n, and GCD(m, n) = 1.\n\nSo, for each possible divisor g of d, we can find the minimal m such that x = g*m >= a, and GCD(m, n) = 1, where n = d/g.\n\nOnce we find that m, then the corresponding LCM is g * m * (m + n). Which is g * m * (m + (d/g)).\n\nThen, among all possible g's (divisors of d), we can find the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\nBut also, there's another possibility: when x is such that x and x +d are coprime. Then, their LCM is x*(x +d). But perhaps for some cases, this is better than other options.\n\nBut how do we generate all possible candidates for the minimal LCM?\n\nThe idea is that the minimal LCM occurs when the GCD(x, d) is as large as possible. Because that would make the denominator larger, thus reducing the LCM. So, perhaps considering all possible divisors of d, and for each of them, find the minimal m that satisfies the conditions.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Compute d = b - a (after swapping a and b if needed to ensure a <= b).\n\n2. If d is zero, return 0.\n\n3. Else, find all divisors of d.\n\n4. For each divisor g of d:\n\n   a. Compute n = d / g.\n\n   b. Find the minimal m such that m >= ceil(a / g), and GCD(m, n) = 1.\n\n   c. Then, the candidate LCM is g * m * (m + n).\n\n   d. Also, compute the corresponding k = x - a = g*m -a.\n\n   e. Keep track of the minimal LCM and the corresponding k.\n\n5. Additionally, we need to consider the case where x is chosen such that x is as small as possible. For example, when x = a, which would correspond to k=0. But perhaps that's already covered in the above steps. Wait, but for some divisors g of d, the minimal m may not be possible. So, perhaps the above steps cover all possibilities.\n\nBut wait, perhaps there are other possibilities. For example, when x is not a multiple of any divisor of d. But according to our previous analysis, for any x, GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. So, for each x, there is a unique g that is GCD(x, d), which is a divisor of d. Therefore, considering all possible divisors of d will cover all possible cases.\n\nSo, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the problem is to find all divisors of d, then for each of them, compute the minimal m as described.\n\nBut how to find all divisors of d?\n\nWell, for d up to 1e9, the number of divisors is manageable. For example, even if d is 1e9, which is 2^9 * 5^9, the number of divisors is (9+1)*(9+1) = 100. So generating all divisors is feasible.\n\nSo first, generate all divisors of d.\n\nBut how to generate all divisors of a number?\n\nWe can factorize d into primes, then generate all combinations of exponents. However, for numbers up to 1e9, trial division is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, we can generate all divisors via trial division. Let me think.\n\nYes, for a given d, we can find all its divisors by checking numbers up to sqrt(d). For each i that divides d, add i and d/i to the list of divisors.\n\nOnce we have all divisors, we can process them.\n\nBut wait, in the code, for each divisor g of d, we need to process it. However, for each g, we can generate the minimal m.\n\nBut how to find the minimal m such that m >= m_min (where m_min = ceil(a/g)), and GCD(m, n) = 1, where n = d/g.\n\nSo, for example, m_min is the smallest integer m such that g*m >= a. So m_min = ceil(a/g). But since a and g are integers, m_min can be calculated as (a + g -1) // g.\n\nOnce m_min is found, we need to find the smallest m >= m_min such that GCD(m, n) = 1.\n\nBut how to find that m?\n\nWell, for n, the minimal m >= m_min that is coprime with n.\n\nIf m_min is coprime with n, then that's the answer. Otherwise, we need to check m_min +1, m_min +2, etc., until we find such an m.\n\nBut for large values of m_min and n, this could take time. However, since n can be up to d/g. Since d can be up to 1e9, and g is a divisor of d, so for example, if g is 1, then n = d, which can be up to 1e9. So for each such case, checking sequentially could be O(1) in practice, but worst case O(n), which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but for example, if n is 1e9, and m_min is 1e9, then checking m_min, m_min+1, ... until we find a coprime. But for n=1e9, which factors into 2^9 * 5^9, then the first m that is coprime with n is m_min if it's not divisible by 2 or 5. Otherwise, we need to check next numbers.\n\nBut in the worst case, this could be O(1) steps. For example, if m_min is even, then m_min +1 could be odd, but not divisible by 5. But how to find it quickly?\n\nBut given that the problem requires us to find the minimal k, and the minimal m for each divisor g, perhaps for each g, we can find the minimal m in O(1) or O(number of primes in n) steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find the minimal m >= m_min that is coprime with n. Let's think about how to find that.\n\nThe minimal m >= m_min such that GCD(m, n) = 1.\n\nBut for n, if m_min is coprime with n, then that's the answer. Otherwise, we can increment m by 1 until we find such an m. However, in the worst case, this could take O(k) steps where k is the number of consecutive numbers that share factors with n. However, since n is fixed, and m_min can be up to something like a/g, which for a up to 1e9 and g as small as 1, m_min can be up to 1e9. So this approach might not be feasible for large cases.\n\nBut perhaps in practice, for the given problem constraints, this approach is acceptable. Because for each divisor g of d, the number of steps required to find m is small. Let's think of examples.\n\nTake for instance, d = 4, and n = 4/g. Suppose g is 1, then n =4. Then, m_min is ceil(a/1) = a. Let's say a is 6. So m_min is 6. Check if GCD(6,4) is 1? No, GCD(6,4)=2. So check 7: GCD(7,4)=1. So m is 7. So that's only one step.\n\nAnother example: suppose n is 1000000000, and m_min is 1000000000. Then, check if m_min is coprime with n. Well, 1000000000 is 2^9*5^9. So m_min is 1e9. So GCD(1e9, 1e9) is 1e9. Not coprime. Then check m_min +1 = 1e9 +1. What's GCD(1e9 +1, 1e9)? Well, GCD(1e9 +1, 1e9) = GCD(1e9 +1 -1e9, 1e9) = GCD(1, 1e9) = 1. So m is 1e9 +1. So only one step.\n\nSo in general, for any n, the first m >= m_min that is coprime with n is either m_min or m_min +1, or maybe m_min + something small. Because if m_min is not coprime with n, then m_min +1 may be coprime. But how can we be sure?\n\nNot sure. However, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can proceed with this approach, and hope that in practice, the number of steps is small. Because even if for some cases, we have to check a few numbers, it's manageable.\n\nSo the code for this part would be:\n\ndef find_min_m(m_min, n):\n\n    m = m_min\n\n    while True:\n\n        if gcd(m, n) == 1:\n\n            return m\n\n        m += 1\n\nBut for very large m_min and n, this could be slow. However, given that d can be up to 1e9, and the number of divisors is small, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 1? Then any m is coprime with n. So m_min is the answer. So that's a special case.\n\nSo, the code can handle that.\n\nNow, the next step is to generate all divisors of d.\n\nBut how to generate all divisors of d?\n\nLet me think. For example, for d = 4, the divisors are 1, 2, 4.\n\nSo, the code can generate the divisors via trial division.\n\nSo here's a function to generate all divisors of a number d:\n\ndef get_divisors(d):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n\n        if d % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n\n    return sorted(divisors)\n\nBut note that for d=0, this function would not work. However, in our case, d is the difference between a and b, which is non-zero (since we handled the case when a = b earlier).\n\nSo once we have all the divisors, we can process each of them.\n\nOnce we have all the divisors, for each divisor g, we compute n = d // g.\n\nThen compute m_min = ceil(a / g). Which can be calculated as (a + g - 1) // g.\n\nThen, find the minimal m >= m_min such that GCD(m, n) = 1.\n\nOnce we find m, compute the candidate LCM as g * m * (m + n).\n\nThen, compute the corresponding k = g * m - a.\n\nBut wait, since x = g*m, and k = x - a.\n\nSo, for each divisor, we can compute the candidate k and LCM. Then, among all candidates, select the one with the minimal LCM. If there are multiple candidates with the same minimal LCM, choose the one with the smallest k.\n\nBut what about other possibilities? For example, what if the minimal LCM occurs when x is not generated from any of the divisors of d?\n\nNo, because earlier analysis shows that for any x, GCD(x, d) is a divisor of d. So the approach covers all possibilities.\n\nBut wait, there's another case: when x is such that x +d is smaller than x. But since d is positive (as we have a <= b), x +d is larger than x. So no problem.\n\nSo, after processing all divisors, we can collect all possible candidate k's and their LCMs, and then select the best one.\n\nBut also, there's another possible candidate: when x is chosen as (a + k) such that x is as small as possible. For example, when k is zero. But in that case, x is a, and y is a +d = b. So the LCM of a and b. But perhaps this case is already considered in the divisors of d.\n\nFor example, let's take the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 6 10. So a=6, b=10, d=4. The divisors of 4 are 1,2,4.\n\nFor each divisor:\n\nCase g=1:\n\nn = 4 /1 =4. m_min is ceil(6/1) =6. Now find m >=6, coprime with 4.\n\nCheck 6: GCD(6,4)=2 !=1. Next 7: GCD(7,4)=1. So m=7. Then LCM is 1 *7*(7+4) = 7*11=77. The corresponding k is 7*1 -6 =1.\n\nCase g=2:\n\nn=4/2=2. m_min is ceil(6/2) =3. Find m >=3, coprime with 2. The first m is 3 (since 3 is odd). So m=3. LCM is 2 * 3*(3+2) = 2*3*5=30. k is 2*3 -6 =0. Wait, but in the sample input, the correct answer is k=2. Wait, why?\n\nWait, this seems conflicting. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, in the sample input, the correct k is 2. Let me see what happens here.\n\nIf g=2, then m=3. Then x = 2*3 =6. So a +k =6. Since a is 6, k is 0. Then, the numbers are 6 and 6 +4=10. Their LCM is LCM(6,10) = 30. Which is indeed the case. But in the sample input, the correct answer is k=2, which gives numbers 8 and 12, LCM 24. So why is this case not considered?\n\nAh! Because there's another candidate. For example, when g=4.\n\nLet me check for g=4. n =4/4=1. m_min is ceil(6/4) =2. Find m >=2 coprime with 1. Since GCD(m, 1) is always 1, so m=2. Then LCM is 4 * 2*(2+1) =4*2*3=24. Which is better than 30. Then the corresponding k is 4*2 -6 =8-6=2. Which matches the sample's correct answer.\n\nSo, in this case, the code would find that for g=4, the candidate has LCM 24, which is better than others. So the code would select that.\n\nSo the code would generate for each divisor, and compare all the possible candidates. So the code would find that the minimal LCM is 24, with k=2.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nBut why in the case of g=2, the code finds a candidate with LCM 30. Which is worse than 24. So the code would select the minimal.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nAnother example: when a=5 and b=10. Then d=5. The divisors of 5 are 1,5.\n\nFor g=1: n=5. m_min is ceil(5/1)=5. Check m=5. GCD(5,5)=5 !=1. Next m=6. GCD(6,5)=1. So LCM is 1 *6*(6+5) =6*11=66. k=6*1 -5=1.\n\nFor g=5: n=5/5=1. m_min is ceil(5/5)=1. m=1. LCM is 5 *1*(1+1) =5*2=10. k=5*1 -5=0. Which is the correct answer. So the code would output 0, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code seems to work.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, handle a == b: output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute d = b -a (assuming a <= b).\n\nGenerate all divisors of d.\n\nFor each divisor g:\n\n   n = d // g\n\n   m_min = ceil(a / g) = (a + g -1) // g\n\n   find the minimal m >= m_min with GCD(m, n) = 1.\n\n   compute candidate_lcm = g * m * (m + n)\n\n   compute candidate_k = g * m - a\n\n   keep track of the minimal candidate_lcm and the corresponding k.\n\nOnce all divisors are processed, select the candidate with minimal LCM, and if tie, the smallest k.\n\nBut there's another case: when x is chosen such that x is less than a. But since k is non-negative, x must be >=a. So no.\n\nSo, the code needs to generate all possible candidates from the divisors, and then pick the best.\n\nBut what about the case where multiple divisors produce the same LCM? For example, two different divisors leading to same LCM but different k's. In that case, we need to pick the smallest k.\n\nNow, in code, how to implement this.\n\nSo, in code, for each candidate (lcm_value, k), we can track the minimum lcm_value, and among those, the minimum k.\n\nSo, the code can initialize min_lcm as a very big number, and min_k as a very big number.\n\nFor each candidate:\n\nif current_lcm < min_lcm:\n\n   update min_lcm and min_k.\n\nelif current_lcm == min_lcm:\n\n   if current_k < min_k:\n\n       update min_k.\n\nSo, after processing all candidates, output min_k.\n\nBut what about when there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM? For example, two different divisors leading to same LCM but different k's. The code would handle that.\n\nBut what about other possibilities? Like, for example, when the minimal LCM is achieved for multiple divisors, but with different k's.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the minimal LCM is achieved for multiple m's for the same divisor?\n\nNo, because for each divisor, we find the minimal m (smallest possible m >= m_min) that satisfies the condition. Thus, for each divisor, we have exactly one candidate.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate all divisors of d, which is the difference between a and b.\n\nBut how to generate the divisors correctly?\n\nAnother thing: when d is zero, we return 0. Otherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, code steps in Python:\n\nRead a and b.\n\nif a == b:\n\n   print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n   if a > b:\n\n      swap a and b.\n\n   d = b - a.\n\n   generate all divisors of d.\n\n   for each divisor g in divisors:\n\n      n = d // g\n\n      m_min = (a + g -1) // g\n\n      find the minimal m >= m_min where gcd(m, n) == 1.\n\n      compute candidate_lcm and candidate_k.\n\n   collect all candidates and select the best.\n\nBut how to generate the divisors.\n\nImplementing get_divisors as discussed.\n\nBut note that in Python, math.isqrt is available in Python 3.8 and above. So for code compatibility, perhaps using int(math.sqrt(d)) + 1. But for code correctness, perhaps better to use math.isqrt.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef get_divisors(d):\n\n    divisors = set()\n\n    for i in range(1, int(math.isqrt(d)) + 1):\n\n        if d % i == 0:\n\n            divisors.add(i)\n\n            divisors.add(d // i)\n\n    return divisors\n\nBut then, for example, d=4, the divisors would be {1,2,4}.\n\nOnce we have the divisors, process each.\n\nBut in code, for each divisor, we need to process it.\n\nBut also, note that the same divisor can be generated multiple times (for example, when d is a square, i and d//i are same). But the set takes care of that.\n\nNow, the code for the main part.\n\nBut also, note that for each divisor g, the code may generate a candidate. However, there's also the case when x is such that x is not generated by any of the divisors. But according to the earlier analysis, that's not possible.\n\nBut now, the code can proceed.\n\nBut what about when the minimal m is not found? Well, since m can be as big as needed, and since for any n, there exists m >= m_min that is coprime with n. For example, m_min + 1, m_min + 2, etc. So the loop will eventually find it.\n\nBut for code, how to implement that loop.\n\nImplementing the find_min_m function.\n\nBut in code, for each m starting from m_min, check if gcd(m, n) == 1.\n\nBut for large n, this can be time-consuming. However, given that the number of divisors is small, and for each case, the number of steps is small, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n\n    while b:\n\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\ndef find_min_m(m_min, n):\n\n    m = m_min\n\n    while True:\n\n        if gcd(m, n) == 1:\n\n            return m\n\n        m += 1\n\nBut for cases where n is 0? Wait, no. Because d is non-zero, and g is a divisor of d. So n = d/g. Since d is non-zero and g is a divisor of d, n is non-zero. So no problem.\n\nBut in code, when d is zero, we have already handled that case.\n\nNow, putting it all together.\n\nRead a and b:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\nif a == b:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    if a > b:\n\n        a, b = b, a\n\n    d = b - a\n\n    divisors = get_divisors(d)\n\n    min_lcm = float('inf')\n\n    min_k = float('inf')\n\n    for g in divisors:\n\n        n = d // g\n\n        m_min = (a + g -1) // g\n\n        # find m >= m_min with gcd(m, n) == 1\n\n        m = find_min_m(m_min, n)\n\n        current_lcm = g * m * (m + n)\n\n        current_k = g * m - a\n\n        # compare with min_lcm and min_k\n\n        if current_lcm < min_lcm or (current_lcm == min_lcm and current_k < min_k):\n\n            min_lcm = current_lcm\n\n            min_k = current_k\n\n    print(min_k)\n\nWait, but what about when there are multiple divisors leading to the same LCM? The code will choose the one with the smallest k.\n\nBut what if there are other candidates that are not covered by the divisors? For example, suppose that for some x not generated by any of the divisors, but that's impossible according to our analysis.\n\nBut let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 6 10 → a=6, b=10, d=4.\n\ndivisors of 4 are {1, 2, 4}.\n\nProcessing each:\n\nFor g=1:\n\nn=4, m_min=(6 +1 -1)//1 =6. find m=6. gcd(6,4)=2 !=1. Then m=7. gcd(7,4)=1. current_lcm=1 *7*(7+4) = 77. current_k=7*1 -6=1.\n\nFor g=2:\n\nn=4//2=2. m_min=(6 +2-1)//2 = (7)//2=3. find m=3. gcd(3,2)=1. current_lcm=2*3*(3+2)= 2*3*5=30. current_k= 2*3 -6 =0.\n\nFor g=4:\n\nn=4//4=1. m_min=(6 +4-1)//4 → (9)//4 =2. find m=2. gcd(2,1)=1. current_lcm=4 *2*(2+1) =4*2*3=24. current_k=4*2 -6=8-6=2.\n\nSo the min_lcm is 24, min_k is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother sample input: 21 31 → output is 9.\n\nLet me check.\n\nOriginal a=21, b=31. Since a < b, d=10. divisors of 10 are 1, 2,5,10.\n\nProcessing each:\n\nFor each divisor g in [1,2,5,10].\n\nLet's compute for each:\n\ng=1:\n\nn=10/1=10. m_min = (21 +1-1)/1 =21. find m >=21, coprime with 10.\n\nCheck 21: gcd(21,10)=1. Yes. So m=21. current_lcm = 1 *21*(21+10) =21*31=651. current_k=21*1 -21 =0.\n\nBut wait, the sample output is 9. So this candidate is not the best.\n\ng=2:\n\nn=10/2=5. m_min=(21 +2-1)/2 = (22)/2=11. find m >=11, coprime with 5. 11 is coprime with 5. So m=11. current_lcm =2 *11*(11+5) = 2*11*16= 352. current_k=2*11 -21 =22-21=1.\n\ng=5:\n\nn=10/5=2. m_min=(21 +5-1)/5 = (25)/5=5. find m >=5, coprime with 2. First m=5, which is odd. gcd(5,2)=1. So m=5. current_lcm=5 *5*(5+2) =5*5*7=175. current_k=5*5 -21 =25-21=4.\n\ng=10:\n\nn=10/10=1. m_min=(21 +10-1)/10 → (30)/10=3. m=3. gcd(3,1)=1. current_lcm=10 *3*(3+1) =10*3*4=120. current_k=3*10 -21=30-21=9. Which is the sample answer.\n\nSo among all candidates, the minimal LCM is 120 (from g=10), which gives k=9. So the code would output 9. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: 5 10. Output is 0.\n\nAs discussed earlier, for g=5, the code finds m=1, which gives k=0.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about the case when multiple divisors lead to same LCM?\n\nFor example, suppose a=2, b=4. d=2. Divisors are 1,2.\n\nFor g=1: n=2. m_min= (2 +1-1)/1=2. Check m=2. gcd(2,2)=2 !=1. Next m=3. gcd(3,2)=1. current_lcm=1 *3*(3+2)=15. k=3-2=1.\n\nFor g=2: n=1. m_min=(2 +2-1)/2 =3//2=1. m=1. current_lcm=2*1*(1+1)=4. k=2*1 -2=0. So the minimal is 0. Correct.\n\nSo code works.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=5. d=2. Divisors 1,2.\n\nFor g=",
