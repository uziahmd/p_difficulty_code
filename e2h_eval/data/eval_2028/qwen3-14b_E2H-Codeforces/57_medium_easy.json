His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have based on the given points from two tours. The problem says that Vasya's total is at least x. But how do I model this?\n\nFirst, the best possible rank. For that, I want Vasya's total to be as high as possible. So, I should pair his maximum possible a_i with maximum possible b_j. Wait, but since the teacher has the results of both tours, but they are in arbitrary order. So for the best case, we can assume that Vasya's a_i and b_j are chosen such that their sum is the maximum possible. But how do I find that?\n\nWait, no. Because the actual participants are all the combinations of a_i and b_j. Wait, no. Wait, each participant has one a_i and one b_j. But the problem says that the input gives the a's and b's in arbitrary order. So the original participants are each a_i and b_j, but the pairing between them is unknown. Oh right! Because the problem says that the teacher has the results of the first and second tour, but they are given in arbitrary order. So for example, the first tour's points are a1, a2,... an, and the second tour's are b1, b2,... bn. But each participant has exactly one a and one b. But the pairing between the a's and b's is not known. So the teacher has to consider all possible pairings of a's and b's, and then find the best and worst possible ranks that Vasya could have.\n\nBut wait, Vasya's total is at least x. So, for the best rank, we want to choose a pair (a_i + b_j) that is as large as possible, but also, when considering all other possible pairs, how does that affect the rank?\n\nWait, but the problem says that there exists some i and j such that a_i + b_j >= x. So Vasya is present in the Olympiad.\n\nSo the problem is to find, considering all possible pairings of a's and b's (each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa), what is the best possible rank (minimum possible) and worst possible rank (maximum possible) that Vasya can have, given that his total is at least x.\n\nWait, but how does the pairing affect the possible ranks? Because the pairing determines the sum for each participant. For example, if we pair a_i with b_j, then that participant's total is a_i + b_j. So the teacher needs to consider all possible pairings of a's and b's, and for each possible pairing, determine Vasya's rank (assuming that his sum is at least x). Then find the best and worst possible ranks across all possible pairings.\n\nBut how can we model this? Because considering all possible pairings is computationally impossible for n up to 1e5. So there must be a smarter way.\n\nLet me think again. The best possible rank for Vasya would be when his sum is as high as possible, and others' sums are as low as possible. Similarly, the worst possible rank would be when his sum is as low as possible (but still >=x) and others' sums are as high as possible.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nFor the best possible rank:\n\nWe can choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya. That is, take the maximum a_i and maximum b_j. Then, count how many other participants have a sum greater than this value. The best rank is that count + 1. But wait, because in the case of ties, the jury can assign the ranks in any way. So if there are multiple people with the same sum as Vasya, he can be placed first (if possible) or last among them.\n\nWait, the problem says that if two or more participants have the same sum, the jury can assign places according to their choice. So for the best possible rank, we can assume that Vasya is placed as high as possible. So for example, if his sum is the maximum, he gets rank 1. If there are others with same sum, he can be considered first. So for the best rank, we can imagine that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and that all others with higher sum are counted, and he is placed first among those with same sum.\n\nSimilarly, for the worst possible rank, we want to imagine that his sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and others have as high as possible sums. So the worst rank would be the number of participants with sum strictly higher than his plus the number of participants with same sum as him (since he can be placed last among them).\n\nSo the approach is:\n\nBest rank:\n\nFind the maximum possible sum that Vasya can have (which is max_a + max_b). Then, count how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than this value. The best rank is that count + 1.\n\nWait, but how do we compute how many participants can have a sum strictly greater than this value? Because the pairing of a and b determines that. So if we choose the maximum possible sum for Vasya, then the other participants are paired in a way that their sum is as small as possible. But how?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think again. For the best possible rank, we want to arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and others' sums are as low as possible. But how can we model that?\n\nAlternatively, for the best possible scenario, Vasya's sum is as high as possible. Then, the minimal number of people who can have a higher sum than him. To find that, we can take the maximum possible sum for Vasya (say, S), and then find the minimal number of people that can have a sum greater than S, given that the a's and b's are paired optimally to minimize that number.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by choosing the maximum possible sum for Vasya, and then for the other participants, pairing their a's and b's in a way that their sum is as small as possible. But how can we compute the number of people that have a sum higher than Vasya's sum?\n\nAlternatively, think that the best possible rank is determined by the maximum possible sum for Vasya, and then the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) that can be formed (without overlapping elements) that have a sum strictly greater than that.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nWait, but here's an idea: for the best possible rank, we can choose Vasya's sum as the maximum possible (so, the maximum a_i + maximum b_j). Then, for the rest of the participants, we need to pair the remaining a's and b's in a way that minimizes the number of people with sum higher than Vasya's sum. How can we do that?\n\nBut perhaps this is overcomplicating. Because the problem allows any pairing, so for the best rank, we can arrange that Vasya's sum is as high as possible, and for the others, arrange their pairings such that as few as possible have a higher sum than Vasya's.\n\nBut how can we compute the minimal possible number of people with sum > S, where S is the maximum possible sum for Vasya?\n\nAlternatively, think that for the best rank, the minimal possible number of people that can have a sum greater than Vasya's sum. So regardless of how you pair the a's and b's, the maximum number of people that could have a higher sum than S is some value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best possible rank is determined by the following:\n\nThe maximum possible sum for Vasya is S = max_a + max_b. Then, the number of people that can have a sum greater than S is zero. Because if you pair the other a's with other b's, but how?\n\nWait, no. Suppose that S is the sum of the maximum a and maximum b. Then, for other participants, the sum can't be higher than S. Because the maximum a and maximum b are already used for Vasya. So the other a's are less than or equal to max_a, and the other b's are less than or equal to max_b. But their sum could be up to max_a + max_b (if another a is max_a and another b is max_b). Wait, but if you have multiple a's with max_a and multiple b's with max_b, then pairing them would allow other participants to have sum S. So for example, if there are two a_i's with max_a and two b_j's with max_b, then even after taking one of each for Vasya, the other can be paired to get sum S again.\n\nBut in that case, the number of people with sum greater than S is zero. So for the best rank, the best possible is 1, because Vasya's sum is S, and others can have sum <= S. So in that case, the best rank is 1.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1, because we can arrange that Vasya's sum is the maximum possible, and others can't have a higher sum. But wait, is that possible?\n\nYes. Because if we pair the maximum a with maximum b for Vasya. Then, for the rest of the participants, even if you pair the next highest a with the next highest b, their sum will be less than or equal to S.\n\nBut how can we be sure that there's no other pair that can have sum higher than S? Because S is the maximum possible sum of any pair. So for example, if you have a_i and b_j, then the maximum possible sum is max_a + max_b. So any other pair will have a sum less than or equal to that. Therefore, if Vasya's sum is S, then there can't be any other participant with sum higher than S. Hence, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nBut wait, in the first sample input, all the a's are 1 and all the b's are 1. So S is 2. All other participants have sum 2. So the best possible rank is 1, and the worst is 5. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo for the best rank, it's always 1? No, wait. What if there are other participants whose sum is equal to S? Then, depending on how the jury assigns the ranks, Vasya can be first. So the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. But why in the sample input, the answer is 1 for the first case. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut then why in the second example, the best rank is 1. Because Vasya can have a sum of 4+8=12, which is the maximum possible. So yes.\n\nSo then, for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. But that can't be correct. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose there are two participants. Suppose a1=3, a2=2. b1=3, b2=2. x is 4. So Vasya's sum is at least 4. The maximum possible sum for Vasya is 3+3=6. Then, the other participant's sum is 2+2=4. So Vasya's sum is higher than others. So best rank is 1.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are two participants. a1=5, a2=5. b1=5, b2=5. x is 10. Then, the maximum sum for Vasya is 5+5=10. The other participant's sum is 5+5=10. So in this case, the best possible rank is 1 (since the jury can assign him first place). So yes.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the best possible rank is 1. But why then in the sample input, the output is 1 for the first case. So that seems to hold.\n\nWait, but what if there's someone else with a higher sum than Vasya's maximum possible sum? No, because Vasya's maximum possible sum is the maximum possible sum of any pair. So that can't happen. Therefore, the best possible rank is 1.\n\nSo that's the best possible rank. So the first part of the answer is always 1. But wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, what if the maximum possible sum for Vasya is not achievable? No, the problem says that it is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. So for the best case, we can choose that pair to be the maximum possible sum.\n\nSo for the best possible rank, the answer is 1. So that's straightforward.\n\nNow, the worst possible rank. How to compute that?\n\nFor the worst possible rank, we need to arrange the pairings such that Vasya's sum is as low as possible (but still >=x), and the number of participants with sum strictly greater than his sum is as large as possible. Also, the number of participants with the same sum as him is as large as possible, so that he can be placed last among them.\n\nSo, how to find this?\n\nFirst, we need to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya that is >=x. Then, we need to calculate the maximum number of participants that can have a sum strictly greater than that, plus the number of participants with the same sum (since he can be placed last among them).\n\nBut how to find that minimal sum? Well, the minimal sum is x (but perhaps not, but the minimal sum is the minimal possible sum that is >=x). So for example, if x is 2, and there exists a pair with sum 2, then that's the minimal sum for Vasya.\n\nBut how to choose this sum? Because for the worst case, we need to choose the minimal possible sum (so that more people can have higher sums than him). So the minimal sum is x, but only if there exists a pair with sum exactly x. Otherwise, it's the minimal sum that is >=x.\n\nBut how to find the minimal possible sum for Vasya that is >=x. Well, that's the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. However, the problem states that there exists at least one pair that is >=x. So we can find the minimal possible sum S for Vasya, which is the minimal value of a_i + b_j that is >=x. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the worst case scenario, we can assume that Vasya's sum is exactly x (if possible), and then maximize the number of participants with sum >=x. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut to find the worst possible rank, we need to find the maximum possible number of participants that can have sum strictly greater than Vasya's sum, plus the number of participants with sum equal to his sum (so that he is placed last in that group).\n\nSo, to maximize the number of participants with sum > S, where S is Vasya's sum (which is >=x and as small as possible), we need to choose S as small as possible (so that more people can have higher sums than him).\n\nTherefore, the steps for the worst case are:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible S that is >=x. This is the minimal sum that Vasya can have. Let's call this S_min.\n\nBut how to find S_min? Well, S_min is the minimal sum such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum >=x. But to find the minimal sum that is >=x, perhaps we can find the minimal possible sum that is >=x. For example, if there's a pair with sum exactly x, that's the minimal possible. Otherwise, the minimal possible sum is the minimal sum that is larger than x.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the worst case scenario, we can choose S to be the minimal possible sum (>=x) that can be achieved. Then, we need to find the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S, and the number of participants that have sum == S.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nLet me think about how to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S, given that S is fixed.\n\nBut how to find S? Well, for the worst case, S is the minimal possible sum that is >=x. So the minimal S is the minimal value such that there exists a pair (a_i, b_j) with a_i + b_j >=x. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the worst case, we can choose S as the minimal possible sum that is >=x, and then compute how many pairs can have sum > S, given that the pairings are arranged to maximize that count.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, think of it like this: For the worst possible rank, we need to arrange the pairings such that as many other participants as possible have sum greater than Vasya's sum. So, for that, we need to choose Vasya's sum to be as small as possible (so that others can have higher sums), and then arrange the pairings to maximize the number of participants with sum greater than Vasya's sum.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Find the minimal possible sum S that is >=x. This S can be found by checking all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) and finding the minimal one that is >=x. However, since n is up to 1e5, checking all pairs is O(n^2), which is impossible.\n\nWait, but n is 1e5. So O(n^2) is impossible. Therefore, we need a smarter approach.\n\nBut how can we find the minimal possible sum S that is >=x? For that, we can sort the a array and the b array, and for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then take the minimal of all those values.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nYes. Let's sort the a array in ascending order. Then, for each a_i, find the minimal b_j that when added to a_i gives >=x. Since the b array is sorted, we can use binary search for each a_i.\n\nBut since we want the minimal possible S, which is the minimal a_i + b_j >=x, then we can proceed as follows:\n\nSort the a array in ascending order. Sort the b array in ascending order. For each a_i in the a array, find the minimal b_j that is >= (x - a_i). Then, the minimal S would be a_i + b_j. We can take the minimum of all these possible values.\n\nBut since the a array is sorted, perhaps we can find the minimal S efficiently.\n\nOnce we have the minimal S, then we can proceed to compute the maximum number of participants that can have a sum > S.\n\nBut how?\n\nWait, but how do we find the maximum number of participants that can have sum > S, given that S is fixed and that we can pair the a and b arrays in any way, but with the constraint that exactly one pair is S (for Vasya's sum). Or is that not required?\n\nNo. Because Vasya's sum is S, but the other participants can have any pairings. However, the pairing must be such that each a and b is used exactly once.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: given two arrays a and b, find the maximum number of pairs (a_i, b_j) such that a_i + b_j > S. But how to compute that, given that S is fixed?\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j > S. How to do that?\n\nThe standard approach for this is to sort one array and use two pointers.\n\nFor example, sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, find the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet and such that a_i + b_j > S. But I think that the optimal way to maximize the number of pairs is to pair the smallest a with the largest possible b that makes the sum > S.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose we sort a in ascending order and b in descending order. Then, for each a_i, we try to pair it with the largest possible b_j that hasn't been used yet and such that a_i + b_j > S. If this is possible, we count it and move on.\n\nAlternatively, here's a standard approach for this problem:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize two pointers, i starting at 0 (beginning of a), j starting at n-1 (end of b). Count the number of pairs where a[i] + b[j] > S. If so, increment count, move i forward and j backward. Else, move i forward.\n\nThis approach gives the maximum number of pairs where a_i + b_j > S.\n\nLet me think about this. For example, if a is [1, 2, 3], b is [4, 5, 6], and S is 5. Then, the maximum number of pairs is 3: 1+6=7>5, 2+5=7>5, 3+4=7>5. Using the two pointers approach:\n\ni=0, j=2. a[0]+b[2]=1+6=7>5 → count +=1. i=1, j=1. a[1]+b[1]=2+5=7>5 → count +=1. i=2, j=0. a[2]+b[0]=3+4=7>5 → count +=1. Total 3.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [1, 1, 1], b = [1, 1, 1], S=2. The maximum number of pairs is 0, since all sums are 2. So the approach would check a[0] + b[2] = 2, which is not > 2. So we move i forward. Then a[1] + b[2] = 2 again. So again, move i forward. Then a[2] + b[2] = 2. So count remains 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a = [1, 3, 5], b = [2, 4, 6], S = 5. The maximum number of pairs is 2 (3+4=7, 5+2=7, but 1+6=7. So all three pairs can be made. But how does the two pointers approach work?\n\nWait, initial i=0 (a=1), j=2 (b=6). 1+6=7>5 → count=1. i=1, j=1. a=3, b=4: 7>5 → count=2. i=2, j=0. a=5 + b=2=7>5 → count=3. So the approach gives 3.\n\nYes, which is correct.\n\nSo this approach works. Thus, the maximum number of pairs with sum > S is computed as follows:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order. Initialize i=0, j =n-1. count =0. while i <n and j >=0:\n\nif a[i] + b[j] > S: count +=1, i +=1, j -=1.\n\nelse: i +=1.\n\nThus, this gives the maximum number of pairs possible with sum > S.\n\nSo, for the worst case scenario, the steps are:\n\n1. Find the minimal possible S (>=x) that can be achieved by any pair (a_i, b_j). Let's call this S_min.\n\nBut how to find S_min?\n\nAs discussed earlier, we can sort a and b, and for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x. Then take the minimal of all those possibilities.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. Sort a and b in ascending order. For each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that b_j >= (x - a_i). Since the array is sorted, we can perform a binary search for (x - a_i) in b. For each a_i, the minimal b_j that satisfies this is the first element in b that is >= (x - a_i). If such a b_j exists, then the sum is a_i + b_j. We can compute this for all a_i and take the minimal sum among them. However, since we need to find the minimal S_min, which is the minimal sum that is >=x.\n\nBut since we need to find the minimal S_min, perhaps we can find the minimal sum over all possible pairs (a_i, b_j) that are >=x.\n\nBut for that, the approach would be:\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize the minimal S to be something very large.\n\nFor each a_i in a:\n\n   target = x - a_i\n\n   find the first index in b where b_j >= target. Let's call this index 'pos'.\n\n   if pos exists (i.e., pos < n):\n\n       current_sum = a_i + b[pos]\n\n       if current_sum < current_min:\n\n           current_min = current_sum\n\nThus, the minimal S_min is current_min.\n\nBut this is O(n log n) time, since for each a_i, binary search on b is O(log n).\n\nOnce we have S_min, then we can compute the maximum number of pairs with sum > S_min. Let's call this count_high. Then, the worst possible rank is count_high + 1 (since Vasya is one of the participants with sum S_min, and there are count_high participants with sum > S_min. But also, there may be other participants with sum equal to S_min. So how to account for that?\n\nWait, the worst possible rank is count_high + (number of participants with sum equal to S_min). Because if there are k participants with sum equal to S_min, then Vasya can be placed last among them. So his rank would be count_high + k.\n\nBut how to compute the number of participants with sum equal to S_min?\n\nBut how can we compute that, given that the pairing is arranged to maximize count_high and also maximize the number of participants with sum equal to S_min?\n\nWait, but in the worst case scenario, we want to maximize the number of people with sum >= S_min. Because that would increase the rank. However, the count_high is the number of people with sum > S_min. So the number of people with sum equal to S_min is the total number of pairs with sum equal to S_min. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the worst possible rank is count_high + the number of pairs that can be formed with sum equal to S_min. However, since in the pairing, one of those pairs is Vasya's, and the rest are others. So the total number of participants with sum equal to S_min is (total_pairs_equal_S_min), and thus the worst rank is count_high + total_pairs_equal_S_min.\n\nBut how to compute the number of pairs that can be formed with sum equal to S_min, given that the pairing is arranged to maximize count_high and then maximize the number of pairs with sum equal to S_min.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, perhaps the way to compute the worst possible rank is as follows:\n\nOnce we have S_min, the worst possible rank is the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S_min, and then the rank is that number.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the worst possible rank is the number of participants that can have sum >= S_min. Because if there are K participants with sum >= S_min, then Vasya can be placed K-th (since he is one of them). But how to compute that?\n\nBut how to compute the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S_min, given that the pairings are arranged to maximize this number. Because that would give the worst possible rank.\n\nBut this seems like a different problem. How to compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAgain, using the two pointers approach. Let me think. For example, to find the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min.\n\nSort a in ascending order, sort b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize i=0, j =n-1. count =0.\n\nWhile i <n and j >=0:\n\n   if a[i] + b[j] >= S_min:\n\n       count +=1\n\n       i +=1\n\n       j -=1\n\n   else:\n\n       i +=1\n\nThis would give the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min. So the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S_min is count.\n\nBut then, since Vasya is one of them, the worst possible rank is count.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause in this case, the maximum number of participants that can have sum >= S_min is count. So Vasya is one of them, and he can be placed last among them. So his rank is count.\n\nBut how does this relate to the previous count_high and count_equal?\n\nWell, count_high is the number of participants with sum > S_min. Then, the number of participants with sum >= S_min is count_high + count_equal. So the worst possible rank is count_high + count_equal.\n\nBut according to the two pointers approach, the count gives the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min, which is count_high + count_equal. So the worst possible rank is count.\n\nSo for the worst case, the steps are:\n\nFind S_min (the minimal sum >=x), then compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min, which is count. Then, the worst possible rank is count.\n\nBut how to find S_min?\n\nLet me think again. Let's take the first sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=5, x=2.\n\na = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nb = [1,1,1,1,1]\n\nFor S_min, the minimal sum >=x is 2. So S_min is 2.\n\nThen, the maximum number of pairs with sum >=2 is 5 (all pairs sum to 2). So the worst rank is 5.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n6 7\n\na: [4,3,5,6,4,4]\n\nb: [8,6,0,4,3,4]\n\nSo x=7.\n\nWe need to find the minimal S_min >=7.\n\nLet me sort a and b.\n\na sorted: [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n\nb sorted: [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\nFor each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=7.\n\nLet's go through each a_i:\n\na_i=3: need b_j >=4. The first such is 4. So sum is 3+4=7.\n\na_i=4: need b_j >=3. The first is 3. sum 4+3=7.\n\na_i=4: same as above. sum 7.\n\na_i=4: same. sum 7.\n\na_i=5: need b_j >=2. The first is 0? No. Wait 5 +0 is 5 <7. So need b_j >= 7-5=2. The first b_j >=2 is 3. So sum 5+3=8.\n\na_i=6: need b_j >=1. First is 0. 6+0=6 <7. Next is 3. 6+3=9 >=7. So sum is 9.\n\nSo the minimal S_min is 7.\n\nNow, compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >=7.\n\nUsing the two pointers approach:\n\nsorted a: [3,4,4,4,5,6]\n\nsorted b: [0,3,4,4,6,8]\n\ni=0, j=5. a[0]=3, b[5]=8. 3+8=11 >=7 → count=1. i=1, j=4.\n\na[1]=4, b[4]=6 → 10 >=7 → count=2. i=2, j=3.\n\na[2]=4, b[3]=4 → 8 >=7 → count=3. i=3, j=2.\n\na[3]=4, b[2]=4 → 8 >=7 → count=4. i=4, j=1.\n\na[4]=5, b[1]=3 → 5+3=8 >=7 → count=5. i=5, j=0.\n\na[5]=6, b[0]=0 → 6+0=6 <7 → i increments to 6, loop ends.\n\nTotal count is 5. So the worst possible rank is 5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach seems to work.\n\nSo putting it all together, the steps are:\n\nFor best rank:\n\nAlways 1.\n\nFor worst rank:\n\nCompute S_min (minimal sum >=x).\n\nThen compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min. That is the worst possible rank.\n\nBut how to compute S_min?\n\nAs discussed earlier, by sorting a and b, and for each a_i, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x, and take the minimal sum among all those possibilities.\n\nSo let's code this.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut first, how to handle the S_min computation.\n\nImplementing:\n\nSort a and b in ascending order.\n\nInitialize min_sum to a very high value (like infinity).\n\nFor each ai in a:\n\n   target = x - ai\n\n   find the first index in b where b_j >= target.\n\n   if such index exists, then current_sum = ai + b_j.\n\n   compare to min_sum, and keep the minimum.\n\nOnce all ai are processed, S_min is min_sum.\n\nBut how to find the first index in b where b_j >= target?\n\nWe can use the bisect module's bisect_left function.\n\nSo for each ai in a:\n\ntarget = x - ai\n\npos = bisect.bisect_left(b, target)\n\nif pos < len(b):\n\n   current_sum = ai + b[pos]\n\n   if current_sum < min_sum:\n\n       min_sum = current_sum\n\nelse:\n\n   continue (but since the problem says that there is at least one pair, we don't need to worry about this case).\n\nOnce we have S_min, then compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min using the two pointers approach.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the two pointers approach, we need to sort a and b again (but they are already sorted for the S_min computation).\n\nSo, the code outline is:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead list a.\n\nRead list b.\n\nSort a.\n\nSort b.\n\nCompute S_min:\n\nmin_sum = infinity\n\nfor ai in a:\n\n    target = x - ai\n\n    pos = bisect.bisect_left(b, target)\n\n    if pos < len(b):\n\n        current_sum = ai + b[pos]\n\n        if current_sum < min_sum:\n\n            min_sum = current_sum\n\nSo S_min is min_sum.\n\nThen compute the maximum number of pairs with sum >= S_min.\n\nInitialize i=0, j =n-1, count=0.\n\nwhile i < n and j >=0:\n\n    if a[i] + b[j] >= S_min:\n\n        count +=1\n\n        i +=1\n\n        j -=1\n\n    else:\n\n        i +=1\n\nworst_rank = count\n\nThus, the output is '1 ' + str(worst_rank).\n\nBut wait, in the first sample, the worst_rank is 5, which is correct.\n\nIn the second sample, the worst_rank is 5, which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: suppose n=1, x=0. a=[0], b=[0]. Then S_min is 0. The maximum number of pairs with sum >=0 is 1. So worst_rank is 1. Output is 1 1.\n\nAnother case: n=2, x=3. a = [1, 2], b = [2, 3]. For S_min:\n\nCheck each a_i:\n\na[0] =1 → target is 3-1=2. Find in b: 2 is at index 0. sum is 1+2=3.\n\na[1] =2 → target is 1. Find in b first element >=1 is 2 (index 0). sum is 2+2=4. So min_sum is 3.\n\nThen compute maximum pairs with sum >=3.\n\nsorted a is [1,2], sorted b is [2,3].\n\ni=0, j=1: 1+3=4 >=3 → count=1. i=1, j=0: 2+2=4 >=3 → count=2. So worst_rank is 2. So output is 1 2.\n\nBut what if Vasya is one of the two, and the other has sum 3. So the worst possible rank is 2. Which makes sense.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nBut what about cases where there are multiple ways to get S_min?\n\nBut the code finds the minimal possible S_min, which is correct for the worst case.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where x is zero. For example, n=1, x=0. a=[0], b=[0]. Then S_min is 0. The maximum pairs with sum >=0 is 1. So output is 1 1.\n\nAnother case: x is very large. For example, n=2, x=100. a = [50, 50], b = [50, 50]. Then S_min is 100. The maximum pairs with sum >=100 is 2. So worst rank is 2.\n\nBut in that case, the best rank is 1, worst is 2.\n\nBut what if there are multiple pairs with sum equal to S_min. For example, n=3, x=2, a=[1,1,1], b=[1,1,1]. S_min is 2. The maximum number of pairs with sum >=2 is 3. So worst rank",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could achieve in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves efficiently calculating these ranks using sorting and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: The best possible rank Vasya can achieve is always 1. This is because we can always pair the highest scores from both tours to maximize Vasya's total score, ensuring he is at the top of the rankings.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To determine the worst possible rank, we need to:\n   - Find the minimum possible score (S_min) that Vasya can have while still meeting or exceeding the given minimum score x.\n   - Calculate the maximum number of participants who can have a score greater than or equal to S_min using a two-pointer technique on sorted arrays.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    \n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Compute S_min\n    min_sum = float('inf')\n    for ai in a_sorted:\n        target = x - ai\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(b_sorted, target)\n        if pos < len(b_sorted):\n            current_sum = ai + b_sorted[pos]\n            if current_sum < min_sum:\n                min_sum = current_sum\n    \n    # Compute worst rank\n    i = 0\n    j = n - 1\n    count = 0\n    while i < n and j >= 0:\n        if a_sorted[i] + b_sorted[j] >= min_sum:\n            count += 1\n            i += 1\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    print(\"1\", count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of participants `n`, the minimum score `x`, and the scores from the two tours.\n2. **Sorting**: Both the scores from the first and second tours are sorted to facilitate efficient searching and pairing.\n3. **Finding Minimum Possible Score (S_min)**: Using binary search, we determine the minimum score Vasya can have while still meeting the threshold `x`. This is done by checking each element in the sorted first tour scores and finding the smallest corresponding element in the second tour scores that meets the required sum.\n4. **Calculating Worst Rank**: Using a two-pointer technique on the sorted arrays, we determine the maximum number of participants who can have a score greater than or equal to S_min. This gives the worst possible rank for Vasya as this count represents how many participants could potentially be ranked higher or equal to him.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute both the best and worst possible ranks using sorting and binary search, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n log n).",
