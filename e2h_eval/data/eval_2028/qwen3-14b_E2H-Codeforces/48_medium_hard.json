He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the task is to convert a number from base a to base b, which could be Roman numerals. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nFirst, I need to read the input. The first line has a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. Then the next line is the number c in base a. So the plan is:\n\n1. Convert the input number c (which is in base a) to a decimal integer.\n2. Then convert that decimal integer to base b. But if b is 'R', then convert to Roman numerals instead of a regular base.\n\nSo the main steps are converting from base a to decimal, then converting from decimal to base b or Roman.\n\nLet me think about the first part: converting c from base a to decimal. The input c can have leading zeros, but that's okay because when converting to decimal, leading zeros don't affect the value. However, the problem says that if Roman numerals are involved, the number is non-zero and <= 3000 in decimal. Also, for other cases, it's up to 1e15.\n\nBut how to handle the conversion from base a? For example, if a is 10, then the input is a normal decimal number. But if a is 16, then the digits can include letters like A-F (assuming that the input c uses letters for digits above 9). Wait, the problem says that in the input, c is given in base a. But how are the digits represented? For example, if a is 12, then digits can be 0-9, A, B? Or does the input use letters for digits beyond 9?\n\nWait, looking at the note: \"Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.\" So when converting from base a, the input c may contain letters for digits >=10. For example, if a is 12, then the digit 'A' represents 10, 'B' represents 11. So the input c can have letters in uppercase? Or lowercase? Well, the problem says that in the sample input, there's a case like '12 13\\nA' which outputs 'A'. So probably the input is using uppercase letters for digits above 9. So during the conversion from base a, we need to process each character of c as a digit in base a, where digits can be 0-9, A-Z (for values 10 and up).\n\nSo first, I need to write a function that converts a string (like 'A') in base a to a decimal integer. Let's think about that.\n\nFor example, for the input 'A' in base 12: that's 10 in decimal.\n\nSo for the first step, the code needs to parse the string c into a decimal number. Let's think about how to do that.\n\nThe function would iterate over each character in the string, and for each character, convert it to its numerical value. For example, '0' is 0, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. Then multiply by a^position and sum.\n\nBut wait, the input c can be up to 10^3 characters long. For a base up to 25, that's a big number. But since Python can handle big integers, that's okay. However, converting a very long string (like 1000 characters) in base 25 would take some time, but for the constraints given, it's manageable.\n\nSo the code for converting c from base a to decimal would be:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\nWait, but what if the input has lowercase letters? Well, the problem says that the input is given in base a, but the sample input shows 'A' in the input. So perhaps the input uses uppercase letters. But the problem statement says that the input is given with letters as needed. So the code should handle uppercase letters, and maybe convert to uppercase.\n\nBut the problem says that the input may have letters for digits above 9. So, for example, in base 16, the input could be 'A' which is 10, 'B' 11, etc. So the code for converting each character to its value is important.\n\nNow, once we have the decimal value, the next step is converting it to base b, which can be a number or 'R'.\n\nSo for the second part:\n\nIf b is not 'R', then we need to convert the decimal number to base b. The output must not have leading zeros. For example, if the decimal is zero, but according to the problem statement, when Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. But in other cases, the input can be zero? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe input says that c may be zero (the note says that if Roman numerals are included, the number is not zero. In other cases, it's not greater than 1e15. So for example, if the input is zero, and the output is in base 2, then output is 0. But the problem says to omit leading zeros, so for zero, the output is just 0.\n\nSo for converting decimal to base b (non-R), the steps are:\n\n- Handle zero case: if the number is zero, output is '0'.\n- Else, convert to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z as needed for bases >10.\n- Omit leading zeros.\n\nSo for example, converting 4 to base 2 is 100. But if the input is zero, output is '0'.\n\nNow, the code for converting decimal to base b:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    # Now reverse the digits and convert to characters\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    result = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            result += str(d)\n        else:\n            result += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return result\n\nWait, but for example, if the number is zero, we return '0'. Otherwise, we process as above.\n\nBut what if the input is zero and the base is R? Well, according to the problem statement, when Roman numerals are involved, the input is not zero. So the code can assume that when converting to Roman, the number is non-zero.\n\nNow, the other case is when b is 'R', then convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nSo the code needs a function to convert a decimal number (<=3000) to Roman numerals.\n\nHow to do that? Let's think about the standard approach. The Roman numerals are built using subtractive notation. The standard way is to have a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For example:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value, subtract as many times as possible from the number and append the corresponding symbols.\n\nSo the code for converting decimal to Roman would be:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is <= 3000. So this code should handle that.\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\nRead the input lines. Wait, the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (but b can be R). The next line contains the number c in base a.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows multiple test cases. For example, the sample input is a list of inputs and outputs. But in the actual problem, the input is one test case. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nIn the example, the input is given as:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nBut that's probably the list of test cases. But the actual input is per test case. However, the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the input is multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\nWait, the original problem's input description says:\n\nInput: The first line contains two integers a and b ... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo for each test case, the input is two lines. But in the sample input, the user provided multiple test cases. But in the programming competition problem, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases? Or is it a single test case?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe first line is ['10 2\\n1', ...], which seems like multiple test cases. But the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, then the next line contains c. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. However, in the problem statement's input description, it's unclear. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo the input is two lines. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. For example, the sample input is given as a list of inputs, each with two lines. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... The next line contains ... So perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. But the sample shows multiple test cases. However, in the problem's sample input, the input is given as a list of test cases. But in reality, the code is supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases, each with two lines. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe input is given as a list of test cases. For example, the first input line is '10 2\\n1', which is two lines. The output is a list of outputs. So the code should read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. However, in the problem statement's input description, it's unclear. But looking at the problem's sample input and output, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains a and b, and the next line contains c. Which implies that each test case is two lines. But how many test cases are there? The problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases until EOF.\n\nBut the problem's sample input shows that the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, each with two lines. However, the problem's input description doesn't specify that. So this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, there are five test cases. The input for each is two lines. The output is five lines. So the code should read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. So how to read them?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into groups of two lines. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case. But the sample shows multiple test cases. But perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to read one test case. That would make sense for a programming competition problem.\n\nWait, the problem's input says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo the input is two lines. The sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the sample input is formatted as multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. But that's conflicting. How can the sample input have multiple test cases?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a multi-test case problem. For example, the code should read multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line is a and b, the second line is c. So for example, in the sample input, there are five test cases, each with two lines. The code should process each of them and output the corresponding result.\n\nBut how to read that in Python? Because in programming competition problems, sometimes the input is multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description doesn't mention that. But the sample input and output suggests that.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe input is given as a list of test cases. The output is a list of outputs. So the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to read them? Well, in Python, reading from stdin can be done by reading all lines, then processing them in pairs.\n\nSo the code should read all lines, then for each pair of lines (i.e., first line is a and b, second line is c), process them.\n\nBut how to handle that in code? Let's think.\n\nIn the sample input, the input is given as:\n\nFor example, the first test case input is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nWhich would be two lines. Then another test case is:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nAnother test case is:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo the code should read all lines, and process them in pairs. So the code can read all lines into a list, then process them two at a time.\n\nBut in practice, when the code is run, the input is given as multiple lines. So perhaps the code can read lines until EOF, and process them in pairs.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n\ni = 0\n\nwhile i < len(lines):\n\n    a_and_b_line = lines[i]\n\n    c_line = lines[i+1]\n\n    process them\n\n    i += 2\n\nBut how to handle cases where the number of lines is odd? Well, according to the problem statement, the input is correct, so the code can assume that the input is given in pairs.\n\nSo now, the code needs to process each test case.\n\nSo putting all together, the steps for each test case are:\n\n1. Parse a and b. But b can be 'R'.\n\n   For example, the first line is split into two parts. For example, '10 2' gives a=10, b=2. '16 R' gives a=16, b='R'.\n\n2. Parse the c_line as a string in base a.\n\n3. Convert c to decimal.\n\n4. Convert decimal to base b (if b is not 'R') or to Roman numerals.\n\nNow, the code for converting c to decimal.\n\nBut what about the case where the input is zero? For example, if c is '0' in base a. Then the decimal is zero. Then, if the output is base b (not R), then output is '0'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the input is not zero. So in that case, the code can safely assume that when converting to Roman, the decimal is non-zero.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nFirst, the function to convert from base a to decimal.\n\nBut for the input c, which is a string. For example, '1111001' in base 2 is 121 in decimal.\n\nBut the code must process each character in the string. For example, for 'A' in base 12, it's 10.\n\nSo the code for converting the input string to decimal is:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n\n    num = 0\n\n    for ch in s:\n\n        # convert ch to its value\n\n        if ch.isdigit():\n\n            digit = int(ch)\n\n        else:\n\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n\n        num = num * base + digit\n\n    return num\n\nBut wait, what if the input has lowercase letters? For example, 'a' in base 12. The code converts to uppercase, so it's okay.\n\nNow, for the decimal to base b (non-R):\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n\n    if n == 0:\n\n        return '0'\n\n    digits = []\n\n    while n > 0:\n\n        remainder = n % base\n\n        digits.append(remainder)\n\n        n = n // base\n\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n\n    res = ''\n\n    for d in digits:\n\n        if d < 10:\n\n            res += str(d)\n\n        else:\n\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n\n    return res\n\nBut for example, if the base is 13, and the number is 10, then the digit is 'A'.\n\nNow, for the Roman conversion.\n\nNow, handling the case where the input is zero. But according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the number is not zero.\n\nSo, the code for the test case:\n\nFor each test case:\n\nRead a and b (split the first line into two parts).\n\nRead the c string.\n\nConvert c to decimal.\n\nThen, if b is 'R', convert decimal to Roman.\n\nElse, convert decimal to base b.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut how to read the first line? For example, in the first line, the first part is a, and the second is b. So for the first line, split into two parts. But in the case of 'R', the second part is 'R'.\n\nSo for example, in the first line of the sample input, '10 2' gives a=10, b=2. For '16 R', a=16, b='R'.\n\nSo code for parsing the first line:\n\nparts = a_and_b_line.split()\n\na = int(parts[0])\n\nb = parts[1]\n\nNow, process c_line.\n\nOnce the decimal is computed, then proceed.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample input 1:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nConvert c (1 in base 10) to decimal is 1. Then convert to base 2: 1. Output is '1'.\n\nSample input 2:\n\n16 R\n\n5\n\nConvert 5 in base 16 to decimal is 5. Then convert to Roman: 'V'.\n\nSample input 3:\n\n5 R\n\n4\n\nConvert 4 in base 5 to decimal: 4. Convert to Roman: IV.\n\nSample input 4:\n\n2 2\n\n1111001\n\nConvert 1111001 in base 2 to decimal. Let's calculate:\n\nbinary 1111001 is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Then convert to base 2: 1111001. Which is the same as input. So output is '1111001'.\n\nSample input 5:\n\n12 13\n\nA\n\nConvert A in base 12 to decimal: 10. Convert to base 13: 10 is 'A' in base 13. So output is 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: c is zero. For example, input is 10 2 and c is 0. Then output is 0.\n\nEdge case 2: converting to Roman. For example, decimal 4 is IV, 9 is IX, etc.\n\nAnother edge case: when the input is in base a=2, and c is 0, then output is 0.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to base b=10, which is the same as the decimal value.\n\nAnother case: when converting to base higher than 10, e.g., 11. For example, decimal 10 is 'A' in base 11.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the functions.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead lines from stdin. Process them in pairs.\n\nBut in code, how to read lines? For example, in Python, using sys.stdin.read().splitlines().\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(lines):\n        a_b_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        i += 2\n\n        # parse a and b\n        a_part, b_part = a_b_line.split()\n        a = int(a_part)\n        b = b_part\n\n        # parse c_line\n        c = c_line\n\n        # convert c to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n\n        # process based on b\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what about leading zeros in the output? For example, when converting to base b, the code returns the correct string without leading zeros. Because the function decimal_to_base returns '0' for zero, and for other numbers, the digits are generated correctly. For example, if the number is 0, returns '0'; else, the digits are generated without leading zeros.\n\nYes. Because in the code for decimal_to_base, when n is zero, returns '0'. Else, the digits are generated by dividing by base, and the digits are stored in reverse order, then reversed again. For example, for 4 in base 2, the code would generate [1, 0, 0], reversed to [0, 0, 1]? No, let's see:\n\nWait, for n=4, base=2:\n\nn=4, remainder 0, digits.append(0), n=2.\n\nn=2, remainder 0, digits.append(0), n=1.\n\nn=1, remainder 1, digits.append(1), n=0.\n\ndigits is [0, 0, 1]. Then reversed to [1, 0, 0], which is correct. So the code returns '100'.\n\nSo the code for decimal_to_base is correct.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nTest case 4: input is 2 2 and c is 1111001. The decimal is 121, converted to base 2 is 1111001. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: input is 5 R and c is 4. decimal is 4, converted to Roman is IV.\n\nAnother case: input is 16 R and c is 5, which is 5 in decimal, converted to V.\n\nSo the code seems to handle these cases.\n\nNow, what about when the input is zero? For example, a=10, b=2, c=0. The code returns '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=10, b=R, c=0. But according to the problem statement, when Roman is involved, the input is not zero. So the code can assume that this case does not happen.\n\nNow, what about leading zeros in c? For example, c is '001' in base 10. The to_decimal function will process it as 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code handles leading zeros correctly.\n\nAnother case: when the input is in base 10, and c is '0', then output is '0'.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to base 1? Wait, but the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So the code can assume that the base is at least 2. So the code doesn't have to handle base 1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So the code can assume that the base is valid. So the code can safely convert to int(b) when it's not R.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the sample input. Let's see.\n\nSample input:\n\nFirst test case: 10 2 and c is 1. decimal is 1. converted to base 2 is 1. Output '1'.\n\nSecond test case: 16 R and c is 5. decimal is 5. Roman is V.\n\nThird test case: 5 R and c is 4. decimal is 4. Roman is IV.\n\nFourth test case: 2 2 and c is 1111001. decimal is 121. converted to base 2 is 1111001.\n\nFifth test case: 12 13 and c is A. decimal is 10. converted to base 13 is 10, which is 'A'.\n\nWhich matches the sample outputs.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base to another base or to Roman numerals. The solution involves two main steps: converting the input number from its original base to a decimal (base 10) integer, and then converting this decimal integer to the target base or Roman numerals.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in a specified base. We convert this number to a decimal integer by processing each digit according to its value in the given base.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base or Roman Numerals**:\n   - If the target base is not Roman numerals, convert the decimal integer to the specified base using standard base conversion techniques.\n   - If the target base is Roman numerals, convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals using a predefined set of value-symbol pairs that represent Roman numerals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    num = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        num = num * base + digit\n    return num\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        remainder = n % base\n        digits.append(remainder)\n        n = n // base\n    digits = digits[::-1]\n    res = ''\n    for d in digits:\n        if d < 10:\n            res += str(d)\n        else:\n            res += chr(ord('A') + d - 10)\n    return res\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip()]\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(lines):\n        a_b_line = lines[i]\n        c_line = lines[i+1]\n        i += 2\n\n        a_part, b_part = a_b_line.split()\n        a = int(a_part)\n        b = b_part\n\n        c = c_line\n\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c, a)\n\n        if b == 'R':\n            print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_value))\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of lines. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains the original base and target base (or 'R' for Roman numerals), and the second line contains the number in the original base.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` processes each character of the input number, converting it to its decimal equivalent based on the original base.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: The function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal number to the specified base, handling bases greater than 10 by using letters A-Z for values 10 and above.\n4. **Conversion to Roman Numerals**: The function `decimal_to_roman` converts the decimal number to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, ensuring correct application of subtractive notation.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and ensures correct conversion between different numeral systems, including Roman numerals.",
