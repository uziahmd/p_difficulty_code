The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. So the problem is about Xenia moving around a ringroad with houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1 and needs to complete m tasks. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the circular arrangement. But how?\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 houses and 3 tasks. The tasks are at 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Starting at 1. First task is at 3. How long does it take? From 1 to 3 clockwise: 2 steps (1→2→3). Then, the second task is at 2. But since she's at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around: 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Then third task is at 3 again. From 2 to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is that for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to calculate the time to move from the current position to the next task's house, considering the direction (clockwise only). But since the movement is clockwise, the time between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nWait, but how do we compute the time between two positions? Let's say Xenia is currently at position curr, and needs to move to next_pos. Since the movement is clockwise, the number of steps is (next_pos - curr) mod n if that's the shortest path? Wait no. Because if curr is 3 and next_pos is 2, then moving clockwise would require (n - curr + next_pos) steps. For example, n=4, curr=3, next_pos=2: 3→4→1→2 is 3 steps. Which is (4 - 3 + 2) = 3. So the formula for steps between curr and next_pos is (next_pos - curr) if next_pos >= curr, else (n - curr + next_pos). Alternatively, it can be written as (next_pos - curr + n) % n. Wait, let's check:\n\nIf next_pos is greater than curr, then (next_pos - curr) is positive. If next_pos is less than curr, then (next_pos - curr) is negative. Adding n and taking mod n would give the correct steps. For example, next_pos=2, curr=3, n=4: (2-3 +4) = 3 mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the steps between curr and next_pos is (next_pos - curr + n) % n. But wait, what if next_pos is same as curr? Then steps are zero. Which is correct.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Start at position 1.\n\n- For each task in order, calculate the steps needed to get from current position to the task's position, add that to the total time.\n\n- Update current position to the task's position.\n\nBut wait, the tasks are given as a list a_1, a_2,...a_m. But the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. For example, if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, then moving time between them is zero. So the code should process each task in order, and for each, compute the steps from previous position to current task's position.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0\n\nfor each a_i in the list of tasks:\n\n    steps = (a_i - current_pos + n) % n\n\n    total_time += steps\n\n    current_pos = a_i\n\nreturn total_time\n\nWait, but why does this work?\n\nBecause for each task, you have to move from your current position to the new position, and the steps are computed as the minimal clockwise steps. But since the problem says that you have to complete all previous tasks before doing the current one, the order of the tasks is fixed. So the code needs to process the tasks in the order given, and for each, compute the steps from the previous position.\n\nYes. So for the first example:\n\ntasks are [3,2,3]\n\ncurrent_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3: steps = (3-1 +4) mod 4 → (2",
