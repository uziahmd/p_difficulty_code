The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i requires her to be at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the houses are arranged in a circle, moving clockwise, the movement between two houses depends on their positions.\n\nLet me think about how to model the movement between consecutive tasks.\n\nFor example, suppose she is currently at position current_pos, and the next task is at target_pos. How much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the movement is clockwise, the time between current_pos and target_pos is (target_pos - current_pos) mod n if moving clockwise. Wait, no. Wait, if current_pos is 3 and target is 2, then moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. But (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3. So yes, that works. So the formula for the time between current and target is (target - current) % n if moving clockwise. But wait, when target is larger than current, it's target - current. If target is smaller, then (target - current + n) mod n. So the formula (target - current) % n gives the correct number of steps.\n\nBut wait, in the first example given:\n\nThe input is 4 3, and the tasks are [3, 2, 3].\n\nThe output is 6. Let's see:\n\nShe starts at 1. The first task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise steps are 2 steps (1→2→3). Then, the next task is at 2. So from 3 to 2: moving clockwise, that's 3 steps (3→4→1→2). Then next task is 3 again. From 2 to 3: 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the approach is to track the current position, and for each task, compute the steps needed to get from current position to the target, add that to the total, and update current position.\n\nBut wait, the tasks have to be done in order. So for the list a_1 to a_m, we process them in order, and for each a_i, compute the distance from the previous position (which is the position after completing the previous task).\n\nBut what about when there are multiple tasks in the same house? For example, if the tasks are [3,3], then the first task is at 3, and the second is also at 3. So moving from 3 to 3 takes zero steps. So the total steps would be the steps to reach 3 once, then nothing else.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nInitialize current_pos as 1 (starting point). total_time = 0.\n\nFor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   compute the distance from current_pos to a_i, add to total_time.\n\n   set current_pos to a_i.\n\nBut how to compute the distance between current_pos and a_i?\n\nAs discussed earlier, the distance is (a_i - current_pos) % n if moving clockwise. Wait, but if a_i is equal to current_pos, then the distance is zero.\n\nWait, let's test with the first example:\n\nn=4, current_pos starts at 1.\n\nFirst task is 3: (3-1) = 2 mod 4 is 2. Correct.\n\nThen current_pos is 3. Next task is 2. (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3. Correct.\n\nThen current_pos is 2. Next task is 3. (3-2) mod 4 is 1. Correct.\n\nTotal sum is 2+3+1=6. Correct.\n\nAnother example: input is 4 3, tasks [2,3,3]. Let's see.\n\nStart at 1.\n\nFirst task is 2: distance is 1. total is 1. current is 2.\n\nSecond task is 3: distance is 1. total is 2. current is 3.\n\nThird task is 3: distance is 0. total remains 2. So output is 2. Which matches the second example.\n\nSo that seems correct.\n\nSo the algorithm is straightforward: iterate through the list of",
