The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The problem is about calculating the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 chance), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what conditions the tower placements must satisfy for this to be possible. \n\nFirst, the signal coverage must be such that each town from 1 to n is covered by exactly one tower. Also, towns 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower. \n\nLet me think about the constraints on the tower positions. For example, if there's a tower at position i, its signal power p must be chosen so that it covers some towns, but not 0 or n+1. \n\nBut how can we model the valid configurations of towers?\n\nAn important observation here might be that the towers must be arranged in a way that allows for a partition of the towns 1..n into intervals, each covered by exactly one tower. For example, each tower's coverage must be such that it covers a contiguous block of towns, and these blocks don't overlap. Also, the coverage of each tower must not reach beyond the towns they are supposed to cover.\n\nWait, maybe the key is that the towers must form a structure where each tower is responsible for a certain range of towns. Let's think about the coverage of a tower. Suppose a tower is placed at position i. Its signal power p must be such that the coverage is from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. Wait, no. The problem says that a tower at i with power p reaches every city c where |c - i| < p. So the distance from i to c must be less than p. That means that the coverage is from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). So the length of the interval covered is 2(p-1) + 1 = 2p-1. But since p can be any integer between 1 and n, the maximum coverage would be up to 2n-1, but that's probably not needed here.\n\nBut for the problem's constraints, the tower's coverage must not reach town 0 or town n+1. So for a tower at position i, the power p must be such that i - p + 1 > 0 (since |0 - i| = i, which must be >= p. So i >= p. Similarly, for town n+1: |(n+1) - i| >= p. Which implies that n+1 - i >= p → i + p <= n+1 → p <= n+1 -i. \n\nBut when choosing the power, the tower's coverage must not reach 0 or n+1. So for any tower at i, the maximum allowed p is min(i, n+1 - i). However, the actual p chosen depends on how we want to cover the towns.\n\nBut how does this relate to the configuration of towers? Let's think about the necessary conditions for the tower placements.\n\nSuppose that the towers are placed in such a way that there's a valid assignment of signal powers. Then, perhaps the towers must be arranged such that each tower covers a certain range of towns, and these ranges are non-overlapping and cover all towns from 1 to n. \n\nFor instance, imagine that the towers are arranged in a way that each tower is responsible for covering a segment of towns. For example, if there's a tower at position i, then it must cover some towns to the left and right, but not overlapping with other towers. \n\nWait, but how can we model this? Maybe the problem reduces to finding a set of towers where each tower is placed in such a way that there's a way to assign ranges that are non-overlapping and cover all towns. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to tiling or interval covering. For example, each tower must be placed such that it can be the center of an interval that covers some towns, and these intervals don't overlap and cover all towns. \n\nAnother thought: For each tower, the signal power must be such that it covers exactly the towns assigned to it. For example, suppose we have a tower at position i. Let's say that it is responsible for covering towns from a to b. Then, the signal power p must be such that:\n\n- The distance from i to a is less than p, and similarly for b. Also, the coverage should not include any towns outside of a to b. \n\nWait, but the signal power can be chosen to be exactly (max distance from i to any of the towns it's covering) + 1? Or something like that. \n\nAlternatively, for a tower to cover exactly the towns from a to b, the signal power p must be such that p > (distance from i to a) and p > (distance from i to b). But also, the coverage can't reach beyond a or b. So, for example, if the tower is responsible for covering towns from a to b, then:\n\nThe maximum distance from i to any of the towns in a to b is max(i - a, b - i). Then, the signal power p must be at least (max(i - a, b - i) + 1), because if you set p to that value, then the coverage will reach from i - (p-1) to i + (p-1). So for example, if the tower is at i and needs to cover from a to b, then:\n\ni - (p-1) ≤ a and i + (p-1) ≥ b. \n\nBut that would imply that p-1 ≥ i - a and p-1 ≥ b - i. Therefore, p-1 ≥ max(i -a, b - i). So p ≥ max(i -a, b -i) + 1. \n\nBut then, the coverage would extend to i - (p-1) = a - (max(...)) + ... Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the way to cover towns from a to b with a tower at i is that i is the midpoint of a and b. For example, if the tower is at i, and the coverage is exactly from a to b, then the signal power is (b - a + 1)/2, but only if a and b are symmetric around i. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way to arrange the coverage is that each tower covers a range of towns that starts and ends at certain points, and these ranges are adjacent. \n\nBut perhaps there's a pattern here. Let's look at the examples given. \n\nIn the first example where n=2, the valid case is when towers are built at 1 and 2. Each has power 1. So the coverage of tower 1 is |c -1| <1 → only town 1. Similarly for tower 2. Then, town 0 and 3 (n+1) are not covered. \n\nAnother valid configuration could be if there's a single tower at 2 with power 2. Then, the coverage would be |c -2| <2 → towns 1, 2, 3. But town 3 is n+1 (since n=2). That's invalid. So that's not allowed. Wait, but the tower is at 2, and the power is 2. Then, town 3 (n+1) is at distance 1 from 2, which is less than 2. So town 3 would be covered, which is not allowed. Therefore, that configuration is invalid. So the only valid configuration for n=2 is when both towers are built, and their power is 1. \n\nSo, the problem is not just about having towers, but also ensuring that their coverage doesn't reach the ends. \n\nAnother example: for n=5, towers at 2,4,5. The tower at 2 has power 2, which covers towns 1, 2, 3. The tower at 4 has power 1 (covers 4), and the tower at 5 has power 1 (covers 5). So that works. \n\nSo, the key seems to be that the towers must be arranged such that each tower is responsible for a certain range of towns, and that these ranges are non-overlapping and cover all towns from 1 to n. Also, each tower's coverage must not reach beyond the ends. \n\nThis seems similar to the problem of tiling the line with intervals, where each interval is centered at a tower and has certain constraints. \n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say f(n) is the number of valid tower configurations for a given n. Then, the total possible configurations is 2^n. The answer is f(n) / 2^n, which we need to compute modulo 998244353.\n\nSo, how to compute f(n)?\n\nLet me think about the structure of valid configurations. For the configuration to be valid, the towers must be placed in such a way that there's a way to assign ranges to them. \n\nOne possible approach is to model this as a dynamic programming problem. Let's think about dp[i] as the number of valid configurations for the first i towns (from 1 to i). Then, we need to find dp[n].\n\nHow can we build dp[i]?\n\nFor the last tower (i-th town), there are two possibilities: either there is a tower here, or not. But if there is a tower here, then it must be part of some coverage. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the coverage must be such that each tower's coverage ends at some point. For example, when considering the i-th town, maybe the last tower is placed at position i, and it covers from some position j+1 to i. Then, the previous part (from 1 to j) must be covered properly. \n\nWait, this seems similar to the problem of counting the number of ways to tile a board with certain tiles. For example, in the tiling problem, each tile can be of certain lengths. Here, perhaps each tower can be considered as covering a certain range, and the way to split the problem is based on where the last tower is placed.\n\nLet me think again. For the entire range 1..n to be covered, the last town (n) must be covered by some tower. Let's say that the tower covering town n is at position k. Then, the coverage of this tower must include town n, and also not include town n+1. \n\nSo, the tower at position k must have a signal power p such that |n -k| < p. Also, since the coverage can't reach town n+1, the maximum p allowed is n+1 -k. \n\nBut the tower's coverage must include town n. So, the signal power p must be at least (n -k + 1). Because |n -k| = n -k. To have that < p, p must be at least (n -k + 1). \n\nBut also, the coverage of this tower can't reach beyond n. So, the maximum p is n+1 -k. So, the allowed p is exactly (n -k + 1) ≤ p ≤ (n+1 -k). \n\nBut since p can be any integer between 1 and n, but for the tower to be able to cover town n, the minimal p is (n -k +1). But the tower's coverage must not reach n+1, so p can be at most (n+1 -k). \n\nBut for these values to exist, we need that (n -k +1) ≤ (n+1 -k) → which is always true. So, for any k, there exists a p (for example, p = n -k +1) that allows the tower at position k to cover town n. \n\nBut what's the coverage of this tower? If the tower is at k and uses p = (n -k +1), then the coverage is from k - (p-1) to k + (p-1). Let's compute that:\n\np-1 = (n -k +1) -1 = n -k.\n\nSo, the coverage starts at k - (n -k) = 2k -n, and ends at k + (n -k) = n. \n\nSo, the coverage starts at 2k -n and ends at n. But since the coverage must not include town 0, the start must be ≥1. \n\nSo 2k -n ≥ 1 → 2k ≥ n +1 → k ≥ (n+1)/2. \n\nWait, but that's only if we choose the minimal p. But maybe the tower can have a larger p. However, for the coverage to not reach town 0, the start of the coverage must be ≥1. \n\nSo, for the tower at position k, the maximum possible p is min(k, n+1 -k). Because the tower can't have p larger than k (otherwise, the coverage would reach 0) or larger than n+1 -k (coverage would reach n+1). \n\nBut for the tower to cover town n, the p must be ≥ (n -k + 1). \n\nSo combining these two conditions:\n\nn -k +1 ≤ p ≤ min(k, n+1 -k)\n\nWhich requires that n -k +1 ≤ min(k, n+1 -k). \n\nLet me check for this condition. Let's consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: k ≤ n+1 -k → 2k ≤ n+1 → k ≤ (n+1)/2.\n\nThen, min(k, n+1 -k) is k. So the condition becomes n -k +1 ≤ k → n +1 ≤ 2k → k ≥ (n+1)/2. But in this case, k ≤ (n+1)/2. So combining these gives k = (n+1)/2. Which is only possible if n is odd. \n\nSo for even n, this case is impossible. \n\nCase 2: k > (n+1)/2 → min(k, n+1 -k) is n+1 -k. \n\nSo the condition becomes n -k +1 ≤ n+1 -k → which simplifies to n -k +1 ≤ n+1 -k → yes, it holds. \n\nSo for the tower at position k to be able to cover town n (as part of its coverage), and not reach 0 or n+1, the tower must be placed in a position where k ≥ (n - (n+1 -k) +1) ? Wait, no. \n\nWait, the condition that the coverage starts at 2k -n (when using the minimal p) must be ≥1. \n\nBut when using p = n -k +1, the coverage starts at 2k -n. \n\nSo to ensure that 2k -n ≥ 1 → k ≥ (n +1)/2. \n\nWhich is the same as saying that k is in the second half of the towns. \n\nSo for the tower at position k to be able to cover town n and not reach town 0 or n+1, k must be ≥ (n+1)/2. \n\nBut how does this help us in the DP approach?\n\nLet me think again. Suppose we want to model the problem with dynamic programming, where dp[i] represents the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. \n\nFor the base case, dp[0] = 1 (no towns to cover, maybe?), and dp[1] would be... Well, for i=1, the only town is 1. We need to have it covered by exactly one tower. So the tower must be present at 1, and the signal power must be 1 (so that it covers 1, but not 0 or 2). \n\nSo for i=1, the number of valid configurations is 1 (tower is built at 1). \n\nSo dp[1] = 1.\n\nFor i=2, the valid configurations are when towers are built at 1 and 2. Then, each has power 1. So the count is 1. So dp[2] = 1. \n\nBut the total possible configurations is 2^2 =4. So the answer is 1/4, which matches the first example.\n\nNow, for the recurrence relation. Let's think about how to compute dp[i]. \n\nThe idea is that for the i-th town to be covered, there must be a tower that covers it. Let's say that the tower covering i is placed at position k, where k is between some value and i. \n\nBut how to model this? For example, when considering the i-th town, the tower covering it can be placed at position k, and the coverage of this tower extends from some position m to i. Then, the previous towns from 1 to m-1 must be covered properly. \n\nBut how to find m?\n\nIf the tower is placed at position k, then the coverage of this tower must include i. So the maximum distance from k to i is less than p. As discussed earlier, the minimal p is (i -k +1). And to not reach town i+1 (which is n+1 if i =n), the p must be at most (n+1 -k). But for general i (not necessarily n), the tower's coverage must not reach town 0 or town i+1 (if it's part of the problem). \n\nWait, but in the general case, for the i-th town, the tower covering it must be placed in such a way that its coverage doesn't reach 0 or i+1 (assuming that i is part of the towns 1..n). \n\nBut perhaps for the DP approach, when considering the first i towns, the tower covering the i-th town must be placed at some position k, and its coverage must include i and not go beyond i. \n\nWait, but the coverage of the tower can't reach town i+1. So, for the tower at position k, the signal power p must be such that |i+1 -k| ≥ p. Which implies that p ≤ (i+1 -k). \n\nAlso, since the tower must cover i, p must be ≥ (i -k + 1). \n\nSo combining these two, we have:\n\ni -k +1 ≤ p ≤ i+1 -k. \n\nBut this implies that i -k +1 ≤ i+1 -k → which is always true. So there exists a p (for example, p = i -k +1) that satisfies this. \n\nBut for the coverage of the tower to not reach town 0, we also need that the left end of the coverage is ≥1. \n\nThe left end of the coverage is k - (p-1). Since p ≥ i -k +1, then p-1 ≥ i -k. \n\nSo k - (p-1) ≤ k - (i -k) = 2k -i. \n\nBut to ensure that this is ≥1, we need 2k -i ≥ 1 → k ≥ (i +1)/2. \n\nTherefore, for the tower at k to cover the i-th town and not reach 0 or i+1, the position k must be ≥ (i+1)/2. \n\nSo, for the DP approach, when considering the i-th town, the tower that covers it must be placed at some position k in [ceil((i+1)/2), i]. \n\nOnce such a k is chosen, the coverage of this tower would start at some position m, and the first m-1 towns must be covered properly. \n\nBut what is m?\n\nIf the tower is placed at k, and uses the minimal p (i -k +1), then the coverage starts at 2k -i. So m = 2k -i. \n\nThus, the first m-1 towns (from 1 to m-1) must be covered by some valid configuration, and the rest (m to i) is covered by this tower. \n\nSo, the recurrence relation would be:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k = ceil((i+1)/2)}^i [ dp[m-1] * (number of ways to have a tower at k and not have towers in positions that conflict?) ]\n\nWait, but the presence of the tower at k is required. However, the other towers in the positions between m and i (except k) may or may not be present. Wait no, because the tower at k is covering from m to i. But other towers in that range would interfere. \n\nWait, this seems complicated. Because if there's another tower in the range [m, i], then their coverage would overlap with the coverage of the tower at k. \n\nAh! This suggests that the entire range [m, i] must be covered by exactly the tower at k. Therefore, there can be no other towers in that range. \n\nBecause otherwise, those towers would have their own coverage, which would overlap with the coverage of the tower at k. \n\nSo, for the configuration to be valid, when we choose a tower at position k to cover the range [m, i], there must be no towers in the range [m, i] except for k. \n\nThis is a crucial observation. \n\nTherefore, the recurrence for dp[i] is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k = ceil((i+1)/2)}^i [ dp[m-1] * 1 ] \n\nWhere m is 2k -i, and there are no towers in positions m to i except for k. \n\nBut how do we account for the presence of the tower at k and the absence of towers in the rest of the range?\n\nThe number of ways to have a tower at k and no towers in positions m to i except k is 1 (tower at k) multiplied by the product of (probability of not having towers in positions m to i except k). \n\nWait, but in our problem, the towers are built with probability 1/2 each, but we are counting the number of valid configurations (the numerator x), and then divide by 2^n. \n\nSo, for the DP approach, dp[i] is the number of valid configurations for the first i towns. \n\nSo, for the recurrence, when choosing a tower at position k, and ensuring that there are no towers in positions m to i except k, the number of ways for this choice is dp[m-1] * 1 (tower at k) * 1 (no towers in positions m to i except k). \n\nBut how to compute that? Because the positions from m to i (excluding k) must not have any towers. \n\nThe number of ways for that is 1 (tower at k) multiplied by 2^{number of positions not in [m, i] and not in the previous parts}? No, wait. \n\nActually, the presence of towers in positions outside of [m, i] is already accounted for in dp[m-1]. Because dp[m-1] counts the number of valid configurations for the first m-1 towns. \n\nBut for the positions from m to i, except for k, there must be no towers. So for the positions m to i, except k, each must not have a tower. \n\nThe number of such possibilities is 1 (for the tower at k) multiplied by 1 (for each of the other positions in m to i being not built). \n\nThe number of positions in m to i is (i - m + 1). But since k is in this range, the number of positions that must not have towers is (i - m + 1 - 1) = i - m. \n\nEach of these positions has a 1/2 chance of being not built, but since we are counting the number of valid configurations (the x in x/2^n), each such choice contributes 1 (since for each of these positions, they must be not built, which is one possibility). \n\nThus, the number of ways for the current choice is dp[m-1] * 1 * 1^{number of positions} = dp[m-1]. \n\nWait, because the positions m to i, except k, must not have towers. So for each of those positions, there is exactly one choice (not building a tower). So the total number of ways for that part is 1. \n\nBut the tower at k must be built, which is one possibility. \n\nSo the total number of ways for this scenario is dp[m-1] * 1 (for the tower at k) * 1 (for the other positions in [m, i] not having towers). \n\nTherefore, the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k = ceil((i+1)/2)}^i dp[m-1], where m = 2k -i.\n\nBut what is m? Let's compute m for each k. \n\nm = 2k -i. \n\nWe need to ensure that m ≥ 1, since the first m-1 towns are considered. \n\nBut since k ≥ ceil((i+1)/2), let's see:\n\nFor example, if i is even: say i=2. Then ceil((2+1)/2) = 2. k=2. m= 2*2 -2 = 2. So m=2. Then m-1 = 1. dp[1] is 1. So dp[2] = 1, which is correct. \n\nAnother example: i=3. Then ceil( (3+1)/2 ) = 2. So k can be 2 or 3. \n\nFor k=2: m = 2*2 -3 = 1. So dp[0] = 1. \n\nFor k=3: m = 2*3 -3 = 3. So dp[2] = 1. \n\nThus, dp[3] = 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nBut what's the actual count for i=3?\n\nLet's think. For n=3, the valid configurations are:\n\nCase 1: towers at 2 and 3. But wait, no. Let me think.\n\nWait, for i=3, the towns 1, 2, 3 must be covered. \n\nPossible valid configurations:\n\nOption 1: Tower at 2 with power 2. Coverage is from 2-1=1 to 2+1=3. So covers all three towns. But then, towns 0 and 4 (n+1=4) must not be covered. \n\nFor town 0: distance to 2 is 2. The power is 2. So |0-2| < 2? 2 < 2 is false. So no coverage. \n\nFor town 4: distance is 2, which is not less than 2. So okay. \n\nSo this configuration is valid. The tower is built at 2, and not built at 1 and 3. \n\nAnother option: towers at 1, 2, 3. Each has power 1. Then, each covers their own town. \n\nBut that's another valid configuration. \n\nWait, but according to the note for n=3, the answer is 1/4. Let's check. \n\nThe note says that for n=3, the answer is 1/4. The real answer is 1/4. How many valid configurations are there? \n\nTotal possible configurations is 2^3=8. \n\nValid configurations are:\n\n- Only tower at 2. Then, set power to 2. That's one case. \n\n- Towers at 1, 2, 3. Each set to power 1. That's another case. \n\nWait, but what about towers at 2 and 3? Let's see. \n\nTower at 2 and 3. For the tower at 2, can we set power to 1 (covers 1 and 2?), no. Wait, if power is 1, then coverage is |c-2| <1 → only town 2. Tower at 3 has power 1, covers town 3. Then town 1 is not covered. So that's invalid. \n\nSo that configuration is invalid. \n\nAnother case: tower at 2 and 1. Then, tower at 1 has power 1 (covers 1), tower at 2 has power 1 (covers 2). Town 3 is not covered. Invalid. \n\nAnother case: tower at 2 and 3. Tower at 2 has power 2 (covers 1, 2, 3). Tower at 3 has power 1 (covers 3). But then town 3 is covered by both. Which is invalid. \n\nSo only two valid configurations. Thus, x=2, and 2/8 = 1/4. Which matches the note. \n\nBut according to our DP calculation for dp[3], it's 2. Which is correct. \n\nSo the recurrence seems to work. \n\nSo, for dp[i], the recurrence is:\n\ndp[i] = sum_{k = ceil((i+1)/2)}^i dp[2k -i - 1] ?\n\nWait, no. Earlier we said m = 2k -i. Then, the previous part is m-1. So dp[m-1] = dp[2k -i - 1]? \n\nWait, m is 2k -i. So m-1 is 2k -i -1. \n\nYes. \n\nSo for each k in the range [ceil((i+1)/2), i], we add dp[2k -i -1] to dp[i]. \n\nBut how to compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the possible values of 2k -i -1. For example, when k ranges from ceil((i+1)/2) to i, what is 2k -i -1?\n\nLet me take i=3 again. For k=2: 2*2 -3 -1 = 4 -3 -1 = 0. dp[0] = 1. For k=3: 2*3 -3 -1 =6-3-1=2. dp[2]=1. So sum is 1+1=2. Which is correct. \n\nAnother example: i=1. ceil((1+1)/2) = 1. k=1. 2*1 -1 -1 = 0. dp[0] =1. So dp[1] =1. Correct. \n\nAnother example: i=2. k ranges from ceil(3/2)=2. k=2. 2*2 -2 -1 =4-2-1=1. dp[1]=1. So dp[2] =1. Correct. \n\nFor i=4, let's compute. \n\nceil((4+1)/2) = 3. So k can be 3,4. \n\nFor k=3: 2*3 -4 -1 =6-4-1=1. dp[1] =1. \n\nFor k=4: 2*4 -4 -1=8-4-1=3. dp[3]=2. \n\nSo dp[4] = 1+2=3. \n\nWhat's the actual count for i=4? \n\nWell, the answer for n=4 would be dp[4]/2^4. But I'm not sure of the exact value, but let's proceed. \n\nSo the recurrence seems to hold. \n\nNow, the problem is to compute dp[n], then divide by 2^n, and output that modulo 998244353. \n\nThe next step is to find an efficient way to compute dp[i] for i up to 2e5. \n\nBut how? Let's see. For each i, we have to compute the sum over k from ceil((i+1)/2) to i of dp[2k -i -1]. \n\nLet me make a substitution. Let j = 2k -i -1. Let me see for each k. \n\nAlternatively, for each i, let's think about the terms in the sum. \n\nLet me denote for each i, the sum is over k from m to i, where m = ceil( (i+1)/2 ). \n\nBut for each k in this range, the term is dp[2k -i -1]. Let me denote that as dp[ (2k -i -1) ].\n\nLet me substitute l = 2k -i -1. Let's solve for k in terms of l. \n\nl = 2k -i -1 → 2k = l +i +1 → k = (l +i +1)/2. \n\nBut since k must be an integer, l must have the same parity as (i+1). \n\nBut perhaps this isn't helpful. \n\nAlternatively, for a given i, let's think about the possible values of 2k -i -1. Let's note that for k in [m, i], where m = ceil( (i+1)/2 ), then:\n\nk ranges from m to i. Let's compute 2k -i -1 for these k. \n\nLet me take for example, when k = m. What is 2k -i -1?\n\nSince m = ceil( (i+1)/2 ), let's consider two cases: i even or odd. \n\nCase 1: i is even. Let i = 2t. Then (i+1)/2 = (2t +1)/2 = t + 0.5 → ceil is t+1. So m = t+1. \n\nThen, for k = t+1: 2*(t+1) - 2t -1 = 2t +2 - 2t -1 = 1. \n\nFor k = t+1 to 2t (i=2t), the value of 2k -i -1 ranges from 1 to 2*(2t) -2t -1 = 2t -1. \n\nSo for i even, the sum is over terms dp[1], dp[3], ..., dp[2t -1]. \n\nBut how to find a pattern here?\n\nAlternatively, notice that 2k -i -1 = 2(k - (i+1)/2) - 1. \n\nBut perhaps this isn't helpful. \n\nAnother approach: Let's precompute dp[0...n], and for each i, compute the sum. \n\nBut for n up to 2e5, and each i requiring O(i) time, this would be O(n²), which is too slow. \n\nThus, we need to find a way to compute this sum more efficiently. \n\nLet me think about the sum for dp[i]. Let me denote that:\n\nsum_{k = m}^i dp[ 2k - i - 1 ]\n\nwhere m = ceil( (i+1)/2 )\n\nLet me substitute j = 2k - i - 1. \n\nRearranged: k = (j + i + 1)/2 \n\nBut since k must be integer, j must be such that j + i + 1 is even. \n\nBut perhaps it's easier to think of for each i, the values of j = 2k -i -1. \n\nLet me see for k ranging from m to i:\n\nFor k = m, j = 2m -i -1. \n\nFor k = i, j = 2i -i -1 = i-1. \n\nSo the sum is over j from (2m -i -1) to (i-1), stepping by 2? \n\nWait, for consecutive values of k, j increases by 2. Because when k increases by 1, j increases by 2*1 = 2. \n\nYes! Because for k and k+1, j increases by 2*(k+1) -i -1 - (2k -i -1) ) = 2. \n\nSo the sequence of j's is an arithmetic progression starting at j_start = 2m -i -1, ending at j_end = i-1, with step 2. \n\nSo the sum becomes sum_{j = j_start}^{j_end} dp[j], where j increases by 2 each step. \n\nBut how to compute this sum quickly?\n\nThis is equivalent to the sum of dp[j] for all j in [a, b] where j has the same parity as a. \n\nIf we can precompute prefix sums for even and odd indices, then for each i, we can compute the sum in O(1) time. \n\nYes! Let's think about it. \n\nLet me create two prefix sums:\n\n- even_sum[i]: sum of dp[0] + dp[2] + ... + dp[i] if i is even. \n\n- odd_sum[i]: sum of dp[1] + dp[3] + ... + dp[i] if i is odd. \n\nBut perhaps it's better to have separate prefix sums for even and odd indices. \n\nAlternatively, create two arrays:\n\nprefix_even[i] = sum_{k=0}^i dp[k] if k is even, else 0. \n\nprefix_odd[i] = sum_{k=0}^i dp[k] if k is odd, else 0. \n\nBut then, for a given range [a, b], and step 2, we can compute the sum based on whether a is even or odd. \n\nBut how to find the sum from j_start to j_end with step 2. \n\nFor example, if j_start is even, then the sum is the sum of even numbers from j_start to j_end (if j_end is even) or up to j_end-1. \n\nSimilarly for odd. \n\nBut how to compute this quickly. \n\nAlternatively, for each i, compute the sum of dp[j] for all j with j ≡ r mod 2, where r is determined by j_start. \n\nSo, for the sum from j_start to j_end with step 2, we can compute it as follows:\n\nIf j_start > j_end, the sum is zero. \n\nElse, determine if j_start is even or odd, and then find the number of terms and their positions. \n\nBut with prefix sums for even and odd indices, we can compute this. \n\nSo, for example, let's say we have prefix_even and prefix_odd arrays. \n\nprefix_even[i] = sum_{k",
