And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Each week is defined as k consecutive days. For each of these weeks, we calculate the average sleep time (sum of the k days divided by k), and then find the average of all those averages.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says that Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. Then, there are n - k + 1 weeks. For each of these weeks, we calculate the average sleep time (sum divided by k?), and then the output is the average of all those averages?\n\nWait, looking at the example:\n\nIn the first example input: 3 2, and the array is [3,4,7]. The weeks are days 1-2 (sum 7, average 3.5) and days 2-3 (sum 11, average 5.5). The average of these two averages is (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.0000... Wait wait, wait, no. Wait the sample output given for the first input is '9.0000000000'? Wait that doesn't match. Wait let me check the example again.\n\nWait the first example input is:\n\nInput is 3 2, then 3 4 7. The output is 9.000000...\n\nWait according to the note, the example says that the result is (sum of all weeks divided by number of weeks). Wait, but how?\n\nWait the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So maybe the problem is not to take the average of the averages, but to take the sum of all the sums of the weeks, divided by the number of weeks, and then divided by k? Or perhaps the problem says that the average is the total sum of all the weeks' sums divided by (number of weeks * k) ?\n\nWait the problem says: \"the average sleep time per week\". So for each week, we compute the average (sum of k days divided by k). Then, the overall average is the average of all those per-week averages.\n\nBut in the first example, the two per-week averages are 3.5 and 5.5. Their average is (3.5 + 5.5)/2 = 9/2 = 4.5. But the sample output is 9.000... which suggests that the output is the sum of the per-week sums divided by the number of weeks. Because 7 + 11 = 18, divided by 2 is 9. So that would be the average of the sums, not the average of the averages. But why?\n\nWait the problem statement says: \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\". So for each week, the average is sum / k. Then, the overall average is the average of all those values. Which would be (sum1/k + sum2/k + ... + sum_m/k ) / m, where m is the number of weeks. Which equals (sum1 + sum2 + ... + sum_m) / (m * k). \n\nBut in the first example, the sum of the per-week sums is 7+11=18. m is 2. So 18/(2*2) = 4.5, which would be the correct average. But the sample output is 9.000... So that contradicts.\n\nWait wait the sample output given for the first example is 9.000... So what's going on here?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement's example:\n\nIn the first example, the input is 3 2, and the array is [3,4,7]. The output is 9.000... So according to the note, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by the number of weeks. Wait, the note says that in the third example, the answer is the sum of all weeks divided by 7. So perhaps the problem is not to compute the average of averages, but to compute the average of the sums of each week. Which would be (sum of all weeks' sums) divided by the number of weeks. But that seems odd. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nProblem statement says:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the example in the problem statement says that the result is 9.000... So in that case, the output is (sum of all weeks' sums) divided by the number of weeks. Because the sum of the two weeks is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by 2, gives 9. Which matches the sample output.\n\nBut why? Because the problem says that the average is the average of the per-week averages. But according to that example, it's not. So perhaps the problem is actually asking for the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the average of each week. Which is a bit confusing.\n\nWait the problem says: \"the average amount of hours of sleep per week\". So for each week, the average is sum of the k days divided by k. Then, the overall average is the average of those per-week averages. Which would be (sum1/k + sum2/k + ... + sum_m/k ) / m = (sum_total) / (m*k). But in the first example, sum_total is 18, m is 2, k is 2. So 18/(2*2) = 4.5. But the sample output is 9. So that's conflicting.\n\nBut the sample output says 9.000000. Therefore, the problem must be that the output is the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the average. Which would be (sum_total) / m. Which in the first example is 18/2 =9. So that's the sample output.\n\nSo the problem statement is wrong? Or perhaps I misunderstood the problem.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"For example, if k=2, n=3 and a=[3,4,7], then the result is .\"\n\nBut the sample output for that case is 9.000... So the example says that the result is 9. Which is the average of the sum of the weeks. So the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the average. But why does the problem say \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\"?\n\nWait the problem says:\n\n\"Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .\"\n\nWait the problem says that the result is the average of the sum of each week. Because in that example, the sum of the weeks is 3+4=7 and 4+7=11, so the average is (7+11)/2=9. So the output is 9. So the problem says that the answer is the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the average. Which is confusing because the problem says \"average amount of hours of sleep per week\".\n\nBut that's probably a mistake in the problem statement. But according to the sample input, the correct approach is to compute the average of the sum of each week. So the problem is to compute the average of the sum of each week (sum of each week divided by the number of weeks).\n\nBut why does the problem mention average sleep time per week? Because for each week, the average is sum / k. But the problem says that the overall average is the average of the sum of the weeks. That seems incorrect. However, the sample shows that the correct approach is to compute the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the average.\n\nTherefore, the problem requires us to compute the average of the sum of each week. So the steps are:\n\nFor each of the (n -k +1) weeks, compute the sum of the k elements. Then, compute the average of these sums. Which is (sum of all the sums) divided by (number of weeks).\n\nBut why does the problem say \"average sleep time per week\"? Because that would be the average of the average of each week. But the sample shows that it's not that.\n\nBut the sample input and output suggest that the answer is the average of the sum of each week. So perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and the actual requirement is to compute the average of the sum of each week. Which would be the same as the sum of all the sums divided by the number of weeks.\n\nSo the task is to compute the average of the sum of each week. So for each week, sum the k elements, then take the average of those sums.\n\nSo how to compute this efficiently?\n\nConstraints are n up to 2e5. So O(n) solution is needed.\n\nThe straightforward approach would be to compute the sum for each window of size k, then take the average of all those sums.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for each window efficiently?\n\nWe can use the sliding window technique. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements. Then, for each subsequent window, subtract the element leaving the window and add the new element entering. This way, each sum is computed in O(1) time, leading to O(n) total time.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\n- Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\n- Then, for each window starting at position 1 to (n -k) (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), adjust the sum by subtracting a[i-1] and adding a[i +k -1].\n\n- Keep track of the total sum of all windows.\n\n- Then, divide by the number of windows (which is (n -k +1)).\n\nBut for the first example, the sum of the two windows is 7 + 11 = 18. Divided by 2 gives 9, which matches the sample.\n\nSo the problem is indeed to compute the average of the sum of each week, not the average of the average. Therefore, the code needs to compute the sum of all the window sums, then divide by the number of windows.\n\nSo the code plan is:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nCompute the number of windows: m = n -k +1.\n\nCompute the sum of all the window sums.\n\nThen, divide by m, and output with enough decimal digits.\n\nNow, how to compute the sum of all window sums efficiently.\n\nSliding window approach:\n\nInitialize current_sum as sum(a[0..k-1]).\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum.\n\nThen, for i from 1 to m-1:\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\nadd this to total_sum.\n\nBut for large n, this is O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test with the first sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=3, k=2.\n\na = [3,4,7]\n\ninitial sum is 3+4=7.\n\ntotal_sum starts as 7.\n\nThen, next window is i=1 (assuming 0-based?), the next window is positions 1 and 2. So subtract a[0] (3) and add a[1+2-1] = a[2] (7). So current_sum becomes 7-3+7= 11. total_sum becomes 7+11=18. m is 2. 18/2=9. Correct.\n\nAnother sample:\n\nSecond input is '1 1\\n10'. So n=1, k=1. Number of windows is 1. Sum is 10. Divide by 1 gives 10. Correct.\n\nThird example input is '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'.\n\nSo the windows are:\n\nwindow 1: 1+2=3\n\nwindow 2: 2+4=6\n\nwindow3:4+100000=100004\n\nwindow4:100000+123=100123\n\nwindow5:123+456=579\n\nwindow6:456+789=1245\n\nwindow7:789+1=790\n\nsum of all windows is 3 +6 + 100004 + 100123 + 579 + 1245 + 790 = let's compute:\n\nLet me add them step by step:\n\n3 +6 =9\n\n+100004 = 100013\n\n+100123 = 200136\n\n+579 = 200715\n\n+1245 = 201,960?\n\nWait 200715 + 1245 = 201,960?\n\nYes. Then +790 = 202,750.\n\nThen divide by 7 (since m=8-2+1=7). 202750 /7 = ?\n\nLet me compute 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857..., which matches the sample output of 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo yes, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nIn Python, the steps are:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead the list of a as integers.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nIf m is zero? Well, since k <=n, m is at least 1.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\nThen, for each of the next m-1 windows, adjust the sum.\n\nAdd all the sums to total_sum.\n\nThen, divide by m, and output with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut for large n and k, the sum can be very big. But in Python, integers can handle that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input:\n\nBut the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows three examples, like:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. Wait, but the problem statement says that the input is for one test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nBut the sample input shows three examples. But perhaps that's part of the problem's sample input, but in reality, the code should process a single test case. Wait, the original problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo the code should read one test case. But looking at the sample input, perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects to process one test case.\n\nWait, the sample input given in the problem is:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nBut that's probably a way to represent multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is for one test case. So perhaps the sample input is written as multiple lines, but the code needs to process a single test case.\n\nBut the user's problem says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So for the code, the input is two lines: first line is n and k, second line is the array.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases. However, perhaps the problem is that in the problem's sample, the input is given as multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process a single test case. So the code should read from stdin, which for the problem's purpose is one test case.\n\nBut perhaps the original problem has multiple test cases, but the problem statement's example is not clear.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and k.\n\nThe second line contains n integers.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. However, perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one. However, the sample outputs show three outputs, which suggests that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nWait, the problem's sample input and output are given as:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nWhich suggests that the code needs to process multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains two integers, etc. So perhaps the problem is that the code should read multiple test cases. But that's not clear from the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original problem's input description says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).\n\nThe second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\nSo the code should process a single test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. So perhaps the problem's sample input is given in a way that each test case is presented as a separate input, but the code should process one test case. However, the user's code is supposed to read from stdin, which in practice may have multiple test cases. But the problem statement's input is not clear on that.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the first sample input is:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nWhich produces output 9.000000...\n\nThe second sample input is 1 1 followed by 10, output is 10.000...\n\nThird sample input is 8 2 followed by the array, output is 28964.285714...\n\nSo the code must process multiple test cases. But how?\n\nBut the problem says that the input is for one test case. But the sample input shows three test cases. This is conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code should read one test case. But the user's code is supposed to read from stdin, which for the problem's purposes would be one test case.\n\nBut looking at the problem's note, the third example has n=8, k=2, and the output is given as 28964.2857142857. So the code needs to process one test case.\n\nBut why in the sample input, there are three test cases? Maybe that's a formatting error. Perhaps the sample input is given as multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code processes one test case. However, in the problem's original statement, the input is for one test case.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read from stdin. So perhaps the code should read one test case. But then why in the sample input, there are three test cases?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user is supposed to write code that can handle multiple test cases, but the problem's input is only for one test case. However, the sample shows multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking back at the problem's original statement:\n\nThe input is given as two lines: first line with n and k, second with the array. The output is the desired output for that case.\n\nTherefore, the code must read one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases, but perhaps that's just an example of how the code should work for different cases. So the code should process one test case.\n\nBut the user's code is supposed to read from stdin, which in practice may have multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that it's for one test case. So perhaps the code is supposed to process one test case.\n\nBut the sample input given by the user shows three test cases. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's original input description says that the code should process one test case. So this is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user is mistaken in the way they presented the sample input. For example, perhaps the sample input is given as multiple lines, but each line represents a separate test case. However, the problem's original input is for one test case.\n\nThis is a critical point. If the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, then the code must read all test cases. But how?\n\nBut looking at the problem's original input description, it's unclear. However, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nSample Output:\n\n9.0000000000\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n1 1\n\n10\n\nOutput: 10.000000...\n\nThird sample input:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nOutput: 28964.2857142857.\n\nSo the code should process one test case. But the sample input shows three separate test cases. However, in programming competition problems, sometimes the sample input is shown with multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one.\n\nBut in the problem's original input description, the code is supposed to read one test case. Therefore, the code should read two lines: first line n and k, second line the array.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin, which for the problem's purposes has two lines.\n\nThus, the code should process one test case.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n and k from input.\n\nRead the list of a.\n\nCompute m = n -k +1.\n\nCompute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n\ntotal_sum = initial_sum.\n\nThen, for i in range(1, m):\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\nadd to total_sum.\n\nThen, divide by m.\n\nOutput the result with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut in Python, how to read the input?\n\nThe input can be read via input().split().\n\nBut for the second line, the list can be read as list(map(int, input().split())).\n\nNow, code:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nm = n - k + 1\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, m):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\naverage = total_sum / m\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nWait, but for the first sample, the code would compute total_sum = 7 + 11 = 18. m is 2. 18/2=9.0. So printed as 9.0000000000. Which matches.\n\nAnother sample: when n=1, k=1. m=1. total_sum is sum of first 1 elements (10). divided by 1 is 10.0.\n\nThird sample: m=7, and the total_sum is 3+6+100004+100123+579+1245+790 = ?\n\nLet me compute:\n\nLet me re-calculate the third sample.\n\nThe array is [1, 2, 4, 100000, 123, 456, 789, 1]\n\nk=2.\n\nThe windows are:\n\n[1,2] sum 3\n\n[2,4] sum 6\n\n[4,100000] sum 100004\n\n[100000, 123] sum 100123\n\n[123, 456] sum 579\n\n[456, 789] sum 1245\n\n[789, 1] sum 790.\n\nTotal sum is 3+6=9, +100004=100013, +100123= 200136, +579= 200715, +1245= 201,960, +790= 202,750. Divided by 7 is 202750 /7 = 28964.2857142857..., which is the sample output.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, testing for edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=k. Then m=1. The sum is sum of the entire array. Divided by 1. So output is sum of array.\n\nEdge case 2: k=1. Then each window is a single element. The sum of all windows is sum of the array. Divided by m =n. So average is (sum of array)/n. Which is the same as the average of all elements. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, k=1. Then m=2. The sum of windows is a[0] + a[1]. Divided by 2. Which is (a0 +a1)/2. Which is the average of the array.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, k=2. sum is a0+a1. divided by 1. So output is sum.\n\nSo the code works for these cases.\n\nNow, the code in Python. However, for large n (up to 2e5), the code must be efficient. The code is O(n) time, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, in Python, the sum(a[:k]) could be O(k) time. For k up to 2e5, that's acceptable. But for multiple test cases, but in this code, it's only once.\n\nSo the code is acceptable.\n\nNow, handling the output. The output must have at least 6 decimal digits. So using Python's string formatting with .10f will ensure that.\n\nBut in Python, when you print with .10f, it rounds the number to 10 decimal places. However, the problem says that the answer is considered correct if the absolute or relative error does not exceed 1e-6. So printing 10 decimal digits is sufficient.\n\nFor example, in the third sample, the output is 28964.2857142857. Which is 10 decimal digits. So the code's approach is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, when m is 0? No, since k <=n, m = n -k +1 >= 1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and k.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nCompute m.\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0:k]).\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum.\n\nThen for i in 1 to m-1:\n\ncurrent_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\ntotal_sum += current_sum.\n\nThen average = total_sum / m.\n\nPrint with 10 decimals.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the for loop runs from 1 to m-1. Because for m windows, the first window is i=0 (if we start from 0), and then for the next m-1 windows.\n\nWait, the code uses for i in range(1, m):\n\nBecause the initial current_sum is for the first window (i=0). Then, for the next m-1 windows (from i=1 to m-1, since m is the total number of windows). Because range(1, m) is from 1 to m-1 (since range is exclusive of upper bound). So for example, if m is 2, the loop runs once (i=1).\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nTesting for the first sample:\n\nSample input:\n\n3 2\n\n3 4 7\n\nThen:\n\ncurrent_sum = 3+4=7.\n\ntotal_sum =7.\n\nloop runs for i in 1 to 1 (m=2, range(1,2) is [1]).\n\ni=1:\n\ncurrent_sum = 7 - a[0] (3) + a[1+2-1] = a[2] (7). So 7-3+7=11.\n\ntotal_sum becomes 7 +11 =18.\n\naverage is 18/2=9.0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut what about when k=0? Well, according to input constraints, k is at least 1.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the list a is read as input().split(), which is correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n and k:\n\nn, k = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nThen compute m = n -k +1.\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\ntotal_sum = current_sum\n\nfor i in range(1, m):\n\n    current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n    total_sum += current_sum\n\naverage = total_sum / m\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nBut in Python, for very large numbers, the sum can be very big, but Python handles big integers.\n\nNow, testing the third sample input:\n\nSample input:\n\n8 2\n\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1\n\nThe code computes the sum correctly.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the array is very large, like 2e5 elements? The code will process it in O(n) time.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code is written. Now, the user's sample input includes multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the code should process one test case. However, the sample input shows three test cases. But perhaps the user's sample input is for multiple test cases, and the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\nOutput:\n\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the code should read one test case. This is a contradiction.\n\nBut the user's problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. How?\n\nBut how to determine how many test cases there are? In programming competition problems, sometimes the first line indicates the number of test cases. But in this problem's input description, there is no such indication.\n\nThis is a problem. However, the sample input shows three test cases, and the sample output shows three outputs. So the code must read multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's input description says nothing about that. However, the sample input and output suggest that the code should read multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is a problem. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking back at the original problem statement, perhaps the sample input is formatted as multiple test cases, but the actual problem expects that the code processes one test case. However, the user's code is supposed to read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases.\n\nBut in the original problem statement, the input is for one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. This is confusing.\n\nBut the user's sample input is given as a list of test cases. However, the actual problem may expect that the code reads one test case. But in the problem's sample input, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut this is a contradiction. To resolve this, perhaps the user's problem has a mistake in the sample input, and the actual code should process one test case. However, in the problem's sample input, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to tell. However, looking at the problem's sample input and output, the code must read multiple test cases. Because the sample input has three test cases and the output has three answers.\n\nBut how to read multiple test cases? In programming competitions, usually, the first line indicates the number of test cases. But in this case, the problem's input description does not mention that.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is '3 2\\n3 4 7', then '1 1\\n10', then '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1'.\n\nBut this is probably a representation of multiple test cases, where each test case is provided as two lines. So the code should read all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to do that in Python? For example, read all lines from stdin, split into groups of two lines.\n\nBut how to handle that in code?\n\nBut the original problem's input description says that the first line contains n and k, and the second line contains the array. So for one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows three test cases, which implies that the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nThis is a problem. However, the user's sample output shows that for each test case, the code should output the corresponding result.\n\nBut how to proceed?\n\nPerhaps the problem's original input is for one test case, and the sample input is formatted incorrectly. However, given that the user's sample input has three test cases, and the code must produce three outputs, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how?\n\nAssuming that the code should process multiple test cases, and that each test case consists of two lines: first line with n and k, second line with n integers.\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, and process them in pairs.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in some cases, the input may be provided as multiple lines, and the code can read them all.\n\nSo, for example, in Python, the code can read all the input at once, split into tokens, and process accordingly.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the code can read lines until there is no more input.\n\nBut in practice, for programming competition problems, the code should read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description is ambiguous.\n\nBut given the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. So the code should read all test cases, and for each, compute the required output.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor each test case:\n\n    read n and k\n\n    read a\n\n    compute and print the result.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, reading from stdin can be done via sys.stdin.read().split(), and then processing the tokens.\n\nBut for this, the code can read all tokens at once.\n\nLet me think:\n\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case has two lines: first line with n and k, second line with n integers.\n\nSo the input can be read as a list of tokens. The first token is n, then k, then n tokens for the array, then next test case's n and k, and so on.\n\nSo the code can process the tokens in this way.\n\nFor example, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndata = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n\nptr = 0\n\nwhile ptr < len(data):\n\n    n = data[ptr]\n\n    k = data[ptr+1]\n\n    ptr +=2\n\n    a = data[ptr:ptr+n]\n\n    ptr +=n\n\n    # process this test case\n\n    m = n -k +1\n\n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n\n    total_sum = current_sum\n\n    for i in range(1, m):\n\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k -1]\n\n        total_sum += current_sum\n\n    average = total_sum /",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible weeks, where each week is defined as a consecutive sequence of `k` days from a list of `n` days. The goal is to compute the average of the sums of these consecutive `k`-day periods.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read all input data at once for efficiency, especially given the constraints.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use a sliding window approach to efficiently compute the sum of each consecutive `k`-day period. This technique allows us to compute each window sum in constant time after the initial sum calculation.\n3. **Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the first `k` days. Then, iteratively adjust this sum by sliding the window one day at a time, subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n4. **Average Calculation**: Compute the total sum of all window sums and then divide by the number of windows to get the final average.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    data = list(map(int, sys.stdin.read().split()))\n    ptr = 0\n    while ptr < len(data):\n        n = data[ptr]\n        k = data[ptr + 1]\n        ptr += 2\n        a = data[ptr:ptr + n]\n        ptr += n\n        \n        m = n - k + 1\n        current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n        total_sum = current_sum\n        \n        for i in range(1, m):\n            current_sum = current_sum - a[i - 1] + a[i + k - 1]\n            total_sum += current_sum\n        \n        average = total_sum / m\n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read all at once and split into a list of integers for efficient processing.\n2. **Sliding Window Technique**: The initial sum of the first `k` elements is calculated. For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by removing the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n3. **Total Sum Calculation**: The total sum of all window sums is accumulated as we slide through the list.\n4. **Final Average**: The total sum of all window sums is divided by the number of windows (which is `n - k + 1`) to get the average sleep time over all weeks. This result is printed with 10 decimal places to ensure precision.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the required sums using a linear pass through the list, making the solution both time and space efficient.",
