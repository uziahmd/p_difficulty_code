Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two given names. So, the idea is that the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name should exactly match the letters in the pile. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the concatenation of the first two input strings (guest and host) has exactly the same characters as the third string (the pile), with the same counts for each character.\n\nHow to do that in Python?\n\nHmm. Well, one way is to take the first two strings, combine them into one, then check if the sorted version of that combined string is equal to the sorted version of the third string.\n\nYes. Because when you sort both, if they are the same, then the counts of each character must be the same. That's a common technique for anagram problems.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read three lines of input.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Sort this concatenated string and the third line's string.\n4. Compare the two sorted strings. If they are equal, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the lengths are different? For example, if the combined length of guest and host is not equal to the pile's length. Then obviously it's impossible. So maybe first check if the lengths are equal. If not, immediately return NO. Otherwise proceed with the sorting method.\n\nThat's a good optimization. Because if the lengths are different, there's no way the counts can match. So first check len(guest) + len(host) == len(pile). If not, output NO. Else, proceed to compare sorted strings.\n\nSo the code steps would be:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile): print NO\n\nelse: check if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile). If yes, output YES else NO.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS, host: DEDMOROZ. Combined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count the letters. Then the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me check the length. The combined length is len(\"SANTACLAUS\") + len(\"DEDMOROZ\") = 10 + 8 = 18? Let me see:\n\nSANTACLAUS is S A N T A C L A U S → 10 letters. DEDMOROZ is D E D M O R O Z → 8 letters. Total 18. The pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → let me count letters. Well, the sample says it's correct. So sorted(combined) would be same as sorted(pile).\n\nSecond example: guest is PAPAINOEL, host JOULUPUKKI. Combined length is len(\"PAPAINOEL\") is 9, len(\"JOULUPUKKI\") is 10. Total 19. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the length. Let me see, the sample says the output is NO because there's a missing P and an extra L. So the length would be 19? Let me check the pile's length. Let me count the letters in the third input line: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's see:\n\nLet me count letters. Let me think: \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\" → perhaps the length is 19? Let me check:\n\nOriginal guest + host: 9 + 10 = 19. The pile's length is 19? But according to the note, the pile has an extra L. So the lengths are same, but the counts differ. So the sorted approach would catch that.\n\nThird example: BABBONATALE and FATHERCHRISTMAS. Combined length is len(\"BABBONATALE\") is 10 letters, \"FATHERCHRISTMAS\" is 14 letters. Total 24. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me check the length. Let me count: \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\" — let's see. Well, the sample says there's an extra L. So the combined length would be 10 + 14 = 24. The pile's length is 24? Let me see: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER — let me count letters. Well, the sample says there's an extra L. So the length would be same, but the sorted lists would differ.\n\nSo the code logic should handle these cases.\n\nNow, the code. How to read the inputs? The input is three lines. So in Python, we can read them via input().strip() three times.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as three lines. So for example, in the first sample input, the first line is 'SANTACLAUS', the second 'DEDMOROZ', third 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nSo code:\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen combined = guest + host.\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile): print 'NO' else check sorted.\n\nSo code:\n\ndef main():\n\n    guest = input().strip()\n\n    host = input().strip()\n\n    pile = input().strip()\n\n    combined = guest + host\n\n    if len(combined) != len(pile):\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n    else:\n\n        if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n\n            print(\"YES\")\n\n        else:\n\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nBut wait, in Python, the sorted function returns a list. So comparing the lists should work.\n\nYes. So this code should handle all cases.\n\nTesting the examples:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nguest is 'SANTACLAUS', host 'DEDMOROZ', pile 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nCombined is 'SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ' → let's check the length. Let me count:\n\nSANTACLAUS is 10 letters. DEDMOROZ is 8 letters. Total 18. The pile is 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS' → let me count letters. Let's see:\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS → S A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S → let me count letters. Let me think that the combined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. So the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. But the code will sort both and compare. So the code will return YES.\n\nSecond example: guest is 'PAPAINOEL', host 'JOULUPUKKI'. Combined is 'PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI' → length 9 + 10 = 19. The pile is 'JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI' → let's check the length. Let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's count letters. Let me think that the length is 19. But the sorted combined and sorted pile would differ. For example, in the combined string, there are two P's (from PAPAINOEL) and in the pile, perhaps there's only one P. So the sorted lists would differ. Hence, output is NO.\n\nThird example: guest is BABBONATALE (10 letters?), host FATHERCHRISTMAS (14 letters?), combined length 24. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the length. Let me see:\n\nBABBONATALE is B A B B O N A T A L E → 11 letters? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input for third example is:\n\n['BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nSo guest is BABBONATALE. Let me count letters:\n\nB A B B O N A T A L E → that's 11 letters. Host is FATHERCHRISTMAS: F A T H E R C H R I S T M A S → let me count letters: F(1), A(2?), T(2?), H(2?), E(1), R(2?), C(1), I(1), S(2?), M(1). Let me count the letters:\n\nFATHERCHRISTMAS is spelled as F A T H E R C H R I S T M A S → that's 14 letters. So combined length is 11+14=25. The pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the letters in that string. Let me see:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R → perhaps the length is 25? Or maybe not. Let me count:\n\nThe pile is \"BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\". Let me split into parts:\n\nBABCHRISTMAS → B A B C H R I S T M A S → 12 letters.\n\nBONATALLE → B O N A T A L L E → 9 letters.\n\nFATHER → F A T H E R → 6 letters.\n\nTotal 12+9+6 = 27? Wait, but that's adding up. Wait, perhaps the actual string is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the letters:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER → Let me count each character.\n\nBut perhaps the length is 25? Or maybe 25?\n\nBut according to the sample note, there's an extra L. So the combined length of guest and host is 11 + 14 = 25. The pile's length would be 25? Let me check:\n\nOriginal pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the letters:\n\nLet me see:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R → Let me count each letter:\n\nBreaking down:\n\nBABCHRISTMAS → B, A, B, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S → 12 letters.\n\nBONATALLE → B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E → 9 letters.\n\nFATHER → F, A, T, H, E, R → 6 letters.\n\nTotal 12+9+6=27. But that's 27 letters, but the combined length is 25. So in this case, the code would first check the length. Since 25 != 27, it would print NO. But according to the sample, the output is NO. However, according to the note, the third sample's output is NO because there's an extra L. So perhaps the pile's length is same as combined length, but the counts are wrong.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me check again.\n\nThe third input line is 'BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER'.\n\nLet me count the letters in this string. Let's write it out:\n\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R\n\nLet me count each letter step by step.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R\n\nLet me count the letters:\n\nBreaking into parts:\n\nBABCHRISTMAS → B, A, B, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S → 12 letters.\n\nBONATALLE → B, O, N, A, T, A, L, L, E → 9 letters.\n\nFATHER → F, A, T, H, E, R → 6 letters.\n\nTotal 12+9+6=27 letters. But the combined length of guest and host is 11 + 14 = 25. So len(pile) is 27, which is longer than 25. Therefore, the code would output NO, which matches the sample. So the code would handle that correctly.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: All empty strings? But according to the problem statement, all lines are not empty. So no need to handle that.\n\nEdge case 2: All same letters. Like guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\" → YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"BA\" → YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → YES.\n\nIf pile is \"AAB\", then len is 3, but combined is 2 → output NO.\n\nWhat about case where the combined and pile have same length but different letters? Like guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"BB\" → len is same (2), but sorted combined is ['A', 'B'], sorted pile is ['B', 'B'] → not same → output NO.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the input is read via input().strip(). But the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So for example, in the first sample input, the first line is 'SANTACLAUS', the second 'DEDMOROZ', third 'SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS'.\n\nBut when reading via input(), each input() call reads a line, including any leading or trailing whitespace. However, the problem says that all lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. So the .strip() is safe here. But perhaps, the problem's input may have leading or trailing spaces? No, according to the problem statement, the input lines consist of uppercase letters only, no other characters. So using .strip() is safe. However, perhaps the input is read as input().strip() to avoid any leading/trailing whitespace, even though the problem says that the input lines don't have any.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, perhaps the code should read each line as input().strip().\n\nSo the code is as written before.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, the input is three lines. But the sample input is given as a list of three elements. But in the actual problem, the input is three lines. So for example, the first test case's input is:\n\nSANTACLAUS\n\nDEDMOROZ\n\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nSo the code would read those three lines correctly.\n\nSo the code would process each of the three lines correctly.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the Python code should be as follows.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door could be rearranged to form the combined names of the guest and the host. This involves checking if the pile contains exactly the same characters as the combined names, with no extra or missing letters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the three input lines which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Combined String**: Concatenate the guest's name and the host's name into a single string.\n3. **Length Check**: Check if the length of the combined string matches the length of the pile. If they do not match, immediately return \"NO\".\n4. **Character Comparison**: If the lengths match, sort both the combined string and the pile of letters. If the sorted versions are identical, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check for the presence of exactly the same characters in both the combined names and the pile, leveraging sorting to compare character counts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    guest = input().strip()\n    host = input().strip()\n    pile = input().strip()\n    \n    combined = guest + host\n    if len(combined) != len(pile):\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The code reads three lines from the input, each representing the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters.\n- **Combining Strings**: The guest's and host's names are concatenated into a single string to form the combined string.\n- **Length Check**: If the length of the combined string does not match the length of the pile, it is impossible for the pile to contain the exact letters needed, so the answer is immediately \"NO\".\n- **Sorting and Comparing**: By sorting both the combined string and the pile, we can directly compare if they contain the same characters in the same quantities. If they do, the answer is \"YES\"; otherwise, it is \"NO\".\n\nThis method efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures correctness by leveraging sorting for character count comparison.",
