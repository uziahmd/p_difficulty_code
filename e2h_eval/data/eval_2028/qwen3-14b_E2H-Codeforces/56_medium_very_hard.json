Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if there's a perfect matching between Rebel spaceships and bases such that no two connecting lines intersect. The input gives me R spaceships and B bases, and I need to check if such a matching exists.\n\nFirst, the problem says that every base must be assigned exactly one spaceship, and vice versa. So the first thing is that R must equal B. Wait, the input constraints say that R and B can be up to 10. Oh wait, the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching, which implies that R and B must be equal. So if R != B, the answer is immediately No. But looking at the input examples, in the second case, it's 2 1, which would have R=2 and B=1. So the answer is No because you can't have a perfect matching. So the first check is whether R equals B. If not, output No.\n\nSo the first step is to check if R and B are equal. If not, return 'No'.\n\nNow, assuming R = B, the problem becomes finding a perfect matching between the two sets (spaceships and bases) such that no two edges (connecting lines) cross each other.\n\nSo how do I model this? Well, the problem is equivalent to checking if there's a bipartite matching between the two sets where the edges represent non-crossing connections. But since the problem requires that all edges in the matching are non-crossing, we need to find a way to check for such a matching.\n\nBut how to model this? For each possible perfect matching (which would be R! possibilities), check if any two edges cross. However, with R up to 10, 10! is 3.6 million, but for each of these permutations, checking all pairs of edges for intersection. For 10 elements, that would be O( (R^2) * R! ) operations. For R=10, that's 10^2 * 3.6e6 = 3.6e8 operations. Hmm, that might be manageable, but perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to model this as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if they don't cross with others. But since the problem requires that all edges in the matching are non-crossing, it's not straightforward. Because even if two edges don't cross each other, adding another edge might cross with one of them.\n\nWait, but perhaps the problem can be approached by considering the order of points. For example, if we sort the spaceships and bases in some way, like by their x-coordinate, and then match them in order. But that's just a heuristic. However, the problem says that any two paths (edges) must not cross. So maybe there's a way to arrange the matching such that when sorted in a certain way, all edges are non-crossing.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as a bipartite graph where each possible pair (spaceship, base) is an edge, but with the condition that when selecting edges for a matching, no two edges cross. Then, the problem reduces to finding a perfect matching in this graph.\n\nBut how to model this? The problem is that the edges are not independent; the presence of one edge affects the possibility of others. So, for example, if two edges cross, they cannot both be in the matching. Therefore, the problem becomes finding a perfect matching in the bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if they don't cross with any other edges in the matching. However, this seems complex to model directly.\n\nAn alternative approach is to generate all possible perfect matchings (permutations) and check for each if any pair of edges cross. Since R is small (up to 10), this approach might be feasible.\n\nLet me think: for R=10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, we need to check all pairs of edges (i.e., for each pair of edges in the matching, check if they cross). For each permutation, checking O(R^2) pairs. For R=10, that's 10*10=100 checks per permutation. Total operations would be around 3.6e5 * 100 = 3.6e8 operations. Wait, but that's a lot. However, given that Python can handle about 1e8 operations in a few seconds, perhaps this approach would be too slow. But for R=10, 3.6e8 operations may be too much. Wait, but maybe the actual number is smaller. Let me calculate:\n\nEach permutation has R edges. For each permutation, the number of pairs of edges is R*(R-1)/2. For R=10, that's 45 pairs. So total operations would be 3.6e6 * 45 = 163 million. That's a lot for Python, which can handle about 1e8 operations per second. So 1.6e8 would take about 1.6 seconds. But maybe with optimizations, it's manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think again.\n\nAnother idea: the problem is equivalent to finding a non-crossing matching between two sets of points. This is similar to the problem of matching points in two sets such that no two edges cross. How can this be done?\n\nIn computational geometry, there's a concept of non-crossing matchings. For instance, if you sort the points in one set and the other set in the same order, then matching them in order would result in a non-crossing matching. But this depends on the arrangement.\n\nFor example, suppose we sort all the spaceships and bases in a certain order (like by their x-coordinate, or polar angle from a certain point), then match them in that order. However, this might not always work. But perhaps for the problem's constraints, there's a way to sort them such that the matching is non-crossing.\n\nAlternatively, the problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where edges are allowed only if they don't cross with any other edges in the matching. However, since the matching is a set of edges, this is a problem of finding a perfect matching in a graph that is dependent on the entire set of edges chosen.\n\nBut perhaps for small R and B, the brute-force approach is feasible. Let's proceed with that.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Check if R != B. If so, output 'No'.\n\n2. Else, generate all possible permutations of the bases (since each permutation represents a possible matching: the i-th spaceship is matched to the i-th base in the permutation).\n\nWait, but the spaceships are fixed. Let me clarify: the problem is to assign each spaceship to a unique base. So the possible perfect matchings are all the bijections between the two sets. So for each possible permutation of the bases, we can consider that the i-th spaceship is matched to the perm[i]-th base. Or perhaps, considering that the spaceships are in a list, and the bases are in a list, and the permutation represents which base each spaceship is assigned to.\n\nSo for example, if the spaceships are S = [s1, s2, s3], and the bases are B = [b1, b2, b3], then a permutation p = [0, 1, 2] would mean s1→b1, s2→b2, s3→b3. Another permutation p = [2, 1, 0] would mean s1→b3, s2→b2, s3→b1.\n\nSo generating all permutations of the bases (assuming the bases are ordered in a list) and checking for each permutation whether the corresponding matching has any crossing edges.\n\nSo the steps for each permutation:\n\nFor each pair of edges (s_i → b_p[i], s_j → b_p[j]), check if the line segments between them cross.\n\nIf any pair of edges cross, then this permutation is invalid. Otherwise, it's valid, and we can return 'Yes'.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nGenerate all permutations of the bases (for the case where R=B). For each permutation, check all pairs of edges for crossings. If any permutation passes, return 'Yes'; else, 'No'.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments cross?\n\nThe problem says that the paths are straight lines from the base to its assigned spaceship. So for two pairs (s1, b1) and (s2, b2), the line segments between s1 and b1, and between s2 and b2 must not cross.\n\nBut how to determine if two line segments cross?\n\nWe need to check if the two line segments intersect. However, the problem says that no three points are colinear. So no three points lie on the same line. Which helps because it avoids cases where two segments overlap partially.\n\nSo the standard line segment intersection check can be used here.\n\nBut how to implement that?\n\nThe standard approach is to use the orientation method. The steps are:\n\nTwo line segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\n1. The orientations of (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) are different, and the orientations of (C, D, A) and (C, D, B) are different. (This is the case when the segments cross each other.)\n\nOR\n\n2. One of the endpoints lies on the other segment. But according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear. So this case can't happen. Because if, say, C lies on AB, then points A, C, B are colinear, which is not allowed. Therefore, the second case (endpoint lying on another segment) is impossible. Hence, we can ignore that.\n\nTherefore, the check for two line segments AB and CD is whether their orientations are different.\n\nSo the steps for checking if AB and CD intersect:\n\nCompute the orientation of A, B, C and A, B, D. If they are different, then check the orientation of C, D, A and C, D, B. If those are also different, then the segments cross.\n\nBut perhaps I should use the standard function to check if two line segments intersect.\n\nSo the code for checking if two line segments (p1, q1) and (p2, q2) intersect.\n\nFirst, define the orientation function. The orientation of three points (p, q, r) is determined as follows:\n\n- 0 if colinear,\n- 1 if clockwise,\n- 2 if counterclockwise.\n\nBut for our case, since no three points are colinear, the orientation will never be zero.\n\nSo the function:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0])*(r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1])*(r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # colinear\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2  # 1 for clockwise, 2 for counterclockwise\n\nThen, the segments AB and CD intersect if:\n\norientation(A,B,C) != orientation(A,B,D) and orientation(C,D,A) != orientation(C,D,B)\n\nSo the code for checking if two segments AB and CD intersect would be:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    if o1 != o2 and o3 != o4:\n        return True\n    return False\n\nWait, but there's a possibility that the segments are overlapping. But according to the problem statement, no three points are colinear. So that scenario can't happen. Because if AB and CD share a common point, then that would imply that one of the endpoints is on the other segment. But since the problem states that no three points are colinear, that's not possible. So the only possible way for the segments to intersect is when they cross each other, which is the case checked by the above code.\n\nSo that's the function to check if two segments cross.\n\nNow, for each permutation of the bases, we need to check all pairs of edges in the matching. For example, for permutation p (where each spaceship i is matched to base p[i]), then for each pair (i,j), check if the segment between spaceship i and base p[i] crosses the segment between spaceship j and base p[j].\n\nIf any such pair exists, the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nFor each permutation in permutations of the bases (assuming that the bases are numbered 0..R-1):\n\n   create the list of edges (spaceship i to base p[i])\n\n   for all i < j:\n\n      check if the segments between (spaceship i, base p[i]) and (spaceship j, base p[j]) intersect.\n\n      if yes, then this permutation is invalid. Break and check next permutation.\n\nIf any permutation passes all checks, output 'Yes', else 'No'.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line has R and B. Then R lines for the spaceships, then B lines for the bases.\n\nBut note that the input may have R and B as different, but the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching. So first check if R != B, return 'No'.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nWe can represent the spaceships as a list, say ships = [ (x0, y0), ... ]\n\nSimilarly, bases = [ (x0, y0), ... ]\n\nThen, generate all permutations of the bases. For each permutation p (which is a list of indices into the bases list), we check if the matching (ship i to base p[i]) has any crossing segments.\n\nBut wait, the permutation is of the bases. For example, if the bases are [b0, b1, b2], then a permutation [1, 0, 2] would mean ship 0 is connected to base 1, ship 1 to base 0, etc.\n\nBut how to generate all possible permutations of the bases? Well, since the bases are in a list, we can generate all permutations of the indices 0 to R-1, and for each permutation, assign ship i to base perm[i].\n\nSo in code:\n\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\nfor perm in permutations(range(B)):\n\nBut since B = R, because we checked R == B earlier.\n\nSo for each perm in permutations(range(R)):\n\n   for each pair of i < j:\n\n      check if the segment between ships[i] and bases[perm[i]] intersects with the segment between ships[j] and bases[perm[j]]\n\nIf any of these pairs intersect, then this perm is invalid.\n\nOnce all permutations are checked, if any is valid, output 'Yes', else 'No'.\n\nNow, the problem is that for R=10, permutations would be 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, checking R*(R-1)/2 pairs. For R=10, that's 45 pairs. For each pair, checking the intersection.\n\nBut in Python, even with that, for R=10, 3.6e6 * 45 = 163 million checks. Each check involves four orientation calculations. However, perhaps with some optimizations, this can be handled.\n\nBut let's think about the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nShips are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nBases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nOne possible permutation is [0,1,2], meaning ship 0 to base 0, ship 1 to base 1, ship 2 to base 2.\n\nCheck if any pairs cross.\n\nShip 0 to base 0: line from (0,0) to (-2,1)\n\nShip 1 to base 1: (2,0) to (0,3)\n\nShip 2 to base 2: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\nDo any of these cross?\n\nCheck between ship0-base0 and ship1-base1:\n\nLine segments (0,0)-(-2,1) and (2,0)-(0,3). Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute their orientations.\n\nBut perhaps in the sample, they don't cross. So the answer is 'Yes'.\n\nBut the code would generate all permutations and check.\n\nNow, for the code.\n\nImplementing the orientation function.\n\nBut in Python, how to handle that.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nif R != B:\n\n   print 'No'\n\nelse:\n\n   read R ships.\n\n   read B bases.\n\n   generate all permutations of the bases (as indices)\n\n   for each permutation:\n\n       check if all pairs of edges are non-crossing.\n\n       if found, return 'Yes'\n\n   after all permutations, return 'No'\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut for the permutations, in Python, permutations are generated from the itertools.permutations function.\n\nBut since the bases are stored as a list, the permutations are of range(R) (since B=R).\n\nSo, for example, for R=3, permutations(range(3)) gives all possible orderings.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImplement the orientation function.\n\nBut wait, the code needs to be efficient. Let me think about how to write the functions.\n\nImplementing the orientation function:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n\n    # p, q, r are tuples (x, y)\n\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n\n    if val == 0:\n\n        return 0\n\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\nBut since the problem says that no three points are colinear, so in our code, val will never be zero. So perhaps we can skip checking for that, but it's safer to leave it in.\n\nBut for the problem's constraints, the code can proceed.\n\nThen, the function to check if two segments AB and CD intersect:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n\n        return True\n\n    return False\n\nBut wait, this is the standard check for two line segments intersecting. However, there is a case when one of the segments is entirely contained within the other. But the problem states that no three points are colinear, so that can't happen. So this function should correctly return True if the segments cross.\n\nSo, for each permutation, for all i < j, check if segments_intersect(ships[i], bases[perm[i]], ships[j], bases[perm[j]]).\n\nIf any of these returns True, then the permutation is invalid.\n\nSo, for each permutation, loop over all i < j pairs.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut for R=10, the code may be slow. However, given that the constraints are small (R and B up to 10), it's acceptable.\n\nLet me test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nShips are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]\n\nBases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)]\n\nThe permutation [0,1,2] would connect:\n\nShip 0 to base 0: (0,0) to (-2,1)\n\nShip 1 to base 1: (2,0) to (0,3)\n\nShip 2 to base 2: (3,1) to (2,2)\n\nCheck between ship 0 and 1:\n\nCheck if their segments cross.\n\nLet me compute the orientation.\n\nA = (0,0), B = (-2,1), C = (2,0), D = (0,3).\n\nWait, the segments are AB and CD, where AB is ship0 to base0, CD is ship1 to base1.\n\nWait, no. The first segment is between A (ship0) and B (base0). The second segment is between C (ship1) and D (base1).\n\nSo AB is (0,0) to (-2,1), CD is (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nCheck if these two segments cross.\n\nCompute o1 = orientation(A, B, C) = orientation of (0,0), (-2,1), (2,0).\n\nval = (-2 - 0)*(0 - 0) - (1 - 0)*(2 - 0) ?\n\nWait, the formula is (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x)\n\nSo for p = A = (0,0), q = B = (-2,1), r = C = (2,0):\n\n(q.x - p.x) = -2 - 0 = -2\n\n(r.y - p.y) = 0 - 0 = 0\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 1 - 0 = 1\n\n(r.x - p.x) = 2 - 0 = 2\n\nval = (-2)*0 - (1)*2 = 0 - 2 = -2 → which is negative. So orientation returns 2 (since val < 0).\n\nThen o2 is orientation(A, B, D) → D is (0,3).\n\nSame p = A, q = B, r = D.\n\n(q.x - p.x) = -2, (r.y - p.y) = 3 - 0 = 3.\n\n(q.y - p.y) = 1, (r.x - p.x) = 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nval = (-2)*3 - (1)*0 = -6 - 0 = -6 → negative. So o2 is 2.\n\nSo o1 and o2 are same (both 2). So the first condition (o1 != o2) is false. So the segments don't cross.\n\nThen check between ship0 and ship2.\n\nShip0 to base0: (0,0) to (-2,1).\n\nShip2 to base2: (3,1) to (2,2).\n\nCheck if these cross.\n\nA is (0,0), B is (-2,1). C is (3,1), D is (2,2).\n\nCompute o1 = orientation(A,B,C) → (0,0), (-2,1), (3,1).\n\nval = (-2 - 0)*(1 - 0) - (1 - 0)*(3 - 0) → (-2)(1) - (1)(3) = -2 -3 = -5 → negative → orientation 2.\n\no2 = orientation(A,B,D) → (0,0), (-2,1), (2,2).\n\nval = (-2)(2 - 0) - (1)(2 - 0) → (-2)(2) - 1*2 → -4 - 2 = -6 → negative → orientation 2. So same as o1. So again, no crossing.\n\nThen check between ship1 and ship2.\n\nShip1 (2,0) to base1 (0,3). Ship2 (3,1) to base2 (2,2).\n\nCheck if these cross.\n\nA is (2,0), B is (0,3). C is (3,1), D is (2,2).\n\no1 is orientation(A,B,C) → points (2,0), (0,3), (3,1).\n\nval = (0-2)*(1 - 0) - (3 - 0)*(3 - 2) → (-2)(1) - 3*(1) → -2 -3 = -5 → negative → orientation 2.\n\no2 is orientation(A,B,D) → (2,0), (0,3), (2,2).\n\nval = (-2)*(2-0) - 3*(2-2) → (-2)*2 - 3*0 → -4 → negative. So o2 is 2. Same as o1. So no crossing.\n\nThus, this permutation is valid. Hence, the answer is Yes.\n\nNow, the code would find this permutation and return 'Yes'.\n\nThe second sample input is:\n\n['2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, the input is R=2, B=1. So since R != B, output is 'No'.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nBut first, handling the input. The input is given as a list of strings. Wait, looking back, the user provided the input as a list of strings. Wait, in the problem description, the input is given as a list of strings. But in reality, the code must read from stdin. However, in the sample input given, the first example is:\n\nInput:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nBut that seems like the input is given as two separate test cases. Wait, the original problem says that the input is given via standard input. But perhaps the user is providing the input as a list of test cases, but in the actual code, the code should read from stdin.\n\nWait, the problem says that the code must read input from stdin and print output to stdout. So the code must read from stdin. The sample input shows that the first input is for the first test case, and the second is for the second test case. But in reality, the code must process one test case per run. However, the problem statement's sample input shows that the input is given as a list of strings, but perhaps that's a mistake. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nLooking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases.\n\nSo the input is a single test case. The sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases for the example, but the actual code should process a single test case.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the user's code is supposed to read from stdin. So the code should read the input as per the problem's input description.\n\nSo the code should read R and B from the first line, then read R lines for the spaceships, then B lines for the bases.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for the first example, the input is:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nWhich is R=3, B=3. Then three lines for the ships, then three for the bases.\n\nSo the code should read from stdin normally.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is given as a list of strings, which may be for testing purposes. However, the actual code must read from stdin.\n\nSo the code will read from stdin, split into lines, and process accordingly.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nImport necessary modules: itertools.permutations.\n\nRead R and B from the first line.\n\nIf R != B, print 'No'.\n\nElse:\n\nRead R lines for the ships.\n\nRead B lines for the bases.\n\nThen generate all permutations of the bases (indices 0 to R-1).\n\nFor each permutation, check all pairs of edges for intersection.\n\nIf any permutation is valid, output 'Yes' and exit.\n\nElse, after checking all permutations, output 'No'.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as follows:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # returns 1, 2, or 0\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx +=1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        ships.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=1\n    # Now check all permutations\n    for perm in permutations( range(R) ):\n        # perm is a tuple of indices for bases\n        # check all pairs i < j\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                # get the two segments\n                A = ships[i]\n                B = bases[ perm[i] ]\n                C = ships[j]\n                D = bases[ perm[j] ]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, the code for checking the permutation is:\n\nfor each permutation:\n\n   valid = True\n\n   for i in 0..R-1:\n\n      for j in i+1..R-1:\n\n         check if segments between ships[i] and bases[perm[i]] and ships[j] and bases[perm[j]] intersect.\n\n         if yes, mark as invalid and break.\n\nBut in the code, the loops are:\n\nfor i in range(R):\n\n    for j in range(i+1, R):\n\n        check if segments_intersect(...)\n\n        if yes, set valid to False and break.\n\nBut in the code, after checking for j, once valid is False, break out of the i loop.\n\nBut in the code, after the inner loop (j), if valid is False, break and proceed to check next permutation.\n\nBut the code is correct.\n\nBut what about the time for R=10? Let's see.\n\nBut for the problem's constraints, this code should work.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3\n\n0 0\n\n2 0\n\n3 1\n\n-2 1\n\n0 3\n\n2 2\n\nThe code would generate permutations and find that at least one permutation is valid.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 1\n\n1 0\n\n2 2\n\n3 1\n\nHere, R=2, B=1. So output is 'No'.\n\nAnother test case: when R=B=1. Then, there is only one possible permutation. Since there's only one segment, no intersections. So output 'Yes'.\n\nAnother test case: R=B=2. Suppose ships are (0,0), (0,1), bases are (1,0), (1,1). Permutation [0,1] connects (0,0)-(1,0) and (0,1)-(1,1). These two segments are parallel, no crossing. So output 'Yes'.\n\nAnother permutation [1,0] connects (0,0)-(1,1) and (0,1)-(1,0). These two segments cross. So in this case, the code would check both permutations. The first permutation is valid, so output 'Yes'.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nBut what about cases where there are multiple permutations, some of which are valid?\n\nThe code returns as soon as it finds one.\n\nNow, possible optimizations.\n\nBut for the code as written, perhaps in some cases, the code can be optimized. For example, precompute all the pairs. But for R=10, it's manageable.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in the code, for each permutation, the code checks all pairs of edges. However, in the worst case, for each permutation, it's O(R^2) checks. But with R=10, it's manageable.\n\nNow, what about the case where R=0? According to the problem statement, R and B are at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut in the code, the permutation is generated for range(R), which is correct since B=R.\n\nThus, this should solve the problem.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to assign Rebel spaceships to bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base, with the additional constraint that no two connecting paths (straight lines) intersect in the 2D galaxy plane.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check for Equal Numbers**: First, check if the number of spaceships (R) is equal to the number of bases (B). If not, immediately return \"No\" as a perfect matching is impossible.\n2. **Generate Permutations**: For each possible permutation of the bases, generate potential assignments of spaceships to bases.\n3. **Check for Intersections**: For each permutation, check if any pair of connecting paths (segments between a spaceship and its assigned base) intersect using computational geometry principles.\n4. **Orientation Check**: Use the orientation method to determine if two line segments intersect. This involves checking the relative orientation of points to determine if segments cross.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    if (o1 != o2) and (o3 != o4):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    idx = 0\n    R, B = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    ships = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        ships.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x, y = map(int, input[idx].split())\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 1\n    # Check all permutations\n    for perm in permutations(range(R)):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                A = ships[i]\n                B = bases[perm[i]]\n                C = ships[j]\n                D = bases[perm[j]]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and split into lines for processing.\n2. **Initial Check**: The first check ensures that the number of spaceships equals the number of bases, which is a prerequisite for a perfect matching.\n3. **Permutations Generation**: Using `itertools.permutations`, all possible assignments of bases to spaceships are generated.\n4. **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, every pair of connecting paths is checked for intersections using the orientation method. This method determines if two line segments intersect by checking the relative orientations of their endpoints.\n5. **Output Result**: If any valid permutation (without intersecting paths) is found, \"Yes\" is printed. If none are found after checking all permutations, \"No\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all constraints are checked efficiently given the small input size (up to 10 spaceships and bases), leveraging permutations and geometric checks to determine the feasibility of non-intersecting assignments.",
