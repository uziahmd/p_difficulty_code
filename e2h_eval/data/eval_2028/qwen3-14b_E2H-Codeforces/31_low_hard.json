Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Vanya has some cards, and the sum of the found ones needs to be zero. The task is to find the minimum number of additional cards he needs to find to make the total sum zero. The cards can have numbers from -x to x. \n\nSo first, let's understand the problem. Let's take the example given. In the first input, the sum of the found cards is -1 + 1 + 2 = 2. So to make the total sum zero, he needs to add a card with -2. Which is possible since x is 2. So the answer is 1. \n\nIn the second example, the sum is -2 + (-2) = -4. The maximum absolute value is 3. So he needs to add 4. But since each card can contribute up to 3, he needs two cards: 3 + 1 (but wait, maybe 2 and 2? Or 3 and 1? Wait, but the maximum allowed is 3. So the sum needed is 4. How can we get that with minimal cards? Well, the maximum per card is 3. So one card can contribute 3, then another 1. But that's two cards. So the answer is 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: find the minimal number of cards needed to add to reach a sum that cancels the current sum. Let me think about the steps.\n\nFirst, compute the total sum of the found cards. Let's call it S. Then, we need to find the minimal number of cards such that their sum is -S. Because adding those cards will make the total sum zero.\n\nBut how to find the minimal number of cards to reach a sum of -S, given that each card can be between -x and x. Wait, but the problem says that each card can be any integer between -x and x. So the maximum absolute value per card is x. So for example, if we need to reach a sum of T (which is -S), what's the minimal number of cards?\n\nLet me think. Let's say T is the target sum. Let me take T as the absolute value. Because if T is negative, we can just take the same approach. For example, if T is -5, then the minimal number of cards is same as for 5. Because we can use negative numbers. So let's take absolute value of T.\n\nSo, let's calculate T = abs(S). Then, the problem is to find the minimal k such that k * x >= T. Because each card can contribute at most x. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). But wait, let me think again.\n\nSuppose T is 5, x is 2. Then, 5 / 2 is 2.5. So ceil(2.5) is 3. Which would be 2+2+1, but wait, but each card can be up to 2. So 2+2+1 is 5, but 1 is allowed. But the maximum per card is x. So yes. So the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). But wait, what if T is exactly divisible by x? Then it's T/x. For example, T=4, x=2: 4/2=2 cards. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula is ceil(T / x). But how to compute that in Python. Well, in Python, we can compute it as (T + x -1) // x. Because for example, 5 + 2-1 = 6, divided by 2 is 3. Which is correct. For 4, 4+2-1=5, divided by 2 is 2.5 floored to 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then the answer is zero. Because no cards are needed. So in that case, we return 0.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the sum S of the found cards.\n\n2. If S is zero, return 0.\n\n3. Else, compute T = abs(S).\n\n4. Compute the minimal number of cards as ceil(T / x), which is (T + x -1) // x.\n\nBut wait, let's test the examples.\n\nFirst example: sum is 2. T is 2. x is 2. (2 + 2-1) // 2 = (3) // 2 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nSecond example: sum is -4. T is 4. x is 3. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose sum is 5, x is 2. Then (5 + 2-1)/2 = 6/2=3.",
