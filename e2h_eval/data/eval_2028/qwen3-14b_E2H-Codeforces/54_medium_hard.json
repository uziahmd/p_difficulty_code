Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form .

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about finding three vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And we need to output any of the optimal triplets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the angles in a regular polygon work. Let me think. For a regular n-gon, each internal angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, that's the internal angle of the polygon itself. However, when we choose three vertices, the angle formed at v2 isn't necessarily that. So how do we compute the angle for any triplet?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have a regular polygon with n sides. Let's imagine selecting three vertices v1, v2, v3, where v2 is the vertex where the angle is formed. The angle at v2 depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2 along the perimeter.\n\nWait, in a regular polygon, all the vertices lie on a circle. So the central angles between adjacent vertices are 360/n degrees. For example, in a square (n=4), each central angle is 90 degrees.\n\nNow, when you pick three points v1, v2, v3 on the polygon, the angle at v2 can be determined based on the number of edges between v1 and v2, and between v3 and v2. Let me think: suppose there are k steps between v1 and v2 clockwise, and m steps between v3 and v2 clockwise. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the actual positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2 would determine the angle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the angle depends on the number of sides between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. Wait, perhaps the key is to consider the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Because in a circle, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice that subtended at the circumference. But I'm not sure exactly how that applies here.\n\nLet me think again. For a regular polygon, if we fix v2 as the vertex where the angle is formed, then v1 and v3 must be two other vertices. The angle at v2 depends on how many vertices are between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon.\n\nLet me take an example. For a square (n=4), if we pick vertices 1, 2, 3. The angle at 2 is 90 degrees. If we pick vertices 1, 2, 4, then the angle at 2 would be 45 degrees. Because the arc between 1 and 4 (without passing through 2) is 270 degrees, but the central angle would be 270, but the inscribed angle would be half of that? Wait, no. Wait, the angle at v2 is formed by two chords. Let me think of the triangle formed by v1, v2, v3. The angle at v2 is determined by the arcs between v1 and v2, and between v3 and v2. Or perhaps the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't include v2.\n\nAlternatively, here's a formula I found once. For a regular n-gon, the angle formed at a vertex when choosing two other vertices that are k steps apart. Let me think: suppose between v1 and v3, there are k edges along the perimeter. Then the angle at v2 would be something like (k-1)* (180/(n)) ?\n\nWait, maybe I need to find a general formula for the angle at v2. Let's think about the regular polygon as being inscribed in a unit circle. Let's imagine that the vertices are placed at angles θ_i = 2π*(i-1)/n radians, for i from 1 to n.\n\nSuppose we pick v2 as vertex 2. Let's say v1 is vertex 2 - k steps away, and v3 is vertex 2 + m steps away. But since the polygon is regular and convex, the angle at v2 would depend on the number of steps between v1 and v3. Wait, perhaps the angle is determined by the number of edges between v1 and v3 when moving along the perimeter in one direction. Let me think: for example, in a regular pentagon (n=5), if I take vertices 1, 2, 3. The angle at 2 is the internal angle of the polygon, which is (5-2)*180/5 = 108 degrees. But if I take vertices 1, 2, 4, then the angle at 2 would be smaller. How?\n\nAlternatively, the angle can be calculated based on the number of sides between v1 and v3. Let's say that between v1 and v3, there are m vertices (excluding v1 and v3). Then, the central angle between them is (m+1)* (360/n) degrees. Then, the angle at v2 would be half of that? No, that's for an inscribed angle. Wait, the inscribed angle theorem says that the angle subtended by an arc at the center is twice that subtended at the circumference. So if the arc between v1 and v3 is α degrees, then any point on the circumference that's not on that arc would form an angle of α/2. But in our case, v2 is one of the vertices. So if the arc between v1 and v3 is α degrees, then the angle at v2 would be α/2. But how does that relate to the position of v2?\n\nWait, if the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 is α degrees, then the angle at v2 would be (α)/2. Because that's the inscribed angle. But how to compute α?\n\nFor example, in the square case. Let's take vertices 1, 2, 4. The arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't contain 2 is 270 degrees (since the square's total is 360). But that's not possible because the arc between 1 and 4 passing through 3 would be 270 degrees. But then the angle at 2 would be 270/2 = 135 degrees? But earlier examples said that in a square, the angle can be 45 or 90 degrees. Hmm, so this approach might be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express the problem. Let's take the square example again. When choosing vertices 1, 2, 3. The angle at 2 is 90 degrees. Which is the internal angle of the square. Now, if I choose vertices 1, 2, 4. The angle at 2 is formed by the lines from 2 to 1 and 2 to 4. In the square, this forms a 45-degree angle. How?\n\nBecause the square has coordinates (assuming unit circle for simplicity) as follows: 1 at (1,0), 2 at (0,1), 3 at (-1,0), 4 at (0,-1). The vectors from 2 to 1 is (1, -1), and from 2 to 4 is (0,-2). The angle between these vectors can be computed using the dot product. Let me compute that:\n\nVector 2 to 1 is (1-0, 0-1) = (1,-1). Vector 2 to 4 is (0-0, -1-1) = (0,-2). The angle between them is arccos( ( (1)(0) + (-1)(-2) ) / ( |v1| * |v2| )) = arccos(2/(sqrt(2)*2)) ) = arccos( 2/(2*sqrt(2)) ) = arccos(1/sqrt(2)) = 45 degrees. Oh right! So that's 45 degrees. So the angle depends on how far apart the other two points are from v2.\n\nSo for a regular polygon, if we fix v2, and then choose v1 and v3 such that there are k steps between v1 and v2, and m steps between v3 and v2. But since the polygon is regular, the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2 would determine the angle. However, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of edges between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in a certain direction.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose that for a fixed v2, the number of edges between v1 and v3 (along the perimeter) is m. Then, the angle at v2 would be ( (m) * (180/(n)) ) ?\n\nWait, in the square example, when v1 is 1, v2 is 2, and v3 is 4, then the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter (passing through 3) is 3 steps (from 1 to 2 is 1 step, then 2 to 3 is another, then 3 to 4 is another. Wait, but the steps between v1 and v3 would be 3 steps. But the angle was 45 degrees. Let me see: 3 steps between v1 and v3 would correspond to an arc of 3*(360/4) = 270 degrees. Then according to the inscribed angle idea, the angle at v2 would be (arc length)/2 = 270/2 = 135 degrees. But that's not matching the actual calculation. So that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm. So maybe the formula is different. Let me think again. The angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon in the direction that doesn't pass through v2. Wait, maybe not. Let's think of another approach.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is 360/n degrees. Let's imagine that when you select three vertices v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of sides between v1 and v2, and between v3 and v2. Wait, but since the polygon is regular, the angle depends only on the number of steps between v1 and v2 and between v3 and v2. Wait, but since the polygon is symmetric, perhaps the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 when going around the polygon in one direction. For example, if between v1 and v3 there are k steps (in the clockwise direction), then the angle at v2 would be something based on k.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following: For a regular polygon, if we fix v2 as the vertex, and then select v1 and v3 such that there are k steps between v1 and v2 in one direction, and l steps between v3 and v2 in the other direction. Then, the angle at v2 would be determined by the number of steps between v1 and v3. Let me think of the case where v1 is k steps away from v2 in one direction, and v3 is m steps away in the other direction. Then, the total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter would be k + m steps. But since the polygon is regular, the angle at v2 can be calculated based on the number of steps between v1 and v3.\n\nBut how? Let's take an example. In the square case, if v1 is 1 step away from v2 (say, v2 is vertex 2, v1 is vertex 1), and v3 is 1 step away in the other direction (vertex 3). Then, the angle at v2 is 90 degrees. Which is the internal angle of the square. If instead, v3 is 2 steps away in the other direction (vertex 4), then the angle at v2 is 45 degrees. So what's the pattern here?\n\nThe number of steps between v1 and v3 in the direction that doesn't pass through v2 is (n - (k + m))? Or something else? Let me think. In the square example, when v1 is 1 step away from v2 (vertex 1), and v3 is 2 steps away from v2 in the other direction (vertex 4), then the steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter that does not pass through v2 is 2 steps (from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4? No, that's 3 steps. Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's find a formula for the angle at v2. Suppose that between v1 and v3, there are m vertices (excluding v1 and v3) along the arc that does not contain v2. Then, the arc length between v1 and v3 is (m + 1) * (360/n) degrees. Then, according to the inscribed angle theorem, the angle at v2 would be half of that arc. Wait, but in the square example, when v1 is 1 and v3 is 4, the arc between them that doesn't contain v2 (which is vertex 2) is the arc passing through 3. That's 3 steps (from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4?), no. Wait, the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't contain v2 (vertex 2) would be the longer arc. For the square, the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't contain 2 is 3 edges long (from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4?), but that includes vertex 2. Wait, no. Wait, if v2 is vertex 2, then the arc between v1 (1) and v3 (4) that doesn't contain v2 would be the arc going from 1 to 4 through 3. But that arc does not contain vertex 2. The number of steps between 1 and 4 along that arc is 3 steps (from 1 to 2 is one, but that's not part of the arc. Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here.\n\nLet me think of the square again. For the case where the angle at 2 is 45 degrees (vertices 1,2,4). The arc between 1 and 4 that does not contain 2 is the arc from 1 to 4 via 3. The length of this arc is 2 edges (from 1 to 3 is two edges, but the arc between 1 and 4 via 3 is three edges? No. The square has four vertices. From 1 to 4 via 3 is 1 -> 4? No, that's one edge if you go counter-clockwise. Wait, the square has edges between 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-1. So the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't contain 2 is the direct edge from 1 to 4 (but that's not an edge of the square. Oh right, the square's edges are adjacent vertices. So the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't contain 2 is the arc that goes from 1 to 4 via 3. Which is two edges (1-3 is not an edge, but the arc would be 1-4 is one edge? No, the arc between 1 and 4 is either 1-2-3-4 (three edges) or 1-4 (one edge). So the arc that does not contain vertex 2 is the 1-4 edge, which is one edge. Then the central angle for that arc is 90 degrees. So according to the inscribed angle theorem, the angle at v2 (vertex 2) would be half of that, which is 45 degrees. Which matches the example. Oh! So that's the correct approach.\n\nSo the formula is: the angle at v2 is equal to half of the central angle of the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. Therefore, to find the angle, we need to compute that arc length and divide by 2.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each possible triplet, compute the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2, then compute its central angle, then divide by 2 to get the angle at v2.\n\nBut how do we find the arc length between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2?\n\nAssuming that the polygon is labeled in clockwise order. Let's assume that the vertices are numbered 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\nIf we fix v2, then for any two other vertices v1 and v3, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be the shorter arc (or not?), but perhaps not. Wait, in the square example, the arc between 1 and 4 that doesn't contain 2 is the shorter arc (length 1 edge), but the arc that contains 2 is the longer arc (length 3 edges). So the arc that does not contain v2 is the shorter arc.\n\nBut how to compute this? Let's think. For any two distinct vertices v1 and v3, there are two arcs between them. One of them is shorter than or equal to the other. The arc that does not contain v2 is the one that is not passing through v2. But how to compute that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given v2, and given v1 and v3, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 can be found by checking whether v2 is on the arc between v1 and v3 in the other direction. This seems complicated.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this. Let's imagine that for a fixed v2, we can select v1 and v3 such that they are k steps away from v2 in opposite directions. For example, if v1 is k steps clockwise from v2, and v3 is m steps counter-clockwise from v2. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is the arc that goes from v1 to v3 via the other side. The length of that arc would be (k + m) steps. But since the polygon has n vertices, the total steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is (k + m) steps. Therefore, the central angle is (k + m) * (360 / n) degrees. Then, the angle at v2 is half of that, which is (k + m) * (180 / n) degrees.\n\nBut wait, in the square example, if v2 is 2, then v1 is 1 step clockwise (k=1), and v3 is 1 step counter-clockwise (m=1). Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is (k + m) = 2 steps. Central angle is 2 * 90 = 180 degrees. Angle at v2 is 90 degrees, which is correct for the internal angle of the square.\n\nAnother example: v1 is 1 step clockwise from v2 (k=1), and v3 is 2 steps counter-clockwise from v2 (m=2). Then, the arc between v1 and v3 that doesn't contain v2 is 1+2=3 steps. Central angle is 3*90=270 degrees. Angle at v2 is 270/2 = 135 degrees. But earlier example with v2=2, v1=1, v3=4 (which is 2 steps counter-clockwise from v2) gives an angle of 45 degrees. Wait, that contradicts this formula. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, in the example where v2 is 2, v1 is 1 (1 step clockwise from v2?), no. Wait, the numbering is clockwise. So for the square, the vertices are ordered 1, 2, 3, 4 clockwise. So, if v2 is 2, then clockwise from v2 is 3, then 4, then 1, etc. Counter-clockwise from v2 is 1, then 4, then 3, etc.\n\nSo if v1 is 1 (which is counter-clockwise from v2 by 1 step), and v3 is 4 (counter-clockwise from v2 by 2 steps). Wait, but that would mean that the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 would be the arc that goes from 1 to 4 via 3, which is 2 steps (from 1 to 4 is directly one edge, but that's not possible. Wait, this is getting confusing again. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nLet me think: for a fixed v2, any other vertex can be considered as being k steps away in the clockwise direction. For example, for the square, vertex 2 is the current vertex. The vertices clockwise from it are 3 (k=1), 4 (k=2), 1 (k=3), and then back to 2 (k=4). Similarly, counter-clockwise steps would be negative.\n\nBut perhaps for any pair of vertices v1 and v3, the minimal number of steps between them is min(d, n-d), where d is the absolute difference in their positions. However, for our problem, we need to find the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2. How can we find that?\n\nAlternatively, for a given v2, and any two vertices v1 and v3, the arc between v1 and v3 that does not contain v2 must be the arc that is opposite to v2. So, for example, if v2 is in the arc between v1 and v3 in the other direction, then the arc that does not contain v2 is the other arc.\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps there's a better way. Let's think about the angle at v2. For any three distinct vertices, the angle at v2 depends on how many vertices are between v1 and v3 along the perimeter. Let's assume that between v1 and v3 (in the perimeter), there are k vertices. Then, the arc between v1 and v3 is (k+1) steps. The central angle is (k+1) * (360/n) degrees. The angle at v2 is half of that. So the angle is (k+1) * (180/n) degrees.\n\nBut how to find k for a given triplet?\n\nWait, for example, in the square case where v1 is 1, v2 is 2, v3 is 4. Between v1 and v3 along the perimeter (not passing through v2) are vertices 3. So k=1. Then the angle is (1+1)*180/4 = 2*45 = 90 degrees? But earlier calculation showed that the angle was 45 degrees. So this formula is not correct.\n\nHmm. So clearly, my previous reasoning is flawed. Let me try to find another approach.\n\nLet me think of the regular polygon as being inscribed in a unit circle. Let me assign coordinates to each vertex. Let's say that the center of the circle is O. The vertices are placed at angles θ_i = 2π(i-1)/n radians, for i from 1 to n.\n\nNow, consider three vertices v1, v2, v3. We want to find the angle at v2. Let's denote the vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3. Let me find the angle between these two vectors.\n\nLet me consider the positions of the points. Let me assume that v2 is at angle θ. Then, v1 is at angle θ - α, and v3 is at angle θ + β, where α and β are multiples of 2π/n. The angle between the vectors v2v1 and v2v3 can be found using vector math.\n\nBut perhaps there's a simpler way. Since the polygon is regular, the angle between two adjacent vertices from the center is 2π/n radians. The angle between vectors from v2 to v1 and from v2 to v3 depends on the arc between v1 and v3 that passes through the opposite side of the polygon from v2.\n\nLet me think again. For example, in the square case where v2 is at (0,1), v1 is at (1,0), and v3 is at (0,-1). The vectors from v2 to v1 are (1-0, 0-1) = (1,-1). The vector from v2 to v3 is (0-0, -1-1) = (0,-2). The angle between these two vectors is 45 degrees. How can I find this angle in terms of the positions of v1 and v3 relative to v2?\n\nThe arc between v1 and v3 that does not include v2 is the arc from v1 to v3 passing through the opposite side of the polygon. The central angle for this arc is (number of steps between v1 and v3 along this arc) * (2π/n) radians. Let's call this angle φ. Then, the angle at v2 is equal to φ/2 radians. Wait, earlier example: φ is 270 degrees (3 steps in the square), which divided by 2 is 135 degrees. But the actual angle was 45 degrees. So this is not matching. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: The angle at v2 is equal to π - φ/2, where φ is the central angle for the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2. Let's test this. In the square example, the arc containing v2 between v1 and v3 is the arc from v1 to v3 passing through v2, which has central angle of 90 degrees (since v1 is 1, v3 is 4, and passing through 2 and 3). Wait, that's 3 steps (from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4) which is 3 * 90 = 270 degrees. So φ = 270 degrees. Then π - φ/2 is 180 - 135 = 45 degrees, which matches the example. Yes! So this seems to be the correct formula.\n\nSo the angle at v2 is equal to π - (φ)/2, where φ is the central angle of the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2. But since we're working in degrees, it would be 180 - (φ_degrees)/2.\n\nBut how to compute φ_degrees?\n\nWell, φ_degrees is the central angle of the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2. This arc can be calculated as follows: for any two distinct vertices v1 and v3, the arc that contains v2 is the longer of the two arcs between them, unless the two arcs are equal (when the polygon is even and the arc is exactly half the circle).\n\nBut how to find the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2?\n\nLet me think. For a given v2, and two other vertices v1 and v3, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is the one that passes through v2. To find the number of steps between v1 and v3 along this arc, we can calculate the distance between v1 and v3 in the clockwise direction, or in the counter-clockwise direction, whichever includes v2.\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed v2, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is equal to (distance between v1 and v3 along the entire perimeter) minus the steps along the arc that does not contain v2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed v2, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is the arc that passes through v2. The length of this arc can be calculated as follows: the total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter is d. Then, the arc that contains v2 is (n - d) steps, since the other arc is d steps. Wait, no. Because the total number of steps between v1 and v3 along the perimeter is d (the minimal steps) and n - d steps (the maximal steps). But which of these contains v2?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, for the purpose of finding the angle at v2, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2. Let me denote this number as k. Then, the central angle is (k * 360/n) degrees. And the angle at v2 is 180 - (k * 180/n) degrees.\n\nLet me test this with the square example. For v1=1, v2=2, v3=4. The arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is the longer arc (steps from 1 to 4 passing through 2 and 3). The number of steps here is 3 (from 1 to 2 to 3 to 4). So k=3. Then the angle at v2 is 180 - (3 * 180/4) = 180 - 135 = 45 degrees. Correct!\n\nAnother example: v1=1, v2=2, v3=3. The arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is the shorter arc (steps from 1 to 3 passing through 2). Steps here is 2 (from 1 to 2 to 3). So k=2. The angle is 180 - (2 * 180/4) = 180 - 90 = 90 degrees. Correct.\n\nAnother example: for a pentagon (n=5), suppose v2 is vertex 2, v1 is vertex 1, v3 is vertex 4. The arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is from 1 to 4 passing through 2 and 3. Steps: 1->2 (1), 2->3 (2), 3->4 (3). So k=3 steps. The central angle is 3*72 = 216 degrees. The angle at v2 is 180 - 216/2 = 180 - 108 = 72 degrees.\n\nBut how to compute k for any given triplet?\n\nThe key insight is that for a given v2, the number of steps k between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is equal to (distance between v1 and v3 in the perimeter) + something? No. Alternatively, for any two vertices v1 and v3, the minimal distance between them is d, and the maximal is n -d. The arc that contains v2 is the one with length n -d steps if v2 is on that arc. But how to determine whether v2 is on the longer or shorter arc between v1 and v3?\n\nThis seems complex. However, perhaps we can find that for any three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is (distance between v1 and v3) + 2 * (some value). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for a fixed v2, and for any two other vertices v1 and v3, the arc between v1 and v3 that contains v2 is the arc that passes through v2. To find the number of steps k between v1 and v3 along this arc, we can imagine that the arc starts at v1, goes through v2, and ends at v3. The number of steps would be the number of steps from v1 to v2 plus the steps from v2 to v3.\n\nBut since the polygon is regular and the vertices are labeled in clockwise order, we can compute the distance between v1 and v2 in the clockwise direction as (v2 - v1) mod n, and similarly for other distances. Wait, but the labels are from 1 to n in clockwise order. So, for example, the distance from v1 to v2 in clockwise direction is (v2 - v1) if v2 > v1, or (v2 - v1 + n) otherwise. But this is not accurate. For example, in a square (n=4), the distance from 4 to 1 in clockwise direction is 1 step. But (1-4) mod 4 is 3, but the actual distance is 1.\n\nAh, right. The clockwise distance from a to b is (b - a) if a < b, else (b - a + n). Or more accurately, it's (b - a) mod n, but since we want the minimal steps in the clockwise direction. Wait, no. The number of steps from a to b in clockwise direction is (b - a) if b >= a, else (b - a + n). For example, a=4, b=1, n=4: steps = 1 -4 +4 = 1. Correct.\n\nSo for any two vertices a and b, the clockwise steps from a to b is (b - a) if b >=a, else (b -a +n). Let's call this function cw(a, b).\n\nSimilarly, the counter-clockwise steps would be n - cw(a, b).\n\nBut how to find the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2?\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have v1, v2, v3. The arc from v1 to v3 that contains v2 must pass through v2. So, the arc is from v1 to v2 to v3. The number of steps along this arc is cw(v1, v2) + cw(v2, v3). But this would be the case if v3 is in the clockwise direction from v2. However, if v3 is in the counter-clockwise direction from v2, then this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, the arc from v1 to v3 that contains v2 is the arc that goes from v1 to v3 through v2. This means that v2 lies on the arc between v1 and v3. So, to check if v2 is on the arc between v1 and v3, we can see if the clockwise distance from v1 to v3 is greater than the clockwise distance from v1 to v2 plus the clockwise distance from v2 to v3. Or something like that.\n\nThis seems complicated. Perhaps there's another way. Let me think: for any triplet, the angle at v2 is determined by the number of vertices between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2. Let me denote this number as k. Then the angle is 180 - (k * 180/n) degrees.\n\nBut how to find k?\n\nAlternatively, since the angle depends on the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2, which is (n - d), where d is the minimal number of steps between v1 and v3. Because the minimal steps is d, and the other arc is n -d steps. So if the arc that contains v2 is the larger arc (n -d steps), then k = n -d. But how to know whether v2 is on the larger arc or not?\n\nThis seems tricky. However, perhaps for any triplet of vertices, the angle at v2 depends on the number of vertices between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2. And since we're trying to minimize the difference between the angle and a, perhaps we can find for each possible k (number of steps) what the corresponding angle is, and find the best k.\n\nBut how to find the possible values of k?\n\nLet me think: For a fixed v2, the angle at v2 depends on the choice of v1 and v3. However, for any choice of v1 and v3, the number of steps between them along the arc that contains v2 is k, which ranges from 2 to n-2. Wait, for example, in the square, when v1 and v3 are adjacent to v2 (like v1=1, v2=2, v3=3), the arc that contains v2 is 2 steps (from v1 to v2 to v3), and k=2. The angle is 180 - (2 * 180/4) = 180 - 90 = 90 degrees. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: if v1 and v3 are diametrically opposite (if n is even), then the arc that contains v2 could be either of the two equal arcs. But that's a special case.\n\nBut perhaps for any triplet, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2 is (s + t), where s is the number of steps from v1 to v2 in one direction, and t is the number of steps from v2 to v3 in the same direction. But this depends on the direction.\n\nAlternatively, for any v2, the possible angles at v2 are determined by the number of vertices between v1 and v3 along the arc that contains v2. Let's assume that between v1 and v3, there are m vertices along the arc that contains v2. Then, the number of steps between v1 and v3 along that arc is m+1 steps. So the central angle is (m+1)* (360/n) degrees, and the angle at v2 is 180 - ((m+1)*180/n) degrees.\n\nBut how to find m for any triplet?\n\nThis seems too abstract. Let me think of the problem in terms of choosing for v2, and for some k, choosing v1 and v3 such that the arc between",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at one of the vertices is as close as possible to a given angle `a`. The solution involves calculating the possible angles formed at each vertex and selecting the one that minimizes the difference from `a`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Angles in Regular Polygons**: In a regular n-gon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{360}{n} $ degrees. The angle at a vertex (v2) formed by two other vertices (v1 and v3) can be derived using geometric properties.\n2. **Angle Calculation**: For a given vertex v2, the angle formed by vertices v1 and v3 depends on the number of steps between them along the arc that contains v2. This angle can be calculated using the formula derived from the properties of regular polygons.\n3. **Iterative Search**: For each vertex v2, we check possible configurations of v1 and v3 to determine the angle closest to `a`. We use a binary search approach to efficiently find the optimal configuration.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import math\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    if n == 3:\n        print(\"1 2 3\")\n        return\n    \n    # For a regular n-gon, the angle at v2 when there are k steps between v1 and v3 along the arc containing v2\n    # is 180 - (k * 180 / n)\n    # We need to find k such that this value is as close as possible to a\n    # The minimal k is 2 (since v1 and v3 must be distinct from v2 and each other)\n    # The maximal k is n-2\n    \n    # So for each possible k (from 2 to n-2), compute the angle\n    # Then find the k which gives the closest angle to a\n    # Once found, construct the triplet\n    \n    best_diff = float('inf')\n    best_k = 2\n    for k in range(2, n-1):\n        angle = 180 - (k * 180.0 / n)\n        diff = abs(angle - a)\n        if diff < best_diff:\n            best_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n        elif diff == best_diff:\n            # Prefer smaller k or any\n            if k < best_k:\n                best_k = k\n    \n    # Now, find any triplet that corresponds to best_k\n    # For example, take v2 = 1, then v1 is 1 - best_k steps in one direction, and v3 is 1 + 1 steps?\n    # Or more accurately, for v2=1, v1 is 1 - best_k steps clockwise (but need to wrap around)\n    # Let's choose v2 = 1, and v1 = 1 - best_k steps clockwise (i.e., (1 - best_k) mod n)\n    # Wait, but how to ensure that the arc containing v2 is of length k steps?\n    # For example, if best_k is the number of steps between v1 and v3 along the arc containing v2, then we need to choose v1 and v3 such that the arc from v1 to v3 through v2 has k steps.\n    # One way is to choose v1 as v2 - m steps, and v3 as v2 + (k - m) steps, where m is chosen so that the steps are valid.\n    # But perhaps the simplest way is to choose v2 = 1, v1 = 1 - best_k + 1, and v3 = 1 + 1.
