A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out how many toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So the answer is the maximum possible number of toasts per friend such that all the resources are sufficient.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input gives n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt). Then, each toast requires nl ml of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and np grams of salt per friend.\n\nWait, no. Wait, the problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs these things. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl ml. Because each friend has one toast. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (since each friend uses one slice per toast). And the salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nWait, no. Let me recheck:\n\nThe problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for each toast, each friend requires these. So if there are t toasts, then each friend makes t toasts. So for all friends, total drink required is n * t * nl. Because each friend has t toasts, each requiring nl ml. Similarly, for lime slices: each toast per friend requires a slice, so total slices needed is n * t. And salt is n * t * np grams.\n\nSo the problem is to find the maximum t such that:\n\nTotal drink available >= n * t * nl\n\nTotal lime slices available >= n * t \n\nTotal salt available >= n * t * np \n\nAnd then t is the minimum of the possible values from each resource.\n\nSo first, compute how much of each resource is available.\n\nDrink available: k * l ml.\n\nLime slices available: c * d.\n\nSalt available: p grams.\n\nThen, for each resource, calculate the maximum possible t that can be supported.\n\nFor drink: (k*l) / (n * nl) → but since t must be integer, floor division.\n\nFor lime: (c*d) / (n) → again floor division.\n\nFor salt: p / (n * np) → floor division.\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of those three values.\n\nWait, but in the first example:\n\nSample input is 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1.\n\nSo n=3 friends.\n\nDrink available is 4*5=20ml. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml? Wait, no. Wait, for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink is n * nl. For t toasts, it's t * n * nl. So for the first sample:\n\nt is the number of toasts per friend. So for each toast, each friend uses nl ml. So for t toasts, each friend uses t * nl ml. Total for all friends is n * t * nl.\n\nSo for the first sample:\n\nDrink available is 4*5 =20ml. The total required for t toasts is 3 * t * 3 = 9t. So 9t ≤ 20 → t ≤ 2.222..., so floor is 2.\n\nLime slices available is 10 * 8 =80 slices. Total required is 3 * t → 3t ≤80 → t ≤26.666... so floor 26. But since the drink allows only 2, that's the min.\n\nSalt is 100 grams. Required is 3 * t * 1 = 3t. 3t ≤100 → t ≤33.333, floor 33. So the minimum of 2, 26, 33 is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the maximum t for each resource:\n\nt_drink = (k*l) // (n * nl)\n\nt_lime = (c*d) // (n)\n\nt_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nThen the answer is min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt).\n\nBut wait, what if any of these values is zero? Like in the third sample input:\n\nSample input 3: 10 1000 1000 25 23 1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources per friend, and we must ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Compute the total amount of drink available from the bottles, the total number of lime slices from the limes, and the total amount of salt available.\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**: For each resource, determine how many toasts can be made given the constraints:\n   - **Drink**: The total drink available divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total lime slices available divided by the number of slices needed per toast for all friends.\n   - **Salt**: The total salt available divided by the amount needed per toast for all friends.\n3. **Determine Maximum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum value obtained from the constraints of the three resources.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    input_line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split the input into individual numbers\n    numbers = list(map(int, input_line.split()))\n    \n    # Extract the parameters\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = numbers\n    \n    # Calculate total drink available\n    total_drink = k * l\n    # Calculate total lime slices available\n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    # Salt is already given as p\n    \n    # Compute max toasts based on each resource\n    t_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    t_lime = total_lime_slices // n\n    t_salt = p // (n * np)\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three\n    print(min(t_drink, t_lime, t_salt))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers for processing.\n- **Resource Calculation**: \n  - **Total Drink**: Calculated by multiplying the number of bottles by the volume per bottle.\n  - **Total Lime Slices**: Calculated by multiplying the number of limes by the number of slices per lime.\n- **Toast Constraints**: For each resource, the maximum number of toasts is determined by integer division of the total resource by the required amount per toast for all friends.\n- **Result Calculation**: The final result is the minimum value of the three constraints, ensuring that all resources are sufficient for the number of toasts calculated. This ensures that no resource is exhausted before the others, providing the correct maximum number of toasts each friend can make.",
