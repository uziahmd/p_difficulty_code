A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible number determined by the available resources divided by the number of friends, right?\n\nLet me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each toast requires for each friend: nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for one toast, each friend needs those things. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl ml. Because each of the n friends needs nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (since each friend needs one slice). And for salt, each toast requires n * np grams.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose they make t toasts. For each toast, each friend needs some amount. So for t toasts, each friend would have t * nl ml of drink, t slices of lime, and t * np grams of salt. But since there are n friends, the total required resources would be:\n\nDrink: n * t * nl ml. Because each of the n friends has t toasts, each needing nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl.\n\nLime slices: n * t. Because each friend needs one slice per toast, so for t toasts, n * t slices.\n\nSalt: n * t * np grams. Because each friend needs np grams per toast, so total is n * t * np.\n\nBut the available resources are:\n\nTotal drink available is k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices available is c * d.\n\nSalt available is p grams.\n\nSo, the maximum t such that:\n\nn * t * nl <= k * l\n\nn * t <= c * d\n\nn * t * np <= p\n\nSo, solving for t in each of these inequalities:\n\nt <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nt <= (c*d) / n \n\nt <= p/(n * np)\n\nThen the maximum possible t is the minimum of these three values, but since t has to be an integer (you can't have a fraction of a toast), we take the floor of each of these values and then take the minimum.\n\nWait, but how do we compute it? For example, for the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total drink is 4*5=20 ml. For the drink constraint, n*t*nl = 3 * t * 3 = 9t. So 9t <= 20 → t ≤ 20/9 ≈ 2.222. So floor is 2.\n\nFor the lime slices: c*d is 10*8=80. n*t is 3t. So 3t ≤ 80 → t ≤ 26.666, floor is 26. But wait, the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. How?\n\nAh, the sample explanation says that for the first case, the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Let me check. The sample input is 3 friends, and the limes are 10, cut into 8 slices each. So total slices is 10*8=80. Each toast requires n slices (since each of the n friends needs one slice per toast). So for t toasts, the total slices needed is n * t. So for t toasts, n*t ≤ c*d. So for the first sample, 3*t ≤ 80 → t ≤ 80/3 ≈ 26.666. So the maximum t here is 26. But the sample explanation says that the limes are enough for 80 toasts. Wait, that seems conflicting. Oh, maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait the sample explanation says: the limes are enough for",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources for each friend, and we must ensure that all friends can make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: Determine the total amount of drink available from the bottles, the total number of lime slices from the limes, and the total amount of salt available.\n2. **Determine Constraints**: For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made based on the available quantity and the requirements per toast.\n3. **Compute Maximum Toasts**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is determined by the minimum of the values derived from each resource constraint. This is because the limiting factor will be the resource that runs out first.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal_drink = k * l\ntotal_lime_slices = c * d\n\nmax_toasts_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\nmax_toasts_lime = total_lime_slices // n\nmax_toasts_salt = p // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_toasts_drink, max_toasts_lime, max_toasts_salt)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Total Resources Calculation**:\n   - **Drink**: The total amount of drink available is calculated as `k * l` (number of bottles multiplied by milliliters per bottle).\n   - **Lime Slices**: The total number of lime slices is calculated as `c * d` (number of limes multiplied by slices per lime).\n   - **Salt**: The total amount of salt available is given directly as `p`.\n\n2. **Constraints for Toasts**:\n   - **Drink Constraint**: Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink (since each of the `n` friends needs `nl` milliliters). The maximum number of toasts based on drink is `total_drink // (n * nl)`.\n   - **Lime Constraint**: Each toast requires `n` slices (one per friend). The maximum number of toasts based on lime slices is `total_lime_slices // n`.\n   - **Salt Constraint**: Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt (since each of the `n` friends needs `np` grams). The maximum number of toasts based on salt is `p // (n * np)`.\n\n3. **Result Calculation**: The result is the minimum of the three values calculated above, as this represents the limiting factor that determines how many toasts can be made without exceeding any resource constraints.",
