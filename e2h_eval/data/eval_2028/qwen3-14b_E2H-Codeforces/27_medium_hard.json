On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to find the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing some subarray in the original array. The original array consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nSo the key is to figure out which subarray to reverse so that when we reverse it, the overall longest non-decreasing subsequence is as long as possible. But how do I approach this efficiently?\n\nFirst, let me think about the original array's longest non-decreasing subsequence. For example, if the array is already non-decreasing, then reversing any subarray might not help. But if there are some fluctuations, maybe reversing a certain part can make more 1s followed by 2s.\n\nBut since the array only has 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is basically the count of 1s plus the count of 2s that come after the last 1. Wait, no. Actually, the maximum possible length is the total number of elements if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the maximum between the count of 1s and 2s, but that's not necessarily correct. Wait, no. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the longest non-decreasing subsequence is 2 (like 1,2 or 1,2), but after reversing [2,3], it becomes [1,1,2,2], which gives a length of 4. So the original maximum was 2, but after reversing, it's 4.\n\nSo the idea is that by reversing a subarray, we can possibly merge some parts of the array into a longer non-decreasing sequence.\n\nBut how do I model this? Trying all possible subarrays to reverse would be O(n^2) possibilities, and for each of those, compute the longest non-decreasing subsequence. However, n is up to 2000, so O(n^2) is 4 million, and for each of those, computing the LNDS (longest non-decreasing subsequence) would take O(n^2) time, which would be 4 million * 4 million operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me think: Since the array consists of only 1s and 2s, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is simply the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s. Because any subsequence can't have more than all 1s followed by all 2s. So the maximum possible length is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the original array. Or perhaps the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s? No, that's not right. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], the maximum is 2 (the length of 1,2 or 1,2). But if you reverse the middle two elements, you get [1,1,2,2], which gives length 4.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding a way to reverse a subarray such that the number of 1s followed by 2s is maximized.\n\nWait, but how can reversing a subarray help? Let's think about what reversing does. Suppose we have a subarray from l to r. When reversed, the elements in that subarray are flipped. So, for example, if the original subarray had some 1s and 2s, after reversal, the order is reversed.\n\nBut how can that help in making the entire array have a longer non-decreasing sequence?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the array. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence is the maximum number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. But perhaps there's a way to have more 1s before some 2s by reversing a subarray.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire array as consisting of some number of 1s and 2s. The optimal scenario is that all 1s come before all 2s. The maximum possible length would be the total number of elements if that's the case. Otherwise, it's the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. But how can reversing a subarray help in merging some 1s and 2s?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that the optimal scenario after reversing a subarray is that the entire array is non-decreasing. If that's possible, then the answer is n. Otherwise, we need to find the best possible arrangement.\n\nBut how to find that? Well, maybe the original array is not non-decreasing, but after reversing some subarray, it becomes non-decreasing. For example, the first sample input is [1,2,1,2]. Reversing [2,3] gives [1,1,2,2], which is non-decreasing. So the answer is 4.\n\nBut how to check if there exists a subarray that, when reversed, makes the array non-decreasing? Well, that's a possibility. However, for some cases, even if that's not possible, we can find a way to maximize the length.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum possible length is either:\n\n- The original maximum length of the LNDS, or\n\n- The maximum possible length achievable by reversing some subarray.\n\nBut how do I compute the maximum possible length after reversing any subarray?\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible subarray [l, r], when reversed, the new array can be considered as:\n\noriginal[0..l-1] + reversed(original[l..r]) + original[r+1..n-1]\n\nWe need to find the maximum LNDS over all these possibilities.\n\nBut for n=2000, trying all O(n^2) possibilities and for each, compute LNDS in O(n) time would be O(n^3), which is 8e9 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo we need a smarter approach.\n\nSince the elements are only 1 and 2, perhaps we can find a way to calculate the maximum possible length without checking all possibilities.\n\nLet me think about the structure of the array. The LNDS for any array of 1s and 2s is equal to the number of 1s plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1. Or, alternatively, the maximum between the number of 1s and the number of 2s, but that's not correct. For example, [1,2,1,2] has 2 ones and 2 twos. The LNDS is 2. But if you arrange them as [1,1,2,2], then it's 4.\n\nWait, so the LNDS is the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s. So the maximum length is the number of 1s in the array plus the number of 2s that are after the last occurrence of 1 in the array. But that depends on the arrangement.\n\nBut after reversing a subarray, the arrangement of 1s and 2s can change.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal way to maximize the LNDS is to find a way to have as many 1s as possible followed by as many 2s as possible. How can reversing a subarray help in that?\n\nLet me think of the original array. Let's say that there are some 1s and 2s. The problem is that there are some 2s before some 1s. Reversing a subarray that contains some of those 2s and 1s could move the 1s to the left of the 2s.\n\nFor example, in the sample input, the original array is [1,2,1,2]. There's a 2 followed by a 1. Reversing that pair gives [1,1,2,2], which is optimal.\n\nAnother example: suppose the array is [2,1,2,1]. Reversing the entire array gives [1,2,1,2], which isn't better. But reversing [1,2] (the first two elements) gives [1,2,2,1], which has a LNDS of 3 (the first three elements). Alternatively, reversing [2,3] gives [2, 2, 1, 1], which has LNDS of 2. But maybe another reversal would be better. Alternatively, reverse [1,4], which gives [1, 2, 1, 2], which again has LNDS of 2. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think of the array as consisting of some number of 1s and 2s. The maximum possible LNDS is the total number of elements if the array is non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's the maximum number of 1s plus the number of 2s that come after the last 1. However, by reversing a subarray, we can potentially increase this value.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of (number of 1s in the entire array) + (number of 2s that are after some position, where all 1s before that position are arranged in a way that they are followed by 2s).\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal scenario is when there is a segment of 1s followed by a segment of 2s. The maximum possible length is the number of 1s plus the number of 2s. But if there are some 1s and 2s mixed, then the maximum is less than that.\n\nSo, the problem becomes: find a way to reverse a subarray so that the number of 1s before some point and 2s after that point is maximized.\n\nHow can reversing a subarray help in this?\n\nLet me think. Suppose that in the original array, there are some 2s followed by 1s. Reversing that subarray would turn those 2s into 1s and vice versa, but in reverse order. For example, if the original subarray is [2, 1], reversing it gives [1, 2], which is better. So this would help in merging the 1s and 2s.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum possible value is the total number of 1s plus the total number of 2s, minus the number of transitions from 2 to 1. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the original array as having some number of transitions between 1 and 2. For example, if the array is 1, 1, 2, 2, then there is one transition. If it's 1, 2, 1, 2, there are three transitions. Each time there's a 2 followed by a 1, that's a transition that can be fixed by reversing a subarray.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother approach: Let's precompute for each possible position i, the number of 1s up to i, and the number of 2s after i. Then, the maximum possible length would be max over i of (count_1s_up_to_i + count_2s_after_i). But how does reversing a subarray affect this?\n\nWait, the original maximum is that value. But by reversing a subarray, perhaps we can merge some 1s and 2s that were previously separated.\n\nFor example, suppose there is a segment of 2s followed by 1s. Reversing that segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s. So that would contribute to the count_1s_up_to_i + count_2s_after_i.\n\nBut how can we find such segments?\n\nLet me think of the original array. Let's imagine that there is a segment [l, r] where the original array has some 2s followed by some 1s. Reversing this segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s. Thus, the total number of 1s and 2s in the entire array would still be the same, but the arrangement would allow for a longer non-decreasing subsequence.\n\nSo perhaps the maximum possible value is the total number of 1s plus the total number of 2s (which is n) if the array can be made non-decreasing by reversing a subarray. Otherwise, it's the original maximum plus some amount based on the best possible reversal.\n\nBut how do I find that?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible pair of positions (i, j), where i is the end of some 1s and j is the start of some 2s, reversing the subarray between them would merge those regions.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let me think about the original array. Let's find all the positions where a 2 is followed by a 1. Each such occurrence is a place where reversing a subarray could help. For example, if there's a 2 followed by a 1, reversing the subarray containing just those two elements would turn them into 1 followed by 2, which is better.\n\nBut the maximum gain would be achieved by merging as many of these transitions as possible.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the original array. Let's compute the number of 1s and 2s. Let total_ones = number of 1s, total_twos = number of 2s. The maximum possible length is total_ones + total_twos = n if the array can be made non-decreasing. Otherwise, it's something less.\n\nBut how to find the maximum possible value after reversing a subarray.\n\nAnother idea: the optimal scenario after reversing a subarray is that the array has a block of 1s followed by a block of 2s. So the maximum possible length would be total_ones + total_twos = n. But if the original array can't be made into that form by reversing a single subarray, then the next best thing is to find the maximum possible number of 1s followed by 2s.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in such a way.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think of the following approach: for each possible subarray [l, r], when reversed, how much can it contribute to the total number of 1s followed by 2s?\n\nBut again, checking all possibilities is O(n^2) and for each, how to compute the contribution?\n\nAlternative approach inspired by dynamic programming:\n\nLet me think of the original array and consider all possible ways to reverse a subarray. The key observation is that the maximum length of the LNDS after reversing some subarray is equal to the maximum between:\n\n- The original maximum LNDS.\n\n- The maximum possible value obtained by merging some 1s and 2s via a reversal.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think of the following: for any subarray [l, r], when reversed, the new array will have the elements from l to r reversed. Let's think about how this affects the number of 1s and 2s in the entire array.\n\nThe total number of 1s and 2s remains the same. However, the arrangement can be better. So the maximum possible LNDS is the maximum between the original value and the value when the best possible arrangement is achieved by reversing a subarray.\n\nBut how to find that best possible arrangement?\n\nAnother idea: The LNDS in the new array is the maximum number of 1s in the array plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the new array. So, for any reversed subarray, the maximum LNDS is equal to the number of 1s in the entire array plus the number of 2s that are after the last 1 in the new array.\n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of (total_ones + number_of_2s_after_last_1_in_new_array).\n\nSo, how can reversing a subarray help to maximize the number of 2s after the last 1?\n\nLet me think about the original array. Suppose that in the original array, the last occurrence of 1 is at position x, and after that, there are y 2s. Then, the LNDS is total_ones + y. But if there are some 2s before x that are followed by 1s, reversing a subarray that includes those 2s and 1s could move the 1s to the end of the 2s, thereby increasing the count.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal way is to find the maximum number of 2s that can be placed after the last 1 in the array after reversing some subarray.\n\nSo, how can I find that?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nLet's precompute for each position i, the number of 1s before or at i, and the number of 2s after or at i.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider that reversing a subarray [l, r] can potentially create a new sequence where the last 1 is at some position, and after that, there are as many 2s as possible.\n\nSuppose that in the original array, the subarray [l, r] has some 1s and 2s. When reversed, the elements in [l, r] are reversed. Now, the new array's last 1 may be located in a different position.\n\nBut how to find the best scenario?\n\nLet me think of the following: the best scenario after reversing [l, r] would be that the reversed subarray contributes to having as many 2s after the last 1 as possible.\n\nSo, for example, if the original subarray [l, r] has some 1s followed by 2s, reversing it would turn them into 2s followed by 1s, which is worse. But if the original subarray has 2s followed by 1s, reversing it would turn into 1s followed by 2s, which is better.\n\nThus, the optimal subarray to reverse is one that has 2s followed by 1s. Reversing that would turn it into 1s followed by 2s. This would allow the 1s in that subarray to be merged with earlier 1s, and the 2s in that subarray to be merged with later 2s.\n\nSo, the idea is to find the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be merged by reversing a subarray that contains a transition from 2 to 1.\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nLet’s precompute for each position i, the number of 1s up to i, and the number of 2s from i onwards.\n\nThen, for each possible subarray [l, r], if the original subarray starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s, reversing it would allow us to add the number of 1s in the subarray to the total 1s before l, and the number of 2s in the subarray to the total 2s after r.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think of the following scenario. Suppose that in the original array, there is a segment [l, r] where the first element is 2 and the last element is 1. Reversing this segment would turn it into a segment starting with 1 and ending with 2. Now, the number of 1s before l (original) plus the number of 1s in this segment (which are now at the beginning of the segment) would be added to the count of 1s. Similarly, the number of 2s in this segment (now at the end of the segment) would be added to the count of 2s after r.\n\nBut how to find the maximum value of (number of 1s before l + number of 1s in [l, r] + number of 2s in [l, r] + number of 2s after r).\n\nWait, that's the total number of 1s and 2s, which is n. But that's only if the entire array can be made into a non-decreasing sequence. But perhaps in reality, there are other 2s and 1s outside this segment that are not properly ordered.\n\nBut this suggests that the maximum possible value is n if there exists a subarray that, when reversed, makes the entire array non-decreasing. Otherwise, we need to find the best possible scenario.\n\nBut how to compute this.\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nThe maximum possible value after reversing a subarray is the maximum between:\n\n- The original maximum LNDS.\n\n- For all possible pairs (i, j), where i is the position of the last 1 in the original array, and j is the position of the first 2 in the original array, and the subarray [i+1, j-1] is reversed. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the following: the best scenario is to find a segment that has as many 2s as possible followed by as many 1s as possible. Reversing that segment would turn it into 1s followed by 2s, which would allow the 1s to be merged with the previous 1s and the 2s to be merged with the following 2s.\n\nSo, for each possible segment [l, r], where the original segment starts with some 2s and ends with some 1s, the gain would be:\n\n(number of 1s in the segment) + (number of 2s in the segment) - (the number of 1s in the segment that were before some 2s outside the segment, etc.)\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the original array is [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2]. The total number of 1s is 3 and 2s is 3. The original maximum LNDS is 3 (the 1s or the 2s). But if we reverse the subarray [2,4], which is [2,2,1], reversing gives [1,2,2]. So the new array is [1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2]. The LNDS would be 4 (the first three 1s and 2s, but the last 1 is after the 2s, so the maximum is 4? Or maybe 5? Wait, the longest non-decreasing subsequence would be 1,1,2,2,2 (positions 0,1,2,3,5). So length 5. Which is better than the original 3.\n\nSo the gain here is because by reversing that segment, we merged the 1s into the previous 1s and the 2s into the following 2s.\n\nSo, the formula for the maximum LNDS after reversing [l, r] would be:\n\n(number of 1s before l) + (number of 1s in [l, r]) + (number of 2s in [l, r]) + (number of 2s after r).\n\nBut wait, that's only if the 1s in [l, r] are all before the 2s in [l, r] in the new array. Which is the case after reversing [l, r] if the original [l, r] had 2s followed by 1s. But what if the original [l, r] had a mix of 1s and 2s?\n\nThis seems complicated.\n\nAlternative plan:\n\nLet's precompute for all positions:\n\nprefix_ones[i] = number of 1s in the array up to index i (exclusive or inclusive? Need to define).\n\nsuffix_twos[i] = number of 2s from index i to end.\n\nThen, the original maximum LNDS is max( (prefix_ones[i] + suffix_twos[i]) for all i in 0..n )\n\nBut how does reversing a subarray [l, r] affect this?\n\nWhen you reverse [l, r], the number of 1s in the array is still the same. However, the arrangement changes. The best possible scenario is that the new array has a point where all 1s are before and all 2s are after. So, the maximum possible value would be prefix_ones_new + suffix_twos_new.\n\nBut how to calculate that for any [l, r]?\n\nLet me think: after reversing [l, r], the new array's prefix_ones_new up to some point would be:\n\nprefix_ones_before_l + (number of 1s in [l, r] that are now before the 2s in [l, r]) + ... ?\n\nAlternatively, think of the reversed subarray [l, r]. Let's say that in the original subarray, there are c1 1s and c2 2s. After reversing, the subarray has the same number of 1s and 2s. However, the order of the subarray is reversed.\n\nNow, the maximum possible (prefix_ones + suffix_twos) would be:\n\n(number of 1s before l) + (number of 1s in the reversed subarray that are before the 2s in the reversed subarray) + (number of 2s in the reversed subarray that are after the 1s) + (number of 2s after r).\n\nBut this depends on how the reversed subarray is structured.\n\nIf the reversed subarray is such that all 1s are before the 2s, then the contribution would be:\n\n(prefix_ones_before_l) + (c1) + (c2) + (suffix_twos_after_r).\n\nWhich equals prefix_ones_before_l + c1 + c2 + suffix_twos_after_r.\n\nBut prefix_ones_before_l + c1 is the total number of 1s up to the end of the reversed subarray (since the reversed subarray's 1s are now in the beginning of the subarray). And c2 is the number of 2s in the subarray, which are now at the end of the subarray. Adding the suffix_twos_after_r gives the total number of 2s after the subarray.\n\nSo, the total would be (prefix_ones_before_l + c1) + (c2 + suffix_twos_after_r) = (prefix_ones_before_l + c1 + c2) + (c2 + suffix_twos_after_r - c2) ? No, wait:\n\nActually, the total is (prefix_ones_before_l + c1) + (c2 + suffix_twos_after_r). Because the 1s are all before the 2s in the new array. So the total is (number of 1s before l) + (number of 1s in subarray) + (number of 2s in subarray) + (number of 2s after r).\n\nWhich equals (prefix_ones_before_l + c1) + (c2 + suffix_twos_after_r) = (prefix_ones_before_l + c1 + c2) + (suffix_twos_after_r) ?\n\nNo, because (prefix_ones_before_l + c1) is the number of 1s up to the end of the subarray (since the subarray's 1s are now at the beginning). Then, the number of 2s after the subarray is c2 (from the subarray) plus suffix_twos_after_r. So the total is (prefix_ones_before_l + c1) + (c2 + suffix_twos_after_r).\n\nBut prefix_ones_before_l + c1 is the number of 1s up to the end of the subarray. The c2 + suffix_twos_after_r is the number of 2s from the end of the subarray to the end of the array. So the sum is the total number of 1s up to the end of the subarray plus the total number of 2s from the end of the subarray onward. Which would be the maximum possible if the subarray is arranged as 1s followed by 2s.\n\nSo this suggests that for any subarray [l, r], if after reversing it, the subarray is arranged as all 1s followed by all 2s, then the maximum possible LNDS is (prefix_ones_before_l + c1) + (c2 + suffix_twos_after_r).\n\nBut how to compute this for all possible subarrays [l, r]?\n\nBut how do I know whether reversing [l, r] would result in the subarray being all 1s followed by all 2s?\n\nWell, that's only possible if the original subarray has all 2s followed by all 1s. Because when you reverse it, it becomes all 1s followed by all 2s. So, for example, if the original subarray is [2, 2, 1, 1], reversing gives [1, 1, 2, 2].\n\nSo, for each subarray [l, r], if the original subarray starts with some number of 2s followed by some number of 1s, then reversing it would give a subarray that is all 1s followed by all 2s. In this case, the contribution to the maximum LNDS is as computed above.\n\nBut how to find such subarrays?\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n1. Precompute prefix_ones and suffix_twos arrays.\n\nprefix_ones[i] = number of 1s in the array from 0 to i-1 (so prefix_ones[0] = 0, prefix_ones[1] = a[0] == 1 ? 1 : 0, etc.)\n\nsuffix_twos[i] = number of 2s in the array from i to n-1.\n\n2. For each possible subarray [l, r], check if the subarray starts with 2s and ends with 1s. If yes, then compute the value (prefix_ones[l] + number of 1s in [l, r] ) + (number of 2s in [l, r] + suffix_twos[r+1]). \n\nBut how to efficiently check if the subarray starts with 2s and ends with 1s?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible subarray [l, r], compute the number of 1s and 2s in it. Then, if the subarray has some 2s followed by 1s, then reversing it would contribute to the maximum.\n\nBut how to find all such subarrays?\n\nThis seems challenging. However, perhaps we can find for each possible position where a 2 is followed by a 1, and expand around it.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible l and r, where the subarray [l, r] has at least one 2 and at least one 1, and the first element is 2 and the last is 1.\n\nBut again, for n=2000, checking all O(n^2) subarrays is possible, but how?\n\nLet me think about the time complexity. For each subarray [l, r], we can precompute the number of 1s and 2s in it. To do that, we can use prefix sums. For example, for the number of 1s in [l, r], it's prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l]. Similarly for 2s.\n\nSo, for each subarray [l, r], we can compute:\n\ncount_1 = prefix_ones[r+1] - prefix_ones[l]\n\ncount_2 = (r - l + 1) - count_1\n\nThen, if the subarray starts with a 2 and ends with a 1, then reversing it would turn it into a 1s followed by 2s. So the contribution would be:\n\nprefix_ones[l] + count_1 + count_2 + suffix_twos[r+1]\n\nWhich simplifies to (prefix_ones[l] + count_1) + (count_2 + suffix_twos[r+1]) \n\nBut since count_1 + count_2 = r - l + 1, this is (prefix_ones[l] + count_1) + (count_2 + suffix_twos[r+1]) = (prefix_ones[l] + count_1) + ( (r - l + 1 - count_1) + suffix_twos[r+1] )\n\nBut this seems redundant. The total is prefix_ones[l] + count_1 + count_2 + suffix_twos[r+1] = prefix_ones[l] + (r - l + 1) + suffix_twos[r+1].\n\nBut prefix_ones[l] is the number of 1s before l, and (r - l + 1) is the total number of elements in the subarray. So adding that to suffix_twos[r+1] gives the number of 1s before l plus all elements in the subarray plus the number of 2s after r. But that doesn't seem right. Wait, no:\n\nWait, the contribution is (prefix_ones[l] + count_1) + (count_2 + suffix_twos[r+1]) = (prefix_ones[l] + count_1) is the number of 1s up to the end of the subarray (because the subarray's 1s are now at the beginning). The count_2 + suffix_twos[r+1] is the number of 2s from the end of the subarray to the end of the array. So adding those two gives the maximum possible length of the LNDS for that scenario.\n\nBut this is only valid if the subarray after reversal has all 1s followed by all 2s. So the condition is that the original subarray has all 2s followed by all 1s. But how to check that?\n\nWell, the original subarray must start with a 2 and end with a 1. But even if that is true, there may be 2s after some 1s in the subarray. For example, the subarray [2, 1, 2, 1]. The first element is 2, last is 1. But there are 2s after 1s. Reversing it would give [1, 2, 1, 2], which is not all 1s followed by 2s. So the condition is not sufficient.\n\nAh, right. So the original subarray must be a sequence of 2s followed by 1s. Only then, when reversed, it becomes 1s followed by 2s.\n\nSo how to check that? For the subarray [l, r], we need to ensure that all elements before the last occurrence of 1 in the subarray are 2s, and all elements after that are 1s.\n\nBut how to check that efficiently?\n\nAn alternative approach is to find for each possible l and r, the minimal and maximal values in the subarray. But that may not help.\n\nAlternatively, for each subarray [l, r], we can check if the first element is 2, the last element is 1, and there are no 1s before the last occurrence of 1 in the subarray. But this seems computationally intensive.\n\nPerhaps another way: For each possible subarray [l, r], if the first element is 2 and the last is 1, and the entire subarray is a non-decreasing sequence of 2s followed by 1s. Wait, no. It's a sequence that starts with 2s and ends with 1s, but in between, there may be some 2s and 1s. However, if the entire subarray is such that all 2s are before all 1s, then reversing it would give all 1s before all 2s.\n\nSo, the condition is that in the original subarray [l, r], the elements are a sequence of 2s followed by 1s. So, for example, [2,2,1,1], [2,1], [2,2,2,1,1], etc. But [2,1,2,1] is not such a sequence.\n\nHow can I check this for a given subarray?\n\nThe subarray must be of the form 2...21...1. So, once a 1 appears in the subarray, all subsequent elements must be 1s.\n\nSo, for the subarray [l, r], we can find the first occurrence of 1 in the subarray. All elements before this first occurrence must be 2s, and all elements after must be 1s.\n\nSo, for each subarray [l, r], we can:\n\n- Check if the first element is 2 and the last is 1.\n\n- Find the first index in the subarray where a 1 appears.\n\n- Check that all elements from l to that index-1 are 2s, and all elements from that index to r are 1s.\n\nBut doing this for every subarray would be O(n^3) in the worst case, which is not feasible for n=2000.\n\nHmm. So perhaps this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nSince the array consists of only 1s and 2s, we can precompute for each position the number of transitions between 1 and 2. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], there are three transitions (1->2, 2->1, 1->2).\n\nEach transition from 2 to 1 represents a potential place where reversing a subarray could help. For each such transition, we can consider reversing the subarray that starts at the beginning of the 2s and ends at the end of the 1s.\n\nBut how to find those ranges?\n\nFor example, in the array [1,2,2,1,1,2], the transitions are 1->2 (at index 0), 2->1 (at index 2), 1->2 (at index 4). The 2->1 transition occurs between index 2 and 3. So the subarray from index 1 to 3 (values [2,2,1]) can be reversed to [1,2,2], which helps.\n\nBut how to find all such possible ranges that contain a 2->1 transition.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's find all the positions where a",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that reversing a subarray can help merge segments of 1s and 2s into a more non-decreasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: We precompute prefix arrays to count the number of 1s up to each position and suffix arrays to count the number of 2s from each position to the end of the array.\n2. **Check All Subarrays**: For each possible subarray [l, r], we check if reversing it can potentially merge segments of 1s and 2s.
