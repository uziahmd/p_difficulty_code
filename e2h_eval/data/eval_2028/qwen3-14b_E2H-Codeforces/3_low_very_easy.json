Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum radius d for the lanterns so that the entire street is lit. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that each lantern can light up points within a distance d from it. So, the goal is to find the smallest d such that every point on the street (from 0 to l) is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the steps needed here. \n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is that the lanterns' positions might not be sorted. So maybe I should start by sorting them. Because if they are sorted, it's easier to check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. Because the maximum gap between two consecutive lanterns would determine the required d, but maybe divided by two? Or perhaps not exactly. Let me think.\n\nWait, suppose there are two consecutive lanterns at positions a and b. The area between them that isn't covered by either would be the middle point. For example, if the lanterns are at positions x and y (x < y), then the maximum distance between them is y - x. The worst case is the midpoint between them. The distance from each lantern to that midpoint is (y - x)/2. So, the required d for that gap would be (y - x)/2. But wait, that's only if the lanterns are placed in such a way that their coverage overlaps. But if the gap between two consecutive lanterns is larger than 2d, then there's an area not covered. So, the maximum of these (gap/2) values across all consecutive lanterns would be the required d. However, there's also the edge cases: the first lantern might not be at 0, so the area from 0 to the first lantern's position minus d needs to be covered. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nWait, right. For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. The light from the first lantern covers up to a1 + d. But to cover the starting point (0), we need that a1 - d <= 0. So d must be at least a1. Similarly, for the last lantern, if it's at position an, then the end of the street is l. So the light must cover l, which requires that an + d >= l. So d must be at least l - an. \n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions.\n2. Check the first lantern's position. The required d must be at least the first lantern's position (since the start of the street is 0, and the lantern's coverage needs to reach there).\n3. Similarly, check the last lantern's position. The required d must be at least (l - last lantern's position).\n4. Then, for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the distance between them. The maximum gap between consecutive lanterns is (current - previous). For that gap, the required d is (gap / 2), because the middle point between them would be the farthest point from both. So, the maximum of all these (gap/2) values is considered.\n5. The answer is the maximum between the first part (the first lantern's position and the last lantern's position) and the maximum of the consecutive gaps divided by two.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's take an example. Suppose the first lantern is at position 3. Then the distance from 0 to 3 is 3. So the required d must be at least 3, because otherwise the area from 0 to 3 - d would not be covered. Wait, no. If the lantern is at 3, then the light covers from 3 - d to 3 + d. So to cover 0, 3 - d <= 0 → d >= 3. Similarly, for the end of the street. So yes, those two checks are necessary.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial max_d as max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n- Then, for each i from 1 to n-1, compute the difference between a[i] and a[i-1]. The maximum of these differences divided by 2 is compared with the current max_d. The overall maximum is the answer.\n\nYes. Because between two consecutive lanterns, the maximum distance between them is (a[i] - a[i-1]). The worst case is the middle of that gap. So the required d for that gap is (a[i] - a[i-1])/2. So, the maximum of all those values.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute initial max_d as the maximum between the first lantern's position and (l - last lantern's position).\n\nThen iterate through",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve the problem of determining the minimum light radius $ d $ required for lanterns to illuminate the entire street, we can follow a structured approach based on the following observations:\n\n---\n\n### 🔍 Problem Analysis\n\nEach lantern lights up all points within a distance $ d $ from itself. To ensure that the **entire street** (from 0 to $ l $) is covered:\n\n1. **Edge Coverage**:\n   - The first lantern must be close enough to the start of the street (i.e., the distance from 0 to the first lantern must be ≤ $ d $).\n   - Similarly, the last lantern must be close enough to the end of the street (i.e., the distance from the last lantern to $ l $ must be ≤ $ d $).\n\n2. **Gaps Between Lanterns**:\n   - Between two consecutive lanterns, the **maximum gap** determines the worst-case coverage needed.\n   - For a gap between two lanterns at positions $ a_i $ and $ a_{i+1} $, the midpoint of this gap lies farthest from both lanterns. Thus, the required $ d $ for this gap is $ \\frac{a_{i+1} - a_i}{2} $.\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 Algorithm Steps\n\n1. **Sort the lantern positions** in ascending order.\n2. **Initialize** the maximum required $ d $ as the maximum of:\n   - The distance from the first lantern to the start of the street (i.e., `a[0]`)\n   - The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (i.e., `l - a[-1]`)\n3. **Iterate over the sorted list**, computing the gap between each pair of consecutive lanterns.\n4. For each gap, compute $ \\text{gap}/2 $, and update the maximum required $ d $ if this value is larger.\n5. Return the final value of $ d $ with sufficient precision.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Python Implementation\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split('\\n')\n    \n    for line in data:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, l = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        a = list(map(int, data[data.index(line) + 1].strip().split()))\n        \n        a.sort()\n        max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n        \n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i - 1]\n            current = gap / 2\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        \n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### 📌 Example Execution\n\nFor input:\n```\n7 15\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n```\n\nAfter sorting: `[0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 14, 15]`\n\n- First lantern: `0` → distance to start is `0`.\n- Last lantern: `15` → distance to end is `0`.\n- Largest gap between lanterns: `14 - 9 = 5` → `5/2 = 2.5`\n\nThus, the required $ d = 2.5 $\n\n---\n\n### 📈 Time Complexity\n\n- Sorting the array takes $ O(n \\log n) $\n- Iterating through the array takes $ O(n) $\n- Total time complexity: $ O(n \\log n) $\n\nThis is efficient even for the upper constraint $ n = 1000 $.",
