Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum radius d for lanterns so that the entire street is lit. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the problem says that each lantern can light up points within a distance d. So, the goal is to find the smallest d such that every point on the street from 0 to l is covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. The key here is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. Because the largest gap would require the largest d to cover it.\n\nWait, but how exactly? Let me think. Suppose two consecutive lanterns are at positions a and b. The area between them that isn't covered by either lantern would be the middle part. The maximum distance from either lantern would be (b - a)/2. Because if you have a gap between a and b, the midpoint would be (a + b)/2. The distance from a to that midpoint is (b - a)/2. Similarly for b. So the required d for this gap would be (b - a)/2. But wait, what if the lanterns are placed in such a way that there's a larger gap on one end?\n\nWait, also need to consider the ends. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is important. Similarly, if the last lantern isn't at l, then the distance from the last lantern to l is important.\n\nSo the steps I need to take are:\n\n1. Sort the lantern positions in order.\n2. Check the distance from the first lantern to 0. That's a candidate for max d.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to l. Another candidate.\n4. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each pair, compute (current - previous)/2. The maximum of these is another candidate.\n5. The answer is the maximum among all these candidates.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because for the first part, the initial segment from 0 to the first lantern's position needs to be covered. The lantern's light has to reach back to 0, so the distance is the position of the first lantern minus 0. Similarly for the end.\n\nBut wait, for example, if the first lantern is at position 3, then the distance from 0 to 3 is 3. So the d must be at least 3, because otherwise the area from 0 to 3 - d would not be covered. Wait, no. The lantern's light covers up to d distance. So if the lantern is at position a, then it covers from a - d to a + d. So for the beginning of the street (position 0), it must be within a - d <= 0 <= a + d. Which implies that d >= a - 0 (if a is the first lantern). Because if the lantern is at a, then the leftmost point it can cover is a - d. To cover 0, a - d <= 0 → d >= a. So the first lantern's position is a, then the required d is a (since 0 is at distance a from the lantern). Similarly, for the last lantern, the distance from it to l is l - a, so d must be at least that.\n\nBut for the gaps between two consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap between them is (current - previous), and the required d is half of that. Because the middle point between them is (current + previous)/2, which is at (current - previous)/2 distance from each. So the d must be at least that value to cover the entire gap.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial gap (first lantern's position - 0) → d_candidate = a[0]\n\nCompute the end gap (l - a[-1]) → d_candidate = l - a[-1]\n\nThen for each consecutive pair, compute (a[i] - a[i-1])/2 → compare with current max.\n\nThe maximum of all these values is the minimal required d.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\nSort the list of lanterns.\n\nCheck the first and last positions.\n\nNow, let's think about some examples.\n\nTake the second sample input:\n\nInput is 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\nAfter sorting, the lanterns are [2,5].\n\nFirst check: 2 - 0 = 2. So initial d_candidate is 2.\n\nEnd check: 5 - 5 = 0. So end is 0.\n\nThen between 2 and 5: (5-2)/2 = 1.5. So the maximum is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: first sample input is 7 15, lanterns at",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ that lanterns must have to ensure that the entire street is illuminated. The key insight is to consider the maximum gaps between consecutive lanterns and the ends of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Check Endpoints**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (position $ l $).\n3. **Check Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them and determine the required radius to cover the midpoint of this gap.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required radius $ d $ is the maximum value among the distances calculated for the endpoints and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        l = int(input[idx + 1])\n        idx += 2\n        a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n        idx += n\n        \n        a.sort()\n        max_d = 0.0\n        \n        # Check the first part\n        first = a[0]\n        max_d = max(max_d, first)\n        \n        # Check the last part\n        last = a[-1]\n        max_d = max(max_d, l - last)\n        \n        # Check the gaps between consecutive lanterns\n        for i in range(1, n):\n            gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n            current = gap / 2.0\n            if current > max_d:\n                max_d = current\n        \n        print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n        \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go and split into a list of strings for easier processing.\n2. **Sorting Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in sequentially checking the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n3. **Initial and Final Distances**: The distances from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street are checked to ensure these ends are illuminated.\n4. **Midpoint Calculation**: For each gap between consecutive lanterns, the required radius is determined by considering the midpoint of the gap, which ensures the entire gap is covered.\n5. **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the minimum radius $ d $ by focusing on the critical points where the coverage might be insufficient, ensuring the entire street is illuminated with the smallest possible radius.",
