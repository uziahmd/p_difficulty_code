Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about directing the edges of an undirected graph such that the flow conditions are satisfied. The key points are that the flow must be a maximum flow, and the directed graph must not have cycles. Also, the source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges, and all other vertices except the sink (vertex n) must have equal incoming and outgoing flow sums.\n\nHmm. So the given ci values are the flow amounts on each edge, but we need to assign directions. The challenge is to find a direction for each edge so that the flow conservation holds and there are no cycles.\n\nWait, the problem says that the given ci's are the flow volumes. So the sum of flows into a vertex (except source and sink) must equal the sum of flows out. Also, the source can't have any incoming edges. And the directed graph must not have cycles.\n\nHow can we approach this? Let's think about the structure of the flow network. Since the flow is a maximum flow, the residual graph must have no augmenting paths. But maybe that's not directly helpful here.\n\nAnother thought: since the directed graph must be acyclic, perhaps we can topologically sort the vertices. Then, for each edge, we can direct it in the direction of the topological order. But how to choose the topological order such that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nAlternatively, considering that the flow must be acyclic, perhaps we can model this as building a DAG where the flow conservation holds. But how to ensure that?\n\nWait, the flow conservation for intermediate nodes requires that the sum of the flows going out equals the sum of the flows coming in. Which implies that the net flow out of the node is zero. But for the source, the net flow is equal to the total flow (since it's the source), and for the sink, the net flow is negative by that amount.\n\nBut how do we assign directions to edges so that these conditions are met?\n\nLet me think of the problem as building a directed graph where each edge's direction is chosen such that the flow conservation holds. Since the flow values are given, maybe we can model this as a problem of assigning directions so that for each node (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed out of the node equals the sum of flows on edges directed into the node.\n\nWait, but how to compute that? Let's consider that for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of the flows on edges directed out of v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed into v. Which implies that the total flow through the node is balanced.\n\nBut how can we assign directions to edges to achieve this? Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where each edge's direction is determined based on some kind of potential or hierarchy.\n\nAnother idea: Since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the nodes in a topological order. Let's imagine that we have a topological order where the source comes first, then other nodes, and the sink comes last. Then, for each edge, we can direct it from earlier nodes in the order to later ones. This ensures no cycles.\n\nBut how to choose the topological order such that the flow conservation is satisfied?\n\nAlternatively, think of the flow as a DAG where each node (except source and sink) has in-flow equal to out-flow. Let's model this as a directed graph where for each node v (other than source and sink), the sum of flows on outgoing edges equals the sum of flows on incoming edges.\n\nThis seems similar to finding an Eulerian trail, but not exactly. Wait, but for each node except source and sink, the in-degree (weighted by flow) equals the out-degree. So, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each node has a balance of zero (for intermediate nodes), and the source has a balance of -total_flow (since all flow starts there) and sink has +total_flow.\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges to satisfy this?\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the flow conservation constraints. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed out of v must equal the sum of flows directed into v. Let me denote for each edge (u, v) with flow c, if we direct it from u to v, then it contributes c to the outflow of u and inflow of v. If directed the other way, it contributes c to the outflow of v and inflow of u.\n\nSo, for each node v, the total outflow equals the total inflow. Let's denote for each node v, the total outflow minus inflow is zero. Except for the source (which has outflow minus inflow equal to total_flow) and the sink (which has outflow minus inflow equal to -total_flow).\n\nBut how to model this as a system of equations? Well, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where the sum of flows for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to direct the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies the conditions of a valid maximum flow. The key constraints are:\n1. The source (vertex 1) must have no incoming edges.\n2. All intermediate vertices (excluding the source and sink) must have equal incoming and outgoing flow sums.\n3. The directed graph must be acyclic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Topological Sorting**: We can use a topological sort to ensure the directed graph is acyclic. By arranging nodes in a topological order, we can direct edges from earlier nodes to later nodes in the order.\n2. **Flow Conservation**: For each node (except the source and sink), the sum of flows on incoming edges must equal the sum of flows on outgoing edges. This can be achieved by maintaining a balance of flow for each node and directing edges accordingly.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, m = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = []\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(m):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        graph[a].append((b, i))\n        graph[b].append((a, i))\n\n    # Compute in-degree and out-degree for each node\n    in_degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    out_degree = [0] * (n + 1)\n    # We need to build a DAG with topological order\n    # We will perform a topological sort starting from node 1\n    # But since the graph is undirected, we need to construct a directed version\n    # Let's use a modified approach where we assign directions based on a BFS traversal\n    # Start from node 1, and assign directions to edges in a way that ensures no cycles\n\n    # To avoid cycles, we can perform a BFS or DFS and assign directions from parent to child\n    # However, since the graph is connected, we can perform a BFS starting from node 1\n    # and assign directions from parent to child.

This ensures that edges are directed from earlier nodes in the order to later ones, avoiding cycles.\n3. **Direction Assignment**: For each edge, we check the BFS traversal order to determine the direction. If one node is the parent of the other in the BFS tree, the direction is set accordingly. Otherwise, the direction is determined based on their positions in the topological order.\n\nThis approach ensures that the resulting directed graph is acyclic and satisfies the flow conservation constraints for all intermediate nodes.",
