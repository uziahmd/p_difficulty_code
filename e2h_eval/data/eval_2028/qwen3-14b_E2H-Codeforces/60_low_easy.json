Moreover, each Morse code representation of an English letter contains only dots and dashes. In this task, we will represent a dot with a \"0\" and a dash with a \"1\".Because there are $$$2^1+2^2+2^3+2^4 = 30$$$ strings with length $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$ containing only \"0\" and/or \"1\", not all of them correspond to one of the $$$26$$$ English letters. In particular, each string of \"0\" and/or \"1\" of length at most $$$4$$$ translates into a distinct English letter, except the following four strings that do not correspond to any English alphabet: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\".You will work with a string $$$S$$$, which is initially empty. For $$$m$$$ times, either a dot or a dash will be appended to $$$S$$$, one at a time. Your task is to find and report, after each of these modifications to string $$$S$$$, the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code.Since the answers can be incredibly tremendous, print them modulo $$$10^9 + 7$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains an integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 3\\,000$$$) — the number of modifications to $$$S$$$. Each of the next $$$m$$$ lines contains either a \"0\" (representing a dot) or a \"1\" (representing a dash), specifying which character should be appended to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$m$$$ lines, the $$$i$$$-th of which being the answer after the $$$i$$$-th modification to $$$S$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3\\n1\\n1\\n1', '5\\n1\\n0\\n1\\n0\\n1', '9\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0\\n1']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n3\\n7', '1\\n4\\n10\\n22\\n43', '1\\n3\\n10\\n24\\n51\\n109\\n213\\n421\\n833']\n\n## Note\nLet us consider the first sample after all characters have been appended to $$$S$$$, so S is \"111\".As you can see, \"1\", \"11\", and \"111\" all correspond to some distinct English letter. In fact, they are translated into a 'T', an 'M', and an 'O', respectively. All non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of $$$S$$$ in Morse code, therefore, are as follows.  \"T\" (translates into \"1\")  \"M\" (translates into \"11\")  \"O\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TT\" (translates into \"11\")  \"TM\" (translates into \"111\")  \"MT\" (translates into \"111\")  \"TTT\" (translates into \"111\") Although unnecessary for this task, a conversion table from English alphabets into Morse code can be found here.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the task is to process a string S that's being built step by step by appending 0s and 1s. After each addition, we need to calculate the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by some substring of S in Morse code. But there are some invalid Morse codes that don't correspond to any letters. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly counts as a valid sequence. The problem says that each Morse code string of length 1-4 (so 1, 2, 3, or 4 characters) is a possible representation except for four specific ones: \"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", and \"1111\". So for any substring of S, if it's one of these four, it's not considered valid. Otherwise, it's valid and contributes to the count.\n\nThe challenge is to find all possible substrings of S after each step, check if they are valid Morse codes, and then count the number of such substrings. But wait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". So each valid substring corresponds to exactly one letter, and each such substring is counted once. However, the count isn't just the number of valid substrings. Because sequences can be multiple letters. For example, if a substring is \"11\", which is a valid code, then that's one sequence (the single letter). But if there's a longer substring like \"111\", which is valid, but also substrings like \"1\" (the first character), \"1\" (the second), etc. Also, when considering sequences of letters, each possible way of splitting the substring into valid Morse codes counts as a separate sequence. Wait no! Wait, the problem says \"non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\". Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding this part. Let me re-read the note.\n\nIn the first sample input, after appending three 1s, S is \"111\". The valid substrings are:\n\n- \"1\" (positions 1)\n- \"11\" (positions 1-2)\n- \"111\" (positions 1-3)\n- \"1\" (positions 2)\n- \"11\" (positions 2-3)\n- \"1\" (positions 3)\n- Also, the substrings of length 2 and 3. But how does that translate into sequences?\n\nWait the note says that the answer counts all possible non-empty sequences of letters that can be formed by some substring of S. But how? For example, the substring \"11\" could represent a single letter (since \"11\" is valid), or maybe two letters if it can be split into two valid codes. But according to the note's explanation, \"TT\" (which is two T's) translates into \"11\" (since each T is \"1\"). So the count includes all possible ways to split the substring into valid Morse codes. Wait, but the problem statement says \"the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that are represented with some substring of S in Morse code\".\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me think again. For example, the sample explanation says that after S is \"111\", the valid sequences are:\n\n- \"T\" (from \"1\")\n- \"M\" (from \"11\")\n- \"O\" (from \"111\")\n- \"TT\" (from \"11\" as two T's)\n- \"TM\" (from \"1\" + \"11\")\n- \"MT\" (from \"11\" + \"1\")\n- \"TTT\" (from \"111\" as three T's)\n\nSo each of these is a different sequence. But how do these sequences relate to the substrings of S?\n\nAh, the key is that each such sequence corresponds to a way of splitting a substring into valid Morse codes. For example, the substring \"11\" can be split as one letter (M) or two letters (T and T). So each such split is a different sequence. Therefore, the total number of sequences is the sum over all possible substrings of S of the number of ways to split that substring into valid Morse codes. \n\nBut that seems complicated. How can we compute this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not about splitting substrings into multiple letters, but about counting all possible substrings that are valid Morse codes (each of which represents exactly one letter, so each such substring contributes 1 to the total count). But the sample explanation contradicts that. In the first sample, the output is 7. Let's see:\n\nIf the answer was the count of valid substrings, then for S = \"111\", the valid",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of non-empty sequences of English letters that can be represented by substrings of a dynamically growing binary string. The binary string is constructed by appending either '0' (dot) or '1' (dash), and each valid substring must correspond to a Morse code representation of an English letter, excluding four specific invalid codes.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Morse Code Validity Check**: Maintain a set of invalid Morse code strings (\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\") to quickly check if a substring is valid.\n2. **Dynamic Programming with Prefix Sums**: Use dynamic programming to efficiently count valid sequences. We maintain a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid sequences ending at position `i`.\n3. **Efficient Substring Counting**: For each new character added to the string, check all possible substrings ending at the current position. For each valid substring, update the DP array and use prefix sums to efficiently compute the total number of valid sequences.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    m = int(input[0])\n    ops = input[1:]\n    \n    invalid = {\"0011\", \"0101\", \"1110\", \"1111\"}\n    S = []\n    dp = [0] * (m + 1)  # dp[i] is the number of valid sequences ending at i-th position (1-based)\n    total = 0\n    prefix = [0] * (m + 1)  # prefix[i] is sum(dp[1..i])\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        S.append(ops[i-1])\n        current = \"\"\n        for j in range(i, 0, -1):\n            current = ops[j-1] + current\n            if len(current) > 4:\n                break\n            if current not in invalid:\n                dp[j] = (prefix[j-1] + 1) % MOD\n            else:\n                dp[j] = 0\n        prefix[i] = (prefix[i-1] + dp[i]) % MOD\n        print(prefix[i] % MOD)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of operations and the sequence of operations.\n2. **Invalid Morse Codes**: A set of invalid Morse codes is maintained for quick lookup.\n3. **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: This array keeps track of the number of valid sequences ending at each position. For each new character added, we check all possible substrings ending at that position.\n4. **Prefix Sum Array (`prefix`)**: This array helps in efficiently computing the cumulative sum of valid sequences up to each position, which allows us to quickly determine the total number of valid sequences after each operation.\n5. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, all operations are performed modulo $10^9 + 7$ to prevent overflow and ensure the results fit within standard integer limits.\n\nThis approach ensures that each modification to the string is processed efficiently, leveraging dynamic programming and prefix sums to maintain optimal performance even for the upper limit of operations.",
