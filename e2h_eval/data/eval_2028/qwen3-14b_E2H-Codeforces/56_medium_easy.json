Princess Heidi needs to know if it is possible to assign R Rebel spaceships to guard B bases so that every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base (in other words, the assignment is a perfect matching). Since she knows how reckless her pilots are, she wants to be sure that any two (straight) paths – from a base to its assigned spaceship – do not intersect in the galaxy plane (that is, in 2D), and so there is no risk of collision.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers R, B(1 ≤ R, B ≤ 10). For 1 ≤ i ≤ R, the i + 1-th line contains two space-separated integers xi and yi (|xi|, |yi| ≤ 10000) denoting the coordinates of the i-th Rebel spaceship. The following B lines have the same format, denoting the position of bases. It is guaranteed that no two points coincide and that no three points are on the same line.\n\n## Output\nIf it is possible to connect Rebel spaceships and bases so as satisfy the constraint, output Yes, otherwise output No (without quote).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\n### Output\n['Yes', 'No']\n\n## Note\nFor the first example, one possible way is to connect the Rebels and bases in order.For the second example, there is no perfect matching between Rebels and bases.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about assigning R Rebel spaceships to B bases such that each base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base. But there's an additional condition: any two paths (straight lines) from a base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect. The output is \"Yes\" or \"No\" depending on whether such an assignment exists.\n\nFirst, the input gives R and B. Then R points for spaceships, followed by B points for bases. The constraints are that R and B are up to 10, which is small. Also, no two points coincide, and no three are colinear. So, for each possible perfect matching between the spaceships and bases, we need to check if all the line segments between matched pairs are non-intersecting.\n\nBut how do I check if two line segments intersect? Oh right, there's a standard computational geometry method for that. But since the problem says that no three points are colinear, maybe that simplifies things a bit. Because if two line segments cross each other, they would form an intersection point that's not one of the original points, but since no three points are colinear, that's allowed. Wait, but the problem says that the paths (line segments) shouldn't intersect. So even if two line segments cross each other, that's not allowed.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Generate all possible perfect matchings between the R spaceships and B bases. Since R and B can be up to 10, but for a perfect matching, R must equal B. Wait, the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching, which implies that R must equal B. Wait, the first line says R and B. Oh, but the problem says that the assignment is a perfect matching. So for that to be possible, R must equal B. Otherwise, it's impossible. Wait, the problem says \"every base has exactly one guardian and each spaceship has exactly one assigned base\". So yes, that requires that R = B. So if R != B, the answer is immediately \"No\".\n\nWait, looking back at the input description. For example, in the sample input, the first case is 3 3, which makes sense. The second input is 2 1, so R=2, B=1. Then the answer is No because you can't have a perfect matching. So the first thing to check is whether R equals B. If not, output No.\n\nSo first step: check if R != B. If so, output No.\n\nOtherwise, proceed.\n\nNow, for R = B, we need to check if there exists a permutation of the bases (assigning each spaceship to a base) such that all the line segments between the spaceship and base in the permutation do not intersect with each other.\n\nSo for each possible permutation (each possible way to assign the spaceships to bases), we need to check if all the line segments are non-intersecting.\n\nBut since R can be up to 10, the number of permutations is 10! = 3,628,800. For each permutation, checking all pairs of line segments for intersections. For each permutation, there are (R choose 2) pairs of line segments, which for 10 is 45 pairs. Each pair needs to be checked for intersection.\n\nBut 3.6 million * 45 is about 160 million operations. That's manageable for Python, given that the constraints are small. But perhaps there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a way to order the points such that when we assign them in a certain order, the line segments don't cross. But for the problem, since the answer is just Yes or No, perhaps checking all permutations is feasible.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Check if R != B. If so, output No.\n\n2. Else, generate all permutations of the B bases (since each permutation represents a possible assignment of spaceships to bases).\n\n3. For each permutation, check if all line segments between spaceship i and base permutation[i] (assuming zero-based or one-based index) do not intersect with each other.\n\nIf any permutation passes this check, output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nBut how to check if two line segments intersect?\n\nWe need a function that takes two line segments (each defined by two points) and returns True if they intersect, False otherwise.\n\nBut since the problem states that no three points are colinear, that might help. Because, for two line segments, if they share an endpoint, then they are not considered as intersecting? Or is that considered as intersecting?\n\nWait, the problem says that the paths (straight lines) from a base to its assigned spaceship must not intersect. So, if two line segments share an endpoint, that's allowed? Or not? Because for example, if two line segments share a common endpoint, then they meet at that point. But the problem says that no two paths should intersect. So, if two line segments share an endpoint, that's considered as intersecting? Or not?\n\nBut the note in the problem says that in the first example, connecting in order works. Let's think about that. Suppose the spaceships are arranged in some order, and the bases in some order, and the line segments between them don't cross. For example, if the spaceships are ordered in a way that their positions are sorted, and the bases are sorted similarly, then connecting them in order may avoid crossings.\n\nBut for the problem's purposes, the line segments must not intersect. So, even if two line segments share an endpoint, that's considered as intersecting? Well, according to the problem statement, the paths are straight lines. So if two paths share an endpoint, they meet at that point. But the problem says that the paths must not intersect. So, if two paths share a point (like an endpoint), does that count as an intersection?\n\nBut according to the problem's note, in the first example, connecting in order works. Let's imagine that the first spaceship is connected to the first base, the second to the second, etc. So if the line segments are between (0,0) and (-2,1), (2,0) and (0,3), (3,1) and (2,2). Are those lines crossing? Let me think. Probably not, but perhaps the problem considers that even if two line segments share a point, like if two lines are connected to the same base, but that's not possible here because each base is assigned exactly once. So, in the case of a permutation, each line segment is between a unique spaceship and a unique base. So two line segments can't share a spaceship or a base. Therefore, two line segments can't share an endpoint. Because each spaceship is assigned to exactly one base, and each base is assigned to exactly one spaceship. Therefore, any two line segments in the permutation will have distinct endpoints. Thus, two line segments can't share an endpoint. So, when checking for intersections between two line segments, we can ignore the case where they share an endpoint.\n\nTherefore, the function to check if two line segments intersect can safely assume that they don't share endpoints.\n\nSo, how to implement the line segment intersection check?\n\nI remember that the standard approach involves checking if the two segments straddle each other. The steps are:\n\nFor two line segments AB and CD:\n\n- Check if the orientation of A, B, C is different from the orientation of A, B, D. And also check if the orientation of C, D, A is different from that of C, D, B. If both are true, then the segments intersect.\n\nBut also, need to handle cases where one of the segments lies exactly on the line of the other. However, the problem states that no three points are colinear. So, since the line segments AB and CD cannot have any three points colinear, because that would require that one of the endpoints of a segment lies on the line of another segment. Wait, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, for example, if AB is a segment, then no other point (C, D, etc.) lies on the line AB. Because if that were the case, then A, B, C would be colinear, which is not allowed. So in our case, since all points are unique and no three are colinear, the line segments can't have any points lying on each other's lines except their own endpoints. But since two line segments can't share endpoints, then the segments can't lie on the same line. Therefore, the only possible way for two segments to intersect is if they cross each other, forming an X. So, the standard check for general position.\n\nThus, the code for checking if two line segments AB and CD intersect can be done by checking if the orientations of ABC and ABD are different, and orientations of CDA and CDB are different.\n\nBut how to compute orientation?\n\nThe orientation of three points p, q, r can be determined by the cross product of vectors pq and pr. The cross product (q.x - p.x)*(r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y)*(r.x - p.x). The sign of this value tells us the orientation:\n\n- positive: counter-clockwise (left turn)\n- negative: clockwise (right turn)\n- zero: colinear\n\nBut since the problem says no three points are colinear, we don't need to handle zero.\n\nSo, for two segments AB and CD, the function to check if they intersect is:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n\n    # compute orientation of A, B, C\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    # General case: if o1 and o2 have opposite signs, and o3 and o4 have opposite signs\n    if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n        return True\n\n    # Edge cases: if one of the endpoints is on the other segment. But since no three points are colinear, this can't happen. Because for example, if C lies on AB, then A, B, C are colinear. Which is not allowed. So, the problem says that this can't happen. So, we don't need to handle these edge cases.\n\n    return False\n\nWait, but the problem says that no three points are colinear. So, the endpoints of the segments can't be colinear with any other points. So, for example, if AB is a segment, and CD is another segment, then none of C or D lies on AB. Because that would make A, B, C colinear, which is not allowed. Similarly, A and B can't be on CD. Therefore, the line segments can't have endpoints lying on the other segment. Therefore, the only possible way that the segments can intersect is if they cross each other in the middle, which is the case handled by the general case above.\n\nSo, the function can be written as above.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Read R and B. If R != B, output No.\n\nElse:\n\n- Read R spaceship coordinates into a list, say rebels = [ (x1, y1), ... ]\n\n- Read B base coordinates into a list, say bases = [ (x1, y1), ... ]\n\n- Generate all permutations of the bases list. Each permutation represents a possible assignment of bases to rebels. For example, for permutation p, rebel i is assigned to base p[i].\n\n- For each permutation, check all pairs of line segments (for each i < j, check if the segment between rebels[i] and p[i] intersects with the segment between rebels[j] and p[j]).\n\n- If any permutation passes (no intersections), output Yes. Otherwise, No.\n\nNow, the key steps are generating permutations, checking for intersections.\n\nBut for R=10, the permutations are 10! = 3.6 million. For each permutation, checking (10*9)/2 = 45 pairs. For each pair, checking the intersection. How efficient is that in Python?\n\nWell, 3.6 million * 45 = 162 million checks. Each check is a few operations. For Python, that could be tight, but given that the constraints are small (R and B up to 10), and the problem says it's an easy problem, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nBut let's think about possible optimizations.\n\nBut for the problem's constraints, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nSo, first, implement the orientation function.\n\nLet me code the orientation function.\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # returns the orientation of the triplet (p, q, r)\n    # 0 if colinear, 1 if clockwise, 2 if counterclockwise\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0  # colinear, but the problem says this can't happen\n    return 1 if val > 0 else 2\n\nBut since the problem says no three points are colinear, the val can't be zero. So, in our code, we can safely assume that val is not zero. So, the function can return 1 or -1, perhaps, to make the sign easier.\n\nWait, the actual value of the cross product is (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x). Which is the same as (q - p) × (r - p). So, the sign indicates direction.\n\nIn the code for checking segments, the function segments_intersect would check if o1 and o2 have opposite signs. So, for example, if o1 is positive and o2 is negative, then the two points C and D are on opposite sides of AB. Similarly for o3 and o4.\n\nSo, the code for segments_intersect can be:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if AB and CD intersect\n    # A, B are endpoints of first segment\n    # C, D are endpoints of second segment\n\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    # Check if the segments straddle each other\n    if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nWait, but the orientation function returns 1 or 2. So, in that case, o1 and o2 would be 1 or 2. So multiplying them would be positive. So how can o1 * o2 be negative?\n\nAh, no, I think I made a mistake here. Because earlier, I thought the orientation function returns 1 or -1, but in the code above, it returns 1 or 2. That's incorrect. Because the cross product can be positive or negative, which indicates the direction. So, the orientation function should return the actual sign of the cross product. Wait, but in the code above, the function returns 1 if val>0 else 2. That's wrong. Because the cross product can be positive or negative, but the code returns 1 or 2, which are both positive. So, the code for orientation was wrong.\n\nOh right, that's a mistake. The correct code for orientation is to return the sign of the cross product. So, the function should return the actual value of val, or perhaps just the sign. For example, the orientation function can return the sign as +1, -1, or 0. But since the problem says no three points are colinear, we can ignore 0.\n\nSo, the correct code for orientation is:\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # returns 1 if clockwise, -1 if counter-clockwise, 0 if colinear\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\nBut then, in the segments_intersect function, we can check if o1 and o2 have opposite signs. So, for example, if o1 is 1 and o2 is -1, then their product is negative. Similarly for o3 and o4.\n\nSo, the corrected code for segments_intersect is:\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    # Check if AB and CD intersect\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n\n    if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nNow, with this function, for any two line segments, we can check if they intersect.\n\nOnce that's implemented, the rest is generating permutations and checking for each.\n\nSo, in Python, the itertools.permutations function can be used to generate all permutations of the bases. For each permutation, we check all pairs of line segments.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead input. The input comes as a list of strings, but in the problem description, the input is given as follows: the first line contains R and B. Then R lines for the spaceships, then B lines for the bases.\n\nBut the sample input shows that for example, the first input is:\n\n['3 3\\n0 0\\n2 0\\n3 1\\n-2 1\\n0 3\\n2 2', '2 1\\n1 0\\n2 2\\n3 1']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. But in the sample input, there are two examples. However, the problem says that the user's task is to read input from stdin. So perhaps the actual input is a single test case. But the sample input shows two test cases, which perhaps is part of the example. However, in the problem statement, the user is supposed to write a program that reads from stdin. So perhaps the input is given as a single test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user is to write a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to stdout. So, perhaps the input is given as a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. For example, the first input is for the first example, and the second input is for the second example. But perhaps the input is given as multiple lines, and the code must process one test case. Wait, but the sample input is given as a list of strings. However, the problem's input is probably given as a single test case. For example, in the first example, the input is:\n\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nWhich is R=3, B=3, then 3 spaceships, then 3 bases.\n\nBut the sample input shows that the input is given as a list of strings, but in reality, the code should read from stdin. So, perhaps the code needs to read from stdin, which may contain multiple test cases? But the problem says nothing about that. Looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as per the first line. So for each test case, the code must process one input. However, the sample input shows two test cases. But perhaps that's for the purpose of the example, and the actual code must read one test case. But in the problem statement, the user is to write code that reads from stdin. So, perhaps the code must process a single test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the first input is the first test case, and the output is 'Yes', the second input is the second test case, output 'No'.\n\nBut how is the input provided? For example, in the problem's input, the first line is R and B. Then R lines of spaceship coordinates, then B lines of base coordinates.\n\nSo, the code should read R and B, then R lines for the spaceships, then B lines for the bases.\n\nSo, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process accordingly.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings. However, in practice, the code must read from stdin, which is a single input. So, perhaps the code should read from stdin, split into lines, and process them.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows:\n\nRead all lines from stdin. Then, split into tokens.\n\nBut for the code submission, the code should read from stdin, and output the correct answer.\n\nSo, the code structure:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef main():\n    # Read input\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    # process data\n\nBut perhaps the input is read line by line. However, for the code, perhaps it's easier to read all the input as a list of integers.\n\nBut for the code, the steps are:\n\nRead R and B.\n\nThen read R lines of coordinates for the rebels.\n\nThen read B lines of coordinates for the bases.\n\nBut the code must process the input correctly.\n\nSo, for example, the first line is R and B. Then next R lines are for rebels, then B lines for bases.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nWhich is R=3, B=3. Then 3 lines for rebels, then 3 lines for bases.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    # returns 1 if clockwise, -1 if counter-clockwise\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    R = int(data[idx])\n    idx +=1\n    B = int(data[idx])\n    idx +=1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(data[idx])\n        y = int(data[idx+1])\n        rebels.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=2\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(data[idx])\n        y = int(data[idx+1])\n        bases.append( (x, y) )\n        idx +=2\n    # Now generate all permutations of bases\n    from itertools import permutations\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        # check if all segments between rebels[i] and perm[i] do not intersect\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i+1, R):\n                A = rebels[i]\n                B = perm[i]\n                C = rebels[j]\n                D = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code above, the permutations are generated for the bases. So, for each permutation, perm is a tuple of the bases in some order. Then, for each i, the rebel[i] is connected to perm[i]. Then, for all pairs (i, j), check if the segments between rebel[i] and perm[i], and rebel[j] and perm[j] intersect.\n\nBut in the code, for each permutation, the code loops through all i < j pairs. For each pair, check if their segments intersect.\n\nIf any pair intersects, the permutation is invalid.\n\nIf all pairs are non-intersecting, then output Yes.\n\nNow, let's test this code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n3 3\n0 0\n2 0\n3 1\n-2 1\n0 3\n2 2\n\nSo R=3, B=3. Rebels are [(0,0), (2,0), (3,1)]. Bases are [(-2,1), (0,3), (2,2)].\n\nThe sample output is Yes. One possible permutation is the identity permutation. Let's see:\n\nperm = [ (-2,1), (0,3), (2,2) ]\n\nCheck all pairs:\n\ni=0, j=1: segment between (0,0) and (-2,1), and between (2,0) and (0,3). Do these segments intersect?\n\nLet me calculate the orientations.\n\nFor AB = (0,0) to (-2,1), and CD = (2,0) to (0,3).\n\nCheck if AB and CD intersect.\n\nCompute o1: orientation of AB and C (2,0). Wait, the function segments_intersect(A,B,C,D) is called with A = (0,0), B = (-2,1), C = (2,0), D = (0,3).\n\nSo, o1 is orientation(A,B,C) = orientation of (0,0), (-2,1), (2,0).\n\nval = (-2 - 0) * (0 - 0) - (1 - 0) * (2 - 0) ?\n\nWait, formula is:\n\nval = (q.x - p.x) * (r.y - p.y) - (q.y - p.y) * (r.x - p.x)\n\nSo p is (0,0), q is (-2,1), r is (2,0).\n\nq.x - p.x = -2 - 0 = -2.\n\nr.y - p.y = 0 - 0 = 0.\n\n(q.y - p.y) is 1 - 0 = 1.\n\nr.x - p.x is 2 - 0 = 2.\n\nval = (-2)*0 - (1)*2 = 0 - 2 = -2 → which is negative. So o1 is -1.\n\no2 is orientation(A,B,D) where D is (0,3).\n\nSo r is (0,3). Compute:\n\n(q.x - p.x) = -2, (r.y - p.y) is 3 - 0 = 3.\n\n(q.y - p.y) is 1, (r.x - p.x) is 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nval = (-2)*3 - (1)*0 = -6 → negative. So o2 is -1.\n\no1 * o2 is positive. So the first condition (o1 * o2 < 0) is false. So the segments do not intersect.\n\nWait, but what about the other check?\n\nWait, the code checks if o1 * o2 < 0 and o3 * o4 < 0. So for this pair, o1 and o2 are both -1, so their product is positive. So the condition fails. So the segments do not intersect. So this pair is okay.\n\nAnother pair: i=0 and j=2. The segment between (0,0) and (-2,1), and between (3,1) and (2,2).\n\nCheck if they intersect.\n\nA=(0,0), B=(-2,1), C=(3,1), D=(2,2).\n\nCompute o1: orientation(A,B,C) → points (0,0), (-2,1), (3,1).\n\nval = (-2 - 0)*(1 - 0) - (1 - 0)*(3 - 0) → (-2)*1 - 1*3 = -2 -3 = -5 → o1 is -1.\n\no2: orientation(A,B,D) → D is (2,2).\n\nval = (-2 - 0)*(2 - 0) - (1 - 0)*(2 - 0) → (-2)*2 - 1*2 = -4-2 = -6 → o2 is -1.\n\nAgain, product is positive. So no intersection.\n\nThen for i=1 and j=2: segments between (2,0) and (0,3), and between (3,1) and (2,2).\n\nCheck if they intersect.\n\nA=(2,0), B=(0,3), C=(3,1), D=(2,2).\n\nCompute o1 = orientation(A,B,C) → points (2,0), (0,3), (3,1).\n\nval = (0-2)*(1-0) - (3-0)*(3-2) → (-2)*1 - 3*(1) = -2 -3 = -5 → o1 is -1.\n\no2 = orientation(A,B,D) → D is (2,2).\n\nval = (0-2)*(2-0) - (3-0)*(2-2) → (-2)*2 - 3*0 = -4 → o2 is -1. Product is positive. So no intersection.\n\nThus, for this permutation, all pairs are non-intersecting. So the code would find this permutation and output Yes.\n\nSo the code works for the first sample.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 1\n\nSo R=2, B=1. Since R != B, output is No. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: suppose R=2 and B=2, with the following points:\n\nRebels: (0,0), (2,2)\n\nBases: (0,2), (2,0)\n\nPossible permutations: [ (0,2), (2,0) ] and [ (2,0), (0,2) ].\n\nCheck first permutation: connect (0,0) to (0,2), and (2,2) to (2,0). These are two vertical lines. They are parallel, so they don't cross.\n\nBut wait, the line segments are (0,0)-(0,2) and (2,2)-(2,0). These are two vertical lines. They are parallel, so they don't intersect. So this permutation is valid. So the answer is Yes.\n\nBut if the permutation is [ (2,0), (0,2) ], then the segments are (0,0)-(2,0) and (2,2)-(0,2). These are two horizontal lines. They don't intersect. So again valid. So the code would output Yes.\n\nAnother test case: R=2, B=2. Rebels are (0,0), (2,0). Bases are (1,1), (1,-1). So any permutation would have the segments (0,0)-(1,1) and (2,0)-(1,-1). Do they cross?\n\nLet me compute.\n\nSegments AB: (0,0) to (1,1). CD: (2,0) to (1,-1).\n\nCheck if they intersect.\n\nCompute o1 = orientation(A,B,C) where C is (2,0). So points A(0,0), B(1,1), C(2,0).\n\nval = (1-0)*(0-0) - (1-0)*(2-0) → (1)*(0) - (1)*(2) → 0 -2 = -2 → o1 is -1.\n\no2 = orientation(A,B,D) where D is (1,-1).\n\nval = (1-0)*(-1 - 0) - (1-0)*(1-0) → (1)*(-1) - 1*1 → -1 -1 = -2 → o2 is -1. So o1 * o2 is positive. So the first condition is not met.\n\nCheck the other part: o3 is orientation(C,D,A) → points C(2,0), D(1,-1), A(0,0). Compute val:\n\nD.x - C.x is 1-2 = -1. A.y - C.y is 0-0 = 0. (D.y - C.y) is -1 - 0 = -1. A.x - C.x is 0-2 = -2.\n\nWait, using the formula:\n\nval = (D.x - C.x) * (A.y - C.y) - (D.y - C.y) * (A.x - C.x)\n\nSo:\n\nval = (-1) * (0 - 0) - (-1) * (0 - 2) → (-1)*0 - (-1)*(-2) → 0 - 2 = -2 → o3 is -1.\n\no4 is orientation(C,D,B) → B is (2,0). Wait, no, B is (2,0)? Wait, the original rebel points are (0,0) and (2,0). So in this case, for the second segment CD is (2,0) to (1,-1). Then, for the check of the other segment, the points are C (2,0), D (1,-1), and B (2,0) ?\n\nWait, the code for the segments_intersect function is called with A and B as the first segment, and C and D as the second. So for the first segment AB is (0,0) to (1,1), and CD is (2,0) to (1,-1).\n\nSo for o3 and o4:\n\no3 is orientation(C, D, A) → C is (2,0), D is (1,-1), A is (0,0).\n\nAs above, val is -2 → o3 is -1.\n\no4 is orientation(C, D, B) → B is (2,0). So points C (2,0), D (1,-1), B (2,0).\n\nval = (D.x - C.x) * (B.y - C.y) - (D.y - C.y) * (B.x - C.x).\n\nD.x - C.x = -1. B.y - C.y = 0 - 0 = 0. D.y - C.y = -1 - 0 = -1. B.x - C.x = 2 - 2 = 0.\n\nval = (-1) * 0 - (-1) * 0 = 0 - 0 = 0. But the problem says no three points are colinear, but in this case, the points C and B are the same? No, because in the input, all points are distinct. Wait, in this test case, the rebels are (0,0) and (2,0). The bases are (1,1) and (1,-1). So in this scenario, the code for the second segment CD is (2,0) (which is a rebel point?) No, the CD is between (2,0) (a rebel point?) No, in this case, the first segment is between rebel[0] (0,0) and base[0] (1,1). The second segment is between rebel[1] (2,0) and base[1] (1,-1). So the CD is (2,0) to (1,-1). So in the code, when checking for the segments AB and CD, the points are:\n\nA = (0,0), B = (1,1), C = (2,0), D = (1,-1).\n\nSo for o3: orientation(C, D, A) is orientation of (2,0), (1,-1), (0,0).\n\nWhich is calculated as:\n\nval = (1-2) * (0 - 0) - (-1 - 0) * (0 - 2) → (-1) * 0 - (-1)*(-2) → 0 - 2 = -2 → o3 is -1.\n\no4 is orientation(C, D, B) → points C (2,0), D (1,-1), B (2,0). But B is (2,0), which is same as C. But the problem says that no two points coincide. So in this case, the code would have a problem. Wait, but in this scenario, the code is for a test case where the bases and rebels are distinct. So if in this test case, the code is run, then the bases are (1,1) and (1,-1), and the rebels are (0,0) and (2,0). So the code for the second segment is between (2,0) and (1,-1). So the points C and D are (2,0) and (1,-1). So when checking o4, which is orientation(C,D,B), where B is (2,0) (the rebel point). So the points C is (2,0), D is (1,-1), and B is (2,0). So the three points are C, D, B. But since B is same as C, then the orientation is zero. However, the problem says that no two points coincide. So this scenario is invalid. But in this test case, the code would have a problem. But in reality, the code would not have such a scenario because the input ensures that no two points coincide. Therefore, in the code, the points are",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to assign each Rebel spaceship to a unique base such that the straight-line paths between each spaceship and its assigned base do not intersect. This requires checking all possible permutations of assignments and verifying if any permutation meets the non-intersection condition.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Handling**: Read the input values for the number of spaceships (R) and bases (B), followed by their respective coordinates.\n2. **Immediate Check**: If the number of spaceships (R) is not equal to the number of bases (B), immediately output \"No\" since a perfect matching is impossible.\n3. **Permutations Generation**: Generate all permutations of the bases to explore every possible assignment of spaceships to bases.\n4. **Intersection Check**: For each permutation, check if any pair of line segments (connecting spaceships to their assigned bases) intersect using a geometric orientation check.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef orientation(p, q, r):\n    val = (q[0] - p[0]) * (r[1] - p[1]) - (q[1] - p[1]) * (r[0] - p[0])\n    if val == 0:\n        return 0\n    return 1 if val > 0 else -1\n\ndef segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n    o1 = orientation(A, B, C)\n    o2 = orientation(A, B, D)\n    o3 = orientation(C, D, A)\n    o4 = orientation(C, D, B)\n    if (o1 * o2 < 0) and (o3 * o4 < 0):\n        return True\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    data = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    R = int(data[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    B = int(data[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    if R != B:\n        print(\"No\")\n        return\n    rebels = []\n    for _ in range(R):\n        x = int(data[idx])\n        y = int(data[idx + 1])\n        rebels.append((x, y))\n        idx += 2\n    bases = []\n    for _ in range(B):\n        x = int(data[idx])\n        y = int(data[idx + 1])\n        bases.append((x, y))\n        idx += 2\n    for perm in permutations(bases):\n        valid = True\n        for i in range(R):\n            for j in range(i + 1, R):\n                A = rebels[i]\n                B = perm[i]\n                C = rebels[j]\n                D = perm[j]\n                if segments_intersect(A, B, C, D):\n                    valid = False\n                    break\n            if not valid:\n                break\n        if valid:\n            print(\"Yes\")\n            return\n    print(\"No\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Orientation Calculation**: The `orientation` function calculates the orientation of three points using the cross product to determine if they are clockwise, counter-clockwise, or collinear.\n2. **Segment Intersection Check**: The `segments_intersect` function uses the orientation results to determine if two line segments intersect by checking if their endpoints straddle each other.\n3. **Permutations and Validation**: The main function reads input values, checks for immediate infeasibility (R != B), generates all permutations of bases, and validates each permutation to ensure no intersecting paths exist.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible assignments are checked efficiently given the constraints, leveraging permutations and geometric checks to determine the feasibility of non-intersecting paths.",
