The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is that the districts form a tree structure since there's exactly one path between any two districts. So the problem reduces to selecting a subtree with (n - k) nodes that has the maximum possible sum of 2^i values. Then, we need to remove the k districts that are not in this subtree.\n\nBut how do we find this subtree? Since the sum is based on the districts' numbers, which are 2^i, which increases exponentially with i. So higher-numbered districts contribute way more than lower ones. Therefore, our goal is to include as many high-numbered districts as possible, while keeping the subtree connected.\n\nWait, but the tree structure might not allow us to take all high-numbered districts. So perhaps we need to find a way to select the highest possible districts, ensuring they are connected.\n\nLet me think: The optimal strategy would be to keep the districts with the largest possible numbers, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. So maybe we can start by including the highest-numbered district (n), then include as many high-numbered districts as possible, making sure that they are connected through their parent nodes.\n\nWait, but how do we model this? Maybe we can think in terms of a priority queue approach. For example, we can perform a greedy selection where we start with the highest node, and then add the next highest nodes that are connected to the existing subtree.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the sum is 2^i, which is strictly increasing with i, the optimal set must include the highest possible nodes. So the problem becomes similar to selecting a subtree with (n - k) nodes, which includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nAnother thought: since the sum is maximized by including the largest possible numbers, perhaps the optimal solution is to keep the largest (n - k) districts, but only if they form a connected subtree. If not, we need to remove some of the lower ones and include necessary parents to connect them.\n\nBut how to determine which ones to remove?\n\nAn alternative approach is to think of it as a problem where we need to choose which nodes to keep. Let's say we want to keep the nodes with the highest possible numbers. However, since the tree is connected, we need to ensure that the kept nodes form a connected subtree.\n\nSo here's an idea: We can start by considering that the optimal subtree must include the node with the highest number, n. Then, we can perform a traversal (like BFS or DFS) from that node, selecting the next highest possible nodes, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nWait, but how to decide which nodes to include? Because when you have to choose between including a higher-numbered node but which is not connected yet, and lower ones but connected.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. To do this, perhaps we can use a priority queue (max-heap) approach. Start with the highest node, and then for each step, add the next highest node that is adjacent to the current subtree. But this might not work because the subtree needs to be connected, and the adjacency is dependent on the tree structure.\n\nWait, but maybe we can model this as a reverse process. Suppose we want to remove k nodes. The nodes to remove are those that are not part of the optimal subtree. The optimal subtree must have (n - k) nodes, and we want to maximize the sum. Since the sum is dominated by higher-numbered nodes, the optimal subtree should consist of the highest (n -k) nodes, but connected through their parent nodes.\n\nBut how to check if those nodes form a connected subtree? For example, if the highest (n -k) nodes are all connected via their parent nodes, then that's the best. Otherwise, we need to include some lower-numbered nodes to connect them.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAnother idea: Let's think of the problem as trying to select a subset of nodes with size (n -k) that is connected and has maximum sum. Since the sum depends on the individual node values, which are 2^i, the maximum sum is achieved when we select the nodes with the largest possible i's. However, if those nodes are not connected, we need to include some lower nodes to connect them.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding a connected subgraph with certain constraints. One approach is to use a priority-based selection with a priority queue, ensuring that the selected nodes are connected.\n\nHere's a possible algorithm:\n\n1. Start with the node with the highest value (n). This is our initial subtree.\n2. For the remaining steps, we need to",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and maximize the total number of fans. The key insight is that higher-numbered districts contribute exponentially more fans, so we should aim to retain as many high-numbered districts as possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Greedy Selection with Priority Queue**: Start from the highest-numbered district (n) and use a max-heap (priority queue) to greedily select the next highest-numbered districts that can be connected to the current subtree.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: Use a BFS or DFS to ensure that each selected district is connected to the existing subtree.
