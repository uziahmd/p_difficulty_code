The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts to remove in increasing order.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The districts form a tree since there's exactly one path between any two districts. When we remove some districts, their nodes are removed, and the remaining ones must be connected. So the remaining districts must form a connected subtree. Our goal is to choose which k districts to remove so that the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is as large as possible.\n\nSince the sum is maximized by keeping the districts with the highest possible values of 2^i, which is equivalent to keeping the districts with the largest indices. However, we can't just remove the first k districts with the smallest indices because their removal might disconnect the tree. So there's a trade-off here: we need to remove certain districts such that the remaining ones are connected and include as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n\nWait, but the value of 2^i increases exponentially with i. So the highest value is for the largest i. Therefore, the optimal strategy would be to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, while ensuring the remaining districts form a connected subtree.\n\nSo the problem reduces to selecting (n - k) districts that form a connected subtree, and have the maximum possible sum of 2^i. Since the sum is determined by the set of districts kept, and since higher-numbered districts contribute more, we need to select the largest possible districts, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nBut how do we do that?\n\nAn approach that comes to mind is to think of it as choosing a subtree of size (n - k) that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. But how to find such a subtree?\n\nAnother way to think: since we want to maximize the sum, we should prefer to keep the nodes with the largest i. So perhaps we can start from the largest node and greedily include nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nBut how to handle this in a tree structure?\n\nLet me think of the following approach:\n\nWe need to select a subtree of size m = n - k. Let's think of the problem as choosing which nodes to keep, not remove. The key is that the subtree must be connected. To maximize the sum, we want to keep the largest possible nodes. So maybe we can perform a priority-based selection where we start with the largest node and then add the next largest nodes that are connected to the existing subtree.\n\nBut how to efficiently implement this? For example, if the largest node is node n. Then, we need to include as many of the next largest nodes as possible, but only if they are connected to the existing subtree.\n\nAlternatively, this seems similar to the problem of finding a subtree of size m with maximum sum, where each node has a weight. In this case, the weights are 2^i, which are exponentially increasing with i. So the optimal subtree is the one that contains the largest possible nodes.\n\nBut how to find this subtree?\n\nAn efficient way might be to model this as a problem where we need to find a subtree that includes the largest possible nodes, possibly using a priority queue approach.\n\nAnother idea: since the weights are so skewed (each higher node is worth more than all lower ones combined), the optimal subtree will consist of the largest possible nodes, connected in a way that forms a connected subtree. Therefore, perhaps we can start with the largest node, then add the next largest nodes that are connected to the current subtree.\n\nWait, but how to ensure that the subtree remains connected. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose the tree is like a chain: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Suppose k=3, so m = 3. We need to choose 3 nodes. The best is to take 4,5,6. But if they are connected. Well, in this case, they form a connected subtree. So that's the best choice.\n\nAnother example: suppose the tree is a star with node 2 connected to 1, 3, 4, 5, 6. If we need to choose m = 3 nodes. The best would be 6,5,4, but they are not connected unless they are connected through node 2. So the subtree would have to include node 2 and two of the others. But that would give sum 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6. Which is better than keeping 5,6, and another node. Wait, no. If you take 6,5, and 2, the sum is 2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6. But if you take 2, 6, and 5, that's connected",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected subtree and the total number of fans is maximized. The key insight is to prioritize keeping districts with the highest indices since their fan counts grow exponentially.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The districts form a tree, so we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the tree.\n2. **Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue (max-heap) to always consider the node with the highest value first.\n3. **Greedy Selection**: Start from the highest-numbered node and iteratively add the next highest nodes that are connected to the current subtree, ensuring the subtree remains connected.\n4. **Mark Nodes**: Track which nodes are included in the final subtree and exclude the rest for removal.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split('\\n')\n    \n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(data) and data[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(data):\n        return\n    \n    n, k = map(int, data[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    \n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        while idx < len(data) and data[idx] == '':\n            idx += 1\n        if idx >= len(data):\n            break\n        a, b = map(int, data[idx].split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n        idx += 1\n    \n    m = n - k\n    if m == 0:\n        print()\n        return\n    \n    # We need to select m nodes with maximum values, forming a connected subtree.\n    # Start from the largest node, then expand using BFS or DFS.\n    \n    # Build adjacency list\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for a in range(1, n + 1):\n        for b in edges[a]:\n            adj[a].append(b)\n    \n    # Priority queue: (-value, node)\n    # We will use a max-heap approach by storing negative values\n    # Initially, start with node n\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    heap = []\n    heapq.heappush(heap, (-n, n))\n    count = 0\n    selected = set()\n    \n    while heap and count < m:\n        val, node = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if visited[node]:\n            continue\n        visited[node] = True\n        selected.add(node)\n        count += 1\n        # Push all neighbors into the heap\n        for neighbor in adj[node]:\n            if not visited[neighbor]:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (-neighbor, neighbor))\n    \n    # Now, collect all the nodes not in selected\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in selected:\n            result.append(i)\n    \n    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(result))))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed to extract the number of districts `n` and the number of contestants to remove `k`.\n2. **Tree Construction**: The tree is represented using an adjacency list.\n3. **Max-Heap Initialization**: A max-heap (using negative values for Python's min-heap) is initialized starting from the highest-numbered node.\n4. **Greedy Selection**: Nodes are selected from the heap, ensuring the subtree remains connected. Each node's neighbors are added to the heap for further consideration.\n5. **Result Compilation**: Nodes not selected are collected and printed in increasing order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we maximize the sum of fans by prioritizing higher-numbered nodes while maintaining the connectivity of the remaining districts.",
