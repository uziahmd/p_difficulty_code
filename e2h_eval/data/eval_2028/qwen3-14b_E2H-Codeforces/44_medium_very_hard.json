He has a list of $$$n$$$ problems with difficulties $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$, respectively. His plan is to practice for exactly $$$k$$$ days. Each day he has to solve at least one problem from his list. Polycarp solves the problems in the order they are given in his list, he cannot skip any problem from his list. He has to solve all $$$n$$$ problems in exactly $$$k$$$ days.Thus, each day Polycarp solves a contiguous sequence of (consecutive) problems from the start of the list. He can't skip problems or solve them multiple times. As a result, in $$$k$$$ days he will solve all the $$$n$$$ problems.The profit of the $$$j$$$-th day of Polycarp's practice is the maximum among all the difficulties of problems Polycarp solves during the $$$j$$$-th day (i.e. if he solves problems with indices from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$ during a day, then the profit of the day is $$$\\max\\limits_{l \\le i \\le r}a_i$$$). The total profit of his practice is the sum of the profits over all $$$k$$$ days of his practice.You want to help Polycarp to get the maximum possible total profit over all valid ways to solve problems. Your task is to distribute all $$$n$$$ problems between $$$k$$$ days satisfying the conditions above in such a way, that the total profit is maximum.For example, if $$$n = 8, k = 3$$$ and $$$a = [5, 4, 2, 6, 5, 1, 9, 2]$$$, one of the possible distributions with maximum total profit is: $$$[5, 4, 2], [6, 5], [1, 9, 2]$$$. Here the total profit equals $$$5 + 6 + 9 = 20$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\le k \\le n \\le 2000$$$) — the number of problems and the number of days, respectively.The second line of the input contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_i \\le 2000$$$) — difficulties of problems in Polycarp's list, in the order they are placed in the list (i.e. in the order Polycarp will solve them).\n\n## Output\nIn the first line of the output print the maximum possible total profit.In the second line print exactly $$$k$$$ positive integers $$$t_1, t_2, \\dots, t_k$$$ ($$$t_1 + t_2 + \\dots + t_k$$$ must equal $$$n$$$), where $$$t_j$$$ means the number of problems Polycarp will solve during the $$$j$$$-th day in order to achieve the maximum possible total profit of his practice.If there are many possible answers, you may print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['8 3\\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2', '5 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '4 2\\n1 2000 2000 2']\n\n### Output\n['20\\n3 2 3', '1\\n5', '4000\\n2 2']\n\n## Note\nThe first example is described in the problem statement.In the second example there is only one possible distribution.In the third example the best answer is to distribute problems in the following way: $$$[1, 2000], [2000, 2]$$$. The total profit of this distribution is $$$2000 + 2000 = 4000$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nSo, Polycarp has a list of n problems with difficulties a_1 to a_n. He wants to practice for exactly k days. Each day he solves at least one problem, and the problems must be consecutive and in order. All n problems must be solved over k days. The profit for each day is the maximum difficulty of the problems solved that day. The total profit is the sum of these daily profits. Our task is to find the maximum possible total profit and output the distribution of problems per day.\n\nHmm. The challenge is to split the array into k contiguous parts, each part non-empty, such that the sum of maxima of each part is maximized.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. Since n and k can be up to 2000, we need an efficient algorithm. Let's think about dynamic programming.\n\nDynamic Programming seems like a good approach here. Let's consider dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i problems divided into j days.\n\nThe base case would be dp[0][0] = 0, but maybe we need to adjust indices. Let's think: For dp[i][j], it represents the maximum profit when considering the first i problems split into j days.\n\nTo compute dp[i][j], we need to look back to some m < i, where the j-1th day ends at m, and the jth day is from m+1 to i. So for each possible m, we can take dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut calculating max(a[m+1..i]) for all possible ranges could be expensive if done naively. However, for each i and j, we can precompute the max values for ranges ending at i.\n\nAlternatively, for each i and j, when considering splitting into j days, we can iterate m from j-1 to i-1 (since each day must have at least one problem). For each m, the j-th day would be from m+1 to i. The max of that segment is needed.\n\nBut calculating max for each segment every time would be O(n^3) time, which for n=2000 is way too slow. So we need a way to compute these maxima efficiently.\n\nWait, but maybe we can precompute the max for ranges. For example, for any range [l, r], we can have a 2D array max_range[l][r] which stores the maximum value between l and r. But precomputing that would take O(n^2) time and space, which is acceptable for n=2000 (since 2000^2 is 4 million, which is manageable).\n\nYes, that's feasible. So first, let's precompute a 2D array where max_range[i][j] is the maximum of a[i..j] (assuming 0-based or 1-based indexes, need to be careful with that).\n\nOnce we have that, then for the DP transitions, for each dp[i][j], we can look back to m from j-1 to i-1 (since each of the previous j-1 days must have at least one problem each, so m must be at least j-1, and i must be at least m+1, so m can be from j-1 to i-1). Then, dp[i][j] = max(dp[m][j-1] + max_range[m+1][i]) for all valid m.\n\nBut the DP approach would be O(k * n^2) time. For n=2000 and k=2000, that would be O(2000^3) = 8e10 operations. That's way too slow. Wait, but k can be up to n. For example, if n=2000 and k=2000, then each day has exactly one problem. The maximum total profit would be sum of all elements. But for the general case, the DP approach may not be feasible for n=2000.\n\nSo we need to find a better approach. Wait, but perhaps there's a way to optimize this. Let me think again.\n\nAnother thought: since the problem requires splitting into exactly k days, and each day has at least one problem, the minimal number of days is 1, and the maximum is n. So for k=1, the answer is the maximum of the entire array. For k=n, it's the sum of all elements.\n\nBut for the DP approach, even if n is 2000 and k is 2000, the DP would have O(kn^2) steps. However, for k=2000 and n=2000, that's 2000*2000^2 = 8e10 steps. Which is way too slow. Therefore, this approach is not feasible for the worst case.\n\nHmm, but maybe there's a way to optimize the DP transitions. Let me think about the constraints again.\n\nWait, the problem says that k can be up to n. But for n=2000, even O(kn^2) would be 8e10 steps. That's impossible. So this suggests that the DP approach is not feasible unless we can find a way to optimize it.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think about the problem in terms of the fact that when you split into k days, you need to make k-1 splits. The maximum sum is achieved by choosing the splits such that each split is made where the maximum of the current segment is as high as possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to model that.\n\nAnother thought: For each day, the maximum of that day's segment contributes to the total. Since the segments are contiguous and non-overlapping, the problem is similar to partitioning the array into k segments to maximize the sum of their maxima.\n\nThis problem is known, perhaps? Let me think. Yes, this is similar to some dynamic programming problems.\n\nBut again, the DP approach seems necessary. However, with n=2000 and k=2000, the O(kn^2) approach is not feasible. But perhaps in practice, for the given constraints, the O(kn^2) approach is manageable with optimizations?\n\nWait, n is up to 2000. Let's calculate the number of operations for the worst case. For n=2000, k=2000, the DP would be O(k * n^2) = 2000 * 2000^2 = 8e10 operations. That's way too big for Python, which can handle roughly 1e8 operations per second. So 8e10 is 800 seconds, which is way beyond the time limit. So this approach is not feasible for the worst case.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize the DP transitions. Let me think again about the recurrence.\n\nLet me consider the DP approach again. Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum total profit for the first i problems split into j days. Then, for each i and j, dp[i][j] = max_{m} (dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i])) for m ranging from j-1 to i-1.\n\nNow, for each j, when computing dp[i][j], can we find a way to compute the max efficiently?\n\nAnother idea: For each j, when processing i, we can keep track of the maximum value in the current segment. Let's think for j-th day. Suppose we are considering the j-th day ending at i. For each possible m (the end of the previous day), the segment from m+1 to i. The max of this segment can be calculated incrementally.\n\nFor example, when considering i, and for each possible m (from j-1 to i-1), we can compute the maximum from m+1 to i. But if we process m in reverse order (from i-1 down to j-1), then for each i, we can track the current maximum as we move m leftwards.\n\nLet me explain. Suppose we're trying to compute dp[i][j]. For each possible m (from j-1 to i-1), the segment is [m+1, i]. Let's say we start with m = i-1. Then the segment is [i], max is a[i]. Then m = i-2, the segment is [i-1, i], max is max(a[i-1], a[i]). And so on. So for each i and j, when considering m from i-1 down to j-1, we can keep track of the current maximum as we go left. This way, for each i and j, the calculation of the max for each m is O(1) per step, leading to O(n) per i and j.\n\nIf this is possible, then the overall time complexity becomes O(k * n^2), but with a lower constant factor. However, for n=2000 and k=2000, this is still O(8e10) steps, which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but perhaps the constraints for k are not that tight. For example, if k is small, say up to 100, then O(kn^2) would be manageable. But for k=2000, it's not. However, perhaps there's another observation here.\n\nAnother observation: For the maximum sum, when splitting into k days, the optimal way is to split the array into k segments where each segment's maximum is as large as possible. However, how to balance this?\n\nBut I don't see an obvious greedy approach here. For example, if you have a very high value in the array, it's best to have it as a separate segment. However, when you have multiple high values, you might need to split them into different days.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as choosing k-1 split points. The maximum sum would be the sum of the maxima of the k segments. How can we choose these splits optimally?\n\nBut again, without knowing the structure of the problem, it's hard to find a greedy approach.\n\nLet me think again about the DP approach. Let's try to proceed with it, and see if there's a way to optimize it for the given constraints.\n\nFirst, precompute the max_range array. Let's create a 2D array where max_range[i][j] is the maximum of a[i...j], for 0-based indices. To compute this, for each i from 0 to n-1, we can compute the max for j from i to n-1. For each i, we can keep track of the current max as we expand j. This way, the precomputation is O(n^2), which is acceptable for n=2000.\n\nOnce that's done, the DP can proceed.\n\nBut even with that, the DP is O(kn^2) time.\n\nBut wait, for the given problem, n and k are up to 2000. Let's calculate the actual numbers:\n\nn=2000, k=2000. Then, the DP would require 2000 * 2000 * 2000 = 8e10 operations. That's way too much for Python, which is not optimized for such loops. However, perhaps the constraints in practice are not that tight. For example, in some cases, when k is small, the code can run quickly. But for the worst case, it's impossible.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the problem can be optimized by noticing that for j days, the minimal i is j. So for dp[i][j], i ranges from j to n. Also, for j=1, dp[i][1] is the max of a[0..i-1], since all i problems are split into 1 day.\n\nBut this doesn't help much with the time complexity.\n\nAnother thought: Let's think about the maximum possible value for the DP. Since each day's contribution is the maximum of its segment, and the segments are non-overlapping, the maximum total profit is the sum of the maximums of each of the k segments. But how to split into k segments to maximize this sum.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the following: when you split the array into k segments, each segment contributes its maximum. The maximum of the entire array will be included once. But if there are multiple high values, they can be in different segments, thus contributing multiple times.\n\nFor example, in the third sample input: [1, 2000, 2000, 2], with k=2. The best way is to split into [1,2000] and [2000,2], giving 2000 + 2000 = 4000. If you split into [1,2000,2000] and [2], then it's 2000 + 2 = 2002, which is worse.\n\nSo, the key is to split the array in such a way that as many high values as possible are in their own segments.\n\nBut how to model this in the DP approach.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as selecting k-1 split points, and for each split, the maximums are added. The question is how to select those splits.\n\nBut again, this brings us back to the DP approach.\n\nHmm. Let's proceed with the DP approach and see if there's a way to optimize it for the given constraints.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible time for the DP approach. For n=2000 and k=2000, it's 8e10 steps. That's way too big. However, for the problem's constraints, perhaps the actual test cases are not designed to have n=2000 and k=2000. Or maybe there's a way to optimize the DP.\n\nWait, but what is the maximum possible value of k? It's n. So for k=n, each day has exactly one problem. The total profit is the sum of all a_i. So in this case, the DP can be filled in O(n^2) time. Because for j from 1 to n, and i from j to n, etc. But for j= n, i can only be n. So for each j, the number of i's is n-j+1.\n\nBut for the general case, perhaps there's a way to optimize the DP transitions.\n\nLet me think again about the transition for dp[i][j]. For each i and j, we need to find m in [j-1, i-1], and take dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m+1..i]).\n\nBut for each i and j, when we compute this, the max(a[m+1..i]) can be computed incrementally as we decrease m. Let's think of it like this:\n\nFor a fixed i and j, we can iterate m from i-1 down to j-1. For each m, the segment [m+1, i] is from m+1 to i. When moving m from i-1 down to j-1, the segment starts at m+1, which moves leftward. So for each step, the new segment includes a[m+1], and the max is the maximum between a[m+1] and the previous max.\n\nFor example, suppose we are processing m = i-1, then the segment is [i], max is a[i]. Then m = i-2, the segment is [i-1, i], max is max(a[i-1], a[i]). Then m = i-3, the segment is [i-2, i], max is max(a[i-2], previous max). So for each m, we can keep track of the current maximum as we go from m=i-1 down to m=j-1.\n\nThis way, for each i and j, we can compute the max for each m in O(1) time per m. Thus, for each i and j, the inner loop (for m) takes O(i - (j-1)) steps, which is O(n) steps. So the total time complexity remains O(k * n^2), but with a better constant factor.\n\nBut again, for n=2000 and k=2000, this is still impossible. However, perhaps the problem expects this DP approach with some optimizations.\n\nWait, but for n=2000, even with O(n^3) time, it's 8e9 steps. But in Python, each step is a bit slow. However, maybe with some optimizations, like using precomputed max ranges, and using a more efficient data structure, perhaps it can pass within the time limit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to optimize the DP further. Let's think about the possible values of j. For j=1, the answer is the max of the entire array. For j=2, we need to split into two parts. For each possible split point m (from 1 to n-1), the total profit is max(a[0..m]) + max(a[m+1..n-1]). So the maximum of all these possibilities.\n\nBut for j=2, this can be computed in O(n) time if we precompute prefix maxima and suffix maxima.\n\nSimilarly, for higher j, perhaps there's a way to find transitions more efficiently. However, I'm not seeing it immediately.\n\nAnother thought: For the DP approach, when j is larger than some value, perhaps the transitions can be optimized. For example, when j is large, say j is close to n, then the number of splits is limited. But again, not sure.\n\nLet me think about the constraints again. The problem says n is up to 2000. Let's see, 2000^3 is 8e10 operations. But in practice, Python can handle around 1e8 operations per second. So 8e10 is 800 seconds, which is way too long. Therefore, the DP approach as described is not feasible for Python. Hence, we need a better approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think of the problem as follows. The maximum total profit is the sum of the maxima of each segment. Since each segment is a contiguous part of the array, and the segments are ordered. How can we model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem as choosing k-1 split points. Each split point divides the array into segments. The maximum for each segment is added. How to choose the split points to maximize this sum.\n\nBut again, this seems like the same problem as before.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem as a variation of the maximum sum of k subarrays, where each subarray's contribution is its maximum. This is similar to the problem of splitting the array into k parts to maximize the sum of the maxima.\n\nNow, perhaps there's a way to use a greedy approach with priority queues. For example, in the case of splitting into k segments, the optimal way is to split the array into segments where the maximum elements are in their own segments. However, this might not hold when there are overlapping maxima.\n\nBut let's think of the following idea: The optimal way is to have the k largest elements in their own segments. However, this might not be possible if the elements are not in positions that allow splitting into k segments. For example, if the array is [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], and k=3, the best is to split into [5], [4,3], [2,1], sum is 5+4+2=11. Alternatively, [5,4], [3,2], [1], sum is 5+3+1=9. So the first option is better. Hence, including the largest elements in their own segments gives better results.\n\nBut how to apply this idea. For example, if we can find the k-1 largest elements and split the array around them. But how?\n\nBut this approach may not work in all cases. For example, consider the array [1, 3, 2, 4, 1]. If k=2, the best split is [1,3,2,4], [1], which gives 4 + 1 = 5. Alternatively, [1,3,2], [4,1], which gives 3+4=7. Or [1,3], [2,4,1] gives 3 +4=7. So the optimal is to split after 3 and after 4. But the two largest elements are 4 and 3. So splitting after 3 and after 4 gives the best result.\n\nBut how to find these split points?\n\nThis seems to suggest that the optimal solution involves making splits in such a way that the largest elements are isolated in their own segments. However, it's unclear how to implement this.\n\nAnother idea: For each element, if we can decide whether to split before or after it to capture its maximum value. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: The total profit is the sum of the maxima of the k segments. Since each segment contributes its maximum, the sum is maximized when the segments contain as many high elements as possible. However, overlapping segments can't be considered.\n\nBut again, this doesn't directly lead to an algorithm.\n\nLet me return to the DP approach, but try to find a way to optimize it for the given problem.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible value of k. If k is up to 2000, but for each j, we can process the DP for j based on the previous j-1.\n\nBut even with that, the time is still O(kn^2).\n\nWait, but for j up to k, and for each j, the i ranges from j to n. For each j and i, the inner loop for m is O(i - j + 1) steps. So for j=1, the inner loop for i=1 to n would be O(n^2) steps. For j=2, it's O(n^2) steps again. So overall, the total steps are O(kn^2). Which is again the same as before.\n\nBut with n=2000 and k=2000, it's 8e10 steps. Not feasible.\n\nBut what if we note that for j > n/2, the number of splits required is large, and the number of possible splits is limited. For example, if j is n-1, then there are n-1 splits. Each day has either 1 or 2 problems. But this doesn't help with the time complexity.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem as follows. For each position i and number of days j, the maximum profit can be computed by considering that the last day's segment is from m+1 to i. For this segment, the maximum is a certain value. However, perhaps we can find for each i and j, the optimal m by using some properties.\n\nBut I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think of the problem in terms of the following. For each j, the DP[j][i] depends on DP[j-1][m] for m < i. Perhaps we can find a way to compute the maximum DP[j-1][m] + max(a[m+1..i]) for m in a certain range.\n\nBut how? The max(a[m+1..i]) varies with m. However, for a fixed i, as m decreases, the range [m+1..i] increases, and the max could increase or stay the same. \n\nBut how to find for each i and j, the best m to split.\n\nAnother Idea: Let's precompute for each i and j, the best m. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each j, when computing dp[i][j], we can track the maximum value of dp[m][j-1] + current_max, where current_max is the maximum of a[m+1..i].\n\nAs we move m from i-1 down to j-1, and track current_max, which is the maximum of a[m+1..i]. As m decreases, m+1 decreases, so the segment [m+1..i] expands to the left. The current_max can be updated as the maximum between a[m+1] and the previous current_max.\n\nSo for each i and j, the inner loop can be:\n\ncurrent_max = 0\n\nfor m in range(i-1, j-2, -1):\n\n    current_max = max(current_max, a[m])\n\n    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + current_max)\n\nThis way, for each i and j, we can compute the best m in O(i-j+1) steps.\n\nThis seems correct. For example, when m is i-1, the segment is [i], so current_max is a[i]. Then, when m decreases by 1, the segment is [m+1, i], which is [i-1, i], and current_max is max(a[i-1], a[i]), etc.\n\nYes, this seems correct.\n\nSo with this optimization, the code would be:\n\nInitialize a DP table with dimensions (n+1) x (k+1), since we have 1-based indices.\n\nThen, for j from 1 to k:\n\n   for i from j to n:\n\n       current_max = 0\n\n       for m in range(i-1, j-2, -1):\n\n           current_max = max(current_max, a[m])\n\n           if j == 1:\n\n               dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], current_max)\n\n           else:\n\n               dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + current_max)\n\nBut wait, for j=1, the only possible m is 0 (since j-1=0). So for j=1, the loop for m would be from i-1 downto 0. But the initial code may not handle this properly. Let me think about the indices.\n\nAssuming that the array a is 0-based, and the DP is 1-based. For example, dp[i][j] represents the first i elements (a[0] to a[i-1]) split into j days.\n\nSo for i elements, j days. The m represents the number of elements in the first j-1 days. So m ranges from j-1 to i-1 (since each of the first j-1 days must have at least 1 element, so m >= j-1, and the j-th day has i - m elements, which must be at least 1, so m <= i-1).\n\nSo for each i and j, m ranges from j-1 to i-1. So for the loop, m starts at i-1 and goes down to j-1.\n\nIn this case, the current_max is the maximum of a[m ... i-1], since the j-th day is from m to i-1? Or wait, no. The j-th day is from m+1 to i? Wait, the original problem says that the first i elements are split into j days. So the first j-1 days cover m elements, and the j-th day covers i - m elements. The j-th day's segment is a[m ... i-1], which is from index m to i-1 (inclusive). So when m is varying, the segment is from m to i-1.\n\nBut in the earlier code, during the inner loop for m, the current_max is the maximum of a[m ... i-1]. So when m is i-1, the segment is a[i-1], which is correct. When m decreases by 1, the segment is a[m ... i-1], which includes a[m] and the previous segment.\n\nSo during the loop, for m in range(i-1 downto j-1):\n\ncurrent_max = max(current_max, a[m])\n\nBecause when m decreases by 1, we add a[m] to the segment. So the current_max is the maximum of a[m ... i-1].\n\nYes, this makes sense.\n\nSo the code for the inner loop is:\n\ncurrent_max = 0\n\nfor m in range(i-1, j-2, -1):\n\n    current_max = max(current_max, a[m])\n\n    if j == 1:\n\n        dp[i][j] = current_max\n\n    else:\n\n        dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + current_max)\n\nBut for j=1, we need to compute the maximum of the entire first i elements. So for j=1, the loop runs from m=i-1 downto 0 (since j-1 is 0, and j-2 is -1). But since m starts at i-1 and goes down to j-1 = 0, the loop would be for m in range(i-1, -1, -1). However, in this case, for each m, the current_max is the max of a[m ... i-1], but since j=1, we need to take the maximum for the entire segment. But since we are iterating m from i-1 down to 0, the current_max would eventually be the maximum of the entire array. But for j=1, the dp[i][1] should be the max of the first i elements. So during the loop, the maximum is updated and stored.\n\nBut for j=1, the initial dp[i][1] can be initialized as 0, and then during the loop, we take the maximum of current_max. However, since the loop is for m from i-1 downto 0, the current_max will eventually be the maximum of the entire array. But since for each m, the segment is from m to i-1, and we are taking the maximum of all those segments. However, for j=1, the only possible split is m=0 (the first j-1=0 days, and the j-th day is all i elements). So why are we looping through all m?\n\nAh, here's a mistake. For j=1, the only possible m is 0, because the first j-1 days (which is 0 days) must have 0 elements, and the j-th day has i elements. So the previous code for j=1 is incorrect. It seems that the code above for j=1 is not correct. Because for j=1, the m must be 0. So the code should not loop through all m from i-1 downto 0, but only m=0.\n\nWait, this indicates that there's an error in the earlier logic. Let me re-examine the DP recurrence.\n\nThe DP[i][j] represents splitting the first i elements into j days. For j=1, there is only one way to split: all i elements in one day. So dp[i][1] = max of a[0..i-1].\n\nFor j>1, dp[i][j] = max over m (from j-1 to i-1) of dp[m][j-1] + max(a[m..i-1]).\n\nAh! So the previous code was wrong. The m in the loop for j>1 is from j-1 to i-1. But for j=1, m is 0 (since j-1 = 0, and m must be >= j-1 = 0, and <= i-1). But for j=1, the m is 0, and the segment is a[0..i-1], which is the entire array. So for j=1, the code should compute dp[i][1] as the max of the entire array. But how to compute that?\n\nSo the previous code for j=1 was incorrect. The code for j=1 should be handled separately. For j=1, dp[i][1] = max of a[0..i-1].\n\nSo how to compute this? We can precompute the prefix maxima.\n\nLet me think: for each i, the max of a[0..i-1] can be stored in an array. Let's call it prefix_max[i]. Similarly, for suffix_max.\n\nBut for the DP approach, for j=1, we can compute prefix_max[i] as the maximum of a[0..i-1].\n\nSo, for j=1, dp[i][1] = prefix_max[i].\n\nThus, the code for j=1 is handled separately. For j>1, the code proceeds as before.\n\nSo the previous code had a mistake in handling j=1. Now, correcting that.\n\nSo the corrected approach for the DP is:\n\nInitialize a DP table of size (n+1) x (k+1). Since n can be up to 2000, and k up to 2000, this is manageable.\n\nCompute prefix_max[i] for all i from 1 to n, where prefix_max[i] is the maximum of the first i elements (a[0..i-1]).\n\nThen, for j from 2 to k:\n\n   for i from j to n:\n\n       current_max = 0\n\n       for m in range(i-1, j-2, -1):\n\n           current_max = max(current_max, a[m])\n\n           dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j-1] + current_max)\n\nBut for j=2, m ranges from j-1=1 to i-1. So m starts at i-1 and goes down to 1.\n\nWait, for j=2, the first j-1=1 days must have at least 1 day, so m >= 1. And the j-th day has i - m elements, which must be at least 1, so m <= i-1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code for j>1 is correct.\n\nBut how to initialize the dp table?\n\nWe can initialize dp[i][1] = prefix_max[i].\n\nFor other entries, we can initialize them to -infinity or something, and then fill them in.\n\nNow, with this correction, the code for the DP seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the time complexity? For j from 2 to k, and for each i from j to n, and for each m from i-1 downto j-1, which is O(n) steps per i and j. So the total time is O(k * n^2), which is still O(8e10) for n=2000 and k=2000. However, in practice, for Python, this may not be feasible.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to optimize further. Let's think about the constraints again. For example, for k=2000, the code would take O(2000 * 2000^2) steps. However, for k=2000, the only possible way to split the array into k days is to have each day have exactly one problem. So the total profit is sum of all elements. So for j=k, the code can be optimized to just set dp[i][k] = sum of the first i elements if i=k. But for other i and j, when j is large, perhaps we can find some optimizations.\n\nBut for general cases, it's not clear. However, given that the problem requires a solution, perhaps the DP approach is the only way, and we need to proceed with it, hoping that the code is efficient enough.\n\nNow, let's think about implementing this in Python.\n\nBut with n=2000 and k=2000, even with O(kn^2) time, it's impossible. However, perhaps the test cases are not designed to have both n and k at maximum. Or perhaps the code can be optimized with some pruning.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to reduce the time complexity by noting that for j >= 2, when i is small, j can't be larger than i. So for j > i, dp[i][j] is invalid. But that's already handled by the loops.\n\nAnother Idea: Since the problem requires to output the actual split, we need to track not only the maximum profit but also the way to split. This requires storing backtracking information. However, for the purposes of this problem, perhaps we can first compute the DP table, and then reconstruct the path.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on computing the DP table.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n8 3\n\n5 4 2 6 5 1 9 2\n\nThe prefix_max array would be:\n\nprefix_max[1] = 5\n\nprefix_max[2] = max(5,4)=5\n\nprefix_max[3] = max(5,2)=5\n\nprefix_max[4] = max(5,6)=6\n\nprefix_max[5] = max(6,5)=6\n\nprefix_max[6] = max(6,1)=6\n\nprefix_max[7] = max(6,9)=9\n\nprefix_max[8] = max(9,2)=9\n\nSo for j=1, dp[i][1] = prefix_max[i].\n\nNow, for j=2:\n\nFor i from 2 to 8.\n\nFor example, when i=2 and j=2:\n\nm ranges from 1 downto 1 (since j-1=1). So m=1.\n\ncurrent_max = a[1] =4.\n\ndp[2][2] = dp[1][1] + 4 = 5 +4=9.\n\nWhich is the maximum possible for splitting into 2 days: [5], [4].\n\nFor i=4 and j=2:\n\nm ranges from 3 downto 1.\n\nFor m=3: current_max is a[3]=6. dp[3][1] + 6 = 5 +6=11.\n\nFor m=2: current_max is max(a[2], a[3]) = max(2,6)=6. dp[2][1] is 5 (prefix_max[2] is 5). 5+6=11.\n\nFor m=1: current_max is max(a[1], a[2], a[3]) = 6. dp[1][1] +6 =5+6=11",
