Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is about pairing left and right boots with compatible colors. The goal is to find the maximum number of such pairs. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what makes two boots compatible. A left boot's color and a right boot's color are compatible if either both are the same (if they are letters), or one of them is a question mark. So, for example, a '?' can pair with any other, and two specific letters must match.\n\nThe challenge is to pair as many as possible, making sure that each boot is used once. So, how do I maximize the pairs?\n\nLet me think about the strategy. Maybe we can first pair the specific colors where both are not '?'. Then handle the question marks. But how?\n\nWait, here's an idea: For each color (excluding '?'), count how many left boots have that color and how many right boots have that color. The maximum possible pairs for that color is the minimum of the counts. Then, for the remaining question marks, we can pair them with any remaining boots (either left or right) that are not already paired.\n\nBut wait, there's also the case where a '?' can be paired with another '?'. So maybe we need to process the specific colors first, then handle the question marks.\n\nLet me outline steps:\n\n1. Process all pairs where both are specific colors (not '?') and match. For each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\n2. Then, handle the remaining left and right boots that have '?'. For these, we can pair them with any remaining boots (either left or right?), but since each pair must consist of one left and one right. Wait, no, the question marks are in either left or right. So, for example, a left '?' can pair with a right 'a' (which hasn't been paired yet), or a right '?', or a left '?' with a right '?'.\n\nSo perhaps after pairing the specific colors, we need to collect the remaining left and right boots. Let's think:\n\nAfter step 1, we have some left and right boots that are not yet paired. These could be:\n\n- Left boots with '?'\n- Right boots with '?'\n- Or left boots with specific colors that couldn't be paired (because there were no matching right boots)\n- Similarly for right boots.\n\nWait, no. Because in step 1, for each color, we paired the left and right boots. So for example, if there are 3 left 'a's and 5 right 'a's, we would pair 3 of them. The remaining 2 right 'a's would be left unpaired. But if a left boot has a specific color, but there are no corresponding right boots, then it can't be paired unless it's matched with a '?'.\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\nFirst, pair the specific colors. Then, for the remaining left and right boots, which may include '?', we can pair them as follows:\n\nFor each left '?' and right '?', pair them. But also, any left '?' can pair with any remaining right boot (specific or '?'), and vice versa.\n\nBut how to maximize the number of pairs here?\n\nAlternatively, the remaining left boots can be grouped into those that are specific colors (but couldn't find a match) and those that are '?'. Similarly for the right.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me think of a way to model this.\n\nAnother approach is to model the problem as a bipartite graph, where left boots are on one side, right boots on the other, and edges represent compatibility. Then, finding the maximum matching. However, for n up to 150,000, this is not feasible with standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp, which is O(E√V). The E here would be O(n^2), which is impossible for n=1.5e5.\n\nSo we need a greedy approach.\n\nLet me think again. The key is that '?' can be used as wildcards. So, perhaps we can first pair all the non-? specific colors, then use the ?s to pair with whatever remains.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\nStep 1: Pair as many as possible of the specific colors. For example, for each color c (not '?'), take the min of the count of left c's and right c's, and pair them. For each such pair, we can record the indices.\n\nBut how to track which left and right boots are already used? We need to track which boots are still available.\n\nBut for large n, we need an efficient way to process this. Maybe using dictionaries to count the number of available left and right boots for each color.\n\nBut perhaps, for each color c (non '?'), we can pair left[c] with right[c], taking the minimum of the counts. However, we need to track which boots are used. So maybe we need",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots between left and right boots. Each boot can be either a specific color or an indefinite color (denoted by '?'). The goal is to pair these boots such that their colors are compatible, using a greedy approach to ensure efficiency.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Pair Specific Colors First**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), pair as many left boots with right boots of the same color as possible. This ensures that specific colors are matched optimally.\n2. **Handle Indefinite Colors ('?')**: After pairing specific colors, use the remaining indefinite colors to pair with any remaining boots (either specific or indefinite). This involves:\n   - Pairing left '?' with right '?'.\n   - Pairing left '?' with remaining right boots of specific colors.\n   - Pairing right '?' with remaining left boots of specific colors.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l_str = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r_str = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    # Read all test cases\n    test_cases = []\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        l_str = input[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        r_str = input[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        test_cases.append((n, l_str, r_str))\n\n    for case in test_cases:\n        n, l_str, r_str = case\n        l = list(l_str)\n        r = list(r_str)\n        left_used = [False] * n\n        right_used = [False] * n\n        pairs = []\n\n        # Step 1: Pair specific colors\n        color_count_left = defaultdict(int)\n        color_count_right = defaultdict(int)\n        for i in range(n):\n            if l[i] != '?':\n                color_count_left[l[i]] += 1\n            if r[i] != '?':\n                color_count_right[r[i]] += 1\n\n        # For each color, pair as much as possible\n        for c in color_count_left:\n            if c in color_count_right:\n                cnt = min(color_count_left[c], color_count_right[c])\n                # Now find indices to pair\n                # Need to collect all left indices with c and right indices with c\n                left_indices = []\n                right_indices = []\n                for i in range(n):\n                    if not left_used[i] and l[i] == c:\n                        left_indices.append(i)\n                    if not right_used[i] and r[i] == c:\n                        right_indices.append(i)\n                for i in range(cnt):\n                    if i < len(left_indices) and i < len(right_indices):\n                        pairs.append((left_indices[i]+1, right_indices[i]+1))\n                        left_used[left_indices[i]] = True\n                        right_used[right_indices[i]] = True\n\n        # Step 2: Collect remaining left and right boots\n        left_question = []\n        right_question = []\n        left_specific = []\n        right_specific = []\n\n        for i in range(n):\n            if not left_used[i]:\n                if l[i] == '?':\n                    left_question.append(i)\n                else:\n                    left_specific.append(i)\n        for i in range(n):\n            if not right_used[i]:\n                if r[i] == '?':\n                    right_question.append(i)\n                else:\n                    right_specific.append(i)\n\n        # Step 3: Pair ? with ?\n        min_q = min(len(left_question), len(right_question))\n        for i in range(min_q):\n            pairs.append((left_question[i]+1, right_question[i]+1))\n            left_used[left_question[i]] = True\n            right_used[right_question[i]] = True\n\n        # Step 4: Pair remaining left ? with right specific\n        for i in range(len(left_question)):\n            if not left_used[left_question[i]]:\n                for j in range(len(right_specific)):\n                    if not right_used[right_specific[j]]:\n                        pairs.append((left_question[i]+1, right_specific[j]+1))\n                        left_used[left_question[i]] = True\n                        right_used[right_specific[j]] = True\n                        break\n\n        # Step 5: Pair remaining right ? with left specific\n        for j in range(len(right_question)):\n            if not right_used[right_question[j]]:\n                for i in range(len(left_specific)):\n                    if not left_used[left_specific[i]]:\n                        pairs.append((left_specific[i]+1, right_question[j]+1))\n                        left_used[left_specific[i]] = True\n                        right_used[right_question[j]] = True\n                        break\n\n        print(len(pairs))\n        for a, b in pairs:\n            print(a, b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and split into individual test cases.\n2. **Specific Color Pairing**: For each specific color (excluding '?'), we count occurrences on both left and right boots and pair them as much as possible.\n3. **Handling Indefinite Colors**: After pairing specific colors, we handle the remaining indefinite colors by first pairing them with each other, then using them to pair with remaining specific colors from the opposite side.\n4. **Output**: The maximum number of pairs and their indices are printed for each test case.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently use both specific and indefinite colors to maximize the number of compatible pairs.",
