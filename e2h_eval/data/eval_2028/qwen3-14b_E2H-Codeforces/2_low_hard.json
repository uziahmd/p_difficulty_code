Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two main things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right, and the anti-diagonal is from top-right to bottom-left. All elements on these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other elements must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n2. Check that all elements not on either diagonal are the same. Let's call this 'o_char'.\n3. Ensure that d_char is not equal to o_char.\n\nBut how to check these?\n\nFirst, let's think about how to iterate through the diagonals.\n\nFor the main diagonal, the positions are (i, i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nFor the anti-diagonal, the positions are (i, n-1 -i) for i from 0 to n-1.\n\nBut since n is odd, the two diagonals intersect at the center cell. So that cell is part of both diagonals. But when checking, we need to make sure that all elements in both diagonals are the same. So for example, if the main diagonal has all 'x's and the anti-diagonal has all 'x's, then that's okay.\n\nBut for the non-diagonal elements, they must all be the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nSo, first, collect all the characters from both diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same. Then collect all the non-diagonal characters and check they are same and different.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think. For each cell (i,j) in the grid, check if it is on either diagonal. If yes, check if it's equal to the diagonal character. If not, check if it's equal to the other character.\n\nBut how to find the diagonal characters?\n\nLet me think. For the first step, collect all the characters from both diagonals. Then check that they are all the same. Let's say the first diagonal character is the one from (0,0). Then check that all other diagonal elements are same as that.\n\nBut what if the first element is not part of the diagonals? No, wait, the first element (0,0) is on the main diagonal. So, for example, in the first step, take the first element of the main diagonal (0,0) as the reference. Then check that all elements in both diagonals are equal to this.\n\nBut perhaps there's a case where the main diagonal has some other character, but the anti-diagonal has a different one. So, for example, the main diagonal is all 'a's, and the anti-diagonal is all 'b's. Then that's invalid. So the first step is to check that all elements in both diagonals are same.\n\nSo, first, collect all the elements in both diagonals. Then check that all of them are same. Let's say that's d_char.\n\nThen, collect all the elements not in the diagonals. Check that all of them are same, and that they are different from d_char.\n\nSo, how to implement this.\n\nLet me think about the steps in code.\n\nFirst, read the input. The input is n followed by n lines of n characters each.\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j), check if it is on either diagonal.\n\nSo, for a cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So for example, in a 5x5 grid, for i=0, j=4 (since 0+4=4 =5-1?), yes.\n\nSo, for each cell, if (i == j) or (i + j == n-1), then it's part of the diagonals.\n\nNow, collect all the characters in the diagonals. Let's take the first character of the main diagonal (i=0,j=0) as d_char. Then check that all other diagonal elements are equal to d_char.\n\nWait, but maybe the first cell is part of both diagonals. But that's okay. For example, in a 3x3 grid, the center cell (1,1) is part of both diagonals. But",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' based on specific conditions. The conditions are that all elements on both diagonals of the square must be the same, and all other elements (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal elements.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: Verify that all elements on both the main diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right) and the anti-diagonal (from top-right to bottom-left) are the same.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: Ensure that all elements not on the diagonals are the same and different from the diagonal elements.\n4. **Validation**: If both checks pass, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Check if all diagonal elements are the same\nd_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            if d_char is None:\n                d_char = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] != d_char:\n                    print(\"NO\")\n                    exit()\n\n# Check all non-diagonal elements are same and different from d_char\no_char = None\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            continue\n        if o_char is None:\n            o_char = grid[i][j]\n        else:\n            if grid[i][j] != o_char:\n                print(\"NO\")\n                exit()\n\nif o_char == d_char:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    print(\"YES\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings representing the grid.\n2. **Diagonal Check**: We iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell is on either of the diagonals, we check if it matches the first diagonal character (`d_char`). If any mismatch is found, we immediately print \"NO\" and exit.\n3. **Non-Diagonal Check**: For cells not on the diagonals, we check if they all match the first non-diagonal character (`o_char`). If any mismatch is found, we print \"NO\" and exit.\n4. **Final Check**: After ensuring all diagonal and non-diagonal elements are consistent, we check if the non-diagonal character is different from the diagonal character. If they are the same, we print \"NO\"; otherwise, we print \"YES\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions with a time complexity of O(n^2), which is optimal for the given constraints.",
