Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square must have the same letters.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) must have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, first, I need to check all the cells in the two diagonals. Then check all the other cells. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, for each cell in the grid, determine if it's on either of the two diagonals. For a square of size n x n (where n is odd), the main diagonal is from (0,0) to (n-1, n-1), and the anti-diagonal is from (0, n-1) to (n-1, 0). \n\nFor each cell (i,j), it's on the main diagonal if i == j. It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1. So, any cell that is on either of these two lines is part of the diagonals.\n\nNow, the first step is to check that all the cells on both diagonals are the same. Also, all the non-diagonal cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Check all diagonal cells (both main and anti) to see if they are all the same character. Let's call this character 'd_char'.\n- Check all non-diagonal cells to see if they are all the same character, call it 'o_char'.\n- Ensure that 'd_char' != 'o_char'.\n\nBut wait, how to do that?\n\nLet me think. For each cell in the grid, we can check whether it's on a diagonal or not. For those on diagonals, collect their characters and check if they are all the same. For those not on diagonals, collect their characters and check if they are all the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut how to collect them?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. Iterate through each cell (i, j) in the grid.\n\n2. For each cell, check if it is on either diagonal. If yes, add to diagonal_chars. Else, add to other_chars.\n\n3. After collecting all diagonal_chars and other_chars, check:\n\n   a. All elements in diagonal_chars are the same.\n\n   b. All elements in other_chars are the same.\n\n   c. The two characters are different.\n\nIf all three conditions are met, output YES, else NO.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where there are no non-diagonal cells? Well, since n is at least 3, for example, when n=3, the diagonals have 3 cells each, but overlapping at the center. So the total number of diagonal cells is 2n - 1. For n=3, that's 5 cells. The total cells is 9. So non-diagonal cells are 4. So for n=3, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nRead n, then read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen, for each cell (i, j):\n\nCheck if i == j or i + j == n-1. If yes, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nElse, it's part of the others.\n\nSo, collect all the diagonal characters and others.\n\nNow, check:\n\n- All diagonal characters are the same.\n\n- All other characters are the same.\n\n- The two characters are different.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nFor the diagonals, take the first diagonal character (say, d_char), and check that all other diagonal characters are equal to it.\n\nSimilarly for others: take the first other character (o_char), check that all others are equal to it.\n\nBut what if there are no other characters? For example, when n=1? But according to input constraints, n is at least 3. So no, for n=3, there are 4 non-diagonal cells. So in all cases, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nWait, n is at least 3, and odd. So for n=3, the number of diagonal cells is 2*3 - 1 = 5. The total cells is 9. So other cells is 9-5=4. So yes, there are non-diagonal cells.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n strings, each of length n. Let's store them as a list of lists, perhaps.\n\nThen:\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' based on specific criteria. The grid must have all characters on both diagonals the same, and all other characters (not on the diagonals) must be the same and different from the diagonal characters.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the size of the grid `n` and the grid itself.\n2. **Character Collection**: Separate characters into two groups: those on the diagonals and those not on the diagonals.\n3. **Validation**:\n   - Check if all characters on the diagonals are the same.\n   - Check if all characters not on the diagonals are the same.\n   - Ensure the characters on the diagonals are different from those not on the diagonals.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\ngrid = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n\ndiagonal_chars = []\nother_chars = []\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    for j in range(n):\n        if i == j or i + j == n - 1:\n            diagonal_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n        else:\n            other_chars.append(grid[i][j])\n\n# Check if all diagonal characters are the same\nif len(set(diagonal_chars)) != 1:\n    print(\"NO\")\nelse:\n    d_char = diagonal_chars[0]\n    # Check if all other characters are the same and different from d_char\n    if len(set(other_chars)) != 1:\n        print(\"NO\")\n    else:\n        o_char = other_chars[0]\n        if o_char != d_char:\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The first input line is the size `n`, followed by `n` lines each containing `n` characters.\n2. **Separating Characters**: We iterate through each cell of the grid. If a cell is on either of the two diagonals (main or anti-diagonal), it is added to `diagonal_chars`; otherwise, it is added to `other_chars`.\n3. **Validation Checks**:\n   - Convert `diagonal_chars` to a set to check if all characters are the same. If not, print \"NO\".\n   - Similarly, convert `other_chars` to a set to check if all non-diagonal characters are the same. If not, print \"NO\".\n   - Finally, ensure that the characters on the diagonals (`d_char`) are different from the non-diagonal characters (`o_char`). If they are different, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions using set operations, ensuring clarity and optimal performance.",
