The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given number n can be the number of vertices in a snowflake as defined. Let's try to understand what a snowflake graph is.\n\nFrom the description, the snowflake starts with one vertex. Then, this initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k > 1). Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those leaves) are each connected to k new vertices. This process must be done at least once. So, the construction is like building layers. \n\nLet me think about how the number of vertices grows with each step. Let's model the structure.\n\nLet's consider the initial step. The first layer is just the root node. Then, step 1 adds k children to the root. Now, the total nodes are 1 + k. But then, each of those k nodes is a leaf. So, in the next step, each of them adds k new nodes. So, the next step adds k * k nodes. Now, the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2. Then, each of the k^2 nodes added in the previous step is a leaf, and they each add k nodes. So, the next step adds k^3 nodes. So the total becomes 1 + k + k^2 + k^3, etc. \n\nBut the process requires that the step of adding new nodes to the leaves is done at least once. So, for example, if we do the first step (adding k children) and then stop, then the total is 1 + k. However, according to the problem statement, the step of adding new nodes to the leaves must be done at least once. Wait, the initial step is adding k children. Then, the second step (each leaf adds k children) must be done at least once. So, the minimum snowflake would be when we have two steps: the initial step (adding k children) and then the second step (adding k children to each of those leaves). So the total nodes would be 1 + k + k^2. \n\nWait, but let's recheck the problem statement:\n\nThe initial vertex is connected to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other is connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So, the initial step is adding the first level. Then, the second step (adding new vertices to the leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake is when after the initial step, we perform the second step once. So the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2. \n\nSo for example, the sample input includes n=6. Let's see: For k=2, 1+2+4=7, which is more than 6. For k=1, but k must be greater than 1. So maybe there's another way. Wait, perhaps the process isn't strictly adding layers. Maybe there's a different way to build the snowflake. Or maybe the snowflake can be built with varying numbers of layers. \n\nAlternatively, the snowflake can have any number of layers as long as the expansion steps are done. So, the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1 (since the expansion step must be done at least once). Wait, no. Because the initial step is adding the first layer (k nodes), and then the expansion step (adding to leaves) must be done at least once. So the expansion step is adding the next layer. So the total is 1 + k + k^2. But maybe after that, we can do more expansions. For example, adding another layer. So the total would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3, etc. \n\nSo the snowflake can be represented as a sum of a geometric series where the number of terms is m+1, where m ≥ 1. Wait, because the initial step (adding the first layer) is the first term (the root is 1, then adding k nodes, then adding k^2, etc). Wait, the total number of nodes would be 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1. Because the expansion steps are done at least once. \n\nWait, let's think again. The initial step is creating the root and connecting it to k nodes. That's 1 + k. Then, the expansion step (adding new nodes to each leaf) is done once. Each of the k leaves gets k new nodes. So that's adding k * k = k² nodes. So total is 1 +k +k². Then, if we do another expansion step, each of the k² leaves (from the previous step) would get k new nodes, adding",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the rules. The snowflake graph starts with one vertex and expands in layers where each leaf node is connected to `k` new vertices (with `k > 1`). This expansion must be done at least once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph can be represented as a geometric series. The total number of vertices `n` can be expressed as the sum of a geometric series: `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`, where `m ≥ 1`. This means the minimum number of vertices for any valid snowflake is `1 + k + k^2`.\n\n2. **Constraints on `k`**: For each test case, we need to check if there exists an integer `k > 1` such that the given number `n` can be represented as the sum of such a geometric series.\n\n3. **Efficient Checking**: Given the constraints (up to `10^18`), we need an efficient approach. We iterate over possible values of `k` and check if `n` can be expressed as the sum of the geometric series for some `m ≥ 1`.\n\n4. **Geometric Series Check**: For each possible `k`, we compute the sum of the geometric series up to `m` terms and check if it equals `n`. If it does, we return \"YES\"; otherwise, after checking all possible `k`, we return \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n < 3:\n        return False\n    # Check for possible k\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/2)) + 2\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        # Try different m\n        # Compute sum of 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m\n        # Which is (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)\n        # But since m >= 1, the minimal sum is 1 + k + k^2\n        # So we need to find m such that sum equals n\n        # Let's try to find m for this k\n        # Start with m=1 (sum = 1 + k)\n        # Then m=2 (sum = 1 + k + k^2)\n        # etc.\n        # We can use binary search for m\n        # But since k can be up to sqrt(n), and m can be up to log_k(n)\n        # We can loop m from 1 upwards until the sum exceeds n\n        # However, for large k, even m=2 may be too big\n        # So for each k, we compute the sum step by step\n        # Starting with m=1, then m=2, etc., until sum exceeds n\n        total = 1\n        current = 1\n        for m in range(1, 64):  # Since k >=2, and 2^60 is way larger than 1e18\n            current *= k\n            total += current\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            elif total > n:\n                break\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    t = int(input[0])\n    cases = list(map(int, input[1:t+1]))\n    for n in cases:\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            print(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **is_snowflake Function**: This function checks if a given number `n` can be represented as a sum of a geometric series starting from 1, with each subsequent term multiplied by `k` (where `k > 1`).
