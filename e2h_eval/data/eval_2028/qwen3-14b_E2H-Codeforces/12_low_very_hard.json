The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo Xenia is on a ringroad with n houses arranged in a circle. She starts at house 1. She has m tasks to do. Each task i is located at house a_i, but she can only do task i after completing all tasks with numbers less than i. The question is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks, considering that moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time.\n\nHmm. So the key here is to calculate the total time she moves from one task's house to the next, considering the order of tasks. But since the tasks must be done in order (each task i must come after all previous ones), we need to process them in the given sequence.\n\nLet me think about the example given. In the first example, the input is 4 3 and the tasks are 3, 2, 3. The output is 6. The path is 1→2→3→4→1→2→3. Let's break down the steps:\n\n- Start at 1. First task is at 3. So moving from 1 to 3: clockwise, that's 2 steps (1→2→3). Then, the second task is at 2. But since she's at 3, moving clockwise to 2 would require going all the way around: 3→4→1→2. That's 3 steps. Then third task is at 3 again. From 2 to 3 is 1 step. Total steps: 2 + 3 + 1 = 6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the idea is that for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to compute the time taken to move from the previous position to the current task's position, considering the direction (clockwise only). But how do we compute that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose Xenia is currently at position prev, and the next task is at position curr. How many steps does she need to take?\n\nSince the movement is clockwise, the number of steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) mod n if moving clockwise. Wait, no. Because if prev is 3 and curr is 2 in a 4-house setup, moving clockwise would require (2 - 3 + 4) mod 4 = 3 steps. Which is correct. So the formula for the steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Or equivalently, (curr - prev) % n. Wait, no. Because if curr is less than prev, then (curr - prev) is negative. For example, prev=3, curr=2, n=4. (2-3) is -1. Adding n gives 3, which is correct. So the steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) if curr >= prev, else (curr - prev + n). Which can be written as (curr - prev + n) % n. But since in Python, modulo can handle negative numbers, maybe (curr - prev) % n would give the right value. Let me check:\n\nFor prev=3, curr=2, n=4. (2-3) is -1. (-1) mod 4 is 3. Which is correct. So yes, the steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) % n. But wait, when prev is 1 and curr is 3, (3-1) mod 4 is 2, which is correct. So yes, the steps between prev and curr is (curr - prev) % n. But wait, in the case where prev is 1 and curr is 1, the steps are zero. Which is correct.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house. So if two consecutive tasks are in the same house, the time added is zero. So, for each consecutive pair of tasks, we need to calculate the steps between them, and sum them all.\n\nBut the initial position is 1. So the first task is a_1. The steps from 1 to a_1 is (a_1 - 1) mod n? Wait, no. Because if the initial position is 1, and the first task is at a_1. Let's think of it as moving from 1 to a_1. So the steps would be (a_1 - 1) if a_1 >= 1, else (a_1 - 1 + n). But since a_1 is between 1 and n, inclusive, then (a_1 - 1) is non-negative. So the steps for the first task is (a_1 - 1) steps. But wait, if a_1 is 1, then 0 steps",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses arranged in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the time taken to move between consecutive tasks while considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Movement**: Xenia starts at house 1 and moves clockwise. Each task must be completed in sequence, meaning each task must be completed after all previous tasks.\n2. **Circular Movement Calculation**: The time to move from one house to another in a clockwise direction can be computed using modular arithmetic. For two consecutive tasks at positions `prev` and `curr`, the time taken is `(curr - prev) % n` if moving clockwise. This formula accounts for both direct and wrap-around movements around the ringroad.\n3. **Iterative Calculation**: Starting from house 1, we iterate through each task, accumulating the total time required to move from the current position to the next task's position.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + m]))\n    \n    total_time = 0\n    current = 1  # Starting position\n    for ai in a:\n        diff = (ai - current) % n\n        total_time += diff\n        current = ai\n    print(total_time)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the constraints of large input sizes.\n- **Initialization**: We start from house 1 and initialize the total time to zero.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the time required to move from the current position to the task's house using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the road.\n- **Update Position**: After computing the time for each move, update the current position to the task's house and accumulate the total time.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the total time required by leveraging modular arithmetic to handle circular movement, resulting in an optimal solution with linear time complexity relative to the number of tasks.",
