The ringroad houses are numbered 1 through n in the clockwise order. The ringroad traffic is one way and also is clockwise.Xenia has recently moved into the ringroad house number 1. As a result, she's got m things to do. In order to complete the i-th task, she needs to be in the house number ai and complete all tasks with numbers less than i. Initially, Xenia is in the house number 1, find the minimum time she needs to complete all her tasks if moving from a house to a neighboring one along the ringroad takes one unit of time.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ m ≤ 105). The second line contains m integers a1, a2, ..., am (1 ≤ ai ≤ n). Note that Xenia can have multiple consecutive tasks in one house.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the time Xenia needs to complete all tasks.Please, do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use the cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 3\\n3 2 3', '4 3\\n2 3 3']\n\n### Output\n['6', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test example the sequence of Xenia's moves along the ringroad looks as follows: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 1 → 2 → 3. This is optimal sequence. So, she needs 6 time units.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Xenia has to complete tasks on a ringroad. The problem says that each task requires her to be in a certain house, and she can only do task i after all tasks before it (with numbers less than i). The goal is to find the minimum time she needs to complete all tasks.\n\nHmm, the input gives n (number of houses) and m (number of tasks), followed by a list of a_i's. The initial position is house 1. Moving between adjacent houses takes 1 unit of time. Since it's a ringroad, moving clockwise, so from house n, moving to 1 is one step.\n\nSo the key here is to calculate the total time she moves between the tasks. Let's think about the order of tasks. For example, if the tasks are [3,2,3], then she must do them in order. So first task is at 3, then 2, then 3 again.\n\nBut how do we compute the time between each consecutive task?\n\nLet me think. Suppose she is currently at position current_pos. The next task is at target_pos. How much time does it take to get there?\n\nSince the movement is clockwise, the time between current_pos and target_pos is (target_pos - current_pos) mod n? Wait no. Because if current is 3 and target is 2, in a 4-house setup, moving clockwise would require going from 3 →4 →1 →2, which is 3 steps. But (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3. So yes, the formula (target - current) mod n gives the correct number of steps. But wait, when target is larger than current, like current is 1, target is 3. Then (3-1) = 2 steps, which is correct. So yes, the formula (target - current) mod n gives the steps needed.\n\nWait but in the first example, the input is 4 3, and the tasks are 3,2,3. Let's walk through that.\n\nInitial position is 1. First task is 3. So steps from 1 to 3: (3-1) = 2 steps. Then, from 3 to 2: (2-3) mod 4 is -1 mod 4 = 3 steps. Then from 2 to 3: (3-2) = 1 step. Total steps: 2+3+1=6. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo the approach is to track the current position, and for each task in order, compute the steps needed to get from current position to the target, add that to the total, and update current position.\n\nBut wait, what about when the tasks are in the same house? Like if a task is at the same position as the previous. Then the steps needed is zero. So for example, if the tasks are [2,2], then the first move is from 1 to 2 (1 step), then from 2 to 2 (0 steps). So total is 1.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nInitialize current_pos = 1.\n\ntotal_time = 0.\n\nFor each task in the list a_1 to a_m:\n\n   compute the steps between current_pos and a_i.\n\n   add steps to total_time.\n\n   set current_pos to a_i.\n\nSo the problem reduces to processing each task in order, and accumulating the steps between consecutive positions.\n\nBut how do I compute the steps between current_pos and a_i?\n\nYes, as (a_i - current_pos) mod n? Wait, no. Because if a_i is less than current_pos, then moving clockwise would require going around the ring. For example, current_pos is 3, a_i is 2. Then steps is (2 - 3 + n) mod n? Or (target - current) mod n?\n\nLet me think. Let's take current_pos = 3, target = 2, n=4. The difference is (2-3) = -1. But since it's a ring, the steps required is (n - (current - target)) if current > target. So for current_pos =3, target=2, steps is 3 steps (3→4→1→2). Which is (2 -3 +4) = 3. So the steps is (target - current) mod n. Because (2-3) mod 4 is 3. So yes, the formula (target - current) mod n gives the correct steps.\n\nBut wait, in Python, the modulo operator can return negative values if the numerator is negative. Wait no, in Python, (-1) % 4 is 3, which is correct. So for example, (2-3) is -1, mod 4 is 3. So the formula is",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum time Xenia needs to complete all her tasks on a ringroad with houses numbered from 1 to n in a clockwise manner. The key challenge is to efficiently compute the time required to move between consecutive tasks, considering the circular nature of the road.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start from house number 1.\n2. **Task Processing**: For each task in the given sequence, calculate the time required to move from the current position to the target house for that task.\n3. **Circular Movement Calculation**: Use modular arithmetic to handle the circular movement. The time to move from the current position to the target position is calculated using the formula `(target - current) % n`, which ensures correct handling of both clockwise and counter-clockwise movements around the ringroad.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\ncurrent = 1\ntotal = 0\n\nfor target in a:\n    diff = (target - current) % n\n    total += diff\n    current = target\n\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: We start at house 1.\n- **Loop Through Tasks**: For each task, compute the distance from the current position to the target position using modular arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the ringroad.\n- **Update Position**: After calculating the time for each move, update the current position to the target house for the next iteration.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the total time by iterating through each task exactly once, resulting in an optimal time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of tasks. This solution handles all edge cases, including when the target house is the same as the current position or when moving around the entire ringroad.",
