He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives me a and b (or R), then a number c in base a. My job is to convert c to base b, handling Roman numerals when needed.\n\nFirst, I need to process the input correctly. Let's break down the steps:\n\nStep 1: Read a and b. But b can be 'R' instead of a number. So the first line is two elements, which could be like '10 R' or '5 16', etc.\n\nStep 2: Read the number c, which is in base a. This is a string that may have leading zeros. For example, if a is 10, then c could be '00123' which is 123 in decimal.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Convert c from base a to a decimal integer (as a Python int).\n- Then convert that decimal integer to base b, which could be another base (like 2, 16, etc.) or Roman numerals.\n\nBut how to handle the conversion from base a to decimal? Well, for that, I can process each digit of the string c, treating it as base a. For example, if the string is 'A' and a is 12, then it's 10 in decimal. But note that for bases higher than 10, letters are used (like A for 10, B for 11, etc.), but the input c may contain letters? Wait, the problem says that the input c is given in base a. So, for example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-9 and A-F (uppercase?), but the problem says that the input c may contain letters?\n\nWait, looking at the problem statement: The input c is a non-negative integer in base a. The note says that for cases with Roman numerals, the number is <= 3000 in decimal, but otherwise, it's up to 1e15. Also, the input c may contain leading zeros but its length is up to 10^3.\n\nBut how are the digits represented in base a? For example, if a is 12, then digits go from 0 to 11. So digits would be 0-9, then A (for 10), B (for 11). So the input c is a string that uses digits 0-9 and letters A-Z (uppercase?) for digits above 9. But the problem says that in the input, the c may contain letters? Or does it?\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nIn the third example input, the input is '5 R\\n4'. So the c is '4' in base 5. Which converts to 4 in decimal. Then converted to Roman numerals is IV.\n\nAnother sample is '12 13\\nA' which converts to A (which is 10 in base 12) to decimal is 10, then converted to base 13 which is 'A'.\n\nSo yes, the input c can have letters for digits higher than 9. So when converting from base a to decimal, I need to parse each character in c as a digit in base a. So for example, if a is 16, then the digits can be 0-9, A-F. But the input c may have letters in uppercase?\n\nAssuming that the input c is given with uppercase letters. Because in programming competition problems, often letters are uppercase. But the problem says nothing about case. However, since the input is given as a string, perhaps we can assume that letters are uppercase. But perhaps the code should process them regardless of case? Well, the problem says that the input is correct, so perhaps the input c is properly formatted with uppercase letters for digits beyond 9.\n\nSo, the first step is to convert the input string c from base a to decimal. How to do that?\n\nLet me think: For each character in the string, convert it to its value. For example, 'A' is 10, 'B' is 11, etc. Then compute the value as a base-a number.\n\nSo, for example, the string '1111001' in base 2 is 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + ... etc. Which is 121 in decimal.\n\nSo, the code for converting c from base a to decimal is:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but what if the base is 1? Well, the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So the input a is at least 2. So that's okay.\n\nOnce I have the decimal value, then I need to convert it to base b, which can be a number (2-25) or R (Roman numerals).\n\nSo, for the case when b is not R, we need to convert the decimal number to base b, using digits 0-9 and letters A-Z for digits >=10. Also, leading zeros must be omitted. For example, if the decimal number is 0, but according to the problem statement, when Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. However, in other cases, the input c could be zero? Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^15.\"\n\nBut the input c is a non-negative integer. So, for example, if the input is a=2, b=2, c=0, then output is 0. However, according to the problem statement, \"it is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 10^1510.\"\n\nSo, when converting to Roman numerals, the number is non-zero. But in other cases, the number can be zero. However, in the problem's input, the c is given as a non-negative integer. So, for example, if the input is a=10, b=2, c=0, then output is 0.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle zero correctly.\n\nNow, for converting a decimal number to another base (not Roman):\n\nWe can write a function that takes the number and the base, and returns the string representation. For example, 10 in base 16 is 'A', 255 in base 16 is 'FF', etc.\n\nBut how to handle zero? Well, if the number is zero, return '0'.\n\nFor numbers greater than zero, we can repeatedly divide by the base and collect the remainders. Then reverse the collected digits.\n\nBut for digits >=10, we need to represent them as letters. For example, 10 is 'A', 11 is 'B', ..., 35 is 'Z'? Well, since the base is up to 25, the maximum digit is 24 (for base 25). So 24 is 'Y'? Let's see:\n\ndigit_value = 10 → 'A', 11 → 'B', ..., 24 → 'O'? Because 10 is A, 10 + 14 = 24 → A + 14 letters. Let's check:\n\nord('A') is 65. So for digit_value d >= 10, the character is chr(65 + (d - 10)).\n\nFor example, d=10 → 65 + 0 → 'A'; d=11 → 'B'; ... d=35 would be 65 + 25 = 90 → 'Z'. But since the base is up to 25, the maximum digit is 24 (for base 25). So 24 is 65 + 14 = 79 → 'O'.\n\nSo the code for converting decimal to base b (when b is not R) is:\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\nWait, but what if the input n is zero? Well, in that case, the function returns '0'. However, the problem says that when Roman numerals are involved, the number is not zero. So for the case when the target is Roman, the number is non-zero. But when converting to another base, the input could be zero.\n\nSo, for example, if the input is a=10, b=2, c=0, then output is '0'.\n\nNow, the other case is when b is 'R', then we need to convert the decimal number to Roman numerals.\n\nSo, how to convert a decimal number to Roman numerals?\n\nThe standard approach is to use a list of value-symbol pairs, ordered from highest to lowest. For example:\n\nvalues = [\n    (1000, 'M'),\n    (900, 'CM'),\n    (500, 'D'),\n    (400, 'CD'),\n    (100, 'C'),\n    (90, 'XC'),\n    (50, 'L'),\n    (40, 'XL'),\n    (10, 'X'),\n    (9, 'IX'),\n    (5, 'V'),\n    (4, 'IV'),\n    (1, 'I')\n]\n\nThen, for each value, subtract as many times as possible from the number, appending the symbol each time.\n\nFor example, 4 is IV, 5 is V, etc.\n\nSo, the code for converting decimal to Roman is:\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input for Roman conversion is guaranteed to be <= 3000 and not zero. So we don't have to handle numbers larger than that or zero.\n\nNow, putting all the steps together:\n\nRead a and b. But the first line is two elements. For example, '10 2' or '16 R'.\n\nSo, the first line can be split into two parts. So, in Python, something like:\n\na_part, b_part = input().split()\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a list of inputs. Wait, no. The problem says that the input is read from stdin. For example, in the sample input, the first line is '10 2\\n1', but perhaps the actual input is multiple lines. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.\n\nThe next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a...\n\nSo, the input is two lines: first line is a and b (with b possibly R), second line is c.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is a list of multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWhich seems to be multiple test cases. But the problem says that the input is for a single test case. Wait, perhaps the sample input is showing multiple test cases, but the actual problem is for one test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input shows multiple lines, but perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases? Wait, no. Looking at the problem's input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c...\n\nSo, each test case is two lines. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, in the problem's sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, perhaps for multiple test cases. But the problem says that the code should read input from stdin and output to stdout. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases? Or is the sample input just a way to show multiple examples?\n\nWait, looking at the sample input and output:\n\nSample Input:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nSample Output:\n\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\nWhich suggests that there are five test cases. Each test case has two lines. But the problem says that the input is for a single test case. So perhaps the sample input is written as a list of test cases, but in reality, the code should read one test case. However, looking at the problem's note, the sample input and output are given as lists. But the actual problem says that the input is two lines per test case. So perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem's input is only for one test case. Wait, no. The problem says that the code should read input from stdin. For example, in programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, but the problem statement may not say so. However, looking at the problem's input description, it says \"the first line\" and \"the next line\", implying that there is one test case.\n\nBut the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the problem is expecting multiple test cases? But the problem's original statement is ambiguous. However, looking at the sample input and output, each test case is two lines. For example, the first test case is:\n\n10 2\n\n1\n\nWhich outputs '1'.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. But how many? How is the input structured?\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nSo, the input is two lines. But the sample input shows multiple test cases. However, in the problem statement, perhaps the sample input is presented as a list of test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input shows that the code is given multiple test cases. But that's conflicting.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nThe sample input is given as a list of strings. For example, the first element is '10 2\\n1', which is two lines. The second is '16 R\\n5', etc. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the problem's input description doesn't mention that. This is confusing.\n\nBut looking at the problem's note, the sample input is given as a list of inputs, and the output is a list of outputs. But perhaps the code is supposed to process multiple test cases. However, the problem's original description may not state that. This is a critical point.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sample input is presented in a way that shows multiple test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. But in that case, the sample input is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that the input is multiple test cases. For example, the code should read all lines from stdin, processing each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut the problem's original statement says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers a and b ... The next line contains a single non-negative integer c ...\n\nWhich implies that there is one test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. Therefore, perhaps the problem's actual input is multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines. So the code must read all test cases until EOF.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nIn programming competitions, sometimes the input is multiple test cases, and the code must process all of them. So, perhaps the code should read all lines from stdin, grouping them into pairs of lines (each test case is two lines: first line a and b, second line c).\n\nBut how to read that in Python?\n\nWell, for example, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into pairs. For example, read all lines, then process them in pairs: first line is a and b, second line is c. Then repeat for the next pair.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, each being a test case. For example, the first test case is '10 2\\n1', which is two lines. So, in code, perhaps the code reads lines until EOF, and for each pair of lines, process them as a test case.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, then process them two at a time.\n\nBut how to handle that when the input is given via standard input? For example, in practice, the code can read lines as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin]\n\nThen, process the lines in pairs: lines[0], lines[1], then lines[2], lines[3], etc.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is two lines. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases.\n\nBut the problem's original description may not have said that. However, looking at the sample input and output, the code must process multiple test cases. Otherwise, the sample input would not make sense.\n\nTherefore, the code must process multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: first line is a and b (with b possibly R), second line is c.\n\nThus, the code will read all lines, group them into pairs, and process each pair.\n\nBut how to read the input? For example, in Python, the code can read all the lines, and then process them in pairs.\n\nNow, considering that, let's proceed.\n\nSo, the steps for the code are:\n\nFor each test case:\n\n1. Read a and b (the first line of the test case). Split into two parts. Note that b can be 'R'.\n\n2. Read the second line, which is the string c in base a.\n\n3. Convert c from base a to decimal.\n\n4. Convert the decimal to base b, which can be another base or Roman numerals.\n\n5. Output the result.\n\nSo, the code needs to handle multiple test cases.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead all lines from stdin. For each pair of lines (i and i+1), process them as a test case.\n\nBut how to handle the input? For example, in some cases, the input may have leading/trailing spaces. But the problem says that the input is correct.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip() != '']\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        # Read a and b\n        line1 = lines[idx]\n        a_str, b_str = line1.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        b = b_str\n        idx += 1\n        # Read c\n        c_str = lines[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        # Convert c to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        # Now convert to base b\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nBut wait, what about leading zeros in the output? For example, in the case where the converted value is zero, the function returns '0', which is correct. For other cases, the function decimal_to_base returns the digits without leading zeros. Because when n is zero, returns '0'; otherwise, the loop starts with n>0 and collects digits, then reversed. So for example, if the decimal is 10 in base 2, it would be 1010, which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the converted value is zero? The problem says that when converting to Roman, the number is not zero. So in that case, the code can safely return '0' for the other cases.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\nTest case 1:\n\na=10, b=2, c=1.\n\nConvert c to decimal: 1 in base 10 is 1. Convert to base 2: 1 → output is '1'.\n\nSample Output is '1'.\n\nTest case 2:\n\na=16, b=R, c=5. Convert to decimal: 5. Convert to Roman: V → output 'V'.\n\nThird test case: a=5, b=R, c=4. Convert to decimal: 4 → IV.\n\nFourth test case: a=2, b=2, c=1111001. Convert to decimal: 1*2^6 + 1*2^5 + 1*2^4 + 1*2^3 + 0*2^2 + 0*2^1 + 1*2^0 ?\n\nWait, the string is '1111001' in base 2. Let's compute:\n\nThe digits are 1,1,1,1,0,0,1. The positions are from left to right, starting with 2^6 (since length is 7).\n\nSo 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 0 + 0 + 2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 121. Converting to base 2 again: 121 in decimal is 1111001 in binary. So output is same as input. Which matches the sample output.\n\nFifth test case: a=12, b=13, c=A. Convert to decimal: A is 10 in base 12 → 10. Convert to base 13: 10 is 'A' → output 'A'.\n\nSo the sample outputs match.\n\nNow, what about leading zeros in the output?\n\nFor example, if the converted value is zero, then output is '0'.\n\nAnother case: if converting to base 2, the decimal is 0 → output '0'.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, when converting to Roman, the number is not zero. So the code is safe.\n\nNow, what about the case where the input c is '0' (in base a)? For example, a=10, b=2, c=0. Then the decimal is 0. Converted to base 2 is '0'.\n\nNow, code needs to handle that.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where a is 2, c is '0' → decimal is 0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother edge case: converting to base 1? No, because the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25. So the code doesn't need to handle that.\n\nAnother edge case: when converting to Roman, the number is 3000 → MMM.\n\nWhat about numbers with leading zeros in c? For example, a=10, c='0005' → decimal is 5.\n\nNow, the code's to_decimal function handles that correctly.\n\nAnother case: c is '0' in base a, but when converting to Roman. But the problem says that when Roman is involved, the number is not zero. So such case is impossible.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nBut what about when the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, c is a non-negative integer. But the input is guaranteed to be correct. So no need to handle that.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nBut how to handle the input in code? For example, in the sample input, each test case is two lines. So the code reads lines as a list, and processes them in pairs.\n\nBut in the sample input, the input is given as a list of strings, each being a test case. But in practice, the code would read lines from stdin, which may have multiple test cases.\n\nBut the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, possible issues:\n\nIn the to_decimal function, what if the input c is empty? According to the problem statement, it's not possible. So no.\n\nAnother possible issue: when converting from base a, the input c may have letters. For example, in base 16, the input can have letters A-F. The code handles that by converting to uppercase, then checking if it's a digit or not.\n\nBut what about lowercase letters? The problem says that the input c is correct. So perhaps the input c is in uppercase. But the code uses .upper() on the characters. So even if the input is lowercase, it would be handled.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nAnother possible issue: when the base is 1? But the problem says that a and b are between 2 and 25.\n\nNow, code for the functions:\n\nBut for the decimal_to_base function, when n is zero, returns '0'. Otherwise, proceeds.\n\nAnother thing: when converting to base 10, the code returns the digits as numbers. For example, if the decimal is 10, base 10 is '10'.\n\nNow, what about leading zeros in the output? The problem says to omit leading zeros. The code's decimal_to_base function returns the correct string without leading zeros. For example, if the decimal is 0, returns '0'. For other numbers, the code generates the digits correctly.\n\nNow, testing the code for the sample input.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nTest case 2:\n\nInput line 1: 16 R\n\nInput line 2: 5 → decimal is 5 → Roman is V → output is V.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\nTest case 3: 5 R, c=4 → decimal is 4 → IV.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 2 2, c=1111001 → decimal is 121 → converted to base 2 is 1111001 → output is same.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: 12 13, c=A → decimal is 10 → converted to base 13 is A → output is A.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nNow, what about when the decimal number is zero?\n\nFor example, input a=10, b=10, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nAnother case: a=2, b=10, c=0 → output '0'.\n\nNow, what about when converting to base 16, decimal is 10 → output 'A'.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: decimal is 255 → base 16 is 'FF'.\n\nNow, code seems correct.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- The code reads all lines, but if there's an odd number of lines, it may crash. However, according to the problem statement, each test case is two lines, so the input will have even number of lines. So the code is safe.\n\nAnother possible issue: when splitting the first line into a and b. For example, if the first line is '10 R', then split into ['10', 'R'].\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code implementation in Python:\n\nBut in the code, when reading the lines, the code uses:\n\nlines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip() != '']\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have empty lines. However, the problem says that the input is correct, so the code can process the lines as pairs.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut in the code, the main function is written as:\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip() != '']\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        line1 = lines[idx]\n        a_str, b_str = line1.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        b = b_str\n        idx += 1\n        c_str = lines[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        # process\n        ...\n\nBut what if the line1 has more than two parts? According to the problem statement, the first line has exactly two parts. So it's safe.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut the code needs to be written as a script that reads from stdin and writes to stdout.\n\nSo, the full code:\n\nNow, putting all together.\n\nBut also, note that in the case where the input c is zero, but the target is not Roman. For example, a=10, b=2, c=0 → output is 0.\n\nAnother thing: the function decimal_to_base returns '0' when n is zero. So that's correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the helper functions and main function.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip() != '']\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        line1 = lines[idx]\n        a_str, b_str = line1.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        b = b_str\n        idx += 1\n        c_str = lines[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        # Convert c to decimal\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        # Now convert to base b\n        if b == 'R':\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal_value)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what if the input is given as multiple test cases, but the code reads them all?\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing this code against the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nThe sample input is given as:\n\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\nWhich would be read as lines:\n\nlines = ['10 2', '1', '16 R', '5', '5 R', '4', '2 2', '1111001', '12 13', 'A']\n\nProcessing:\n\nidx starts at 0.\n\nFirst iteration:\n\nline1 = '10 2' → split into a_str='10', b_str='2'\n\nc_str is '1' → decimal is 1.

    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from a given base `a` to another base `b`, which could be a numerical base (2-25) or Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from base `a` to a decimal integer and then converting that decimal integer to the target base `b`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input Number to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a`. We convert this number to its decimal (base 10) equivalent by processing each digit of the input string.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: Depending on whether the target base `b` is a numerical base or Roman numerals:\n   - For numerical bases (2-25), convert the decimal number to the target base using standard base conversion techniques.\n   - For Roman numerals, convert the decimal number to Roman numerals using a predefined list of value-symbol pairs.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch.upper()) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    roman_numerals = [\n        (1000, 'M'),\n        (900, 'CM'),\n        (500, 'D'),\n        (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'),\n        (90, 'XC'),\n        (50, 'L'),\n        (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'),\n        (9, 'IX'),\n        (5, 'V'),\n        (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for value, symbol in roman_numerals:\n        while n >= value:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= value\n    return res\n\ndef main():\n    lines = [line.strip() for line in sys.stdin if line.strip() != '']\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(lines):\n        line1 = lines[idx]\n        a_str, b_str = line1.split()\n        a = int(a_str)\n        b = b_str\n        idx += 1\n        c_str = lines[idx]\n        idx += 1\n        decimal_value = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n        if b == 'R':\n            print(decimal_to_roman(decimal_value))\n        else:\n            base = int(b)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal_value, base)\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read as a list of lines, with each test case consisting of two lines: the first line contains the bases `a` and `b`, and the second line contains the number `c` in base `a`.\n2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `to_decimal` converts the input number from base `a` to a decimal integer by iterating over each character of the input string and computing its value.\n3. **Conversion to Target Base**: \n   - If the target base `b` is 'R', the function `decimal_to_roman` converts the decimal number to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs.\n   - If the target base `b` is a numerical base, the function `decimal_to_base` converts the decimal number to the target base by repeatedly dividing the number by the base and collecting remainders, which are then converted to appropriate characters (digits or letters for bases greater than 10).\n\nThis approach ensures that all edge cases, such as leading zeros and Roman numeral conversions, are handled efficiently and correctly.",
