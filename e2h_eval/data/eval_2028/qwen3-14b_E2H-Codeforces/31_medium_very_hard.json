Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have numbers that don't exceed x in absolute value, and he can use any numbers from -x to x, but each card can be used as many times as needed, I think. Wait, no—wait, the problem says that initially he had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So when he's looking for the missing cards, he can take any number of cards, each of which can be any value between -x and x, but each individual card's value is within that range. But the question is, what's the minimal number of cards he needs to add so that the total sum is zero.\n\nSo the approach is: compute the current sum of the found cards. Let's call that S. We need to add some cards such that the total sum becomes zero. So the sum of the added cards must be -S. Let's call this target T = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of cards (each with value between -x and x) that sum up to T. And we need to find the minimal count of such cards.\n\nBut how do we find that minimal count?\n\nLet me think. For example, if T is zero, then we need zero cards. But that's only possible if the original sum was already zero. Otherwise, we need to find the minimal number of cards to reach T.\n\nSo, let's think about the possible values. Let's say T is the target sum we need to reach with the added cards. Each card can contribute between -x and x. Let's think about the maximum possible sum per card. So, for each card, the maximum contribution is x, and the minimum is -x.\n\nSo, for the minimal number of cards, we want to maximize the sum per card. So for example, if T is positive, we can take as many x as possible. Similarly for negative.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal number of cards required?\n\nLet me think. Suppose T is positive. Then, each card can contribute at most x. So the minimal number of cards is ceiling(T / x). But wait, if T is exactly divisible by x, then it's T/x. Otherwise, it's T//x + 1. For example, if T is 5 and x is 2, then 5/2 is 2.5, so ceiling is 3. Which would be 2+2+1, but since each card can be up to x. Wait, but 2+2+1 is 5, but each card can be 2, but then 2+2+1 would require three cards. However, maybe there's a better way? No, because each card can contribute up to x. So for T positive, the minimal number of cards is ceil(T / x). Similarly, if T is negative, then the minimal number is ceil( |T| / x ), since each card can contribute up to -x (so the same as taking absolute value and dividing by x).\n\nWait, but let's think of T as the sum needed. So, for example, if T is 3 and x is 2. Then, we can take one card of 2 and another of 1. That's two cards. Which is 3/2 rounded up. So yes, that's correct. Similarly, if T is 4 and x is 2, then two cards of 2 each. So 4/2=2.\n\nSo the formula is: the minimal number of cards is ceil( |T| / x ). But wait, what if T is zero? Then zero cards. So the general approach is:\n\nCompute T = -sum of found cards.\n\nIf T is zero, answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute the absolute value of T, then divide by x, take the ceiling. But wait, how to compute that in Python?\n\nFor example, if T is 5 and x is 2: 5 / 2 = 2.5 → ceil is 3.\n\nIn Python, we can compute it as (abs(T) + x - 1) // x.\n\nYes. Because for example, (5 + 2-1) // 2 = 6//2=3. For 4, (4 +2-1)//2 = 5//2=2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards is (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x.\n\nBut wait, let me check some examples.\n\nIn the first sample input:\n\nSample input 1 is 3 2, with numbers -1, 1, 2. The sum is (-1 + 1 + 2) = 2. So T is -2. So the absolute value is 2. Then (2 + 2 -1) // 2 = (3)//2 = 1. Which matches the sample output of 1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: 2 3, numbers -2, -2. Sum is -4. So T is 4. So (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nAnother example: if T is 0, then 0 cards. If T is 3 and x is 3, then 1 card. If T is 4 and x is 3, then (4+3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Which is correct (3+1, but 1 is allowed as x is 3. So two cards.)\n\nSo this formula seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what if T is not divisible by x? For example, T is 5, x is 3. Then 5/3 is 1.666..., ceil is 2. Which would be 3 + 2. So two cards. Which is correct.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards is indeed (abs(T) + x -1) // x.\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Then the answer is zero. So the steps are:\n\nCalculate the sum of the found cards. Let's call it S.\n\nIf S is zero, then answer is 0.\n\nElse, compute T = -S. Then compute the minimal number of cards as (abs(T) + x -1) // x.\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Well, then the answer is 0.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead list of numbers.\n\nCompute sum_S = sum of the list.\n\nif sum_S == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    T = -sum_S\n\n    min_cards = (abs(T) + x -1) // x\n\n    print(min_cards)\n\nWait, but let me check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample:\n\nsum is 2. T is -2. So abs(T) is 2. (2 + 2-1)/2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample: sum is -4. T is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: if sum is 3, x is 3. Then T is -3. abs(T) is 3. (3 +3-1)/3 = 5//3=1. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 1, x is 1. T is -1. (1 +1-1)/1 = 1/1=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum is 1, x is 2. T is -1. (1 +2-1)/2 = 2/2=1. Correct. So adding one card of -1.\n\nBut what if sum is 1 and x is 1. Then T is -1. So the minimal number is 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if sum is 5, x is 2. T is -5. So abs(T) is 5. (5 +2-1)/2 = 6/2=3. Which is correct. 2+2+1=5. So three cards.\n\nBut wait, the cards can be any numbers between -x and x. So for example, in this case, adding three cards: 2, 2, 1. But 1 is allowed because x is 2. So yes.\n\nSo the formula works.\n\nSo the code seems straightforward.\n\nBut wait, what about when x is zero? No, the problem says x is at least 1. Because in the input constraints, x is given as 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000. So no division by zero here.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead list of numbers.\n\nsum_S = sum(list)\n\nif sum_S == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    T = -sum_S\n\n    min_cards = (abs(T) + x -1) // x\n\n    print(min_cards)\n\nBut wait, let me think again. Are there any cases where this approach might not work?\n\nWhat if T is 3, x is 2. Then (3 +2-1)/2 = 4/2=2. Which is correct. 2+1=3. So two cards.\n\nAnother example: T is 4, x is 3. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6/3=2. 3 + 1 =4. So two cards. Correct.\n\nBut what if T is 1, x is 1. Then (1 +1-1)/1 = 1/1=1. Correct.\n\nSo all cases seem to be handled.\n\nSo the code should be straightforward.\n\nNow let's check the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput is '3 2\\n-1 1 2'. The sum is -1 +1 +2 = 2. So T is -2. So abs(T) is 2. (2 + 2-1) // 2 = 3//2=1. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: '2 3\\n-2 -2'. Sum is -4. T is 4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6//3=2. Correct.\n\nAnother example: if the sum is zero, output 0.\n\nAnother example: n=1, x=1, and the card is 1. Sum is 1. T is -1. So (1 +1-1)/1=1. So output 1.\n\nAnother example: sum is 0. Output 0.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input. The first line is two integers n and x. The second line is n integers.\n\nSo in code:\n\nRead the first line as n, x. Then read the second line as a list of integers.\n\nsum_S = sum of the list.\n\nif sum_S == 0: print 0.\n\nelse:\n\ncompute T = -sum_S.\n\nthen compute (abs(T) + x -1) // x.\n\nBut wait, what if T is zero? Well, sum_S is zero, so that's handled in the first case.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\n\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nsum_S = sum(nums)\n\nif sum_S == 0:\n\n    print(0)\n\nelse:\n\n    T = -sum_S\n\n    min_cards = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x\n\n    print(min_cards)\n\nWait, but why is that correct? Because the minimal number of cards is determined by how much you can add per card. For example, each card can contribute up to x. So the minimal number is ceil( |T| / x ), which is exactly what (abs(T) + x -1 ) // x computes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should handle all test cases.\n\nLet me check some edge cases.\n\nCase 1: n=1, x=1, nums=[1]. sum_S=1. T=-1. So (1 +1-1)//1 = 1. Correct.\n\nCase 2: n=1, x=1, nums=[0]. sum_S=0. Output 0.\n\nCase 3: n=2, x=1, nums=[1, -1]. sum is 0. Output 0.\n\nCase 4: sum_S is 3, x=3. T=-3. (3 +3-1)/3 = 5//3=1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: sum_S is 4, x=3. T=-4. (4 +3-1)/3 = 6//3=2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: sum_S is -5, x=3. T is 5. (5 +3-1)/3 =7//3=2. 3+2=5. So two cards.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (including the newly found ones) equals zero. Each card can have a value between -x and x, inclusive.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Target Sum**: Determine the target sum needed to balance the total sum to zero. This target sum is simply the negative of the sum of the found cards.\n3. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed. Otherwise, compute the minimum number of cards required using the formula derived from the maximum possible contribution per card. The formula used is `(abs(target_sum) + x - 1) // x`, which effectively computes the ceiling of the division of the absolute target sum by x.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nnums = list(map(int, input().split()))\nsum_S = sum(nums)\nif sum_S == 0:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    T = -sum_S\n    min_cards = (abs(T) + x - 1) // x\n    print(min_cards)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of two integers `n` (number of found cards) and `x` (maximum absolute value on a card), followed by a list of integers representing the values on the found cards.\n2. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the values on the found cards. If this sum is already zero, the answer is immediately zero.\n3. **Target Sum Calculation**: If the sum is not zero, the target sum needed to balance it to zero is the negative of the computed sum.\n4. **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using the formula `(abs(target_sum) + x - 1) // x`, we determine the minimum number of cards required. This formula ensures we take the ceiling of the division, which gives the minimum number of cards needed considering each card's maximum contribution of `x`.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the solution with a time complexity of O(n) for summing the input values, which is optimal given the constraints.",
