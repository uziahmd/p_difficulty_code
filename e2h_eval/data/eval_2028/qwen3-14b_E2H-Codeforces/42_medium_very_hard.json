    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding all integers between 0 and 100 inclusive that are shown simultaneously on both progress bars at some moment during the file copying process. The two progress bars are calculated differently: one for the current file, and another for the total data copied so far.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. \n\nFirst, let's understand the scenario. Each time a byte is copied, both progress bars update. For each byte x in file i (where x ranges from 1 to a_i), the first progress bar shows floor(100 * x / a_i) percent. The second shows floor(100 * (sum of previous files' sizes + x) / total_sum) percent. Both are updated after each byte is copied. Also, initially, before any bytes are copied, both show 0%.\n\nSo, the task is to find all percentages p (from 0 to 100) such that there exists at least one moment (i.e., some byte being copied) where both progress bars display p.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nThe straightforward way would be to simulate each byte being copied and check for each moment what the two percentages are, then collect all the p's that are present in both. However, since the files can be up to 1000 bytes each, and n can be 100, the total number of bytes is up to 100 * 1000 = 100,000. For each of these bytes, we can compute the two percentages and track when they are equal. Then collect all such p's.\n\nBut wait, even with 1e5 steps, that's manageable. Because 1e5 is acceptable for Python in terms of processing time. So this seems feasible.\n\nBut let's think about the details.\n\nFirst, compute the total_sum of all a_i. Then, for each file i, and for each byte x in 1..a_i:\n\ncurrent_percent = floor(100 * x / a_i)\n\ntotal_percent = floor(100 * (sum_prev + x) / total_sum), where sum_prev is the sum of the first i-1 files.\n\nBut sum_prev can be precomputed. Let's precompute the prefix sums.\n\nFor example, prefix_sum[i] is the sum of a_1 to a_i. Then, when processing the i-th file, the sum_prev is prefix_sum[i-1], and the total_sum is prefix_sum[n].\n\nSo for each byte x in the i-th file, the total bytes copied so far is prefix_sum[i-1] + x. Therefore, the total_percent is floor(100 * (prefix_sum[i-1] + x) / total_sum).\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute the prefix sums.\n- Iterate through each file, and for each byte x in that file:\n   - compute current_percent and total_percent.\n   - if they are equal, add to a set of possible p's.\n- Also, need to consider the initial state (before any bytes are copied) which is 0% for both. So 0 is definitely in the answer.\n\nWait, but according to the problem statement, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is considered. But according to the note in the first example, when there's one file, the progress bars are always the same. But the initial 0% is included. So the initial 0% is a valid case. However, when we simulate the bytes, the initial state isn't covered by the simulation. Because the simulation starts at x=1 for the first byte.\n\nWait, the problem says that after copying each byte, the progress bars are updated. So before any bytes are copied, the progress bars are 0. But after the first byte is copied, they are updated. So the initial 0% is a moment when both are 0. So we need to include 0% in the answer if it's possible. But how?\n\nIn the simulation, for each byte x, we compute the progress after that byte is copied. But the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is also a moment where both are 0. So we need to check whether 0 is present. But in the simulation, when x=0? Well, the problem says that the initial state is 0. So we have to include 0% as a possible value if it's present. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the progress bars are updated after copying each byte. So for the initial state (no bytes copied), the progress bars are 0. Then, after the first byte is copied, they are updated. So the initial 0 is a valid moment. However, during the simulation of the bytes, the code would not capture that. So we need to check whether 0 is a valid value. But in the first example, the output includes 0. So the initial 0 must be considered. However, when the first byte is copied, the progress bars are 100*1/a_i, which could be 100/6=16.666... floored to 16. So the initial 0 is a separate case.\n\nSo, in our code, we need to check if 0 is present. Because in the simulation, the initial state is not covered. So for example, in the first test case, the initial 0 is included. So how to handle this?\n\nWell, the initial 0 is a valid moment. So we need to check if 0 is present. However, in the simulation, when all the bytes are processed, the final state is 100% for both. But the problem says that during the process, including the initial state, the progress bars can have values. So the code needs to check if 0 is a possible value. How?\n\nWell, the initial state (before any bytes are copied) is a moment when both bars are 0. So 0 is always present. Wait, no. Because the problem says that the initial state is 0. So regardless of anything, 0 is a valid value. Because there exists a moment (the very beginning) when both are 0.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"after copying each byte\" the progress bars are updated. But the initial state is before any bytes are copied. So the initial state is a moment where both are 0. So 0 is always part of the answer.\n\nBut looking at the sample input:\n\nFirst example input is 1 and 6. The output is 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which includes 0. So the initial 0 is included.\n\nBut what if there is no moment where both bars are 0 except the initial state? Well, the initial state is considered. So in the code, 0 should be added to the result set automatically. However, perhaps during the simulation, when the first byte is copied, the progress bars may not be 0. So the initial 0 is a valid case.\n\nBut how to handle this?\n\nSo, the code needs to add 0 to the answer set. But wait, what if the total_sum is zero? No, because each a_i is at least 1. So total_sum is at least 1. So the initial 0 is valid.\n\nBut in the simulation, when the first byte is copied, the first progress bar is 100 * 1 / a_i, and the second is 100 * (sum_prev + x) / total_sum. Since sum_prev is 0 (for the first file), and x is 1, the total is 1 / total_sum. For example, if the first file is 6 bytes, total_sum is 6. So the second progress bar is 100 * 1 / 6 = 16.666..., which floors to 16. So the initial 0 is present, but after the first byte, the progress bars are 16 and 16. So in this case, 0 is present, and 16 is also present. So the initial 0 is a valid case. So the code must include 0 in the answer.\n\nBut how to check if 0 is present? Well, the initial state is always present. So the answer must include 0. However, perhaps the problem's note says that in the first example, the progress bars are always the same, which includes 0. But in other cases, maybe there are moments where both are 0 again. For example, if a file is of size 1, then after the first byte is copied, the first progress bar is 100%. But the total progress bar is 100 * 1 / total_sum. Which may be 0 if the total_sum is larger than 1. So in that case, the initial 0 is the only moment where both are 0. So the code must include 0 in the answer.\n\nTherefore, in the code, the set of valid percentages must include 0. However, what if the initial 0 is not the only moment? For example, during the process, there could be other times when both bars are 0. But that's impossible, because once you copy a byte, the total progress is at least 1, so the total percent would be floor(100 * 1 / total_sum). Which for total_sum >= 1, this is 0 if total_sum > 1. So for example, if there are two files of size 1 and 1. Then total_sum is 2. After the first byte (first file), the total progress is 1/2 = 50% (floored to 50). So the initial 0 is the only time when both are 0. So the code must include 0 in the answer.\n\nTherefore, the code should start with adding 0 to the result set. Then, process all the bytes and check for each moment if the two percentages are equal, adding them to the set. Also, after all the bytes are processed, the final state is 100% for both. So the code must also check if 100% is present. Because after the last byte is copied, the progress bars are 100% each. So for example, in the first sample input, the output includes 100.\n\nSo, how to handle the 100% case? Because when the last byte is copied, the current progress bar for the current file is 100% (since x equals a_i). The total progress bar is 100% (since the sum_prev + x is the total_sum). So in that case, both are 100. So the code will capture this when processing the last byte. However, what if the total_sum is not equal to the sum of the files? No, the total_sum is the sum of all the files. So when the last byte is copied, the total progress is 100%.\n\nBut during the simulation, the code checks for each byte. So when the last byte is processed, the code would compute the current_percent and total_percent, which would be 100% each. Thus, 100 is added to the set. However, in some cases, maybe the last byte is not the only time when both are 100. For example, if the total_sum is 1000, and during the process, the total progress bar reaches 100% before the last byte. But that's impossible, because the total progress is floor(100 * (sum_prev + x) / total_sum). The sum_prev + x is less than total_sum until the last byte. So the total_percent can only reach 100% when sum_prev + x equals total_sum, which is exactly when the last byte is copied. Therefore, the code will capture 100% when processing the last byte.\n\nBut what if the sum_prev + x is exactly equal to total_sum? That's the last byte. So the code will capture 100% in that case.\n\nSo, the code should:\n\n- Initialize a set with 0.\n- Iterate through each file and each byte in the file.\n- For each byte, compute the current_percent and total_percent.\n- If they are equal, add to the set.\n- Finally, after processing all bytes, check if 100 is in the set. Well, if the code processes the last byte, then it will capture 100% as part of the simulation. But what if the code doesn't process the last byte? No, because the code is processing all bytes. So the code will capture 100% in the set.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the output includes 100. Let's see:\n\nFor the first sample input, n=1, a_1=6. So the total_sum is 6. For the 6th byte (x=6), current_percent is floor(100 * 6/6) = 100. total_percent is floor(100 * 6/6) = 100. So yes, 100 is added. So the code would capture that.\n\nSo the initial 0 is added, and the code checks all bytes. So the code will capture all the required values.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\nRead n, then read the list a of n integers.\n\nCompute the total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute the prefix sums. For example, prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0] + a[1], etc. So that for the i-th file (0-based?), the sum_prev is prefix_sums[i].\n\nWait, let's think about indexes. Let's say the files are 0-based. For the i-th file (0-based), the sum_prev is prefix_sums[i], and the current file is a[i]. So the prefix_sums array can be built as follows:\n\nprefix_sums[0] = 0\n\nprefix_sums[1] = a[0]\n\nprefix_sums[2] = a[0] + a[1]\n\n...\n\nprefix_sums[n] = sum of all a[0..n-1]\n\nSo for the i-th file (0-based), the sum_prev is prefix_sums[i], and the total_sum is prefix_sums[n].\n\nSo for each file i in 0..n-1:\n\n   for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n       total_bytes = prefix_sums[i] + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to the set.\n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nInitialize a set.\n\nAdd 0 to the set.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nLoop over each file i (0-based):\n\n   sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n   for x in 1 to a[i]:\n\n       current_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\n       total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n       total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n       if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n           add to the set.\n\nOnce all are processed, collect all elements in the set from 0 to 100, sorted.\n\nBut wait, what about the case when after the last byte, the progress bars are 100%? For example, in the first test case, that's captured.\n\nBut also, the code adds 0. So the set will contain 0, and any other p's found during the simulation.\n\nBut what about the 100%? It is added during the simulation. So the code will capture it.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nBut let's check the first example.\n\nSample input 1:\n\nn=1, a=[6]\n\ntotal_sum = 6.\n\nprefix_sums = [0, 6]\n\nfor i=0, sum_prev is 0.\n\nfor x from 1 to 6:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100*x)/6, floored.\n\ntotal_bytes is 0 + x = x. total_percent is (100*x)/6.\n\nso for all x, current_percent and total_percent are same. So all values generated during simulation are added. Also, 0 is added. So the set will have 0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: the second sample input.\n\nSample input 2:\n\nn=2, a = [100, 500]\n\ntotal_sum = 600.\n\nprefix_sums = [0, 100, 600].\n\nProcessing first file (i=0, sum_prev=0):\n\nfor x in 1 to 100:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // 100 = x // 1.\n\nWhich is x.\n\ntotal_bytes = 0 + x = x.\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * x) // 600 = floor(x / 6).\n\nSo for each x in 1-100, current_percent is x, total_percent is x//6.\n\nSo when is x == x//6? Well, x//6 is floor(x/6). So for x=0, 0. But during simulation, x starts from 1.\n\nSo for x=0, which is not part of the simulation.\n\nSo during the first file's processing, the current_percent and total_percent are equal only when x equals floor(x/6). Which is possible only when x is 0. But since x is from 1 to 100, this is not possible. So during the first file, no new values are added except possibly when x=0, which is not considered. So during the first file, nothing is added except maybe 0 (but 0 is already added).\n\nThen, processing the second file (i=1, sum_prev = 100). The a[i] is 500. So for x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // 500 = floor( (x * 100 ) / 500 ) = floor( x / 5 )\n\ntotal_bytes = 100 + x. total_percent = (100 * (100 + x )) // 600.\n\nSo for each x, we check if floor(x/5) == floor( (100 + x) * 100 / 600 )\n\nLet me compute that.\n\nLet me take x=500. Then:\n\ncurrent_percent = 500 /5 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes = 100 + 500 = 600. total_percent = (600 * 100) / 600 = 100. So yes, added.\n\nSo 100 is added.\n\nBut what about other values?\n\nThe sample output for this case is 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nSo during the second file, when x is such that the current_percent and total_percent are equal.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For example, when x is 500 - 1 = 499, the current_percent is 499//5 = 99. The total_bytes is 100 + 499 = 599. total_percent is (599 * 100) // 600 = 59900 // 600 = 99.833... floored to 99. So 99 is added.\n\nSo 99 is in the set.\n\nSimilarly, when x is 595, the current_percent is 595//5 = 119, but that's beyond 100. Wait no, x is up to 500. So current_percent is floor( x * 100 / 500 ) = floor( x / 5 ). For x=500, 500/5=100. So the maximum current_percent is 100.\n\nSo during the second file, the current_percent is between 0 and 100.\n\nSo for the second file, during x from 1 to 500, we can have various values.\n\nBut how to find all the p's that are present in both.\n\nBut according to the sample output, in this case, the valid numbers are 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nSo during the simulation, when x is in the second file, certain values are added.\n\nSo the code would correctly capture those.\n\nThus, the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, considering the code.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nFirst, read n, then the list of a.\n\nCompute total_sum = sum(a).\n\nCompute prefix_sums. For example, prefix_sums can be a list where prefix_sums[0] = 0, prefix_sums[1] = a[0], prefix_sums[2] = a[0]+a[1], etc.\n\nIn Python, for a list a, the prefix_sums can be computed as follows:\n\nprefix_sums = [0]\nfor num in a:\n    prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)\n\nOnce that's done, for each i in 0..n-1:\n\nsum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\nfor x in 1 to a[i]:\n\ncurrent_percent = (100 * x) // a[i]\n\ntotal_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\ntotal_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\nif current_percent == total_percent, add to the set.\n\nOnce all these are processed, collect all elements in the set, sort them, and output.\n\nBut also, the initial 0 is added. However, during the simulation, when x=0 (which is not processed), but the initial state is 0. So in code, the set starts with 0.\n\nBut wait, in the case where during the simulation, there is another moment when both are 0. For example, suppose that the total_sum is 1000, and during the process, the total_bytes is 0 (but that's only possible before any bytes are copied). So the initial 0 is added once.\n\nBut in the code, the set starts with 0. Then, during the simulation, if there's another moment when both are 0, it will be added again, but since it's a set, duplicates are handled.\n\nSo the code can proceed as follows:\n\nInitialize a set called result = {0}\n\nThen process each byte as described.\n\nOnce all bytes are processed, collect the elements in the set, sort them, and print them.\n\nBut what about the case where 100 is not added? For example, if the last byte is processed, but due to integer division, the current_percent and total_percent are 100?\n\nYes, in that case, the code would add it. So the code should capture that.\n\nNow, let's think about the edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, a=[1]. Then total_sum=1.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = 100*1//1 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes = 0+1=1. total_percent = 100*1//1 = 100. So added. So the result set is {0, 100}.\n\nSo output is 0, 100.\n\nAnother edge case: n=2, a=[1, 1]. total_sum=2.\n\nInitial 0 is added.\n\nProcessing first file (i=0, sum_prev=0, a[i]=1):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = 100*1//1 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes = 0+1=1. total_percent = 100*1//2 = 50. 100 != 50, so not added.\n\nProcessing second file (i=1, sum_prev=1, a[i]=1):\n\nx=1:\n\ncurrent_percent = 100*1//1 = 100.\n\ntotal_bytes = 1+1=2. total_percent = 100*2//2=100. So added. So the set is {0, 100}.\n\nThus, output is 0 and 100.\n\nAnother case: n=2, a=[2, 2]. total_sum=4.\n\nFor first file:\n\nx=1: current is 50, total is (0+1)*100/4 = 25. Not equal.\n\nx=2: current is 100, total is (0+2)*100/4 = 50. Not equal.\n\nSecond file:\n\nsum_prev=2.\n\nx=1: current is 50, total is (2+1)*100/4 = 75. Not equal.\n\nx=2: current is 100, total is (2+2)*100/4= 100. So added. So the result set is {0, 100}.\n\nSo output is 0 and 100.\n\nAnother case: when during the process, the same p is achieved multiple times, but the code adds it once.\n\nNow, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code steps in Python.\n\nRead input:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\n\nprefix_sums = [0]\n\nfor num in a:\n\n    prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)\n\nInitialize the set.\n\nresult = set()\n\nresult.add(0)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n\n            result.add(current_percent)\n\nOnce done, collect all elements in the result, sort them, and print them with newlines.\n\nBut wait, the sample outputs have lines like '0\\n16\\n33...' etc. So the output is the numbers in order, each on their own line.\n\nSo the code needs to collect the sorted list, then print each element on its own line.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the outputs are for multiple test cases. Wait, the user provided multiple examples, but the actual problem is for a single test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user provided input examples as lists, but the actual problem is that the code must read from stdin. So the code should read n, then the list of a_i, and output the numbers as per the problem.\n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is given as:\n\nIn the first line, n is given. In the second line, the a_i.\n\nSo the code must read from stdin, and output the numbers in order.\n\nSo in the code, after processing, collect the sorted list of the result set, then print each element on a separate line.\n\nSo for example, in the first sample input, the output is:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich is the sorted list of the set {0, 16, 33, 50, 66, 83, 100}.\n\nSo in code:\n\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\n\nfor num in sorted_result:\n\n    print(num)\n\nBut what about the case where 100 is not in the set? For example, if the last byte is not processed. But no, the code processes all bytes, including the last one. So 100 is added if it occurs.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut let's think about the case where the total_sum is zero. But the constraints say that a_i >= 1, so total_sum is at least 1.\n\nAnother thing: when the current_file_size is zero? No, because the constraints say a_i >= 1.\n\nThus, the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, testing the code against the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n1\n\n6\n\nSample Output:\n\n0\n\n16\n\n33\n\n50\n\n66\n\n83\n\n100\n\nWhich matches the code's processing.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n2\n\n100 500\n\nWhich gives output 0,95,96,97,98,99,100.\n\nLet me see why.\n\nLet me think for the second file (sum_prev = 100, a[i] = 500).\n\nFor x from 1 to 500:\n\ncurrent_percent is (100 * x) // 500 = x//5.\n\ntotal_bytes is 100 + x.\n\ntotal_percent is (100*(100 + x)) // 600.\n\nWe need to find x where x//5 == floor( (100 + x) * 100 / 600 )\n\nLet me compute (100 + x)*100 / 600 = (100 + x) * (1/6) = (100 + x) / 6.\n\nSo the equation is x//5 = floor( (100 + x)/6 )\n\nWe need to find x in 1..500 such that this holds.\n\nLet me take x= 595? No, x is up to 500. So x can be up to 500.\n\nLet me think for x= 500:\n\nx//5 = 100. (100 + 500)/6 = 600/6=100. So 100 == 100. So added.\n\nx= 499:\n\nx//5 = 99. (100 + 499) = 599. 599 /6 = 99.833..., floor 99. So 99 == 99. So added.\n\nSimilarly for x= 498:\n\nx//5 = 99.6 → 99. 100+498=598 → 598/6 = 99.666..., floor 99. So yes.\n\nSo for x from 495 to 500, perhaps?\n\nLet me think for x= 495:\n\nx//5 = 495 /5 = 99. 100 + 495 = 595. 595/6 = 99.166..., floor 99. So yes.\n\nSo x=495 to 500 gives 99 and 100.\n\nBut what about when x is 595? No, since x is up to 500.\n\nSo during the second file, the code would add 99, 100, etc.\n\nBut how do we get 95, 96, 97, 98?\n\nLet me think for x= 475:\n\nx//5 = 95. 100 + 475 = 575. 575/6 = 95.833... → 95. So yes. So 95 is added.\n\nSimilarly for x= 476: 476//5 = 95.2 → 95. 576 /6 = 96. So 95 vs 96. Not equal. So no.\n\nWait, so for x= 475, the current percent is 95, and the total is 575 /6 = 95.833, floor to 95. So equal. So added.\n\nSo 95 is in the set.\n\nSimilarly, for x= 476:\n\ncurrent is 476//5 = 95.2 → 95. total is 576 /6 = 96 → 96. So not equal.\n\nSo how do we get 96?\n\nLet me think for x= 480.\n\ncurrent is 480//5 = 96.\n\ntotal is 100+480 = 580. 580/6 = 96.666... → 96. So yes. So 96 is added.\n\nSimilarly for x= 481:\n\ncurrent is 481//5 = 96.2 → 96. total is 581/6 = 96.833... → 96. So equal. So added.\n\nx= 485: current is 97, total is 585/6 = 97.5 → 97. So added.\n\nSo for x from 480 to 485:\n\nAt x=480: 96, 580/6=96.666 → 96 → equal.\n\nAt x=481: 96, 581/6=96.833 → 96 → equal.\n\nAt x=482: same as above.\n\nAt x=483: same.\n\nAt x=484: same.\n\nAt x=485: current is 485//5=97, total is 585/6=97.5 → 97 → equal. So 97 is added.\n\nSimilarly for x= 490: current is 98, total is 590/6=98.333 → 98. So added.\n\nx=490:\n\ncurrent is 490//5=98.\n\ntotal is 590/6 = 98.333... → 98. So added.\n\nx=491: current 98.2 → 98. total 591/6=98.5 → 98. So added.\n\nSame for x=492, 493, 494: 592/6=98.666, floor 98. So added.\n\nAt x=495: current is 99, total is 595/6=99.166 → 99. So added.\n\nSo the values 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100 are added during the processing of the second file. And 0 is already in the set. Hence, the output includes 0, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100.\n\nSo the code would generate that.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python.\n\nPotential issues:\n\n- Handling large numbers? Probably not, since all variables are integers and manageable.\n\n- Edge cases where the same percentage is generated multiple times, but the set ensures uniqueness.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n, read a.\n\nCompute prefix_sums.\n\nInitialize the set with 0.\n\nProcess each byte.\n\nFinally, sort the set and print each element.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input:\n\nBut in Python, the input is read via input(). However, sometimes the input may have multiple lines. For example, the first line is n, then the second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo:\n\nn = int(input())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut need to ensure that the second line has exactly n numbers. However, the problem says that the input is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0]\nfor num in a:\n    prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)\nresult = {0}\nfor i in range(n):\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n            result.add(current_percent)\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n\nWait, but in the sample input 2, the output includes 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100. Let's see if this code would capture that.\n\nYes, as discussed.\n\nAnother test case: sample input 3:\n\nInput:\n\n4\n\n1000 2 2 998\n\nOutput is 0,50,99,100.\n\nLet me think why.\n\nThe total_sum is 1000 + 2 + 2 + 998 = 2002.\n\nLet me think about when both percentages are equal.\n\nFor example, during the first file (size 1000), when x is 1000, the current_percent is 100. total_bytes is 1000. total_percent is (100 * 1000) / 2002 = 49.95... → 49. So not equal. So during the first file, perhaps no p's except maybe when x is 1000, but not.\n\nBut during the",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine all the integer percentages between 0 and 100 (inclusive) that are simultaneously displayed on two progress bars during the file copying process. The first progress bar shows the percentage of the current file copied, while the second shows the percentage of the total data copied so far.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the number of files and their respective sizes.\n2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Compute the prefix sums of the file sizes to efficiently calculate the total bytes copied up to each file.\n3. **Progress Bar Simulation**: For each byte copied in each file, compute the current progress percentage and the total progress percentage. Check if these percentages are equal and collect such values.\n4. **Result Collection**: Ensure the initial 0% is included as a valid value and collect all valid percentages, then sort and print them.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn = int(input())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\ntotal_sum = sum(a)\nprefix_sums = [0]\nfor num in a:\n    prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)\nresult = {0}\nfor i in range(n):\n    current_file_size = a[i]\n    sum_prev = prefix_sums[i]\n    for x in range(1, current_file_size + 1):\n        current_percent = (100 * x) // current_file_size\n        total_bytes = sum_prev + x\n        total_percent = (100 * total_bytes) // total_sum\n        if current_percent == total_percent:\n            result.add(current_percent)\nsorted_result = sorted(result)\nfor num in sorted_result:\n    print(num)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of files and their sizes. These values are read and stored in a list.\n2. **Prefix Sums Calculation**: This helps in quickly determining the cumulative size of files up to any given point, which is essential for calculating the total progress percentage efficiently.\n3. **Simulating Byte Copying**: For each byte copied in each file, we compute both the current progress percentage (relative to the current file) and the total progress percentage (relative to all files combined). If both percentages match, the value is added to a set to ensure uniqueness.\n4. **Initial Zero Handling**: The initial state where both progress bars show 0% is explicitly included in the result set.\n5. **Sorting and Output**: The collected percentages are sorted and printed in ascending order.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently check each possible moment during the file copying process, leveraging prefix sums for quick calculations and a set to avoid duplicate entries. The complexity is linear with respect to the total number of bytes, making it feasible even for the upper constraint limits.",
