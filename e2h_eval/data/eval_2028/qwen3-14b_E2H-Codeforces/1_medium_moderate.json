The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the first is the edge, then next is two cells away, etc. Each ring is the border of a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), where i is the ring number. Wait, for the i-th ring. So for each ring, we need to calculate the perimeter of that rectangle and sum them all up.\n\nWait, but how do you calculate the number of cells in a rectangular border? For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter (the number of cells in the border) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because each side contributes W or H cells, but subtracting the corners which are counted twice. Like, for example, a rectangle of 3x3, the perimeter is 3*2 + 3*2 - 4 (the corners) = 8. Which matches the first example input where 3x3 with 1 ring gives 8 cells.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). But wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the border of the inner rectangle of that size. So for each ring, the dimensions are (current width) and (current height). But for each ring, the current width and height decrease by 4*(i-1) each time. Wait, for the first ring, i=1, so it's w and h. Then for the second ring, i=2, it's w - 4*(1) and h - 4*(1). Because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so for each ring, the next rectangle is 4 less in both dimensions. So yes, for each ring i, the dimensions are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)).\n\nBut wait, for the second ring, the rectangle is 2 cells away from the edge. So the original plate is w x h. The first ring is the outermost, then the next is 2 cells in, which would require that the rectangle for the second ring is (w - 4*(2-1)) = w-4, and same for h. So yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the approach is to loop from i=1 to k, compute for each i the perimeter of the rectangle with width w_i = w - 4*(i-1), height h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, there's a catch. For each i, the rectangle must have at least 1 cell in each dimension. Otherwise, if the dimensions become zero or negative, but since the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ), then for each i up to k, the dimensions should be valid. Let me think: for example, min(w, h) is say m. Then the maximum k is floor( (m +1)/4 ). Let's see for i= k, then 4*(k-1) must be less than m. Because for the i-th ring, the dimensions are w - 4*(i-1) and h - 4*(i-1). Since k is chosen such that for i=k, 4*(k-1) <= m - 1. Because for example, if m is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. For i=1, 4*(0) = 0, so dimensions are 3-0 =3, which is okay. If m is 5, then (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can be 1. For i=1, 5-0=5. If k was allowed to be 2, then for i=2, 4*(1) =4. 5-4=1. Which is okay. So the input constraints ensure that for each i up to k, the dimensions are at least 1. So no need to check for that.\n\nSo the formula for each ring is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2), where w_i = w - 4*(i-1), h_i = h - 4*(i-1). So the total is sum over i=1 to k of 2*( (w - 4*(i-1)) + (h - 4*(i-1)) - 2 )\n\nSimplify that expression:\n\nEach term is 2*( (w + h - 4*(i-1)*2 ) - 2 )\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n(w - 4*(i-1)) + (h - 4*(i-1)) = w + h - 8*(i-1). Then subtract 2, so total is w + h - 8*(i-1) - 2. Multiply by 2: 2*(w + h - 2 - 8*(i-1)).\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a way to compute the sum without looping, but perhaps it's easier to loop through each ring and compute the perimeter.\n\nSo for each i from 1 to k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h - 2)\n\nsum += perimeter\n\nSo for example, the first sample input is 3 3 1. So i=1:\n\ncurrent_w = 3, current_h =3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSecond example input is 7 9 1. So current_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28. Which matches the second output.\n\nThird example is 7 9 2. For i=1, perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 28. For i=2, current_w is 7-4*(1) =3, current_h is 9-4*(1)=5. So perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*6=12. Total sum is 28+12=40. Which matches the third example.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read w, h, k from input. Then loop from 1 to k, compute for each i the perimeter and sum them.\n\nSo in Python, the code could be:\n\nRead the input line as three integers. Then initialize total = 0. For each i in 1..k:\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\ntotal += perimeter\n\nThen print total.\n\nBut wait, what about when i=1, the first ring. For example, if the original w and h are 3 and 3, then current_w and current_h are 3, which is correct.\n\nSo this seems straightforward.\n\nLet me test the third example:\n\nSample input 7 9 2:\n\ni=1: 7,9. perimeter is 2*(7+9-2) = 2*(14) = 28.\n\ni=2: 7-4*(1) =3, 9-4*(1)=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5-2) = 2*(6) =12. Total is 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: let's take w=5, h=5, k=2. What is the sum?\n\nFor i=1: 5,5. perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. For i=2: 5-4=1, 5-4=1. perimeter is 2*(1+1-2) = 2*(0) =0? Wait, but that would sum to 16+0=16. But that's not possible. Wait, but according to the problem statement, the input constraints for k are such that k is up to floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). For w=5, h=5, min is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So in that case, the input would not allow k=2. So the code is safe.\n\nSo for the code, the input constraints ensure that for each i up to k, current_w and current_h are at least 1. So the code can proceed safely.\n\nAnother example: let's take w=7, h=7, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(7+7-2) = 2*12=24. So output is 24. If k=2, then for i=2, current_w =7-4*(1) =3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 8. So total is 24+8=32.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nThus, the Python code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k. Then compute the sum as described.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input from stdin. For example, the input could be read via input().split().\n\nBut the input is given as three integers. So:\n\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\n\nThen initialize total = 0.\n\nLoop for i in range(1, k+1):\n\ncurrent_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\ncurrent_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\nperimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n\ntotal += perimeter\n\nPrint(total)\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input: 3 3 1 → 8. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: 7 9 1 → 2*(7+9-2) = 2*14=28. Correct.\n\nThird sample input: 7 9 2 → 28 + 2*(3+5-2) = 28 + 12 =40. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for the samples.\n\nWhat about when k is zero? Well, the constraints say that k is at least 1. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother test case: let's say w=5, h=5, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(5+5-2) = 16. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: w=4, h=4, k=1. Then perimeter is 2*(4+4-2) = 2*6=12. But according to the input constraints, k is floor( (min(w,h)+1)/4 ). For min(w,h)=4, (4+1)/4=1.25 → floor is 1. So k=1 is allowed. So code works.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n",
