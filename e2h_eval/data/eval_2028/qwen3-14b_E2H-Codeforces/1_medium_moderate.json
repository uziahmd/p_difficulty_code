    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the task is to calculate the number of cells that are gilded when adding k rings around the plate. Each ring is placed such that the first is the edge, the second is two cells in, etc. Each ring is one cell thick. \n\nLet me think about how each ring contributes to the total. For the i-th ring (starting from 1), the ring is around a rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). Wait, but how do we calculate the perimeter of that rectangle? Because the ring is the border of that rectangle. Oh right, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) - 4. Because each side is counted once. Wait, for example, a rectangle of width w and height h, the perimeter in cells would be 2*(w + h) - 4. Because each corner is counted twice if you just do 2*(w + h). Wait, no. Let me think again. For example, a 3x3 rectangle. The perimeter cells are the outermost layer. How many cells? Well, 3*4 - 4 = 8. Which matches the first example input where output is 8. So yes, the formula for the perimeter is 2*(w + h) - 4. \n\nSo for each ring i, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w', h'), where w' = w - 4*(i-1) and h' = h - 4*(i-1). But wait, for each ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1))? Let me check the example. \n\nTake the first example input: 3 3 1. So for i=1, the rectangle is 3x3. The perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 8, which matches the output. \n\nAnother example: the third input is 7 9 2. Let's see. For the first ring, i=1: w'=7, h'=9. Perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 2*16 -4 = 28. Then for the second ring, i=2: w' = 7 - 4*(1) = 3, h' =9 -4*(1) =5. The perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12? Wait, but the output for that case is 40. Let me check the sum: 28 + 12 = 40. Yes, that's correct. So the total is the sum of perimeters for each ring from 1 to k.\n\nSo the approach is: for each ring from 1 to k, compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), then sum all those perimeters.\n\nBut wait, we need to make sure that for each i, the rectangle is valid. For example, when i increases, the dimensions must be at least 3? Or maybe the problem ensures that k is chosen such that the rings are possible. Because the input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) +1)/4 ). Let me think: for example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense. For each ring, the dimensions must be at least 3? Well, the formula for the rectangle for the i-th ring is (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). For that to be valid, we need that both dimensions are >= 3. Because for example, if i is such that w -4*(i-1) is less than 3, then that ring can't exist. But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. So the problem says that the input is valid. So we don't have to check for that.\n\nSo the plan is: loop from i=1 to k, for each i, compute the perimeter of the rectangle with width w' = w - 4*(i-1), height h' = h -4*(i-1). Then add all those perimeters.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead w, h, k.\n\ntotal = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2*(current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, let's test this against the examples.\n\nFirst example input: 3 3 1. \n\ni=1: current_w=3, current_h=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3) -4 = 12-4=8. Correct.\n\nSecond example input: 7 9 1. \n\ncurrent_w=7, current_h=9. perimeter is 2*(7+9) -4 = 32-4=28. Which matches the output.\n\nThird example input: 7 9 2. \n\ni=1: perimeter 28. i=2: current_w=7-4*(1)=3, current_h=9-4*(1)=5. perimeter is 2*(3+5) -4 = 16-4=12. Total 28+12=40. Correct.\n\nSo that seems to work.\n\nBut wait, what if the current_w or current_h becomes less than 3? For example, if i is such that w-4*(i-1) is 2. But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's allowed. So the problem says that k is <= floor( (min(w, h)+1)/4 ). Let's see: for example, if min(w, h) is 5. Then (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can be 1. For i=1, the dimensions are 5-0=5, and 5-0=5. So for i=1, the perimeter is 2*(5+5) -4 = 16. If k was 2, then the min(w, h) is 5, and 5-4*(2-1) = 5-4=1. Which would be less than 3. But the input constraints prevent that. So the code can safely assume that for all i up to k, the current_w and current_h are >=3. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, let's code it.\n\nRead the input as three integers. Then loop from 1 to k, compute each perimeter and sum.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line as w, h, k. Split into integers.\n\nThen total = 0\n\nfor i in range(1, k+1):\n\n    current_w = w - 4*(i-1)\n\n    current_h = h - 4*(i-1)\n\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) -4\n\n    total += perimeter\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. Let me test another example. Suppose input is 5 5 2. What would be the output?\n\nFor i=1: current_w=5, current_h=5. perimeter is 2*(5+5)-4= 20-4=16.\n\ni=2: current_w=5-4=1, current_h=5-4=1. Wait, but that's 1x1. Which is invalid. But according to the input constraints, k can't be 2 here. Because min(w, h) is 5. (5+1)/4 is 1.5, floor is 1. So k can't be 2. So the code will not be called with such input.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nAnother example: let's take w=7, h=7, k=2. Then:\n\ni=1: 7x7. perimeter 2*(7+7) -4 = 28-4=24?\n\nWait 2*(7+7) is 28. minus 4 is 24. Then for i=2: 7-4=3, 7-4=3. perimeter is 2*(3+3)-4= 12-4=8. Total is 24+8=32. \n\nYes. So that would be the output.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells that will be gilded when adding `k` rings around a rectangular plate. Each ring is placed such that the first ring is along the edge of the plate, the second ring is two cells away from the edge, and so on. Each ring has a width of 1 cell.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Rings**: Each ring forms a border around a rectangle. The first ring is around the entire plate, the second ring is around a smaller rectangle inside the first ring, and so on. The dimensions of each subsequent rectangle decrease by 4 units in both width and height (2 units from each side) for each ring.\n2. **Perimeter Calculation**: For each ring, the number of gilded cells is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle it borders. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` is given by `2 * (w + h) - 4`, which accounts for the four corners being counted twice if we simply sum all sides.\n3. **Summing Perimeters**: We calculate the perimeter for each of the `k` rings and sum them up to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of three integers: `w` (width of the plate), `h` (height of the plate), and `k` (number of rings).\n2. **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the effective width and height of the rectangle that the ring borders. This is done by subtracting `4 * (i - 1)` from both the width and height of the original plate, where `i` is the current ring index.\n3. **Calculate Perimeter**: For each ring, compute the perimeter using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h) - 4`.\n4. **Sum Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by leveraging the properties of rectangles and their perimeters, ensuring correctness and optimal performance within the given constraints.",
