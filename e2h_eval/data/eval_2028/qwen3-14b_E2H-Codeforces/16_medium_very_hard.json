Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, moving through adjacent blocks. The adjacency here is defined by sharing a common border of non-zero length. So, the problem is essentially about finding the shortest path between two regions divided by lines.\n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacencies. But how can I represent each block? Since there are infinite regions, it's impossible to list them all. However, the key insight here is that the movement between blocks is determined by crossing roads. Each road divides the plane into two halves. The blocks can be represented by their position relative to each road.\n\nWait, but how do I determine if two blocks are adjacent? For two blocks to be adjacent, they must share a common boundary, which means that there's at least one road that separates them. But maybe the adjacency is determined by being on opposite sides of a single road. Wait, no. Because if two regions are separated by a single line, then they are adjacent. So, moving from one to another requires crossing that line. So, perhaps the adjacency between blocks can be modeled based on the roads that separate them.\n\nBut how to model the blocks? Well, each block can be uniquely identified by the sign of its position relative to each road. For example, for each road, a point is either on one side or the other. So, the combination of these signs (for all roads) defines the block. However, since there are n roads, each with two possible positions, there are 2^n possible combinations. But that's way too big for n=300. So that approach is not feasible.\n\nBut wait, the problem requires moving between blocks that are adjacent. So, perhaps we can model the problem as a graph where each node represents a block, and edges exist between adjacent blocks. But again, with n=300, the number of nodes is 2^300, which is impossible to handle directly.\n\nSo, there must be a smarter way. Let me think again. Since the movement is allowed between blocks that share a common border, which implies that there's a road that separates them. Therefore, two blocks are adjacent if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Because crossing that road would take you from one block to another. Wait, but maybe not. Because two roads can intersect, creating multiple regions. But for the adjacency condition, if two blocks share a common border, then there exists a road that is their common boundary. So, the two blocks are on opposite sides of that road. Therefore, the difference between their sign configurations is exactly one road's sign.\n\nBut how can I model this? Let's think of each block as a set of signs for each road. For example, for each road i, the sign is +1 or -1, depending on which side of the road the point is. Then, two blocks are adjacent if their sign vectors differ in exactly one road. Because that road is the one that separates them.\n\nBut how can I compute the minimal steps between the home and university blocks?\n\nThe problem reduces to finding the minimal number of sign changes required to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector, where each step allows flipping exactly one sign (since each step corresponds to crossing a road). However, this seems like a BFS problem where each state is a sign vector, and edges connect states differing in one sign. But with n up to 300, the number of possible states is 2^300, which is impossible to handle directly.\n\nThis suggests that there's a different approach. Maybe the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the home and university's sign vectors. Because each step flips one bit. But that's only true if the Hamming distance is the minimal steps. However, the Hamming distance is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. Because each such road would require crossing once. But wait, maybe not. For example, if two regions are separated by multiple roads, but there's a path that crosses each road once. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a block. The edges are between blocks that are adjacent. The minimal steps between home and university is the minimal number of edges in the path between the two nodes.\n\nBut again, the problem is how to represent the nodes. However, maybe the minimal steps is equal to the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road must be crossed once. But that's not necessarily true. For example, suppose there are two roads that cross each other. The home is in a region that is on one side of both roads. The university is on the opposite side of both roads. Then, the minimal steps would be 2: cross first road, then second. But the Hamming distance is 2. So in this case, the steps equals the Hamming distance.\n\nAnother example: suppose the home and university are separated by k roads. Then, the minimal steps is k. Because each step crosses one road. But what if some roads are redundant? Like, if the home and university are on opposite sides of a single road, but there's another road that also separates them. But perhaps that's not possible. Wait, no. Because if two roads are parallel, then being on opposite sides of one road implies being on opposite sides of the other? No. For example, two parallel roads. Suppose home is on one side of the first road, and the university is on the other side of the second road. But the home and university could be on the same side of the other road.\n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each such road must be crossed once. But how to compute this?\n\nLet me think: for each road, check whether the home and university are on opposite sides. If so, then that road is a separator. The minimal number of steps is the number of such roads. But why?\n\nBecause, each time you cross a road, you can flip the sign for that road. So, if you have to flip k bits (roads where home and university differ), then the minimal steps is k. Because each step can flip one bit. But is there a scenario where you can reach the target with fewer steps?\n\nNo. Because each step can only flip one bit. So, the minimal number of steps is the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. Because each step changes exactly one bit. Therefore, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate home and university.\n\nWait, but that would make the problem very simple. Let me check the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1)\nRoads: 2 roads. First is 0x+1y+0=0 → y=0. Second is 1x+0y+0=0 → x=0.\n\nHome (1,1) is above y=0 (since 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1>0?), wait, the equation is a_i x + b_i y + c_i =0. So, for a point (x,y), the value is s_i = a_i x + b_i y + c_i. The sign of s_i determines which side of the road the point is on. So for the first road, y=0. For home (1,1), the value is 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 >0. For the university (-1,-1), the value is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. So this road separates them. Similarly for the second road x=0. Home is x=1>0, university x=-1<0. So both roads separate them. So the Hamming distance is 2. The sample output is 2. Which matches.\n\nSample Input 2:\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1)\nRoads: 3 roads. First is x=0, second is y=0, third is x + y -3 =0. Let's see:\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nCheck each road:\n\nRoad 1: 1*1 + 0*1 + 0 = 1>0. So sign is positive.\n\nRoad 2: 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1>0. Sign positive.\n\nRoad 3: 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 2-3 = -1 <0. So sign negative.\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: 1*(-1) +0 +0 = -1 <0. Sign negative.\n\nRoad 2: 0 + 1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. Sign negative.\n\nRoad 3: (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5 <0. Same as home. So for road 3, same sign. So the Hamming distance is 2 (road 1 and road 2). So sample output is 2. Which matches.\n\nSo the sample outputs match the Hamming distance between the home and university's sign vectors. So perhaps the answer is simply the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nBut why is that correct? Because each such road must be crossed once. And since each step can cross exactly one road, the minimal steps is the number of roads separating them.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where two roads are crossed in a way that allows fewer steps? For example, suppose two roads cross each other. Suppose the home is in a region that is separated from the university by two roads, but there's a path that crosses both roads once, but in two steps. Which is the same as the Hamming distance. So the Hamming distance is indeed the minimal steps.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting how many roads have the home and university on opposite sides.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nFor each road, compute the sign of the home point (s1) and the sign of the university point (s2). If s1 * s2 <0, then the road separates them. So count that.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\n- For each road, compute s1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i.\n\n- Compute s2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i.\n\n- If s1 * s2 < 0, then increment the count.\n\nThe answer is this count.\n\nBut wait, why does this work?\n\nBecause each road that separates the home and university must be crossed once. And the minimal steps is the number of such roads.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because each step allows you to cross one road. So if you have to cross k roads, then you need at least k steps. And since each step can cross exactly one road, you can do it in exactly k steps. Hence, the minimal steps is k.\n\nBut how to confirm that this is correct?\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose there are three roads. Home and university are separated by two roads. But those two roads are parallel. So the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. So, the minimal steps would be 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are two roads that cross. Home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. Then, the minimal steps is 2. Because you have to cross each road once. But perhaps there's a way to cross both roads in one step? No, because each step can only cross one road. So yes, the answer is 2.\n\nAnother example: suppose there are two roads that cross. The home is in a region that is separated by one road, and the university is separated by the same road. Then, the answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo this approach seems correct.\n\nBut why does the problem mention that the movement is allowed only if the blocks share a common border of non-zero length? Because if two blocks are separated by a single road, then they are adjacent. But if two blocks are separated by two roads, but there's a path through other roads, but that's not possible. Because each step can only cross one road.\n\nWait, but the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So, the initial and final blocks are valid.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to count the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. For each road, compute the value for home and for university. If their product is negative, increment the count.\n\nBut let's check the sample input again.\n\nSample 1: two roads. Both separate home and university. So count is 2. Output is 2.\n\nSample 2: three roads. The third road has same sign for both points. So count is 2. Output is 2.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code is as simple as that. But why is the problem considered hard? Because perhaps there's a misunderstanding. Maybe the problem is more complex than that. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is nonzero. So, two blocks are adjacent if they share a common border. But how to ensure that the two blocks are separated by exactly one road. Because if two blocks are separated by more than one road, but there's a way to cross them via some path. But according to the earlier reasoning, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nBut perhaps there's a case where two blocks are separated by multiple roads, but there's a way to cross them in fewer steps. For example, imagine three roads arranged in a triangle. Suppose the home is in one region and the university is in the opposite region. How many roads separate them? All three roads. But perhaps there's a way to cross two roads to get there, but according to the earlier reasoning, the answer would be 3. But that's not possible. Let me think.\n\nWait, each road is a line. The home and university are in regions that are separated by three roads. For example, imagine three lines forming a triangle. The home is inside the triangle, and the university is outside. Then, the home and university are separated by all three roads. So, according to the approach, the answer would be 3. But to get from inside to outside, you need to cross one road. So why is that?\n\nAh, here's a contradiction. So my previous reasoning is wrong. Because in this case, the home and university are separated by three roads, but the minimal steps is 1. So the approach of counting the number of roads that separate them is incorrect.\n\nWhat's wrong here?\n\nLet me think again. How to determine whether a road separates the home and university. For that, the sign of the home and university must be different. But in this case, if the home is inside the triangle, and the university is outside, then for each of the three roads, the home and university are on opposite sides. So the count would be 3. But the minimal steps is 1, because you can cross any of the three roads once to get to the outside.\n\nSo according to the previous approach, the answer would be 3, but the correct answer is 1. Which shows that the approach is wrong.\n\nSo what's wrong with the previous reasoning?\n\nAh, the mistake was in assuming that the minimal steps is the Hamming distance. But in reality, the Hamming distance is the number of roads that separate the home and university. However, the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed to reach the university. But the problem is that crossing a single road may change the sign of multiple roads. Wait, no. Each road is a line. Crossing a road changes the sign for that particular road. But the other roads' signs are not affected. So, when you cross a road, you flip the sign for that road. So, the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads that need to be flipped to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector. However, the Hamming distance is the number of roads where the signs differ. But in the example above, the Hamming distance is 3, but the minimal steps is 1. Which contradicts that idea.\n\nWait, but in this example, the home's sign vector is (positive for all three roads?), or negative? Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose three lines: x=0, y=0, x+y=0. These three lines form a triangle. Let's say the home is at (1,1), which is in the region where x>0, y>0, x+y>0. The university is at (-1,-1), which is x<0, y<0, x+y <0. So for each road, the signs are opposite. So the Hamming distance is 3. But the minimal steps is 1. Because you can cross any of the three roads once. So after crossing one road, you are in a region that is on the opposite side of that road, but same side for the others. But then, how does that get you to the university?\n\nWait, no. Because the university is on the opposite side of all three roads. So if you cross one road, you are now in a region that is on the opposite side of that road, but same side for the other two. But the university is on the opposite side of all three roads. So you need to cross the other two roads as well. Therefore, the minimal steps is 3. But that contradicts my initial thought. So perhaps my initial example was wrong.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose the home is in a region that is on the same side of all roads as the university except for one road. Then, the minimal steps is 1. But if the home and university are on opposite sides of all roads, then the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate them. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university. Because each step can only cross one road, and each road that separates them must be crossed once.\n\nIn the example where the home and university are on opposite sides of all three roads, then the minimal steps is 3. Because each road must be crossed once. But how can you cross all three roads? Because after crossing one, you are in a new region. Then, crossing another road, etc. But perhaps that's the case.\n\nBut how can you get from home to university by crossing three roads. Let me take the example of three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y=0. Home is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). The minimal steps would be 3? Or can you find a path that crosses each road once?\n\nBut perhaps there's a path that crosses each of the three roads once, leading to the university. So the answer would be 3 steps.\n\nBut how can that be? Because each step is moving from one block to another. So, the first step crosses one road (say, x=0), moving to the region x<0, but y>0, x+y>0. Then, the next step crosses the y=0 road, moving to x<0, y<0, x+y>0. Then, the next step crosses the x+y=0 road, moving to x<0, y<0, x+y<0. Which is the university's region. So three steps. So the answer is indeed 3. Which matches the Hamming distance approach.\n\nSo my earlier thought that it could be done in one step was wrong. Because the university is on the opposite side of all three roads. So, you need to cross all three roads.\n\nSo the Hamming distance approach seems correct.\n\nAnother example: suppose two roads that cross. The home is in one region, and the university is in the opposite region across both roads. Then, the Hamming distance is 2. So the minimal steps is 2.\n\nBut how? Let me imagine two perpendicular roads, x=0 and y=0. The home is (1,1), the university is (-1,-1). To get there, you need to cross x=0, then y=0, or vice versa. Two steps. Which is correct.\n\nSo the approach is correct.\n\nSo the conclusion is that the answer is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nThus, the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the home coordinates (x1, y1), the university coordinates (x2, y2), then read n roads. For each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). If their product is negative, increment the count. Output the count.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So, the values for home and university for each road are non-zero. So, the product can't be zero.\n\nThus, the code can be implemented easily.\n\nLet me test the first sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). Roads:\n\n0 1 0 → equation 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0. For home: 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. For university: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1. Product is -1*1 = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1 0 0 → x=0. For home: 1*1 +0 +0 =1. For university: 1*(-1) +0 +0 =-1. Product is -1 → count +=1. Total count is 2. Output 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads:\n\nRoad 1: 1 0 0 → x=0. For home, 1*1 +0 +0=1. For univ, 1*(-1) = -1. Product negative. Count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: 0 1 0 → y=0. Same as before. Count +=1.\n\nRoad 3: 1 1 -3 → equation x + y -3 =0. For home (1,1): 1+1-3 =-1. For univ (-1,-1): -1 + (-1) -3 =-5. Product is (-1)*(-5)=5>0. So no increment. Total count is 2. Output 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: home (1,1), university (2,2). No roads. Then the answer is 0 steps. Because they are in the same block.\n\nIf there is a road that separates them, then count is 1.\n\nSo this approach seems to work.\n\nNow, code-wise, the problem is straightforward. Read the two points, read n roads, for each road compute the value for home and for university, check if their product is negative. Count the number of such roads.\n\nSo the Python code can be written as:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each of n lines:\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nWait, but why is that correct? Because each road that separates the two points must be crossed once. And the minimal steps is the number of such roads. But how can we be sure that there's no shorter path?\n\nBut according to the earlier examples, this seems to hold. So why is this problem considered hard? Maybe there's a misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is non-zero. So, two blocks are adjacent if they share a common border. So, for two blocks to be adjacent, there must be a road that separates them. So, the movement between blocks is possible if they differ in exactly one road's sign. Thus, the problem becomes a graph where each node is a block, and edges connect nodes that differ in exactly one sign. The minimal steps between the home and university blocks is the minimal number of sign changes required to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector.\n\nBut this is equivalent to the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors, since each step can flip exactly one bit. Thus, the minimal steps is the Hamming distance. Which is exactly the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is as simple as that. So why is the problem considered hard? Maybe because the initial intuition is to model it as a BFS on the blocks, which is impossible due to the size. But the actual solution is much simpler.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. Now, implement it in Python.\n\nBut let's check the sample input again. The first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWhich gives output 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n2 2\n\n0\n\nOutput: 0.\n\nAnother test case:\n\nHome (1,1), university (1, -1). One road: 0 1 0 → y=0. For home: 1*0 + 1*1 +0 = 1? Wait, no. The road equation is a_i x + b_i y + c_i =0. So for the road 0x +1y +0=0 → y=0. For home (1,1): 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. For university (1,-1): 0*1 +1*(-1) +0 =-1. So product is negative. Count is 1. So answer is 1. Which is correct, since you need to cross that road once.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code is correct. So the Python code can be written as:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount =0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 <0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the home and university are in the same block? For example, when there are no roads, or when all roads do not separate them. Then the answer is zero steps.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this code should pass all test cases. But why the problem's sample input has two examples with outputs 2 and 2. Which the code handles correctly.\n\nSo this is the solution.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads. Each step involves moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each road divides the plane into two regions. If a road separates the home and the university, it must be crossed to move from one block to another. The minimum number of steps required is equivalent to the number of roads that separate the home and the university. This is determined by checking the sign of the values obtained by substituting the coordinates of the home and university into each road's equation. If the signs differ for a road, it means the road separates the two points.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    x1 = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    y1 = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x2 = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    y2 = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        b = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        c = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input:** The input is read in one go and split into a list for easier processing.\n2. **Coordinates Extraction:** The coordinates of the home and university are extracted from the input.\n3. **Road Processing:** For each road, the coefficients are read, and the values of the home and university coordinates are substituted into the road's equation.\n4. **Sign Check:** For each road, if the signs of the computed values for the home and university coordinates are different (indicating the road separates them), the count is incremented.\n5. **Output Result:** The count of such separating roads is printed, which represents the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their signs, ensuring an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of roads.",
