Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road. It is guaranteed that no two roads are the same. In addition, neither your home nor the university lie on the road (i.e. they do not belong to any one of the lines).\n\n## Output\nOutput the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\n### Output\n['2', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about moving between blocks (regions) divided by roads (lines) in a plane. The goal is to find the minimum number of steps needed to get from the home block to the university block. Each step allows moving to an adjacent block that shares a common border of non-zero length.\n\nFirst, I need to model this as a graph problem. Each block is a node, and there's an edge between two nodes if their corresponding regions share a common border. Then, the problem reduces to finding the shortest path from the home's block to the university's block.\n\nBut how do I represent the blocks and determine adjacency? Since there are infinite regions, we can't enumerate all of them. So we need another approach.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For any point not on any road, the region it's in can be determined by the signs of the equations of the roads. Each road divides the plane into two halves. The position of a point relative to a line can be determined by evaluating the sign of ax + by + c. So for each line, the point is either on one side or the other. The combination of these signs for all lines defines the block.\n\nBut since there are n lines, there are 2^n possible combinations. However, many of these combinations may not be possible, but given that the home and university are not on any line, they must belong to exactly one of these combinations.\n\nBut with n up to 300, 2^300 is way too big to handle directly. So enumerating all possible regions isn't feasible. So we need a different approach.\n\nAlternative idea: Think about the problem as a graph where each node is a region, and edges exist between regions that share a common boundary. Then, the problem becomes finding the shortest path between two nodes. But again, how do we model the regions?\n\nAnother approach: The key observation here is that moving from one region to another requires crossing a line. Each such crossing changes the sign of exactly one equation. Because if you cross a line, you switch from one side to the other. However, if you cross two lines at once (like at an intersection point), then you might change signs of two equations. But for adjacency, the regions must share a common border, which implies that they differ by exactly one line's sign. Because if two regions share a common border, that border is part of exactly one line. Because if two lines intersect, their regions would be adjacent along that line. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose two lines cross each other. Each line divides the plane into two parts. The regions adjacent across a line would differ in exactly one sign (the line's equation). So, for two regions to be adjacent, their sign combinations must differ in exactly one line. Because crossing a single line would flip the sign of that line's equation. So, the adjacency is determined by whether two regions differ in exactly one line's sign.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to modeling the regions as nodes, where each node is a vector of signs (for each line, +1 or -1) and edges exist between nodes that differ in exactly one sign. However, even with this, the number of possible nodes is 2^n, which is way too big for n=300.\n\nBut wait, the home and university points are fixed. So perhaps the only regions we need to consider are those that are reachable via some path from the home region, and the university region. But how can we model that?\n\nAlternative approach: Instead of considering all regions, model the problem as a BFS where each state is the set of signs (but this is impossible for n=300). Therefore, this approach isn't feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: Think of each line as a hyperplane. The problem is similar to moving through hyperplanes, but again, how to model adjacency.\n\nWait, here's a trick. The parity of the number of lines that separate the home from the current region. Wait, no. Another thought: For each line, the home point has a certain sign. If we can find the minimal number of lines that need to be crossed to reach the university's region, that would be the answer. Because each step crosses one line (changing the sign of that line's equation), and the minimal steps is the minimal number of lines whose sign differs between home and university.\n\nWait, but that's not correct. Because the home and university could differ in k lines. But the minimal steps required would be k if they can be crossed in sequence. However, if the lines are arranged in a way that crossing them requires steps. For example, suppose the home and university differ in two lines. But those lines are parallel. Then, crossing one line would take you to a region that is adjacent to the home, but to reach the university, you have to cross the other line. But since the two lines are parallel, their regions are separated by multiple steps. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where each node is the set of lines' signs. But with n=300, that's impossible. However, the home and university are two specific points. So perhaps we can model the problem as a BFS where each state is the current set of signs (relative to the home's signs). But again, for n=300, that's impossible.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think about the problem differently. For each line, the home is on one side, and the university is on some side. Let's compute for each line whether the home and university are on the same side or opposite sides. Let's say that for line i, the home is on side S_i and the university is on side T_i. The difference between S_i and T_i is whether the line is crossed between the home and the university. Now, if the home and university are on opposite sides of a line, then that line must be crossed in any path from home to university. However, the minimal number of steps is the minimal number of lines that need to be crossed, but since each step can cross one line, the minimal steps is the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. Wait, but that seems too simplistic. Let's test with examples.\n\nTake the first sample input:\n\nHome is (1,1), University is (-1,-1). Roads are 0x +1y +0 = 0 (i.e., y=0) and 1x +0y +0=0 (x=0). So the home (1,1) is above y=0 (so +1) and right of x=0 (so +1). The university (-1,-1) is below y=0 (so -1) and left of x=0 (so -1). So for each line, the home and university are on opposite sides. So there are 2 lines where they differ. So according to the previous idea, the minimal steps would be 2, which matches the sample output. \n\nAnother sample input: the second example's output is 2. Let's see. The home is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). The roads are x=0, y=0, and x + y -3 =0. Let's check for each line:\n\nFor x=0: home is + (since x=1>0), university is - (x=-1 <0). So opposite.\n\nFor y=0: same as above.\n\nFor x + y -3 = 0. Let's compute for home (1+1-3) = -1 <0. For university (-1 + (-1) -3) = -5 <0. So same side. So the home and university differ in 2 lines. So steps is 2, which matches the sample. \n\nSo in these cases, the answer is the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. So maybe the answer is simply the count of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. But why?\n\nBecause each such line must be crossed once. And since each step can cross exactly one line, the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university. \n\nBut why is this the case? Let's think. Suppose that the home and university are separated by k lines. Then, each of these lines must be crossed once. But can you cross them in sequence? Because crossing one line may not affect the other lines. \n\nBut how can we be sure that there's a path that crosses each of these lines once, and no others? Because the regions are connected in such a way that you can cross each line once. \n\nBut what if two lines are parallel? For example, suppose there are two parallel lines. The home is on one side of both, and the university is on the other side of both. Then, the home and university are separated by two lines. But to get from home to university, you need to cross both lines, which would require two steps. Which matches the count. \n\nAnother example: suppose there are two lines that cross each other. The home is in a region that is on one side of both lines, and the university is on the opposite side of both. So, the minimal steps would be 2. \n\nBut what if the home and university are separated by k lines, but those lines are arranged such that crossing one line would require crossing another? For example, if you have two lines that cross each other. Suppose the home is in a region that is on the positive side of both lines. The university is on the negative side of both. How do you get there? You can cross one line first, then the other. So two steps. Which again matches the count. \n\nThis suggests that the minimal steps is indeed the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nSo the problem reduces to: For each line, check whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The answer is the count of such lines. \n\nBut why is this the case? Because each such line must be crossed once, and each crossing is a step. And since each step can cross exactly one line, the minimal steps is exactly the number of lines that separate the home and university. \n\nBut why can't there be a scenario where crossing a line that doesn't separate them is needed? For example, suppose that there are three lines. The home and university are on opposite sides of line 1 and line 2, but same side for line 3. But maybe there's a path that crosses line 1 and line 2, but also crosses line 3. But that would add an extra step, which would make the steps more than the count. However, the minimal steps would be the count of lines separating them. \n\nSo the key insight is that the minimal number of steps is equal to the number of lines that separate the home and the university. \n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute for each line, the sign of the home and the sign of the university. If they are different, increment the count. The answer is this count. \n\nBut wait! Let's think again. What if there are two lines that are not parallel, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both lines. Then, the minimal steps would be 2. But suppose that the two lines cross. So the home is in a region that is on one side of both lines. The university is on the opposite side of both. So, the path would require crossing both lines. \n\nBut how? Let's imagine the two lines cross. The home is in one quadrant, and the university is in the opposite quadrant. To get from home to university, you need to cross both lines. So two steps. Which matches the count. \n\nAnother example: suppose there are three lines, all passing through the same point. The home is in a region that is on one side of all three lines. The university is on the opposite side of all three. Then, the minimal steps is 3. \n\nBut how? Well, each step crosses one line. So you can cross each of the three lines once. \n\nThus, the conclusion is that the answer is the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nBut how to verify this? Let's look at the sample inputs. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Two lines: y=0 and x=0. \n\nFor line 1 (y=0): home's value is 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1>0. University is 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0. So opposite. \n\nFor line 2 (x=0): home is 1>0, university is -1<0. Opposite. So total of 2 steps. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSecond sample input: \n\nHome (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three lines: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. \n\nFor x=0: home is 1>0, university is -1 <0. Opposite. \n\nFor y=0: same as above. \n\nFor x+y-3=0: home is 1+1-3 = -1 <0. University is -1 + (-1) -3 = -5 <0. Same side. So count is 2. Which matches the sample output. \n\nSo the approach seems valid. \n\nBut why is that the case? Because each time you cross a line, you can change the sign for that line. So, if you need to change the sign for k lines, you need to cross each of them once. \n\nBut why can't there be a scenario where two lines are crossed in a way that requires fewer steps? For example, if two lines are parallel, and you need to cross both. But since they are parallel, you can cross them in sequence, requiring two steps. \n\nBut suppose that two lines are not parallel. Suppose that the home is in a region that is on the same side of both lines as the university. Then, the count is zero, and the answer is zero. \n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\nCompute for each line, the sign of home and the sign of university. If they are different, add 1 to the answer. \n\nBut how to compute the sign for a line? \n\nFor a line a_i x + b_i y + c_i = 0. \n\nThe value for the home (x1,y1) is val1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i. \n\nSimilarly, val2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. \n\nIf val1 and val2 have opposite signs (i.e., val1 * val2 < 0), then the home and university are on opposite sides of the line. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead x1, y1 and x2, y2. \n\nRead n lines. \n\ncount = 0 \n\nfor each line (a, b, c):\n\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c \n\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c \n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1 \n\nreturn count \n\nBut wait! What about when the line is such that the home and university are on opposite sides, but the line is not between them? For example, if the line is not in the path between them. But according to the problem statement, the movement is allowed through any adjacent regions. So, even if the line is not directly between them, but the home and university are on opposite sides of it, then the line must be crossed once. \n\nBut according to the earlier reasoning, the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate them. \n\nBut how can we be sure that this is correct? \n\nLet me think of a case where the home and university are on opposite sides of a line, but the line is not between them. For example, imagine a line that is far away. The home is on one side, and the university is on the other side. But to get from home to university, you need to cross that line. So the minimal steps would include crossing that line. \n\nBut how can you cross that line? Because the line divides the plane. So regardless of where the home and university are, if they are on opposite sides of a line, then any path between them must cross that line once. \n\nSo the minimal steps is the number of lines that separate the home and university. \n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of lines where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nThis is a very simple solution. Let me check if there's any possible mistake. \n\nWhat about when the home and university are on the same side of a line, but the line is between them? No, because if they are on the same side, the line does not separate them. \n\nBut how can that happen? For example, if the line is somewhere else. \n\nBut according to the formula, the product of val1 and val2 is positive. So the code counts only the lines where the product is negative. \n\nSo, the code is correct. \n\nTherefore, the Python code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the home coordinates, then the university coordinates, then n, then n lines. For each line, compute the value for home and university. Check if their product is negative. Count the number of such lines. Output the count. \n\nLet me test this against the sample inputs. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor first line (0,1,0): equation is 0x +1y +0 =0 → y=0. \n\nval1 = 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1. val2 = 0*(-1) + 1*(-1) +0 = -1. 1 * (-1) = -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line (1,0,0): x=0. val1 is 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1. val2 is 1*(-1) +0*(-1)+0 = -1. Product is -1 → count +=1. Total 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0 → x=0\n\n0 1 0 → y=0\n\n1 1 -3 → x + y -3 =0\n\nFor first line (x=0): val1 =1, val2=-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond line (y=0): same as above → count +=1.\n\nThird line: val1 is 1+1 -3 = -1. val2 is -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0 → no count. So total count is 2. Correct.\n\nSo the code works for samples. \n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nEdge case 1: n=0. But according to input constraints, n is at least 1. Wait, no. The third line says n is given as 1<=n<=300. Wait, the input says:\n\nThird line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So n is at least 1. So no case with n=0.\n\nAnother edge case: home and university are on opposite sides of all lines. Then answer is n.\n\nAnother case: home and university are on same side for all lines. Then answer is 0.\n\nAnother case: one line. Home and university are on opposite sides. Answer is 1.\n\nBut what if the line is such that home and university are on the same side? Then answer is 0.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n\nTherefore, the code is straightforward. Now, implement it in Python.\n\nRead input:\n\nThe input is read from stdin. The first line is x1, y1. Second line x2, y2. Third line is n. Then n lines of a, b, c.\n\nIn Python, read the input. For example, for the first sample input:\n\nThe first line is '1 1', then '-1 -1', then 2, then two lines.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2 from input.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each line:\n\ncompute val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c.\n\ncompute val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c.\n\nif val1 * val2 < 0: count +=1.\n\nAt end, print count.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So for all lines, val1 and val2 are not zero. So we don't have to worry about division by zero. So the code is safe.\n\nThus, this is the solution.\n\nSo the Python code can be written as:\n\nRead the first two lines, then n, then n lines. Then process as described.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead from stdin. For example, in Python:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count +=1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as per the problem. The example shows two test cases, but the actual input is for one test case. Wait, the sample input shows two examples, but in reality, the code should read one test case per run. Wait, the original problem says that the input is for one test case. The sample input shows two examples, but perhaps that's just for demonstration. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nBut that's probably the two test cases. However, the code needs to read from stdin, which for programming competition problems is typically one test case per run. But perhaps the user is providing multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is for one test case. So the code should read one test case.\n\nBut looking at the sample input, the first input is for the first test case, and the second is for the second. However, the code is supposed to process one test case. So the code is correct as written.\n\nThus, the code is correct. \n\nBut why does this work? Because the problem's answer is indeed the count of lines separating home and university. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a plane divided by infinite line roads. Each step allows moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border.\n\n### Approach\nThe key insight is that each line road divides the plane into two regions. The home and university blocks are located in different regions relative to these lines. The minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block is determined by counting how many lines separate these two points. If a line separates the home and university, it means that crossing this line is necessary to move between these blocks.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if val1 * val2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their respective coefficients.\n2. **Evaluating Line Separation**: For each line defined by the coefficients (a, b, c), we evaluate the position of the home and university points relative to the line. This is done by computing the value of the line equation at these points.\n3. **Counting Separating Lines**: If the product of the values computed for the home and university points with respect to a line is negative, it indicates that the points lie on opposite sides of the line. We count such lines as they represent necessary crossings between blocks.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the minimum steps required by leveraging the geometric properties of lines dividing the plane, ensuring an optimal solution with linear complexity relative to the number of lines.",
