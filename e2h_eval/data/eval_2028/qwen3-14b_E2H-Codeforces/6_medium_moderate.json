Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about finding two non-overlapping vouchers such that their durations add up exactly to x, and their total cost is minimized. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. Each voucher has li (departure day), ri (return day), and cost. The duration is ri - li + 1. We need two vouchers i and j where they don't overlap. The sum of their durations must be exactly x. And find the minimal sum of their costs.\n\nSo, how to approach this?\n\nConstraints are n up to 2e5. So O(n^2) approaches are out of the question. Need an efficient way, probably O(n log n) or O(n).\n\nLet me think about the steps needed:\n\n1. For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher that doesn't overlap with it, and the sum of durations is x.\n\nBut checking all pairs is too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: For each voucher, determine what duration it has. Suppose a voucher has duration d. Then we need another voucher with duration x - d. And the two vouchers must not overlap.\n\nSo, for each voucher, we can look for vouchers of duration (x - d), that end before the current voucher starts, or start after the current voucher ends.\n\nBut how to efficiently find the minimal cost for those vouchers?\n\nSo the plan could be:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers grouped by their duration. For example, a dictionary where key is duration, and value is a list of (li, ri, cost) sorted in some way.\n\nThen, for each voucher with duration d, check if there's a voucher with duration (x - d). If yes, then look for vouchers in that group that do not overlap with the current voucher.\n\nBut how to find the minimal cost among those?\n\nFor example, for a given voucher A (duration d), and looking for vouchers B of duration (x - d) that end before A's li, or start after A's ri.\n\nSo for each voucher A, we can check:\n\n- All vouchers B with duration (x - d) that end before A's li. The earliest possible B would be ones that end before A starts. So for these B's, the minimal cost is the minimum cost among all B's that end before A's li.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers B that start after A's ri. The minimal cost among those.\n\nIf we can find these minima quickly, then for each voucher A, we can compute the possible candidates and track the overall minimum.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each duration, being able to query the minimal cost of vouchers that end before a certain day, or start after a certain day.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nLet's think about for each duration k, we have a list of vouchers sorted by their end time (ri). Also, for each such list, we can precompute a prefix minimum array. So for any query \"what is the minimal cost of vouchers with duration k that end before day t\", we can binary search on the sorted end times to find the latest end time <= t, and then take the prefix min up to that index.\n\nSimilarly, for vouchers that start after a certain day. For that, perhaps we can sort the vouchers by their start time (li), and for each duration k, have a sorted list of start times, and a suffix min array. Then, for a given day t, find the first start time >= t, and take the suffix min from that index onwards.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Preprocess for each duration k, two structures:\n\n   a) A sorted list of end times (ri) along with their costs. Also, a prefix min array of costs. This allows us to quickly find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration k that end before a certain day.\n\n   b) A sorted list of start times (li) along with their costs. Also, a suffix min array. This allows us to find the minimal cost of vouchers with duration k that start after a certain day.\n\nOnce these structures are built, for each voucher A (with duration d), we can check if x - d is a valid duration. If so, then:\n\n- For vouchers B with duration (x - d), check if there are any that end before A's li. To do this, use the prefix min array for duration (x -d) with end times. Find the largest end time <= (A's li - 1). If such exists, get the min cost.\n\n- Also check if there are any that start after A's ri. For this, use the suffix min array for duration (x -d) with start times. Find the smallest start time >= (A's ri + 1). If exists, get the min cost.\n\nThen, for each voucher A, the minimal possible cost from these two possibilities (if any) is added to A's cost, and we keep track of the global minimum.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into groups by their duration. For each duration k, collect all vouchers.\n\n2. For each duration k, create two sorted lists:\n\n   a) Sorted by ri (end time). Along with a prefix min array. So for the list sorted by ri, the prefix min array will store the minimum cost up to each index. So when we want to find the minimal cost of vouchers with end time <= t, we can binary search the sorted ri list to find the rightmost element <= t. Then, the prefix min up to that index gives the minimal cost.\n\n   b) Sorted by li (start time). Along with a suffix min array. So for the sorted li list, the suffix min array at index i gives the minimum cost from i to end. So when we want to find the minimal cost of vouchers with start time >= t, we can binary search the sorted li list to find the leftmost element >= t. Then, the suffix min from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nBut how to handle the sorted lists and their corresponding min arrays?\n\nFor example, for the end times sorted list:\n\nSuppose for duration k, we have vouchers sorted by ri. Let's say the list is sorted_ri = [r1, r2, ..., rn], and the corresponding costs are [c1, c2, ..., cn]. Then, the prefix_min array would be prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], c_i). So for any index i in sorted_ri, the prefix_min[i] is the minimal cost among the first i+1 vouchers.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted li list, sorted_li = [l1, l2, ..., ln], and the suffix_min array is suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], c_i). So for any index i, the suffix_min[i] is the minimal cost from i to end.\n\nOnce these structures are built, for any voucher A, when looking for vouchers B of duration (x - d), we can perform the following steps:\n\nCase 1: B ends before A's li. So B's ri < A's li. So for the duration (x -d), we look into the sorted_ri list. Find the largest ri <= (A.li - 1). If such exists, the prefix_min up to that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nCase 2: B starts after A's ri. So B's li > A's ri. For the duration (x -d), look into the sorted_li list. Find the first li >= (A.ri + 1). If such exists, the suffix_min from that index gives the minimal cost.\n\nSo for each voucher A, we can check both cases and take the minimal possible.\n\nNow, the challenge is to build these data structures efficiently.\n\nBut how to handle the grouping? Let's think about code structure.\n\nIn Python, for each duration, we can have a dictionary mapping duration to two structures: one for sorted ri with prefix min, and another for sorted li with suffix min.\n\nBut how to handle that?\n\nLet me think of the code steps:\n\nFirst, group all vouchers by their duration. For example, using a defaultdict(list) where the key is the duration.\n\nThen, for each duration in the dictionary:\n\n   For the sorted_ri list:\n\n      Sort the list of vouchers by ri. Then, create a list of their ri's, and a prefix_min array. The prefix_min array can be built as follows:\n\n      prefix_min[0] = cost of first voucher.\n\n      for i in 1 to len(sorted_ri)-1:\n\n          prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_ri[i].cost)\n\n   Similarly for the sorted_li list:\n\n      Sort the vouchers by li. Then create a list of their li's, and a suffix_min array.\n\n      suffix_min[-1] = cost of last voucher.\n\n      for i in len(sorted_li)-2 downto 0:\n\n          suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_li[i].cost)\n\nBut wait, the sorted_ri list is sorted by ri, but we need to have the ri's in order. So for each voucher in the group, we can extract the ri and sort them. However, the actual vouchers are needed to get the cost for the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nWait, perhaps for each duration group, we can have:\n\nFor the sorted_ri list:\n\nWe sort all vouchers in the group by their ri. Then, create a list of their ri values (sorted_ri_list), and a list of their costs (sorted_ri_costs). Then, the prefix_min array is built from the sorted_ri_costs.\n\nSimilarly, for the sorted_li list: sort by li, then create sorted_li_list and sorted_li_costs, and build the suffix_min array.\n\nOnce these are built, for any query of \"find the minimal cost of vouchers in this group with ri <= t\", we can perform a binary search on the sorted_ri_list to find the largest ri <= t, and then take the prefix_min up to that index.\n\nSame for the other case.\n\nSo the code steps for preprocessing:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ngroups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor each voucher in input:\n    d = ri - li + 1\n    groups[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, for each duration k in groups:\n\n   process the list of vouchers for k.\n\nFor example:\n\nfor k in groups:\n\n    vouchers = groups[k]\n\n    # process for sorted_ri and prefix_min\n\n    sorted_by_ri = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])  # sort by ri\n\n    sorted_ri_list = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_ri]\n    sorted_ri_costs = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_ri]\n\n    # build prefix_min\n    prefix_min = [0]*len(sorted_ri_costs)\n    prefix_min[0] = sorted_ri_costs[0]\n    for i in range(1, len(sorted_ri_costs)):\n        prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], sorted_ri_costs[i])\n\n    # store this info in some structure, maybe a dictionary for each duration.\n\n    Similarly for sorted_by_li:\n\n    sorted_by_li = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n\n    sorted_li_list = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_li]\n    sorted_li_costs = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_li]\n\n    # build suffix_min\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_li_costs)\n    suffix_min[-1] = sorted_li_costs[-1]\n    for i in range(len(sorted_li_costs)-2, -1, -1):\n        suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], sorted_li_costs[i])\n\n    # store this info.\n\nBut how to store this? Maybe for each duration k, we have two entries: one for the sorted_ri and prefix_min, and one for sorted_li and suffix_min.\n\nSo, perhaps we can have two dictionaries:\n\nFor example:\n\nri_info = defaultdict( ... )\n\nBut in Python, perhaps for each duration, we can store:\n\n- For the sorted ri data: a tuple of (sorted_ri_list, prefix_min)\n\n- For the sorted li data: a tuple of (sorted_li_list, suffix_min)\n\nOnce that's done, during processing each voucher, we can do the following:\n\nFor each voucher A with duration d, check if (x -d) exists in the groups. If not, skip. Else:\n\n   target_duration = x -d\n\n   Now, check for vouchers of target_duration that end before A's li, or start after A's ri.\n\n   For the first case:\n\n   Use the ri_info for target_duration. The sorted_ri_list is sorted, and we can binary search for the maximum ri <= (A.li - 1). If found, get the prefix_min value.\n\n   For the second case:\n\n   Use the li_info for target_duration. The sorted_li_list is sorted, and we can binary search for the minimum li >= (A.ri + 1). If found, get the suffix_min value.\n\nSo, for each voucher A, we can check these two possibilities and take the minimum between them (if any) and add to A's cost, then track the global minimum.\n\nNow, the question is how to perform the binary searches.\n\nFor the first case (ri <= t):\n\nWe can use the bisect module in Python. For example, sorted_ri_list is sorted. We can use bisect_right to find the insertion point of t, then the index is insertion_point - 1. If insertion_point is 0, then no such element.\n\nFor example:\n\nt = A.li - 1\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ri_list, t) - 1\n\nif index >=0, then the minimal cost is prefix_min[index].\n\nSimilarly, for the second case (li >= t):\n\nsorted_li_list is sorted. We can use bisect_left to find the first element >= t. The index is the insertion point. If insertion point is within the list length, then the suffix_min from that index is the minimal cost.\n\nFor example:\n\nt = A.ri + 1\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_li_list, t)\n\nif index < len(sorted_li_list):\n\n   min_cost = suffix_min[index]\n\nElse, no such element.\n\nSo, putting this all together.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nRead the n vouchers, compute their durations.\n\nGroup them into the groups dictionary.\n\nThen preprocess the groups into the sorted_ri and sorted_li structures with prefix and suffix mins.\n\nThen, for each voucher in the original list, check if (x -d) exists in the groups.\n\nIf yes, then:\n\n   For the target_duration = x -d:\n\n      Check the first case (B ends before A's li):\n\n         Get the sorted_ri_list and prefix_min for target_duration.\n\n         t = A.li - 1\n\n         perform bisect_right on sorted_ri_list for t.\n\n         if index >=0:\n\n             candidate1 = prefix_min[index]\n\n         else:\n\n             candidate1 = infinity\n\n      Check the second case (B starts after A's ri):\n\n         Get the sorted_li_list and suffix_min for target_duration.\n\n         t = A.ri + 1\n\n         perform bisect_left on sorted_li_list for t.\n\n         if index < len(sorted_li_list):\n\n             candidate2 = suffix_min[index]\n\n         else:\n\n             candidate2 = infinity\n\n      current_min_candidate = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n\n      if current_min_candidate is not infinity:\n\n          total = current_min_candidate + A.cost\n\n          update the global minimum.\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, if the global minimum is found, output it, else -1.\n\nBut wait, there's a problem here. Because for each voucher A, we are considering pairs (A, B) where B is in the target_duration. However, when we process voucher A, we might have B being another voucher. However, since the same voucher can be considered in multiple ways (for example, voucher B may be part of multiple pairs), but since we are considering all possible pairs, this approach should cover all possibilities.\n\nBut what about when the target_duration is same as d? For example, x is even, and d is x/2. Then, we need to make sure that the two vouchers are different. But the code above would check for B's that are in the same group as A's duration. However, when we check for B's that end before A's li or start after A's ri, then even if B is the same voucher as A, it would not be considered because the two vouchers must be different. Wait, but in the problem statement, i and j must be different.\n\nSo, in this case, when target_duration is same as d, and we have a voucher B which is the same as A, but in the group, how do we ensure that B is not the same voucher as A?\n\nAh, that's a problem. Because, for example, if a voucher A has duration d, and x -d is d, then the code would look for vouchers B with duration d that are non-overlapping. However, if B is the same voucher as A, then it's invalid (since i and j must be different).\n\nSo, how to handle that?\n\nThis is a critical point. Because when we process voucher A, and the target_duration is same as d, the code might find a B which is the same voucher as A. But that's invalid.\n\nSo, for example, if the voucher A is in the group of target_duration (x -d =d), and during the processing of A, the code checks for B's in that group. However, if the B is the same voucher as A, then the pair (A, B) is invalid.\n\nSo, how to avoid this?\n\nWell, during the processing of voucher A, when looking for B's in the target_duration group, we need to ensure that B is not the same voucher as A. However, how can we do that?\n\nOne approach is to check if the voucher B is the same as A. However, since the same voucher can appear multiple times in the group (if there are multiple vouchers with same li, ri, cost), but in general, the code needs to ensure that B is a different voucher.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternative idea: when building the groups, for each voucher, when processing it, when looking for B's in the target_duration group, we need to check if the B is not the same as A. However, how can we do that?\n\nBut this seems complicated. Because for example, if the target_duration group is same as the current voucher's duration, then during the processing of A, when looking for B's in that group, the code may find B's that are the same as A. So how to avoid that?\n\nBut how often does this happen? Well, if there are multiple vouchers with the same li, ri, cost, then the code may find B's that are same as A, but the code would have to make sure that at least one other voucher exists in the group.\n\nBut perhaps the way to handle this is that when we process the voucher A, and the target_duration is same as d, then during the binary search steps, the code may include the voucher A itself. So we need to exclude it.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nThis seems tricky. Let's think of an example.\n\nSuppose voucher A has li=1, ri=3, duration 3. Suppose x is 6. So target_duration is 3. So during processing voucher A, we check for B's in the same group. Now, if there are other vouchers in the group, then the code will find them. However, if the code finds voucher A itself, then we need to make sure that it is not considered.\n\nBut how can we know whether the B found in the group is the same as A?\n\nThis seems complicated. Because the data structures for the groups are built with all vouchers in the group, including A. So during the processing of A, when looking for B's in the group, the code may pick A itself if it satisfies the condition (i.e., ends before A's li or starts after A's ri). But since A's ri is 3, and A's li is 1, then for B to end before A's li (which is 1), B's ri must be <= 0, which is impossible. So in this case, B can't be A itself. Similarly, for B to start after A's ri (3), B's li must be >=4. So A's li is 1, which is not >=4. So in this case, when processing A, the code would not consider A itself as B.\n\nBut what if the voucher A is such that it ends before its own li? That's impossible. Because li <= ri.\n\nSo, in general, when looking for B's in the same group as A's duration, the B's that are considered are either ending before A's li (so B's ri < A's li) or starting after A's ri (B's li > A's ri). Since A's ri >= A's li, B can't be A itself in either case.\n\nBecause:\n\nCase 1: B ends before A's li. Since B's ri < A's li. But A's li <= A's ri. So B's ri < A's li <= A's ri. So B's ri < A's ri. So B cannot be A.\n\nCase 2: B starts after A's ri. B's li > A's ri. But A's li <= A's ri. So B's li > A's ri >= A's li. So B's li > A's ri. Thus, B cannot be A.\n\nTherefore, during the processing of voucher A, when looking for B's in the same group, the B's found in the two cases (ending before A's li, or starting after A's ri) are not A itself. Hence, even if the group contains A, the code would not select A as B. Therefore, the code is safe.\n\nThis is a relief! So no need to worry about the same voucher being considered twice. Because when the code looks for B's that end before A's li or start after A's ri, the B's can't be the same as A. Therefore, the code can proceed without worrying about this.\n\nThat's good. So the initial approach is correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nImplementing this in Python.\n\nBut first, note that the groups may not have the target_duration. So for each voucher, we need to check if x -d exists in the groups.\n\nBut what about when x -d is zero or negative? Well, since x is the duration of the vacation, which is given as x ≥ 2 (since n ≥ 2, but looking at the input constraints: n and x can be 2 or higher. Wait, no. The input says x can be as low as 2? Let me check the input constraints:\n\nThe first line has n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5). So x is at least 2.\n\nBut for a voucher's duration d, it's ri - li + 1. Since li ≤ ri, d ≥ 1.\n\nSo for x -d to be valid, it must be ≥ 1. So when d is larger than x, x-d is negative. So for such cases, we can ignore.\n\nThus, during processing each voucher, we check if target_duration = x -d is ≥1, and exists in the groups.\n\nSo, for each voucher, compute d = ri - li + 1. Then target_duration = x -d. If target_duration < 1, skip.\n\nElse, check if groups has that target_duration.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nImplementing the preprocessing.\n\nBut how to store the sorted_ri_list and prefix_min for each duration.\n\nIn Python, perhaps using a dictionary for each duration, with two entries: one for the sorted_ri and prefix_min, and another for sorted_li and suffix_min.\n\nSo:\n\npreprocessing:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nimport bisect\n\ngroups = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor each voucher in input:\n    li, ri, cost = ...\n    d = ri - li + 1\n    groups[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, create two dictionaries: for each duration, the sorted_ri data and sorted_li data.\n\nFor example:\n\nri_data = defaultdict( lambda: ( [], [] ) )\n\nWait, perhaps better to have for each duration, a structure that holds sorted_ri_list and prefix_min array.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps:\n\nWe can have two dictionaries, say, for each duration k:\n\n- ri_sorted: a list of sorted ri's for vouchers of duration k.\n\n- ri_prefix_min: the prefix min array for the sorted_ri list.\n\nSimilarly, for li_sorted and li_suffix_min.\n\nSo:\n\nri_info = dict()  # key: duration, value: (sorted_ri_list, prefix_min)\nli_info = dict()  # key: duration, value: (sorted_li_list, suffix_min)\n\nfor k in groups:\n    vouchers = groups[k]\n    # process for ri_sorted and prefix_min\n    sorted_by_ri = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[1])\n    sorted_ri_list = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_ri]\n    sorted_ri_costs = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_ri]\n    # build prefix_min\n    prefix_min = []\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for cost in sorted_ri_costs:\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, cost)\n        prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n    ri_info[k] = (sorted_ri_list, prefix_min)\n    # process for li_sorted and suffix_min\n    sorted_by_li = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda x: x[0])\n    sorted_li_list = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_li]\n    sorted_li_costs = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_li]\n    # build suffix_min\n    suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_li_costs)\n    min_so_far = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(sorted_li_costs)-1, -1, -1):\n        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_li_costs[i])\n        suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n    li_info[k] = (sorted_li_list, suffix_min)\n\nOnce this is done, then for each voucher in the original list:\n\nfor li, ri, cost in all_vouchers:\n    d = ri - li + 1\n    target_d = x -d\n    if target_d < 1:\n        continue\n    if target_d not in groups:\n        continue\n    # Now check for vouchers in target_d\n    # Case 1: B ends before A's li\n    if target_d in ri_info:\n        sorted_ri_list, prefix_min = ri_info[target_d]\n        t = li - 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ri_list, t) - 1\n        if idx >= 0:\n            candidate1 = prefix_min[idx]\n        else:\n            candidate1 = float('inf')\n    else:\n        candidate1 = float('inf')\n    # Case 2: B starts after A's ri\n    if target_d in li_info:\n        sorted_li_list, suffix_min = li_info[target_d]\n        t = ri + 1\n        idx = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_li_list, t)\n        if idx < len(sorted_li_list):\n            candidate2 = suffix_min[idx]\n        else:\n            candidate2 = float('inf')\n    else:\n        candidate2 = float('inf')\n    current_min = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n    if current_min != float('inf'):\n        total = current_min + cost\n        global_min = min(global_min, total)\n\nBut wait, the 'all_vouchers' list is the original list of vouchers. So during the initial processing, we need to store all the vouchers, perhaps in a list.\n\nBut how to get all the vouchers? Well, during the initial reading of input, we can store them in a list.\n\nSo:\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, groups is built from vouchers.\n\nBut during the processing, for each voucher in vouchers, we process it.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut what about the case where target_d is same as d? For example, when x is even, and d is x/2. But as discussed earlier, the code is safe.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nTest case 1: sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4\n\n1 2 5\n\n5 6 1\n\n1 2 4\n\nThe vouchers:\n\nVoucher 1: li=1, ri=3, duration 3. cost 4.\n\nVoucher 2: li=1, ri=2, duration 2. cost 5.\n\nVoucher 3: li=5, ri=6, duration 2. cost 1.\n\nVoucher 4: li=1, ri=2, duration 2. cost 4.\n\nx is 5. So for each voucher:\n\nTake voucher 1, duration 3. target_d is 5-3=2. So check if there are vouchers with duration 2.\n\nYes. For case 1: B ends before voucher 1's li (1). So B's ri < 1. But vouchers with duration 2 have ri >= 2 (since duration is 2). So no such B. candidate1 is inf.\n\nCase 2: B starts after voucher 1's ri (3). So B's li >= 4. Looking into vouchers with duration 2. Which are vouchers 2, 3, 4.\n\nLooking at voucher 3: li=5 >=4. So the sorted_li_list for duration 2 would be sorted by li. Let's see:\n\nvouchers with duration 2 are vouchers 2 (li=1, ri=2), voucher 4 (li=1, ri=2), and voucher 3 (li=5, ri=6). When sorted by li, they are sorted as [1, 1, 5]. The suffix_min array for this would be:\n\nfor the sorted_li_costs [5,4,1].\n\nsuffix_min[2] = 1.\n\nsuffix_min[1] = min(4, 1) = 1.\n\nsuffix_min[0] = min(5, 1) = 1.\n\nSo when looking for B's li >= 3+1=4. So t=4.\n\nbisect_left on [1,1,5] for 4 is index 2. So suffix_min[2] is 1. So candidate2 is 1. So total is 4 + 1 =5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nAnother voucher: voucher 3 has duration 2. target_d is 5-2=3. Are there vouchers with duration 3? Yes, voucher 1. So check for vouchers with duration 3 that end before voucher3's li (5) or start after voucher3's ri (6).\n\nFor case 1: B ends before 5. Voucher1's ri is 3, which is <5. So candidate1 is 4. Then total is 4 +1=5.\n\nSo the code would find this pair.\n\nSo the code works for this case.\n\nAnother sample input is the second example:\n\n3 2\n\n4 6 3 → duration 3.\n\n2 4 1 → duration 3.\n\n3 5 4 → duration 3.\n\nx is 2. So for each voucher, target_d is 2 -3 = -1. Which is invalid. So no possible pairs. Output is -1.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, for the preprocessing, we need to process all durations in groups.\n\nBut in code, groups is a defaultdict(list). So for each k in groups.keys(), process.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImplement the preprocessing for ri_info and li_info.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr +=1\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr +=1\n        vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n    \n    # Build groups\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        groups[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n    \n    # Preprocess ri_info and li_info\n    ri_info = dict()  # key: duration, value: (sorted_ri_list, prefix_min)\n    li_info = dict()  # key: duration, value: (sorted_li_list, suffix_min)\n    \n    for d in groups:\n        vouchers_d = groups[d]\n        # Process for ri_info\n        sorted_by_ri = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        sorted_ri_list = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_ri]\n        sorted_ri_costs = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_ri]\n        # build prefix_min\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for cost in sorted_ri_costs:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, cost)\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        ri_info[d] = (sorted_ri_list, prefix_min)\n        # Process for li_info\n        sorted_by_li = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        sorted_li_list = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_li]\n        sorted_li_costs = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_li]\n        # build suffix_min\n        suffix_min = [0]*len(sorted_li_costs)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_li_costs)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_li_costs[i])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        li_info[d] = (sorted_li_list, suffix_min)\n    \n    # Now process each voucher\n    min_total = float('inf')\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        target_d = x - d\n        if target_d < 1:\n            continue\n        if target_d not in groups:\n            continue\n        # Check for vouchers with duration target_d\n        # Case 1: B ends before li\n        # Check if target_d is in ri_info (it should be, since groups has it)\n        # Get sorted_ri_list and prefix_min\n        if target_d in ri_info:\n            sorted_ri_list, prefix_min = ri_info[target_d]\n            t = li -1\n            idx = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ri_list, t) -1\n            if idx >=0:\n                candidate1 = prefix_min[idx]\n            else:\n                candidate1 = float('inf')\n        else:\n            candidate1 = float('inf')\n        # Case 2: B starts after ri\n        if target_d in li_info:\n            sorted_li_list, suffix_min = li_info[target_d]\n            t = ri +1\n            idx = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_li_list, t)\n            if idx < len(sorted_li_list):\n                candidate2 = suffix_min[idx]\n            else:\n                candidate2 = float('inf')\n        else:\n            candidate2 = float('inf')\n        current_min = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = current_min + cost\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n    \nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, groups may have a duration, but the ri_info and li_info may not be built for it? No, because for each d in groups, we process and build ri_info and li_info.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4\n\n1 2 5\n\n5 6 1\n\n1 2 4\n\nThe groups for duration 3: [(1,3,4)].\n\ngroups for duration 2: [(1,2,5), (1,2,4), (5,6,1)].\n\nProcessing voucher 1 (d=3, target_d=5-3=2).\n\nCheck case 1: B ends before 1. sorted_ri_list for target_d=2 is [2,2,6]. t = 1-1=0. bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) returns 0, minus 1 gives -1. candidate1 is inf.\n\ncase 2: B starts after 3. t=3+1=4. sorted_li_list for target_d=2 is [1,1,5]. bisect_left([1,1,5],4) returns 2. suffix_min[2] is 1. So candidate2 is 1. total is 4+1=5.\n\nSimilarly for other vouchers.\n\nSo the code returns 5.\n\nAnother test case: sample 2.\n\nInput:\n\n3 2\n\n4 6 3 → duration 3.\n\n2 4 1 → duration 3.\n\n3 5 4 → duration 3.\n\nEach voucher has duration 3. x=2. So target_d = 2-3 = -1. So no processing. min_total remains inf. output -1.\n\nSo code is correct.\n\nWhat about when there are multiple vouchers with same duration and overlapping?\n\nAnother test case: n=2, x=4. vouchers:\n\nvoucher1: li=1, ri=2 (d=2), cost 1.\n\nvoucher2: li=3, ri=4 (d=2), cost 1.\n\nx=4. So target_d for each voucher is 4-2=2. So for voucher1, check for vouchers with duration 2 that end before 1 (voucher2's",

If no such pair exists, we should return -1.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Group Vouchers by Duration**: First, group all vouchers by their duration. This helps in efficiently checking for pairs of vouchers that can sum up to the required duration.\n2. **Preprocess for Efficient Querying**: For each duration, preprocess two structures:\n   - A list of vouchers sorted by their end date, along with a prefix minimum cost array.\n   - A list of vouchers sorted by their start date, along with a suffix minimum cost array.\n3. **Check Valid Pairs**: For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher of the complementary duration (such that their durations sum up to the required value) that does not overlap with it. Use binary search on the preprocessed lists to efficiently find the minimum cost of valid non-overlapping vouchers.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    ptr = 0\n    n = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    x = int(input[ptr])\n    ptr += 1\n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        ri = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        cost = int(input[ptr])\n        ptr += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Build groups by duration\n    groups = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        groups[d].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess ri_info and li_info\n    ri_info = dict()  # key: duration, value: (sorted_ri_list, prefix_min)\n    li_info = dict()  # key: duration, value: (sorted_li_list, suffix_min)\n    \n    for d in groups:\n        vouchers_d = groups[d]\n        # Process for ri_info\n        sorted_by_ri = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[1])\n        sorted_ri_list = [v[1] for v in sorted_by_ri]\n        sorted_ri_costs = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_ri]\n        # build prefix_min\n        prefix_min = []\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for cost_val in sorted_ri_costs:\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, cost_val)\n            prefix_min.append(min_so_far)\n        ri_info[d] = (sorted_ri_list, prefix_min)\n        # Process for li_info\n        sorted_by_li = sorted(vouchers_d, key=lambda x: x[0])\n        sorted_li_list = [v[0] for v in sorted_by_li]\n        sorted_li_costs = [v[2] for v in sorted_by_li]\n        # build suffix_min\n        suffix_min = [0] * len(sorted_li_costs)\n        min_so_far = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_li_costs)-1, -1, -1):\n            min_so_far = min(min_so_far, sorted_li_costs[i])\n            suffix_min[i] = min_so_far\n        li_info[d] = (sorted_li_list, suffix_min)\n    \n    # Now process each voucher\n    min_total = float('inf')\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        target_d = x - d\n        if target_d < 1:\n            continue\n        if target_d not in groups:\n            continue\n        # Check for vouchers with duration target_d\n        # Case 1: B ends before li\n        candidate1 = float('inf')\n        if target_d in ri_info:\n            sorted_ri_list, prefix_min = ri_info[target_d]\n            t = li - 1\n            idx = bisect.bisect_right(sorted_ri_list, t) - 1\n            if idx >= 0:\n                candidate1 = prefix_min[idx]\n        # Case 2: B starts after ri\n        candidate2 = float('inf')\n        if target_d in li_info:\n            sorted_li_list, suffix_min = li_info[target_d]\n            t = ri + 1\n            idx = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_li_list, t)\n            if idx < len(sorted_li_list):\n                candidate2 = suffix_min[idx]\n        current_min = min(candidate1, candidate2)\n        if current_min != float('inf'):\n            total = current_min + cost\n            if total < min_total:\n                min_total = total\n    \n    if min_total == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(min_total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration to facilitate quick lookups when checking for complementary durations.\n- **Preprocessing**: For each duration, we sort vouchers by their end date and start date, and compute prefix and suffix minimum cost arrays.
