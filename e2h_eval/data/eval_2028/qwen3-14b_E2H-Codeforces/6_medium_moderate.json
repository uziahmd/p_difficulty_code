Job is such a thing for Leha.So the hacker began to work hard in order to get rid of boredom. It means that Leha began to hack computers all over the world. For such zeal boss gave the hacker a vacation of exactly x days. You know the majority of people prefer to go somewhere for a vacation, so Leha immediately went to the travel agency. There he found out that n vouchers left. i-th voucher is characterized by three integers li, ri, costi — day of departure from Vičkopolis, day of arriving back in Vičkopolis and cost of the voucher correspondingly. The duration of the i-th voucher is a value ri - li + 1.At the same time Leha wants to split his own vocation into two parts. Besides he wants to spend as little money as possible. Formally Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers i and j (i ≠ j) so that they don't intersect, sum of their durations is exactly x and their total cost is as minimal as possible. Two vouchers i and j don't intersect if only at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled: ri < lj or rj < li.Help Leha to choose the necessary vouchers!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2·105) — the number of vouchers in the travel agency and the duration of Leha's vacation correspondingly.Each of the next n lines contains three integers li, ri and costi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ costi ≤ 109) — description of the voucher.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — a minimal amount of money that Leha will spend, or print  - 1 if it's impossible to choose two disjoint vouchers with the total duration exactly x.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 5\\n1 3 4\\n1 2 5\\n5 6 1\\n1 2 4', '3 2\\n4 6 3\\n2 4 1\\n3 5 4']\n\n### Output\n['5', '-1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample Leha should choose first and third vouchers. Hereupon the total duration will be equal to (3 - 1 + 1) + (6 - 5 + 1) = 5 and the total cost will be 4 + 1 = 5.In the second sample the duration of each voucher is 3 therefore it's impossible to choose two vouchers with the total duration equal to 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, Leha wants to choose exactly two vouchers that don't overlap. The sum of their durations must be exactly x. And we need to find the minimal total cost of such a pair. If there's no such pair, output -1.\n\nFirst, understanding the voucher durations. The duration of a voucher is ri - li + 1. So for each voucher, we can calculate that. Then, for two vouchers i and j, their durations must add up to x. Also, they must not overlap. Which means either the first ends before the second starts, or vice versa.\n\nThe challenge is to find all pairs of vouchers where their durations sum to x, and they don't overlap, then find the minimum cost among those pairs.\n\nBut with n up to 2e5, checking all possible pairs would be O(n²), which is way too slow. So we need an efficient approach.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nLet me think: For each voucher, if I can find another voucher that has duration (x - duration_i) and doesn't overlap with it. Then, for each voucher, check for such vouchers.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nFirst, pre-process all vouchers by their duration. Let's group vouchers by their duration. For example, create a dictionary where key is the duration, and value is a list of vouchers with that duration. But even then, for each voucher with duration d, we need to find vouchers with duration (x - d) that don't overlap with it.\n\nBut how to find those vouchers quickly?\n\nAlternatively, for each voucher, we can consider two cases:\n\nCase 1: The first voucher is the one with duration d, and the second has duration x - d. We need to find the minimal cost voucher in the other duration that doesn't overlap with the first.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the vouchers. Suppose I have a voucher A with duration d, and I need to find vouchers B with duration (x - d) such that B starts after A ends, or ends before A starts.\n\nFor each voucher A, we can look for vouchers B with the required duration that are either entirely before A or entirely after A.\n\nBut how to find the minimal cost for such B's?\n\nThis seems like a problem where for each possible duration, we can pre-process the vouchers sorted by their start and end times, so that for a given A, we can query the minimal cost of vouchers B that end before A starts, or start after A ends.\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\nWe can pre-process for each duration value, two structures:\n\n- A sorted list of vouchers by their end time (for finding vouchers that end before a certain start time)\n- A sorted list of vouchers by their start time (for finding vouchers that start after a certain end time)\n\nBut perhaps even better, for each duration d, we can have two sorted lists:\n\nOne sorted by end time, and another sorted by start time. Then, for a voucher A with duration d, and looking for vouchers of duration (x - d) that end before A's start, or start after A's end.\n\nWait, but for each duration, we can have the vouchers sorted by their end time and start time. Then, for a given voucher A, we can find the minimal cost voucher in duration (x - d) that ends before A's start time (so that B ends before A starts), or starts after A's end time (so that A ends before B starts).\n\nSo, for each voucher, let's say it has duration d. Then, target duration is t = x - d. If t is negative, skip. Also, if t is zero, but since durations are at least 1 (since li <= ri), then x must be at least 2. So for x being 2, t can be 1.\n\nSo, for each voucher, we can check if t is a valid duration (i.e., exists in our data structure). Then, for each such t, we need to find the minimal cost voucher in t's group that does not overlap with the current voucher.\n\nNow, how to find the minimal cost for vouchers in t's group that end before the current voucher's start time (so that they are before), or start after current voucher's end time (so that they are after).\n\nFor the first case (vouchers ending before A's start time), since we have a list of vouchers with duration t, sorted by their end time. For each such voucher B, endB <= startA - 1 (since if B ends on day s, then A starts on s+1, so they don't overlap). So for the current A's start time (say, lA), we need to find all vouchers B in the t group with endB < lA. Among these, the minimal cost.\n\nSimilarly, for the second case, vouchers B in the t group with startB > rA. So for the current A's end time (rA), we need to find vouchers B with startB > rA. Among these, the minimal cost.\n\nSo for each t group, we can have:\n\n- A sorted list of end times, along with the minimal cost up to that end time. For example, for the list sorted by end time, we can have a prefix minimum array. Then, when we want to find the minimal cost of vouchers ending before a certain value, we can perform a binary search to find the largest end time less than lA, and then get the corresponding prefix min.\n\nSimilarly, for the start times sorted in ascending order, we can have a suffix min array. For example, for vouchers sorted by start time, we can find the first start time greater than rA, and then take the min of all elements from that index onwards.\n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Preprocess all vouchers into groups by their duration. For each duration d, we have two sorted lists:\n\n   a. A list of vouchers sorted by end time, along with their costs. Also, a prefix min array for this list.\n\n   b. A list of vouchers sorted by start time, along with their costs. Also, a suffix min array for this list.\n\nBut wait, for the same duration, different vouchers may have different start and end times. So for each duration d, we need to collect all vouchers with that duration, then sort them by end time (for case 1), and sort them by start time (for case 2).\n\nOnce that's done, for any voucher A with duration d, and target duration t = x - d:\n\nIf t is not present in the groups, skip.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck for vouchers in group t that end before A's start time. How?\n\nIn the group t's end-sorted list, find all vouchers with end <= lA - 1. The minimal cost among them.\n\nSimilarly, check for vouchers in group t's start-sorted list that start >= rA + 1. The minimal cost among them.\n\nIf either of these exists, then take the minimal between the two possibilities, and compare with the current overall minimum.\n\nBut how to compute these minima efficiently.\n\nFor the end-sorted list, sorted by end time, and for each position, the prefix min up to that position.\n\nSo for example, for the list sorted by end time, we can precompute an array prefix_min where prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost among the first i+1 vouchers.\n\nThen, when we want to find the minimal cost of vouchers ending before lA, we can binary search for the maximum end time that is <= lA - 1. Let's say that index is k. Then, if k is valid, the minimal cost is prefix_min[k].\n\nSimilarly, for the start-sorted list, sorted by start time. For the suffix min array, for each position i, suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost from i to end of the list. Then, when we want to find the minimal cost of vouchers starting after rA, we can binary search for the first start time that is >= rA + 1. Let's say that index is m. Then, if m is valid, the minimal cost is suffix_min[m].\n\nSo for each group t, we need to have:\n\n- A list of vouchers sorted by end time, and their prefix_min array.\n\n- A list of vouchers sorted by start time, and their suffix_min array.\n\nThis seems manageable.\n\nNow, the steps for the algorithm would be:\n\n- Preprocess all vouchers into groups by duration. For each duration d, we have two sorted lists (sorted by end time, sorted by start time) and their respective prefix/suffix min arrays.\n\n- For each voucher in the original list, compute its duration d. Then, compute t = x - d. If t is less than 1, skip (since duration must be at least 1). Also, check if t exists in the groups. If not, skip.\n\n- For the current voucher's l and r (start and end), check the group t for vouchers that end before l (so that they are non-overlapping), and vouchers that start after r.\n\n- For each of these two possibilities, get the minimal cost if available. Then, the total cost is current voucher's cost plus the minimal found in the group t. Keep track of the global minimum.\n\nBut also, note that the two vouchers must be different. However, since we are considering all vouchers in the group t, and the current voucher is in a different group (d and t are different, unless x is even and d = t = x/2). Wait, in that case, when d = t, then the current voucher is part of the same group. So we need to make sure that the voucher in the group t is not the same as the current voucher.\n\nAh, right! Because the problem says that the two vouchers must be different (i != j). So in the case where d = t (i.e., x is even and d = x/2), then when looking for vouchers in group t (which is same as d), we need to make sure that the voucher in the group is not the same as the current voucher. However, in this case, the group t is same as d, and for the current voucher, when we look for vouchers in group t, we need to exclude itself.\n\nBut how to handle this? Because for example, if the current voucher is in group t, and we are looking for vouchers in group t that end before lA or start after rA. But if there is another voucher in the same group that meets the condition, then it's allowed.\n\nBut how do we ensure that the current voucher is not considered as a candidate for itself?\n\nFor example, suppose the current voucher is A, and group t is same as d. Then, when we look for vouchers in group t that end before lA, perhaps A is in that group. But since A's end time is rA, which is >= lA (since lA <= rA). So for the case where we are looking for vouchers ending before lA, A's end time is rA >= lA, so it's not included. Similarly, for the case of vouchers starting after rA, A's start time is lA <= rA. So A will not be in that set. Therefore, in the case where d = t, the current voucher will not be considered in the group t's candidates. So even if the group t includes the current voucher, when we look for vouchers that are before or after, the current voucher won't be included. Thus, even if the group t is same as d, the code will not select the same voucher.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose current voucher is A with duration d. t = x -d = d. So x = 2d. Now, for group t, which is same as d. When we look for vouchers in group t that end before lA. The current voucher A's end time is rA. Since lA is the start of A, and rA >= lA. So for the vouchers in group t (same as d) that end before lA, the current voucher A cannot be in that list. Because its end time is rA >= lA. Similarly, when looking for vouchers in group t that start after rA, the current voucher's start time is lA <= rA, so it's not in that list. Therefore, in this case, even if the group t is same as d, the current voucher is not considered in the group t's candidates. So we don't have to worry about duplicates. Thus, the code can proceed safely.\n\nThat's a relief. So the code can process all vouchers, and for each voucher, check the group t, and for that group, the candidates are other vouchers, not overlapping with the current one.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nImplement the grouping as discussed.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python?\n\nFirst, let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can have a dictionary, say, duration_map, where keys are durations, and the value is a tuple of (end_sorted_list, prefix_min_end, start_sorted_list, suffix_min_start).\n\nBut for each duration, we need to process the vouchers:\n\nFor example, for duration d, collect all vouchers with that duration.\n\nThen, for end_sorted_list: sort the vouchers by their end time (ri). Then, create a prefix_min array. For each index i in the end_sorted_list, prefix_min[i] is the minimum cost between 0..i.\n\nSimilarly, for start_sorted_list: sort the vouchers by their start time (li). Then, create a suffix_min array. For each index i, suffix_min[i] is the minimum cost between i..end.\n\nSo, for each duration d, we can pre-process these.\n\nOnce that is done, for each voucher A (with duration d, start lA, end rA, cost cA), compute t = x - d. If t < 1, skip. Else, check if t is present in duration_map. If not, skip.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck group t's end_sorted_list for vouchers ending before lA.\n\nHow to do that:\n\nIn the end_sorted_list, which is sorted by end time (ri), find the largest end time <= lA - 1.\n\nWe can use bisect.bisect_right to find the insertion point of lA-1. Let's say the insertion index is k. Then, the number of elements with end <= lA-1 is k. So if k is 0, then there are none. Otherwise, the prefix_min_end[k-1] is the minimum cost for those vouchers.\n\nSimilarly, for the start_sorted_list, which is sorted by start time (li), find the first start time >= rA + 1. Using bisect.bisect_left to find the insertion point. Let's say the insertion index is m. Then, all elements from m onwards have start >= rA + 1. If m is within the length of the list, then the suffix_min_start[m] is the minimum cost among those.\n\nSo, for each of these two possibilities (before and after), if found, we can get the minimum cost, and then add it to the current voucher's cost, and compare to the global minimum.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nThen, read all the vouchers, storing li, ri, costi.\n\nThen, for each voucher, compute duration = ri - li + 1.\n\nGroup the vouchers by duration. For each duration, collect all vouchers, then sort them by end time (for end_sorted_list) and by start time (for start_sorted_list). Also compute the prefix_min and suffix_min arrays.\n\nOnce that's done, iterate through each voucher again. For each voucher, compute d = duration, t = x -d. Check if t is valid (>=1) and exists in duration_map. If yes, then:\n\nCheck group t's end_sorted_list for vouchers ending before lA. Get the min cost (if any) as min1.\n\nCheck group t's start_sorted_list for vouchers starting after rA. Get the min cost (if any) as min2.\n\nIf either min1 or min2 exists, then the total cost is current voucher's cost + min1 or min2, whichever is applicable. Update the global minimum accordingly.\n\nFinally, after processing all vouchers, if the global minimum was found, output it. Else, output -1.\n\nNow, some edge cases:\n\nWhat if x is 0? Well, according to input constraints, x is at least 2. Wait, the input says x is between 2 and 2e5. Wait, the first line says n and x (2 ≤ n, x ≤ 2e5). So x is at least 2. So t can be 0 only if x is 1, but since x is at least 2, that's not possible. So for each voucher, t can be x -d, which could be 0 if d=x. But since x is at least 2, and d is at least 1. So for example, if x=2 and d=2, then t=0. But in that case, we can't have a voucher of duration 0. So in that case, we skip.\n\nSo during the code, for each voucher, compute t = x - d. If t <1, skip.\n\nNow, code-wise, how to implement the grouping and the sorted lists and the prefix/suffix min arrays.\n\nLet me think about how to code this.\n\nIn Python, for each duration in duration_map, we can store:\n\nFor end_sorted_list, a list of (end_time, cost). Then sorted by end_time.\n\nSimilarly for start_sorted_list, a list of (start_time, cost), sorted by start_time.\n\nBut actually, for the prefix_min_end, we can have a list where each element is the minimum cost up to that index. So for example:\n\nend_sorted = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.end)\nprefix_min = [ ... ]\nprefix_min[0] = end_sorted[0].cost\nfor i in 1 to len(end_sorted)-1:\n    prefix_min[i] = min(prefix_min[i-1], end_sorted[i].cost)\n\nSimilarly for the start_sorted list:\n\nstart_sorted = sorted(vouchers, key=lambda v: v.start)\nsuffix_min = [ ... ]\nsuffix_min[-1] = start_sorted[-1].cost\nfor i in range(len(start_sorted)-2, -1, -1):\n    suffix_min[i] = min(suffix_min[i+1], start_sorted[i].cost)\n\nBut in Python, perhaps we can represent each duration's data as:\n\nFor example, for a duration d, duration_map[d] = (end_list, prefix_min_end, start_list, suffix_min_start).\n\nBut how to process this.\n\nSo, for each voucher, we can process as follows:\n\nOnce all vouchers are read, we create the duration_map.\n\nNow, for each duration d in the duration_map:\n\nCollect all vouchers with that duration.\n\nSort them by end time, and create end_list. Then compute prefix_min_end.\n\nSort them by start time, and create start_list. Then compute suffix_min_start.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nduration_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor voucher in all_vouchers:\n    d = voucher.duration\n    duration_map[d].append(voucher)\n\nThen, for each d in duration_map:\n\nvouchers_in_d = duration_map[d]\n\nend_list = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda v: v.ri)\nprefix_min_end = []\ncurrent_min = infinity\nfor v in end_list:\n    current_min = min(current_min, v.cost)\n    prefix_min_end.append(current_min)\n\nSimilarly for start_list and suffix_min_start.\n\nBut in Python, we can process these steps.\n\nOnce that's done, for each voucher A:\n\nd = duration of A.\n\nt = x -d.\n\nif t <1: continue.\n\nif t not in duration_map: continue.\n\nthen, check the group t's end_list and start_list.\n\nSo, for the end_list in group t:\n\nWe need to find the maximum end time <= lA - 1.\n\nEach element in end_list is a voucher with duration t, sorted by ri.\n\nSo, the end times are in the end_list's ri. So we can extract the end times as a separate list for binary search.\n\nBut perhaps, for each end_list, we can have a list of end times, and then use bisect on that.\n\nFor example, for the end_list, we can create a list called end_times = [v.ri for v in end_list].\n\nThen, using bisect.bisect_right(end_times, lA -1) gives us the insertion index k. If k>0, then the min cost is prefix_min_end[k-1].\n\nSimilarly, for the start_list in group t, we can have a list of start_times = [v.li for v in start_list]. Then, using bisect.bisect_left(start_times, rA +1) gives us m. If m < len(start_times), then the min cost is suffix_min_start[m].\n\nSo, in code, for each group t, we need to precompute:\n\n- end_times list (for end_list)\n- prefix_min_end list\n- start_times list (for start_list)\n- suffix_min_start list\n\nBut perhaps during preprocessing, for each duration d, we can store:\n\n- end_list (sorted by ri)\n- end_times (list of ri's)\n- prefix_min_end\n- start_list (sorted by li)\n- start_times (list of li's)\n- suffix_min_start\n\nBut in code, perhaps for each duration d in the duration_map, we can process:\n\nProcessing for end_list:\n\nsorted_end = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda v: v.ri)\nend_times = [v.ri for v in sorted_end]\nprefix_min_end = []\ncurrent_min = float('inf')\nfor v in sorted_end:\n    current_min = min(current_min, v.cost)\n    prefix_min_end.append(current_min)\n\nSimilarly for the start_list:\n\nsorted_start = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda v: v.li)\nstart_times = [v.li for v in sorted_start]\nsuffix_min_start = [0]*len(sorted_start)\ncurrent_min = float('inf')\nfor i in reversed(range(len(sorted_start))):\n    current_min = min(current_min, sorted_start[i].cost)\n    suffix_min_start[i] = current_min\n\nSo, for each duration d, we can store these structures in the duration_map. But how to store them? Maybe for each duration, we can have a tuple of (end_times, prefix_min_end, start_times, suffix_min_start).\n\nBut in Python, perhaps for each duration, we can have a dictionary entry that holds these four lists.\n\nOnce that is done, during the per-voucher processing, for each voucher A, we can do:\n\nt = x - d_A.\n\nif t not in duration_map: continue.\n\nelse:\n\ngroup_t = duration_map[t]\n\nCheck for end_list:\n\nend_times = group_t['end_times']\nprefix_min_end = group_t['prefix_min_end']\n\nlA is the start of voucher A (li).\n\ntarget_end = lA -1.\n\nk = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, target_end)\n\nif k >0:\n\nmin1 = prefix_min_end[k-1]\n\nelse:\n\nmin1 = infinity\n\nSimilarly, for the start_list:\n\nstart_times = group_t['start_times']\nsuffix_min_start = group_t['suffix_min_start']\n\ntarget_start = rA +1\n\nm = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, target_start)\n\nif m < len(start_times):\n\nmin2 = suffix_min_start[m]\n\nelse:\n\nmin2 = infinity\n\nthen, the possible candidates are min1 and min2.\n\nSo, for the current voucher A, the minimal possible is min(min1, min2). If either is not infinity, then add to the global answer.\n\nSo, the code would accumulate the minimal value across all possible pairs.\n\nNow, what about the case when there are multiple vouchers in group t that meet the criteria? The prefix_min and suffix_min arrays take care of finding the minimal cost.\n\nNow, what about the initial setup?\n\nLet me think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\n1 3 4 → duration is 3-1+1 =3.\n\n1 2 5 → duration 2.\n\n5 6 1 → duration 2.\n\n1 2 4 → duration 2.\n\nSo x is 5. So for each voucher:\n\nFirst voucher has duration 3. t =5-3=2. So looking for vouchers with duration 2.\n\nGroup t=2 has three vouchers: (1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4). Wait, no, the third voucher is 5-6, duration 2. The second and fourth vouchers are duration 2.\n\nSo for the first voucher (l=1, r=3, cost 4), looking for vouchers of duration 2 that end before l=1 (target_end = 0) or start after r=3 (target_start=4).\n\nIn group t=2:\n\nend_times for the group would be sorted by ri. The vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 2: ri=2.\n\nvoucher 4: ri=2.\n\nvoucher 3: ri=6.\n\nSo sorted by ri, end_times would be [2,2,6]. prefix_min_end would be [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4,1)=1].\n\nSo for target_end = lA-1 = 1-1=0. bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) returns 0. So k=0, which is not >0. So no min1.\n\nFor the start_times of group t=2: sorted by li. The vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 2: li=1.\n\nvoucher 4: li=1.\n\nvoucher 3: li=5.\n\nSo start_times is [1,1,5]. suffix_min_start is:\n\nfor i=2: min(1) →1.\n\ni=1: min(1, 1) →1.\n\ni=0: min(1, 1) →1.\n\nSo target_start is rA +1 = 3+1=4. bisect_left([1,1,5], 4) → returns 2. m=2, which is less than len(start_times)=3. So suffix_min_start[2] is 1. So min2 is 1. So current voucher's cost (4) + 1 =5. Which is the correct answer.\n\nSo the code would find that.\n\nAnother example: voucher 3 (5-6, duration 2). t =5-2=3. So looking for vouchers with duration 3. There's only the first voucher (duration 3). So check if it's non-overlapping.\n\nVoucher 3 has l=5, r=6. So for group t=3, which has one voucher (voucher 1: l=1, r=3, cost 4).\n\nCheck if voucher 1 ends before 5 (voucher3's l=5). voucher1's end is 3, which is <=5-1=4. So yes. So in group t=3's end_list, the end_times is [3]. target_end is 5-1=4. bisect_right([3],4) returns 1. k=1>0. prefix_min_end[0] is 4. So min1 is 4. So total cost is 1 (voucher3's cost?) Wait, voucher3's cost is 1. So 1+4=5. Which is same as previous case.\n\nSo the code would find that.\n\nThus, the code would capture both possibilities.\n\nNow, the code needs to process all vouchers and find the minimal sum.\n\nNow, the code steps in Python:\n\nBut first, how to represent the vouchers. Let's think about the data structures.\n\nWe can represent each voucher as a tuple (li, ri, cost). Then, for each voucher, compute duration as ri - li + 1.\n\nNow, code outline:\n\nRead n and x.\n\nvouchers = list of tuples (li, ri, cost).\n\nThen, build duration_map as a defaultdict. For each duration d, we collect the vouchers.\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_map, process the end_list, end_times, prefix_min_end, start_list, start_times, suffix_min_start.\n\nOnce that is done, initialize the answer as infinity.\n\nThen, for each voucher in vouchers:\n\nd = ri - li + 1.\n\nt = x -d.\n\nif t <1: continue.\n\nif t not in duration_map: continue.\n\nelse:\n\ngroup = duration_map[t]\n\nprocess the end_list and start_list for group.\n\nCheck for end_list:\n\ntarget_end = li -1.\n\nbisect in end_times of group's end_list.\n\nSimilarly for start_list.\n\nCompute min1 and min2.\n\nif min1 is not infinity, then candidate is current_voucher_cost + min1.\n\nif min2 is not infinity, then candidate is current_voucher_cost + min2.\n\nupdate the global answer with the minimum of these candidates.\n\nOnce all vouchers are processed, if the global answer is still infinity, output -1 else output the answer.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in Python, for the duration_map, how to store the processed data.\n\nLet me think: for each duration d, during preprocessing, we can store:\n\n- end_times: list of ri's sorted.\n\n- prefix_min_end: list of min costs up to each index.\n\n- start_times: list of li's sorted.\n\n- suffix_min_start: list of min costs from each index onwards.\n\nSo during preprocessing:\n\nfor d in duration_map:\n\n    vouchers_in_d = duration_map[d]\n\n    # process end_list and prefix_min_end\n    sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda v: v[1])  # v[1] is ri\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n    prefix_min_end = []\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for v in sorted_end:\n        current_min = min(current_min, v[2])  # v[2] is cost\n        prefix_min_end.append(current_min)\n    # process start_list and suffix_min_start\n    sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda v: v[0])  # v[0] is li\n    start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n    suffix_min_start = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(sorted_start)-1, -1, -1):\n        current_min = min(current_min, sorted_start[i][2])\n        suffix_min_start[i] = current_min\n    # store these in duration_map for d\n    duration_map[d] = (end_times, prefix_min_end, start_times, suffix_min_start)\n\nWait, but the original duration_map was a defaultdict(list). So perhaps we need to replace the list with the processed data. So, perhaps during the initial step, we can have:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nn, x = map(int, input().split())\nvouchers = []\nfor _ in range(n):\n    li, ri, cost = map(int, input().split())\n    vouchers.append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nduration_map = defaultdict(list)\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n    d = ri - li + 1\n    duration_map[d].append( (li, ri, cost) )\n\nThen, for each duration in duration_map, process and replace the list with the processed data.\n\nBut in Python, perhaps we can create a new structure. Let me think:\n\nprocessed_duration_map = {}\n\nfor d in duration_map:\n    vouchers_in_d = duration_map[d]\n    # process end_list\n    sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda v: v[1])\n    end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n    prefix_min_end = []\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for v in sorted_end:\n        current_min = min(current_min, v[2])\n        prefix_min_end.append(current_min)\n    # process start_list\n    sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda v: v[0])\n    start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n    suffix_min_start = [0]*len(sorted_start)\n    current_min = float('inf')\n    for i in range(len(sorted_start)-1, -1, -1):\n        current_min = min(current_min, sorted_start[i][2])\n        suffix_min_start[i] = current_min\n    # store in processed_duration_map\n    processed_duration_map[d] = (end_times, prefix_min_end, start_times, suffix_min_start)\n\nThen, during the processing of each voucher:\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n    d = ri - li + 1\n    t = x - d\n    if t < 1:\n        continue\n    if t not in processed_duration_map:\n        continue\n    # get the data for t\n    end_times, prefix_min_end, start_times, suffix_min_start = processed_duration_map[t]\n    # check end before li\n    target_end = li -1\n    # find in end_times the largest <= target_end\n    # using bisect_right\n    import bisect\n    k = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, target_end)\n    min1 = float('inf')\n    if k > 0:\n        min1 = prefix_min_end[k-1]\n    # check start after ri\n    target_start = ri + 1\n    m = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, target_start)\n    min2 = float('inf')\n    if m < len(start_times):\n        min2 = suffix_min_start[m]\n    # current candidate is cost + min(min1, min2)\n    current_min_candidate = cost + min( min1, min2 )\n    if current_min_candidate < global_min:\n        global_min = current_min_candidate\n\nWait, but min1 and min2 can be inf. So the code should check if either is valid.\n\nBut in the code above, current_min_candidate is cost + min( min1, min2 ). But if both min1 and min2 are inf, then min is inf, and adding to cost is inf. So in that case, no change to global_min.\n\nBut in code, the initial global_min is set to infinity. So after processing all vouchers, if global_min is still infinity, output -1.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nglobal_min = float('inf')\n\nfor li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n    d = ri - li + 1\n    t = x -d\n    if t <1:\n        continue\n    if t not in processed_duration_map:\n        continue\n    end_times, prefix_min_end, start_times, suffix_min_start = processed_duration_map[t]\n    # check end before li\n    target_end = li -1\n    k = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, target_end)\n    min1 = float('inf')\n    if k >0:\n        min1 = prefix_min_end[k-1]\n    # check start after ri\n    target_start = ri +1\n    m = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, target_start)\n    min2 = float('inf')\n    if m < len(start_times):\n        min2 = suffix_min_start[m]\n    current_min_candidate = cost + min( min1, min2 )\n    if current_min_candidate < global_min:\n        global_min = current_min_candidate\n\nAt the end, if global_min is still infinity, output -1 else output global_min.\n\nBut wait, what if both min1 and min2 are inf? Then current_min_candidate is inf, which doesn't affect the global_min.\n\nBut what if one of them is valid?\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n4 5\n\nVouchers:\n\n(1,3,4) → duration 3.\n\n(1,2,5) → duration 2.\n\n(5,6,1) → duration 2.\n\n(1,2,4) → duration 2.\n\nprocessed_duration_map for d=2:\n\nvouchers_in_d are [(1,2,5), (5,6,1), (1,2,4)] ?\n\nNo, the original vouchers are:\n\nvoucher 0: (1,3,4) → duration 3.\n\nvoucher 1: (1,2,5) → duration 2.\n\nvoucher 2: (5,6,1) → duration 2.\n\nvoucher 3: (1,2,4) → duration 2.\n\nSo duration_map for d=2 has vouchers 1, 2, 3.\n\nsorted_end for d=2:\n\nsorted by ri. The vouchers are:\n\nvoucher1: ri=2.\n\nvoucher3: ri=2.\n\nvoucher2: ri=6.\n\nso end_times = [2,2,6]\n\nprefix_min_end is [5, min(5,4)=4, min(4,1)=1]\n\nsorted_start for d=2 is sorted by li:\n\nvoucher1: li=1.\n\nvoucher3: li=1.\n\nvoucher2: li=5.\n\nstart_times = [1,1,5]\n\nsuffix_min_start:\n\nfor i=2: cost is 1 → suffix_min_start[2] = 1.\n\ni=1: min(4, 1) → 1.\n\ni=0: min(5, 1) → 1.\n\nso suffix_min_start is [1, 1, 1].\n\nSo when processing voucher0 (li=1, ri=3, cost=4, duration=3):\n\nt=5-3=2.\n\ntarget_end is li-1 = 0. bisect_right([2,2,6], 0) → returns 0. So k=0 → min1 is inf.\n\ntarget_start is ri+1 = 3+1=4. bisect_left([1,1,5], 4) returns 2. m=2 <3 → min2 is suffix_min_start[2] =1. So current_min_candidate is 4+1=5. Which is correct.\n\nSimilarly, when processing voucher2 (li=5, ri=6, cost=1, duration=2). t =5-2=3. Check if 3 is in processed_duration_map. Yes, because voucher0 has duration 3.\n\nprocessed_duration_map[3] would have:\n\nvouchers_in_d is [(1,3,4)].\n\nsorted_end is [(1,3,4)], end_times = [3], prefix_min_end = [4].\n\nsorted_start is [(1,3,4)], start_times = [1],",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to find two non-overlapping vouchers such that their total duration equals a given value `x` and their combined cost is minimized. The solution involves efficiently searching for valid voucher pairs using preprocessing and binary search techniques.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Preprocessing Vouchers by Duration**: Group vouchers by their duration. For each duration, maintain sorted lists of vouchers based on their start and end times.\n2. **Prefix and Suffix Minimum Arrays**: For each group of vouchers with the same duration, create prefix minimum arrays for end-sorted lists and suffix minimum arrays for start-sorted lists. These arrays help quickly determine the minimum cost of vouchers that end before or start after a given time.\n3. **Binary Search for Efficient Lookup**: For each voucher, check if there exists another voucher with the required complementary duration that does not overlap. Use binary search to efficiently find the valid ranges in the preprocessed lists.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    vouchers = []\n    for _ in range(n):\n        li = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        ri = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        cost = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        vouchers.append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    # Preprocess duration_map\n    duration_map = defaultdict(list)\n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        duration_map[d].append((li, ri, cost))\n    \n    processed_duration = {}\n    \n    for d in duration_map:\n        vouchers_in_d = duration_map[d]\n        # Process end_sorted\n        sorted_end = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda v: v[1])\n        end_times = [v[1] for v in sorted_end]\n        prefix_min_end = []\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for v in sorted_end:\n            current_min = min(current_min, v[2])\n            prefix_min_end.append(current_min)\n        # Process start_sorted\n        sorted_start = sorted(vouchers_in_d, key=lambda v: v[0])\n        start_times = [v[0] for v in sorted_start]\n        suffix_min_start = [0] * len(sorted_start)\n        current_min = float('inf')\n        for i in range(len(sorted_start)-1, -1, -1):\n            current_min = min(current_min, sorted_start[i][2])\n            suffix_min_start[i] = current_min\n        # Store in processed_duration\n        processed_duration[d] = (end_times, prefix_min_end, start_times, suffix_min_start)\n    \n    global_min = float('inf')\n    \n    for li, ri, cost in vouchers:\n        d = ri - li + 1\n        t = x - d\n        if t < 1:\n            continue\n        if t not in processed_duration:\n            continue\n        end_times, prefix_min_end, start_times, suffix_min_start = processed_duration[t]\n        # Check for vouchers ending before li\n        target_end = li - 1\n        k = bisect.bisect_right(end_times, target_end)\n        min1 = float('inf')\n        if k > 0:\n            min1 = prefix_min_end[k-1]\n        # Check for vouchers starting after ri\n        target_start = ri + 1\n        m = bisect.bisect_left(start_times, target_start)\n        min2 = float('inf')\n        if m < len(start_times):\n            min2 = suffix_min_start[m]\n        current_candidate = cost + min(min1, min2)\n        if current_candidate < global_min:\n            global_min = current_candidate\n    \n    if global_min == float('inf'):\n        print(-1)\n    else:\n        print(global_min)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into a list of vouchers.\n2. **Grouping by Duration**: Vouchers are grouped by their duration using a dictionary.\n3. **Preprocessing**: For each duration, vouchers are sorted by their end and start times.
