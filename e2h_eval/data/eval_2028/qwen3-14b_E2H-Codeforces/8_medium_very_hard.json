Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the task is to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies certain flow conditions and is acyclic. The flow has to be a maximum flow, but since the problem already gives us the flow values, we just need to assign directions correctly.\n\nFirst, let's understand the constraints. The main points are:\n\n1. For each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. This is the conservation of flow.\n2. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The directed graph must not have cycles.\n\nHmm. How can I model this? Well, thinking about flow networks, the standard max-flow algorithms work with directed edges. But here, the edges are undirected, and we need to assign directions. However, the problem says that the flow values are already given, so the direction assignment must be such that the flow conservation holds and the graph is acyclic.\n\nWait, the problem says that the given flow is a maximum flow. But how does that affect the direction assignment? Well, maybe the direction assignment needs to be consistent with the flow being a valid maximum flow. But since the flow values are given, perhaps we just need to assign directions that make the flow valid.\n\nBut how to find those directions?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each vertex v (not source or sink), the total inflow equals the outflow. Which implies that the net flow (outflow - inflow) is zero. But since the flow is directed, for each edge, the direction determines whether it contributes to inflow or outflow.\n\nSo, for each vertex, the sum of the flows on edges directed away from it (outgoing) minus the sum of flows on edges directed towards it (incoming) must be zero. Except for source and sink.\n\nWait, for the source (vertex 1), all edges must be outgoing. Because the source has no incoming edges. So for the source, the outflow is the sum of all flows on edges connected to it, and the inflow is zero. Similarly, the sink (vertex n) has all edges incoming? No, the sink can have outgoing edges as long as the net flow into it is equal to the maximum flow. Wait, no. For the sink, the net inflow is equal to the total flow. So for the sink, the sum of incoming flows minus outgoing flows equals the total flow. But for other vertices, the net flow is zero.\n\nBut since the problem states that the flow is maximum, perhaps the way the edges are directed must form a DAG (no cycles) and satisfy the flow conservation.\n\nSo how can I model this? One approach is to think of the flow as a directed acyclic graph where each node (except source and sink) has equal in and out flows.\n\nWait, but how to assign directions to edges to meet these constraints. Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where the edges are directed in a way that forms a DAG, and the flow conservation holds.\n\nAnother thought: since the directed graph must be acyclic, we can arrange the vertices in a topological order. Then, for each edge, we direct it from the earlier vertex in the topological order to the later one. But how does that ensure flow conservation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can construct a directed acyclic graph where the flow conservation is satisfied. Let's think about the flow as a directed graph. For each vertex, except the source and sink, the sum of flows on outgoing edges must equal the sum on incoming edges. But how to compute that.\n\nWait, considering the flow conservation for each node (except source and sink), the total flow leaving the node equals the total flow entering. Therefore, for each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges incident to v, where the direction is outgoing, must be equal to the sum of flows on edges incident to v where the direction is incoming. Which implies that the sum of flows on edges incident to v is even? No, because if you have sum_out = sum_in, then sum_out + sum_in = 2 * sum_out. But sum_out + sum_in is the sum of all flows on edges incident to v. Therefore, the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even? Wait, no. Because sum_out equals sum_in, so sum_out = sum_in = total_flow / 2. But the total_flow is sum_out + sum_in = 2 * sum_out. So yes, the sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even. However, the problem statement says that a solution exists, so this condition is guaranteed.\n\nBut how to use this to assign directions.\n\nAnother idea: the problem requires that the directed graph is acyclic. So, perhaps we can model the direction of edges based on a topological order. Let's imagine that we have a topological order of the nodes, and for each edge, we direct it from the node that comes earlier in the order to the one that comes later. Then, the graph is acyclic. But how to choose the topological order such that the flow conservation is satisfied.\n\nBut how can we find such an order?\n\nAlternatively, think of the flow as a directed graph. Since the graph is acyclic, there must be a topological order. Let's say that we arrange the nodes in a topological order, such that all edges go from earlier to later in the order. Then, for each node except the source and sink, the sum of flows going out must equal the sum of flows coming in. How can we model that?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges directed out of v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed into v. Which means that the total flow through the edges incident to v must be even, and the sum of flows directed out is half of that. But how to compute that.\n\nAlternatively, for each node, the net flow (outflow - inflow) must be zero. Except for the source and sink. For the source, the net outflow is equal to the total flow. For the sink, the net inflow is equal to the total flow.\n\nBut how can we model this? It seems like a problem of assigning directions to edges such that for each node, the net outflow is zero (except source and sink). Also, the graph must be acyclic.\n\nThis feels similar to an Eulerian trail problem, but not exactly. Or perhaps, it's similar to building a directed graph where the in-degree and out-degree balance (except for source and sink).\n\nBut how to assign directions.\n\nAnother thought: since the graph is acyclic, we can process the nodes in topological order. Suppose we arrange the nodes in a topological order where the source is first, and the sink is last. Then, for each node in the order, we can process its edges and assign directions accordingly.\n\nBut how to compute the directions such that flow conservation is met.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where the flow conservation holds. Let's consider the flow as a directed graph. For each node, except source and sink, the net outflow is zero. For the source, net outflow is the total flow. For the sink, net inflow is the total flow.\n\nLet me think about the total flow. The total flow is the sum of all flows from the source. Since the source has no incoming edges, all edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. So for each edge connected to the source, we direct it away from the source.\n\nSimilarly, for the sink, all edges connected to it must be directed towards it, except possibly those that are part of some path. But that might not be the case. Hmm, but the sink can have outgoing edges, as long as the net inflow is correct.\n\nWait, but the sink can have outgoing edges. For example, in the first sample input, the sink is vertex 3. There's an edge from 3 to 2 with flow 10, which is directed as 2 → 3 (since the output is 1 for that edge). So that edge is directed towards the sink. But there's also an edge from 3 to 1 (but the direction is from 1 to 3, which would be outgoing from the source, but in the sample input, the third edge is between 3 and 1 with flow 5. The output for that edge is 1, meaning direction is 1 → 3. So the sink (3) has an incoming edge from 1. But there's also an edge from 3 to 2, which is directed as 2 → 3. So the sink has incoming edges.\n\nBut perhaps the sink can have outgoing edges. For example, suppose there's a path from the sink to another node, but that would require that the flow conservation holds. However, since the graph is acyclic, the sink cannot have any outgoing edges, because that would create a cycle. Because the sink is the last node in the topological order. So in a DAG, all edges go from earlier to later in the topological order. So the sink must be the last node in the topological order, and thus cannot have outgoing edges. So all edges connected to the sink must be incoming.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because if the sink has an outgoing edge, then that edge would go to a node that comes after it in the topological order. But since the sink is the last node, there can't be such a node. Therefore, all edges connected to the sink must be directed into it. Similarly, the source is the first node in the topological order, so all edges connected to it are directed away from it.\n\nSo, this suggests that the topological order starts with the source, ends with the sink, and all edges go from earlier nodes to later ones. Then, the direction of each edge is determined by their positions in the topological order.\n\nBut how to find such a topological order that allows the flow conservation to be satisfied.\n\nLet me think of the flow conservation for each node. For a node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges going out of v must equal the sum of flows on edges going into v. Since all edges are directed from earlier to later in the topological order, the edges incident to v are either directed from v to later nodes, or from earlier nodes to v. So, the sum of flows on edges directed out of v is the sum of flows on edges where v is the earlier node. The sum of flows on edges directed into v is the sum of flows on edges where v is the later node.\n\nSo for flow conservation, the sum of flows on edges directed out of v (sum_out) must equal the sum of flows on edges directed into v (sum_in). Thus, sum_out = sum_in. Which implies that the total sum of flows on edges incident to v is sum_out + sum_in = 2 * sum_out. Therefore, the total sum of flows on edges incident to v must be even. But the problem says that a solution exists, so this is guaranteed.\n\nBut how to find the topological order that allows this. It seems challenging.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph and perform some kind of flow-based processing. Let's consider the following approach:\n\nWe can model the problem as building a directed graph where each edge is directed from u to v or v to u. The constraints are that the graph is a DAG and that the flow conservation holds.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently for large n and m (up to 2e5).\n\nAnother thought: The problem resembles finding an orientation of the edges such that the resulting directed graph is a DAG and satisfies the flow conservation. Since the graph is connected and a solution exists, perhaps we can construct a directed tree structure, like a directed spanning tree from the source to the sink, and assign directions accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, think of the flow conservation as a system of equations. For each node v (except source and sink), the sum of flows on edges directed out of v minus the sum of flows on edges directed into v is zero. But this is equivalent to the sum of flows on edges directed out of v equals the sum of flows on edges directed into v. Which is equivalent to the sum of flows on edges incident to v being even, and the sum of outgoing flows is half of that.\n\nBut how to compute this for each node. Let me think of it as follows: For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of flows on edges incident to v is S_v. Then, the sum of outgoing flows is S_v / 2, and the sum of incoming flows is S_v / 2.\n\nBut how to assign directions to edges to achieve this. For example, for each edge between u and v, we need to decide whether to direct it from u to v or v to u. The choice affects the outgoing and incoming flows for both u and v.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph where each node has a certain \"excess\" that needs to be balanced. For example, for each node v (not source or sink), the excess is zero. But the source has an excess of the total flow (since all edges are outgoing), and the sink has an excess of -total flow (since all edges are incoming).\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe we can think of this as a problem of finding a directed graph where for each node, the outflow minus inflow is equal to the required value (which is zero for non-source/sink nodes, etc.), and the graph is acyclic.\n\nBut again, the question is how to compute this efficiently.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the fact that the directed graph must be acyclic. If we can assign directions based on a topological order, then perhaps we can model the problem by building a topological order where for each node, the sum of flows on edges going out of it is equal to the sum of flows on edges coming into it.\n\nBut how to construct such a topological order.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as building a directed graph where each node (except source and sink) has equal in and out flows, and the graph is a DAG. To do this, perhaps we can model this as a directed graph where each node's outflow is equal to the sum of flows on edges that are directed away from it, and the in-flow is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed towards it.\n\nBut how to compute this. Let's think recursively. Suppose we have a node v that is not the source or sink. We need to ensure that the sum of outgoing flows equals the sum of incoming flows. Let's say that for each node, we can compute the required outflow. For example, for the source, the required outflow is the total flow (sum of all flows on edges connected to it). For the sink, the required inflow is the total flow.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe we can think of the problem as a directed graph where the edges are directed in such a way that each node's outflow equals its inflow, except for the source and sink.\n\nAnother approach: Let's consider the flow as a directed graph. For each node v, the net outflow is:\n\nnet_out(v) = sum of flows on outgoing edges - sum of flows on incoming edges.\n\nFor the source, net_out(1) = total_flow (since all edges are outgoing).\n\nFor the sink, net_out(n) = -total_flow (since all edges are incoming).\n\nFor all other nodes, net_out(v) = 0.\n\nNow, the problem is to assign directions to edges so that these net_out values are satisfied, and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nThis looks like a problem that can be solved using a modified DFS or BFS traversal, where during traversal, we assign directions to edges based on the current state of the net_out.\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by the Euler tour. For each node, we can calculate the required outflow. Let's say that for each node v, the required outflow is delta[v], which is:\n\ndelta[1] = total_flow (sum of flows on edges connected to source)\ndelta[n] = -total_flow\nfor other nodes, delta[v] = 0.\n\nWait, no. Because for each node, the net_out is the sum of outgoing flows minus incoming flows. Which is equal to the sum of flows on edges directed away from v minus the sum on edges directed towards v. But since the sum of outgoing flows plus the sum of incoming flows is the total sum of flows on edges incident to v, which is fixed, and the net_out is sum_out - sum_in = 0 (for non-source/sink). So sum_out = sum_in = total_sum / 2.\n\nBut how to compute this. Maybe we can model this as a directed graph where for each node, the sum of flows on edges directed away from it is equal to (total_sum / 2), but this depends on the edges.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where we need to assign directions to edges such that for each node v, the sum of flows on edges directed away from v is equal to the required value. Let's call this value req[v].\n\nFor the source, req[1] = sum of all flows on edges connected to it. Because all edges are directed away from the source.\n\nFor the sink, req[n] = 0 (since all edges are directed towards it, so the sum of outgoing flows is zero, and sum of incoming flows is the total flow. So net_out is -total_flow, but req[v] is sum_out - sum_in = -total_flow. Wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, for the source, the net_out is sum_out - sum_in. Since sum_in is zero, net_out is sum_out = total_flow. For the sink, net_out is sum_out - sum_in = -total_flow. For other nodes, net_out is zero.\n\nSo, the problem is to assign directions to edges so that for each node v, the net_out is as described.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of the edges as being directed from u to v or v to u. For each edge, when we direct it from u to v, it contributes +c to the net_out of u and -c to the net_out of v. Conversely, if directed from v to u, it contributes -c to u and +c to v.\n\nSo, the net_out for each node is the sum of contributions from all edges incident to it.\n\nThe problem is to find an assignment of directions to edges such that:\n\n- For node 1: net_out = total_flow (sum of all flows on edges connected to it)\n- For node n: net_out = -total_flow (since sum_out - sum_in is -total_flow)\n- For other nodes: net_out = 0\n\nBut how to find such an assignment.\n\nThis seems like a system of equations, but solving it for large n and m would be computationally expensive.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this as a graph where we need to find a directed graph with certain net outflow per node, and then ensure that the graph is acyclic.\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as a directed graph where we can assign directions based on a spanning tree. For example, build a spanning tree rooted at the source, and assign directions according to the parent-child relationships. But how to handle the flow conservation.\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a flow problem. For each edge, we can assign a direction, which contributes to the net outflow of the nodes. The problem becomes finding a set of directions that satisfy the net outflow constraints.\n\nBut how to compute this. This seems like a problem that can be modeled as a directed graph where each edge has a direction, and the net outflow of each node is known. This is similar to finding an Eulerian trail, but again, not sure.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's consider the net outflow for each node. For the source, the net outflow is total_flow. For the sink, it's -total_flow. For others, it's zero. Now, if we can find a directed graph where each edge is directed from u to v, and the net outflow for each node is as specified, then that would satisfy the flow conservation.\n\nBut how to find such a directed graph. This seems like a problem of finding an orientation of the edges that satisfies the net outflow constraints.\n\nThis problem is known in graph theory. It's called the \"directed graph with given net outflow\" problem. The solution involves checking if the sum of all net outflows is zero. In our case, the sum of all net outflows is total_flow (from source) + (-total_flow) (from sink) + 0 for others, which is zero. So it's possible.\n\nNow, how to find such an orientation. One way to do this is to model it as a flow problem. For example, construct a directed graph where each edge can be oriented in either direction, and find an orientation that satisfies the net outflow.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently. Here's a possible algorithm:\n\nWe can model this as a flow problem where each edge is considered as a bidirectional edge with capacity equal to the flow value. Then, we can use some method to assign directions based on the flow.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a directed graph where we need to assign directions to edges such that the net outflow is satisfied. We can model this as a problem of finding a directed graph with the given net outflow for each node.\n\nTo find such an orientation, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Compute the required net outflow for each node (delta[v]).\n2. Build a directed graph where for each edge, we can choose a direction, and adjust the delta values accordingly.\n\nBut how to do this step by step.\n\nHere's an idea inspired by the Ford-Fulkerson method. Let's process the nodes in some order. For each node, we can direct edges to other nodes in a way that balances the delta.\n\nFor example, start with the source. All edges connected to the source must be directed away from it. This will contribute to the delta of the source and the adjacent nodes.\n\nThen, for other nodes, we can look for edges that are not yet directed and direct them in a way that reduces the delta.\n\nBut this seems vague. Let's think of it more concretely.\n\nSuppose we have a node v that has a positive delta (needs to have more outgoing flow). We can look for an edge connecting v to another node u. If we direct the edge from v to u, then delta[v] decreases by c (since that edge contributes +c to delta[v]), and delta[u] increases by c (since the edge contributes -c to delta[u]).\n\nIf we direct the edge from u to v, then delta[v] increases by c (contribution -c to delta[v] from the edge), and delta[u] decreases by c.\n\nSo the idea is to process nodes with non-zero delta and find edges to direct in a way that reduces their delta.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently.\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved using a priority queue or a queue, where we process nodes with non-zero delta. For example:\n\nInitialize a queue with the source node. The source has a delta equal to the total_flow. For each node in the queue, we look for edges that are not yet directed and direct them in a way that reduces the delta of the current node.\n\nBut how to manage this.\n\nAlternatively, here's a possible algorithm:\n\n- For each node v, compute the required delta[v]. For the source, delta is the sum of flows on edges connected to it. For the sink, delta is -sum of flows on edges connected to it. For others, delta is zero. Wait, no. Because for the source, the net outflow should be the total_flow. The total_flow is the sum of flows on edges connected to the source, since all edges are directed away from the source. So the delta for the source is indeed the sum of flows on its edges.\n\nWait, but how to compute the total_flow. Well, the total_flow is the net outflow of the source, which is the sum of flows on edges directed away from it. Since in the solution, the source has no incoming edges, all edges connected to the source are directed away. So the total_flow is the sum of flows on all edges connected to the source.\n\nBut how to compute this. Well, for the source, the total_flow is the sum of flows on edges connected to it. Similarly for the sink.\n\nBut how to compute the delta for each node. Let me think again.\n\nThe net outflow for node v is:\n\ndelta[v] = sum_{edges directed away from v} c_e - sum_{edges directed towards v} c_e.\n\nInitially, all edges are undirected. We need to assign directions so that this delta matches the required values.\n\nBut how to proceed. Perhaps we can model this as a graph where we process nodes and assign directions to edges to balance the delta.\n\nLet's take an example. Suppose we have a node v with delta[v] = D. We need to find an edge incident to v that we can direct in a way that reduces D. For example, if D > 0, we need to direct some edges away from v to reduce delta[v].\n\nBut how to choose which edge to direct. Perhaps we can process the nodes in some order, and for each node, direct edges to other nodes until delta[v] is zero.\n\nThis sounds like a greedy approach.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\n1. Compute the initial delta for each node. For the source, delta is the sum of flows on its edges. For the sink, delta is -sum of flows on its edges. For others, delta is 0.\n\nWait, no. Initially, no edges are directed. So the delta for each node is zero. But we need to assign directions to edges to reach the required delta.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me rephrase.\n\nThe required delta for each node is:\n\n- For the source (v=1): required_delta[v] = total_flow (which is the sum of flows on edges connected to the source, since all edges are directed away from it).\n- For the sink (v=n): required_delta[v] = -total_flow.\n- For other nodes: required_delta[v] = 0.\n\nInitially, all edges are undirected, so the actual delta is zero. We need to assign directions to edges such that the final delta matches the required delta.\n\nBut how to model this. Each time we direct an edge from u to v, we add +c to delta[u] and subtract c from delta[v].\n\nSo the problem is to assign directions to edges so that the final delta for each node is equal to the required delta.\n\nSo the algorithm can be:\n\n- Initialize delta[v] for all nodes as 0.\n- For each edge, we can choose to direct it from u to v or from v to u. Each choice changes the delta of u and v by +c and -c (or vice versa).\n- We need to choose directions so that after all edges are processed, delta[v] = required_delta[v].\n\nThis is similar to the problem of finding a flow that satisfies certain demands. So perhaps we can model this as a flow problem.\n\nBut how to do this. Let me think of the delta as a variable that we need to adjust.\n\nLet me think of this as a graph where we have to find an assignment of directions to edges such that the delta is adjusted properly.\n\nLet me consider the following approach:\n\nStart with the source node. The required delta for the source is the total_flow. Let's assume that all edges connected to the source are directed away from it. This would contribute +c to the source's delta and -c to the adjacent nodes. However, this may not be sufficient, but perhaps this is a starting point.\n\nOnce the source's edges are directed, we can proceed to other nodes. For example, take a node that has a non-zero delta and find an edge that can be directed to reduce the delta.\n\nBut how to choose which edges to direct. This seems like a problem that can be solved using a BFS or DFS approach, processing nodes with non-zero delta.\n\nLet me think of this as follows:\n\n- We maintain a queue of nodes with non-zero delta.\n- For each node u in the queue, we look for an edge that is not yet directed and connects u to another node v. We direct this edge from u to v if possible, which will reduce the delta of u and increase the delta of v. Or, if directing from v to u would help.\n\nBut how to decide which direction to choose. For example, if the current delta of u is positive, we want to direct edges away from u to reduce the delta. If the current delta is negative, we want to direct edges towards u to increase the delta.\n\nBut this requires knowing which direction to take.\n\nLet's formalize this. Suppose we have a node u with current delta[u] = D. We need to find an edge between u and v that hasn't been directed yet. We can direct it from u to v, which would decrease delta[u] by c (since this contributes +c to delta[u], but we already accounted for that? Or wait, no. When we direct an edge from u to v, the delta[u] increases by c (because the edge contributes +c to the net outflow of u), and delta[v] decreases by c (because the edge contributes -c to the net outflow of v). Or am I getting this wrong?\n\nWait, the net outflow of u is sum of flows on outgoing edges minus sum on incoming edges. If we direct an edge from u to v, then for u, this adds +c to the net outflow. For v, this adds -c to the net outflow. So, when we direct the edge from u to v, delta[u] += c, delta[v] -= c.\n\nInitially, all delta are zero. So, if we direct an edge from u to v, delta[u] becomes c, and delta[v] becomes -c.\n\nBut the required delta for the source is total_flow, which is the sum of flows on all edges connected to the source. So, for example, if the source has two edges with flows c1 and c2, then the required delta for the source is c1 + c2. To achieve this, we need to direct all edges away from the source. For each such edge, directing it away from the source increases the source's delta by c. So after directing all edges away, the delta for the source would be sum of all flows on edges connected to it, which is the required delta.\n\nSo this suggests that for the source, we should direct all edges away from it. Then, for other nodes, we process their deltas.\n\nSo the algorithm could be:\n\n1. For the source, direct all edges away from it. This sets their direction and updates delta for the source and adjacent nodes.\n\n2. For other nodes, process the ones with non-zero delta. For each such node u, find an edge that is not yet directed, connecting u to v. Direct the edge in a way that reduces the delta of u. For example:\n\n   a. If delta[u] > 0: we want to direct an edge away from u. So, we find an edge between u and v, and direct it from u to v. This will decrease delta[u] by c (since directing away from u adds +c to delta[u], but we already have delta[u] as positive, so maybe I'm getting this wrong. Wait, no: initially, delta[u] is some value. When we direct an edge from u to v, delta[u] increases by c, and delta[v] decreases by c. So if we want to reduce delta[u], we need to direct the edge in the opposite direction, from v to u. That would decrease delta[u] by c (since the edge contributes -c to delta[u]).\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's think again.\n\nLet me define:\n\nWhen we direct an edge from u to v:\n\n- delta[u] += c (because the edge contributes +c to the net outflow of u)\n- delta[v] -= c (because the edge contributes -c to the net outflow of v)\n\nIf we direct it from v to u:\n\n- delta[v] += c\n- delta[u] -= c\n\nSo, if the current delta[u] is positive, we want to reduce it. To do this, we can direct an edge from u to v (which increases delta[u], which is bad), or from v to u (which decreases delta[u] by c, which is good).\n\nSo, for a node u with positive delta, we want to find an edge connected to u and direct it towards u (i.e., from the other end to u), which would decrease delta[u].\n\nBut how to find such an edge. For example, if u has a neighbor v, and the edge between u and v is not yet directed, then directing it from v to u would decrease delta[u] by c.\n\nSo, for a node u with positive delta, we can pick any undirected edge connected to u and direct it from the other end to u. This reduces delta[u] by c, and increases delta[v] by c.\n\nSimilarly, if a node u has a negative delta, we want to direct edges away from it (so that delta[u] increases by c), which would be achieved by directing the edge from u to v.\n\nSo, the algorithm could be:\n\n- Maintain a queue of nodes with non-zero delta.\n- While the queue is not empty:\n   - Take a node u from the queue.\n   - If delta[u] is zero, skip.\n   - Find any undirected edge incident to u. Let's say the edge connects u and v.\n   - If delta[u] > 0: we want to direct this edge from v to u. This will decrease delta[u] by c (since delta[u] -= c), and increase delta[v] by c (since delta[v] += c).\n   - If delta[u] < 0: we want to direct this edge from u to v. This will increase delta[u] by c (since delta[u] += c), and decrease delta[v] by c (since delta[v] -= c).\n   - After directing the edge, mark it as directed, and check if the new delta for v is non-zero. If so, add it to the queue.\n\nThis approach ensures that we process the nodes and adjust their delta until all are zero.\n\nBut how to implement this efficiently. For example, how to find an undirected edge incident to a node quickly. For that, we can maintain for each node a list of undirected edges. As we process edges, we remove them from the lists.\n\nBut for large n and m (up to 2e5), this approach needs to be efficient.\n\nLet me think about the data structures. For each node, we can keep a list of edges that are still undirected. When we process an edge, we remove it from both nodes' lists.\n\nBut how to manage this. For example, for each edge, we can store it as part of the adjacency list of both endpoints. Then, when we process a node u and find an edge between u and v, we can direct it and remove it from both u and v's adjacency lists.\n\nBut how to find any edge quickly. For example, for a node u with a non-zero delta, we can pick any edge from its adjacency list. Once processed, it's removed from the list.\n\nThis seems feasible. The key is that for each node, we have a list of edges that are still undirected, and we can pick any of them.\n\nLet's outline this approach:\n\nInitialize:\n\n- For each node u, create a list of undirected edges connected to it. Let's call this adj[u].\n- For each edge (a, b, c), add it to adj[a] and adj[b].\n- Compute the required delta for each node. Initially, all delta are zero.\n- For the source node (1), we need to direct all edges away from it. So for each edge in adj[1], we direct it from 1 to the other node. For each such edge, we update the delta of 1 and the other node. Then, we remove this edge from adj[1] and the other node's adj list.\n- After handling the source, we add all nodes that have non-zero delta to a queue.\n\nThen, process the queue:\n\nWhile the queue is not empty:\n\n   u = dequeue()\n\n   if delta[u] == 0: continue\n\n   if adj[u] is empty: continue (but since the problem says a solution exists, this shouldn't happen)\n\n   pick any edge (u, v, c) from adj[u]\n\n   remove this edge from adj[u] and adj[v]\n\n   if delta[u] > 0:\n\n       direct the edge from v to u (so the direction is v → u)\n\n       delta[u] -= c\n\n       delta[v] += c\n\n   else:\n\n       direct the edge from u to v (so the direction is u → v)\n\n       delta[u] += c\n\n       delta[v] -= c\n\n   if delta[v] != 0 and v is not in the queue, enqueue v.\n\nThis process should eventually balance all deltas to zero.\n\nBut wait, what about the sink node? The required delta for the sink is -total_flow. How is this handled?\n\nBecause initially, the delta for the sink is zero. When we process the edges connected to the sink, we need to direct them in a way that contributes to the required delta.\n\nBut according to the algorithm, the sink's delta will be adjusted during the processing steps. Let's see.\n\nLet me think of the first example:\n\nInput:\n\n3 3\n\n3 2 10\n\n1 2 10\n\n3 1 5\n\nThe source is 1, sink is 3.\n\nTotal_flow is sum of flows on edges connected to source (1). The edges connected to 1 are (1-2, 10) and (1-3, 5). So total_flow is 15.\n\nThe required delta for source (1) is 15, for sink (3) is -15.\n\nInitially, for the source node (1), we process all edges connected to it. So the edges between 1 and 2, and between 1 and 3. These are directed away from 1.\n\nAfter this, the delta for node 1 is increased by 10 (from 1-2 edge) and 5 (from 1-3 edge), totaling 15. The delta for node 2 is decreased by 10 (since the edge is directed from 1 to 2), and delta for node 3 is decreased by ",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies specific flow conservation conditions and is acyclic. The solution involves ensuring that each vertex (except the source and sink) has equal incoming and outgoing flows, the source has no incoming edges, and the graph is acyclic.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialization**: Start by processing all edges connected to the source (vertex 1), directing them away from the source. This ensures the source has no incoming edges.\n2. **Delta Calculation**: Maintain a delta value for each vertex representing the difference between outgoing and incoming flows. The source's delta is initialized to the total flow from it, and the sink's delta is initialized to the negative of this total flow.\n3. **Queue Processing**: Use a queue to process vertices with non-zero deltas. For each vertex, adjust the direction of an undirected edge to balance the delta values until all deltas are zero.\n4. **Edge Direction Adjustment**: Direct edges in a way that reduces the delta of the current vertex. If the delta is positive, direct the edge towards the vertex; if negative, direct it away from the vertex.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    m = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    edges = []\n    adj = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]  # adj[0] unused\n    for i in range(m):\n        a = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        b = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        c = int(input[idx])\n        idx += 1\n        edges.append((a, b, c))\n        adj[a].append((b, c, i))\n        adj[b].append((a, c, i))\n    \n    # Compute total_flow for source\n    total_flow = 0\n    for (a, b, c) in edges:\n        if a == 1 or b == 1:\n            total_flow += c\n    \n    # Initialize delta\n    delta = [0] * (n + 1)\n    delta[1] = total_flow\n    delta[n] = -total_flow\n    \n    # For each node, maintain list of undirected edges\n    # We need to track which edges are still undirected\n    # To do this, we can use a list of lists, where each entry is (neighbor, c, edge_index)\n    # However, we need to remove edges once processed\n    # So, we can use a list for each node, and when an edge is processed, remove it from both nodes' lists\n    \n    # Create adjacency lists with pointers\n    # Let's re-construct adj as a list of lists of tuples (neighbor, c, edge index)\n    # But during processing, we'll remove edges from the lists\n    adj_list = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for i in range(m):\n        a, b, c = edges[i]\n        adj_list[a].append((b, c, i))\n        adj_list[b].append((a, c, i))\n    \n    # Now, process the source's edges\n    # For source (1), direct all edges away from it\n    q = deque()\n    processed = [False] * m  # mark if edge is processed\n    direction = [0] * m  # 0 means a->b, 1 means b->a\n    \n    # Process edges connected to source\n    for (nei, c, i) in adj_list[1]:\n        # Direct from 1 to nei\n        direction[i] = 0\n        processed[i] = True\n        # Update delta\n        delta[1] -= c\n        delta[nei] += c\n    \n    # Now, add nodes with non-zero delta to the queue\n    # Also, need to rebuild the adj_list without processed edges\n    # Rebuild adj_list for remaining edges\n    # But instead of rebuilding, we can manage it by checking if edge is processed\n    # However, for efficiency, we can maintain for each node a list of unprocessed edges\n    # Let's create a new adjacency list for unprocessed edges\n    # We'll use a list of lists for each node, containing (neighbor, c, edge index)\n    # But to avoid modifying the original adj_list, we'll create a new structure\n    # However, for the sake of time, let's proceed with the following approach:\n    # For each node, iterate through its adj_list, and check if the edge is processed\n    # But this may be slow for large data.
