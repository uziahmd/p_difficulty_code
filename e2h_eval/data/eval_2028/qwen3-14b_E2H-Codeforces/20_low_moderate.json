For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's try to understand the problem statement thoroughly.\n\nSo, the problem is about counting the number of ways to choose values c_s for all binary strings s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. The answer needs to be computed modulo 998244353.\n\nLet me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, what's a beautiful multiset? For every binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of binary strings of exactly length n.\n\nThe task is to find how many ways we can assign c_s values (each between 0 and k inclusive) so that the maximum size of such a beautiful multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm. So, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset given the c_s constraints is exactly f. We need to count all such assignments of c_s.\n\nLet me think about how to model this.\n\nFirst, for each possible assignment of c_s values, we need to determine what is the maximum size of a beautiful multiset. Then, count those assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut directly computing this for all possible assignments seems impossible because the number of possible c_s values is enormous. For example, for n=15, there are 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^15 = 2^16 - 2 binary strings of lengths 1 to 15. Each of these has k+1 choices. So even for small n, like 15, the total possibilities are way too big.\n\nTherefore, we need a smarter approach. Let's think about the constraints that the c_s must satisfy for the maximum possible multiset size to be exactly f.\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset. How is it determined?\n\nThe maximum size is determined by the constraints on the prefixes. For example, the multiset is a collection of n-length binary strings. Each such string contributes to the count of all its prefixes. So, for example, the string \"01\" contributes to the counts of \"0\", \"01\".\n\nThe problem is similar to building a trie structure where each node (binary string) has a capacity c_s. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is constrained by the capacities of all prefixes. So, the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is the minimum over all possible constraints imposed by the capacities.\n\nWait, but how do we find the maximum possible size? It's similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of nodes in a trie, given that each node can have at most c_s children. But perhaps it's more like a flow problem or something else.\n\nAlternatively, think of each binary string of length n as a path from the root (empty string) to a leaf. Each node along the path (prefix) must have the number of times it is passed through not exceeding its c_s. However, since each string in the multiset contributes exactly once to each of its prefixes, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum over all possible constraints that could limit the count.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the maximum possible size is the minimum over all c_s multiplied by some factor. Wait, no. For example, for the root (the empty string), the capacity is c_empty. Since all strings in the multiset have the empty string as a prefix, the maximum possible size can't exceed c_empty. Similarly, for each node (prefix) s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is limited by c_s. However, the number of such strings is also constrained by the capacities of the prefixes of s. For instance, if s is a prefix of t, then the count for s must be at least as large as the count for t.\n\nThis seems similar to a problem where the capacities form a hierarchy, and the maximum number of strings is determined by the minimum capacity along some path. Wait, perhaps the maximum possible size is determined by the minimal value of c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}, but that might not be correct. Or maybe it's the minimal value of c_s over all prefixes s of length l, multiplied by something?\n\nAlternatively, consider that for any binary string s of length l, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. Also, each such string is a unique extension of s to length n. Therefore, the maximum number of strings in the multiset that can have s as a prefix is c_s multiplied by 2^{n - l} (since each such string can be extended in 2^{n - l} ways). But this is not necessarily the case because the constraints of longer prefixes may limit it further.\n\nWait,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to count the number of ways to choose values $ c_s $ for all binary strings $ s $ of lengths from 1 to $ n $ such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $ f $. The solution involves understanding the constraints on the prefixes of binary strings and efficiently computing the valid configurations modulo $ 998244353 $.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each binary string $ s $ of length $ l $ can be extended to $ 2^{n-l} $ strings of length $ n $. The maximum number of strings in the multiset that have $ s $ as a prefix is constrained by $ c_s $.\n2. **Hierarchical Constraints**: For a multiset to be beautiful, the constraints on shorter prefixes must be considered. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the minimum capacity constraint along any path from the root (empty string) to a leaf (string of length $ n $).\n3. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**: We use dynamic programming to compute the number of valid configurations efficiently. The key insight is to consider the constraints in a hierarchical manner, starting from the longest strings and moving up to shorter ones.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result can be very large, we use modular arithmetic with the modulus $ 998244353 $.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom functools import lru_cache\n\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    cases = []\n    for i in range(0, len(data), 3):\n        n = int(data[i])\n        k = int(data[i+1])\n        f = int(data[i+2])\n        cases.append((n, k, f))\n    \n    results = []\n    for n, k, f in cases:\n        if f > k * (2**n - 1) or f < 0:\n            results.append(0)\n            continue\n        \n        # Precompute powers of 2\n        max_len = n\n        pow2 = [1] * (max_len + 1)\n        for i in range(1, max_len + 1):\n            pow2[i] = pow2[i-1] * 2 % MOD\n        \n        # dp[l][c]: number of ways to assign c_s for strings of length l, considering the constraints\n        # We need to process from length n down to 1\n        # For each length l, we track how many ways to assign c_s such that the min constraints allow for a max size of exactly f\n        # However, this approach may not be directly feasible due to complexity.\n        # Instead, we think recursively about the constraints for each node in the trie structure.\n        \n        # Let's model it as follows: For each node (binary string s of length l), the maximum number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is c_s.

Each node s (prefix) can have up to c_s children. But each child is a longer prefix. The maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) is the product of the capacities along the path, but this is complex.\n        \n        # However, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}). Because for each node s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. But each such string contributes to the count of its prefixes. So the maximum possible number is limited by the minimum of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} across all nodes s.\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) for all s. Hence, for the maximum size to be exactly f, we need that the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) across all s is exactly f.\n        \n        # So our problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) over all s is exactly f.\n        \n        # Now, the problem becomes: count the number of assignments where the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) is exactly f.\n        \n        # This is a classic inclusion-exclusion problem. We can compute the number of assignments where the minimum is at least f, subtract those where it is at least f+1, and get the count for exactly f.\n        \n        # So the answer is: (number of ways where min >= f) - (number of ways where min >= f+1)\n        \n        # Now, how to compute the number of assignments where the minimum is at least m?\n        \n        # For each node s, we must have c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= m. Which implies c_s >= ceil(m / 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        \n        # However, since c_s is an integer between 0 and k, we need to ensure that for each node s, c_s is at least max(ceil(m / 2^{n - len(s)}), 0), and also <=k.\n        \n        # So for a given m, the number of valid assignments is the product over all nodes s of the number of choices for c_s, which is (k - lower_bound + 1) if lower_bound <=k, else 0.\n        \n        # Therefore, the number of assignments where the minimum is at least m is the product for all s of (k - max(ceil(m / 2^{n - len(s)}), 0) + 1) if that term is non-negative, else 0.\n        \n        # However, we need to compute this for all nodes s.

Each node s (prefix) can have up to c_s children. But each child is a longer prefix. The maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) is the product of the capacities along the path, but this is complex.\n        \n        # However, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}). Because for each node s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. But each such string contributes to the count of its prefixes. So the maximum possible number is limited by the minimum of c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} across all nodes s.\n        \n        # Therefore, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) for all s. Hence, for the maximum size to be exactly f, we need that the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) across all s is exactly f.\n        \n        # So our problem reduces to counting the number of assignments of c_s (each between 0 and k) such that the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) over all s is exactly f.\n        \n        # Now, the problem becomes: count the number of assignments where the minimum of (c_s * 2^{n - len(s)}) is exactly f.\n        \n        # This is a classic inclusion-exclusion problem. We can compute the number of assignments where the minimum is at least f, subtract those where it is at least f+1, and get the count for exactly f.\n        \n        # So the answer is: (number of ways where min >= f) - (number of ways where min >= f+1)\n        \n        # Now, how to compute the number of assignments where the minimum is at least m?\n        \n        # For each node s, we must have c_s * 2^{n - len(s)} >= m. Which implies c_s >= ceil(m / 2^{n - len(s)}).\n        \n        # However, since c_s is an integer between 0 and k, we need to ensure that for each node s, c_s is at least max(ceil(m / 2^{n - len(s)}), 0), and also <=k.\n        \n        # So for a given m, the number of valid assignments is the product over all nodes s of the number of choices for c_s, which is (k - lower_bound + 1) if lower_bound <=k, else 0.\n        \n        # Therefore, the number of assignments where the minimum is at least m is the product for all s of (k - max(ceil(m / 2^{n - len(s)}), 0) + 1) if that term is non-negative, else 0.\n        \n        # However, we need to compute this for all nodes s. For each length l from 1 to n, and for each node of length l, compute the required lower bound for c_s.\n        \n        # Let's precompute for each l (length of s), the value of 2^{n - l} (call it power_l), and then for a given m, the required lower bound is ceil(m / power_l). But since m is fixed, for each l, we can calculate the minimum required c_s for nodes of length l.\n        \n        # Let's proceed with this plan.\n        \n        # First, compute for all l from 1 to n, the number of nodes of length l, which is 2^l.\n        \n        # For a given m, for each l, compute the minimal required value of c_s for nodes of length l: ceil(m / (2^{n - l})). Let's denote this as min_c_l.\n        \n        # For each l, if min_c_l > k, then there are no valid assignments (so the total is zero). Otherwise, for each node of length l, the number of choices is (k - min_c_l + 1) if min_c_l <=k, else 0. So for each l, the contribution is (k - min_c_l + 1)^{number of nodes of length l}.\n        \n        # Thus, for a given m, the total number of assignments where the minimum is at least m is the product over l=1 to n of [(k - max(ceil(m / 2^{n - l}), 0) + 1)^{2^l}], if all terms are non-negative, else 0.\n        \n        # Now, to compute the answer, we calculate:\n        # ans = f_count(f) - f_count(f+1)\n        # where f_count(m) is the number of assignments where the minimum is at least m.\n        \n        # However, note that when m > k * 2^n, f_count(m) is zero.\n        \n        # Now, implement this logic.\n        \n        def compute_f_count(m):\n            res = 1\n            for l in range(1, n+1):\n                power = pow2[n - l]\n                if power == 0:\n                    # This can't happen since n >= l, so n - l >=0\n                    pass\n                required = (m + power - 1) // power  # ceil(m / power)\n                if required > k:\n                    return 0\n                # number of choices for each node of length l is (k - required + 1)\n                cnt = (k - required + 1)\n                if cnt < 0:\n                    return 0\n                # raise to the number of nodes of length l: 2^l\n                exponent = pow2[l]\n                # compute (cnt)^exponent mod MOD\n                # but exponent can be up to 2^15 = 32768, which is manageable with pow\n                term = pow(cnt, exponent, MOD)\n                res = res * term % MOD\n            return res\n        \n        if f > k * pow2[n]:\n            results.append(0)\n            continue\n        \n        # Compute f_count(f) - f_count(f+1)\n        val_f = compute_f_count(f)\n        val_f_plus_1 = compute_f_count(f+1)\n        ans = (val_f - val_f_plus_1) % MOD\n        results.append(ans)\n    \n    for res in results:\n        print(res)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
