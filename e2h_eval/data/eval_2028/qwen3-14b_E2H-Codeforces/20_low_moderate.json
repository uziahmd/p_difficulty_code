For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$. The multiset of strings $$$\\{11, 01, 00, 01\\}$$$ is beautiful, since:  for the string $$$0$$$, there are $$$3$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$0$$$ is their prefix, and $$$3 \\le c_0$$$;  for the string $$$00$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$00$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{00}$$$;  for the string $$$01$$$, there are $$$2$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$01$$$ is their prefix, and $$$2 \\le c_{01}$$$;  for the string $$$1$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$1$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_1$$$;  for the string $$$10$$$, there are $$$0$$$ strings in the multiset such that $$$10$$$ is their prefix, and $$$0 \\le c_{10}$$$;  for the string $$$11$$$, there is one string in the multiset such that $$$11$$$ is its prefix, and $$$1 \\le c_{11}$$$. Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$f$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 15$$$; $$$1 \\le k, f \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer $$$c_s$$$ for every binary string $$$s$$$ of length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $$$f$$$. Since it can be huge, print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 42 2', '2 37 13', '4 1252 325', '6 153 23699', '15 200000 198756']\n\n### Output\n['3', '36871576', '861735572', '0', '612404746']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, the three ways to choose the integers $$$c_s$$$ are:  $$$c_0 = 0$$$, $$$c_1 = 2$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{1, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 1$$$, $$$c_1 = 1$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 1\\}$$$;  $$$c_0 = 2$$$, $$$c_1 = 0$$$, then the maximum beautiful multiset is $$$\\{0, 0\\}$$$. \n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to find the number of ways to choose c_s for all binary strings s (of lengths 1 to n) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to compute this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the description, for every binary string s (of length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. The multiset consists of binary strings of exactly length n.\n\nThe maximum possible size of such a multiset depends on how we choose the c_s values. Our goal is to count all possible assignments of c_s values where this maximum size is exactly f.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. For each possible assignment of c_s, we need to determine what's the maximum size of a beautiful multiset. Then, we want the number of assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute the maximum size given the c_s's?\n\nI recall that this problem resembles some kind of constraints on a trie structure. Each binary string s of length up to n can be considered as a node in a trie. The constraints are that for each node (string s), the number of times it's a prefix in the multiset is <= c_s. However, since the multiset consists of strings of length exactly n, each string in the multiset contributes to all its prefixes. For example, a string of length n contributes to prefixes of lengths 1, 2, ..., n.\n\nSo, the problem is similar to building a collection of n-length strings such that for each prefix s (of any length up to n), the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. And the maximum possible size of such a multiset is determined by these constraints.\n\nThe maximum size would be the minimal value across certain constraints. Wait, perhaps it's similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of elements that can be placed without violating any of the constraints. So, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints on the prefixes.\n\nThis seems like a problem where we can model the constraints using a trie and apply some kind of dynamic programming approach. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a flow network where each node represents a prefix, and the constraints are capacities. But maybe there's a better way.\n\nLet me think recursively. For each string of length n, the number of times it can be included in the multiset is limited by the minimum of the c_s values along its prefixes. For example, if a string is '011' (n=3), then its prefixes are '0', '01', '011'. The maximum number of times this string can be included in the multiset is the minimum of c_0, c_01, c_011. But since the multiset can have multiple copies of the same string, but the constraints are per prefix.\n\nWait, no. Because each occurrence of a string in the multiset contributes +1 to all its prefixes. So, if we have m copies of a particular string s, then for every prefix of s, the count increases by m. Therefore, the constraints are that for every prefix s, the sum over all strings in the multiset of the number of times they have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nBut how do we maximize the total number of elements in the multiset? That's equivalent to choosing a multiset such that for all prefixes, the sum of counts is within their c_s. The maximum size would be the maximum total number of elements that can be placed under these constraints.\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled with a trie structure and some constraints. For example, each node in the trie (representing a prefix) has a capacity c_s. The maximum number of elements in the multiset is the maximum number of strings that can be chosen such that for each node, the number of strings passing through it (i.e., having it as a prefix) is <= c_s.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum?\n\nThis sounds similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of paths in a trie where each node has a capacity. Each path is a string of length n. Each path goes from the root (empty string?) to a leaf (depth n). Each node along the path contributes to the count of that node's capacity. The maximum number of such paths is the maximum number of elements in the multiset.\n\nAh! So the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of paths (each of length n) such that for every node (prefix) in the trie, the number of paths that pass through it is",
    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values $ c_s $ for all binary strings $ s $ (of lengths from 1 to $ n $) such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly $ f $. The solution involves dynamic programming and combinatorial counting.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Constraints**: Each binary string $ s $ of length up to $ n $ has a constraint $ c_s $. A beautiful multiset must ensure that for every prefix $ s $, the number of strings in the multiset with $ s $ as a prefix does not exceed $ c_s $.\n\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Setup**: We use a DP approach where `dp[i]` represents the number of valid ways to assign values to prefixes of length $ i $ such that the constraints are satisfied and the maximum possible size of the multiset is exactly $ f $.\n\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**: For each depth $ i $, we compute the number of ways to choose values for all binary strings of length $ i $ considering the constraints from the previous levels.\n\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result can be very large, we use modulo $ 998244353 $ for all operations.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    cases = []\n    for i in range(0, len(data), 3):\n        n = int(data[i])\n        k = int(data[i+1])\n        f = int(data[i+2])\n        cases.append((n, k, f))\n    \n    results = []\n    for n, k, f in cases:\n        if f > k * (1 << n) - (1 << n) + 1:\n            results.append(0)\n            continue\n        \n        # Precompute powers of 2\n        max_len = n\n        dp = [0] * (max_len + 1)\n        dp[0] = 1  # base case: empty string, but not considered here\n        \n        # For each level from 1 to n\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            prev = dp[i-1]\n            # For each node at level i, we have two children (0 and 1)\n            # The number of ways for this level depends on the previous level\n            # We need to compute how many ways to assign c_s for strings of length i\n            # such that the constraints are maintained\n            \n            # For each node at level i, the number of ways is based on the previous level's count\n            # But since each node at level i has two children, we need to consider the multiplicative effect\n            # However, the exact logic is more involved and requires considering the constraints\n            # Here we use the formula derived from the problem analysis\n            \n            # The number of ways for level i is (k + 1)^(number of nodes at level i) - ... \n            # But the actual calculation involves ensuring that the maximum is exactly f.\n            \n            # However, based on the problem analysis, the correct approach involves:\n            # dp[i] = dp[i-1] * (k + 1)^{2^{i-1}} - ...
