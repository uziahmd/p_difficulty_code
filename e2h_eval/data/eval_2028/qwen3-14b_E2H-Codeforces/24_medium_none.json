She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, Luba has n tabs open, and the mouse is at position pos. She needs to close all tabs except those from l to r inclusive. The goal is to find the minimum number of seconds required to do this. Each second, she can move left or right (but within the current a and b, which are the min and max of the unclosed tabs) or close tabs to the left or right of the current position.\n\nHmm. So the problem is about figuring out the optimal sequence of moves and closes to minimize time. Let's think about what needs to be done.\n\nFirst, the tabs that need to stay open are [l, r]. So any tabs outside this range must be closed. The challenge is to find the minimal steps to close all tabs not in [l, r].\n\nBut how does the process work? Because when you close tabs, the a and b values change. For example, if you close tabs to the left of the current position, then the new a becomes the current position's index (since the previous a was the leftmost tab, but after closing left tabs, the new leftmost is the current position's index? Wait, no. Wait, when you close all tabs to the left of the cursor, then the new a is the current tab's index. Because the current tab is part of the remaining tabs. Because the a and b are the min and max of the unclosed tabs. So, for example, if you have tabs 1-6, and you close tabs left of position 3 (so tabs 1 and 2), then the new a is 3, and b is 6. So, moving and closing depends on the current a and b.\n\nBut since the problem requires that in the end, the tabs are exactly l to r, perhaps we can model the problem by considering the necessary steps to close the left and right parts.\n\nLet me think: the initial a is 1 and b is n. But as we close tabs, these values change. However, the final a and b must be l and r, respectively.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to closing all tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. But how to do that efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: The current position is already within [l, r]. Then, maybe we need to close the tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. But how?\n\nWait, but the initial state is that all tabs are open. So, the initial a is 1 and b is n. So, the first step is to reach a position where you can close the left and right parts.\n\nFor example, suppose that l is 2, r is 4, and the current position is 3. Then, to close tabs to the left of l (i.e., tab 1), you need to move to tab 2 (the leftmost of the desired segment) and close all tabs to the left. Similarly, to close tabs to the right of r (tab 5 and 6?), you need to move to tab 4 (the rightmost of the desired segment) and close all tabs to the right.\n\nBut how to get there?\n\nSo, the steps could be:\n\n- Move to the leftmost of the desired segment (l), then close all tabs to the left (which would take some steps). Then move to the rightmost (r), and close all tabs to the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe you can close both sides in some way. But the order may affect the steps.\n\nBut what if l is 1 and r is n? Then nothing needs to be done. So the answer is zero.\n\nSo, the general approach is to determine whether the current position is already in the desired range. If not, then we need to move to the correct positions to close the left and right parts.\n\nBut let's think about the steps required.\n\nFirst, let's consider the two regions that need to be closed: left of l (if l > 1) and right of r (if r < n).\n\nFor each of these regions, we need to perform a close operation. However, each close operation can only be done once the cursor is at the correct position.\n\nSo, for example, to close the left part (tabs before l), the cursor must be at position l. Then, closing all tabs to the left (from a=1 to l-1). Similarly, to close the right part (tabs after r), the cursor must be at r, and then close all tabs to the right (from r+1 to b=n).\n\nSo, the steps would involve:\n\n1. Moving from the initial position to the position where you can close the left part (if needed).\n2. Closing the left part (costs 1 second).\n3. Moving from that position to the position where you can close the right part (if needed).\n4. Closing the right part (costs 1 second).\n\nBut there might be cases where you can do these steps more efficiently. For example, if you can close both left and right from the same position, but that's probably not possible unless l = r.\n\nWait, for example, if l = r. Then, you have to close all tabs except that one. So, you need to be at that position, and close both left and right. But closing left would close everything to the left, and closing right would close everything to the right. So that's two operations. But maybe you can do it in one step? No, because each second you can do only one action. So, for example, if you are at l, you can close left (which closes all tabs left of l, which is none if l is 1), and then close right (which closes all tabs right of l, which is everything else). So that's two steps.\n\nBut maybe the order of closing left and right matters. For example, if you first close the left, then the right. Or vice versa. But in terms of steps, it's the same.\n\nSo, the key is to calculate the steps needed to reach the positions where you can close the left and right parts, plus the steps to close them.\n\nBut how do we model the movement steps?\n\nLet me think about the movement steps. Let's say that we need to close the left part. So, the cursor must be at l. Similarly, to close the right part, the cursor must be at r.\n\nBut depending on the initial position, and whether we need to close left and/or right, the movement steps vary.\n\nLet me consider different scenarios.\n\nCase 1: l == 1 and r == n. Then, no need to do anything. Answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: l == 1 and r < n. Then, need to close the right part. So, need to move to r, then close right. How many steps to move from pos to r? The steps would be |pos - r|. Then add 1 for closing.\n\nBut wait, what if pos is already at r? Then steps are 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nBut what if the initial position is to the left of r? Like, pos is 2, r is 4. Then, moving to r takes 2 steps (from 2 to 3, then to 4). Then close right (1 sec). So total steps is 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nBut maybe there's a better way. For example, if you can close the right part from a position that's not r? No, because the close operation for the right requires that you are at a position i, and then you close all tabs to the right of i. So, if you are at position r, then closing to the right would close all tabs from r+1 to current b (which is n). So, that's the correct way.\n\nSo, for closing the right part, you need to be at r. Similarly for the left part, you need to be at l.\n\nBut what if you have to close both left and right parts?\n\nFor example, l is 2, r is 4, and initial pos is 3. So, need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 5 and 6, assuming n=6). So, steps:\n\nFirst, move to l (position 2). From pos 3, that's 1 step. Then close left (1 sec). Now, the a is 2, b is 6. Then, need to move from 2 to r (4). That's 2 steps. Then close right (1 sec). Total steps: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5. Which matches the first example given in the problem statement.\n\nYes, the first example input is 6 3 2 4. Output is 5. Which matches this calculation.\n\nAnother example: input 6 3 1 3. Output is 1. Because the current position is 3. To close the right part (tabs 4-6). So, you can close right from position 3. So, that's 1 step. Because the current position is already at 3, which is the left end of the desired segment. So, closing right would close all tabs to the right of 3 (tabs 4-6). So that's 1 second. Hence output is 1.\n\nThird example: input 5 2 1 5. So, nothing to close. Output is 0.\n\nSo, the approach seems to be:\n\nIf the current position is already within [l, r], then:\n\n- If we need to close left (l > 1) and/or right (r < n).\n\nBut how to compute the steps for that.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nFor closing left:\n\n- Need to move to l. The steps to reach l from current position (pos) is |pos - l|.\n\nThen, close left (1 sec).\n\nFor closing right:\n\n- Need to move to r from the current position (after closing left, which is at l). So, steps are |l - r|, then close right (1 sec).\n\nBut if we can combine the movement steps between closing left and closing right?\n\nWait, but if you first close left and then close right, then after closing left, the a is l, and the current position is l. Then, to get to r, you need to move from l to r. So steps |l - r|.\n\nAlternatively, if you first close right, then close left. But that depends on the positions.\n\nBut maybe the optimal way is to choose between the two options: closing left first or right first. Which one gives a better total steps?\n\nBut in some cases, it's possible that moving to l and then to r is better than moving to r and then to l. But since the movement steps are |pos - l| + |l - r|, versus |pos - r| + |r - l|, which are same. So, the total steps for moving is same regardless of the order. So, the order of closing left and right doesn't affect the movement steps. So, the total steps would be (steps to reach l) + 1 (for closing left) + (steps to reach r from l) + 1 (for closing right). Or, alternatively, steps to reach r, then steps to reach l from r, etc.\n\nBut in that case, the total steps would be (steps to reach l) + (steps to reach r from l) + 2. Or steps to reach r + steps to reach l from r + 2. Which is same as |pos - l| + |l - r| + 2, or |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2. Which is same as |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2, or |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2. But since |pos - l| + |r - l| is the same as |pos - r| + |r - l| if pos is between l and r? Not sure. Let me think of an example.\n\nSuppose pos is 3, l is 2, r is 4. Then, |pos - l| is 1, |r - l| is 2. So total movement steps is 1 + 2 = 3. Then adding 2 for the closing steps (total 5). Which is correct as per the first example.\n\nBut if I first go to r (4) from pos 3 (steps 1), then go to l (2) from r (steps 2). So movement steps is 1 + 2 = 3. Then 2 for closing steps. Same total.\n\nSo regardless of the order, the movement steps are same. So, the total steps for closing both left and right is (distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r) + 2. Or (distance from pos to r) + (distance from r to l) + 2. Which is same as |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2. Or |pos - r| + |r - l| + 2. Which is same as |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut in this case, the total steps would be |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2. But what if the initial position is already at l? Then |pos - l| is 0, and steps would be |r - l| + 2. For example, if pos is l, then moving to l is 0 steps, then moving to r is |r - l| steps, then two closes.\n\nBut what if the initial position is already at r? Then |pos - r| is zero. Then steps would be |r - l| + 2. Same as before.\n\nSo, in general, if we need to close both left and right, the steps are (distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r) + 2. Or (distance from pos to r) + (distance from r to l) + 2. Which is same as |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2. But wait, |pos - l| + |r - l| is the same as |pos - l| + (r - l) if l <= r. Since r >= l. So, that's |pos - l| + (r - l) + 2. But that's not necessarily the same as |pos - r| + ... ?\n\nWait, no. Because |pos - l| + (r - l) is same as |pos - r| + (r - l) + (something)? Not sure. Let me take an example.\n\npos is 3, l is 2, r is 4. Then |pos - l| is 1, r - l is 2. So sum is 3. If pos is 3, |pos - r| is 1, and r - l is 2. So same sum. So in this case, yes, the sum is same. So the total steps would be same.\n\nSo, in general, if we need to close both left and right, the steps are |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2. Wait, no. Because the movement steps is |pos - l| + |r - l|, and then two operations (closing left and closing right). So total steps is |pos - l| + |r - l| + 2.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Like, if the initial position is already in the [l, r] range, then maybe you can close both left and right in some way. For example, if you are at l, you can close left (but there's nothing to close if l is 1). Then close right. Or if you are at r, you can close right (nothing to close if r is n), then close left.\n\nBut the formula above seems to account for that.\n\nBut what if you don't need to close both left and right?\n\nLike, if l is 1 and r is 4, and n is 6. Then, you need to close the right part (tabs 5 and 6). So, you need to move to r (4) and close right. Steps would be |pos - r| + 1.\n\nSimilarly, if l is 2 and r is 6 (n is 6), then you need to close left (tabs 1). So steps is |pos - l| + 1.\n\nSo, the general approach would be:\n\nCheck if the current position is within [l, r]. If not, then we need to move to a position where we can close the left and/or right parts. But wait, if the current position is outside [l, r], then perhaps we need to move to l or r first?\n\nBut how can that be? Let's think. Suppose the current position is to the left of l. For example, l is 3, and current pos is 2. Then, the desired segment is [3, r]. So, we need to close tabs to the left of l (which is 1, 2). But to close them, we need to be at l (3) and close left. So, the steps would be to move from pos (2) to l (3) (steps 1), then close left (1 sec). Then, if needed, move to r and close right.\n\nBut in this case, the initial position is not in [l, r], but we can still proceed.\n\nSo, the overall steps would be:\n\nWe need to check whether we need to close left (i.e., l > 1) and/or close right (r < n).\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\ntotal_steps = 0\n\nif l > 1:\n\n   need to close left. So, move to l, then close left.\n\nif r < n:\n\n   need to close right. So, move to r, then close right.\n\nBut the movement steps depend on the order of these operations.\n\nBut how to compute the minimal steps?\n\nLet me think. For example, if we need to close both left and right, then the movement steps are:\n\nsteps to reach l from initial pos, then steps from l to r, then steps for closing.\n\nBut if the initial position is not in [l, r], then maybe moving to l or r first is needed.\n\nBut perhaps the minimal steps can be calculated as follows:\n\nIf we need to close left and right, then the minimal steps is:\n\nmove to l (if not already there) and then move to r (if not already there), plus 2 seconds for closing.\n\nBut how to compute the movement steps?\n\nThe movement steps from initial pos to l, then to r. Or from initial pos to r, then to l. Which is better?\n\nBut the total movement steps would be |pos - l| + |l - r| or |pos - r| + |r - l|. Which is same as |pos - l| + |r - l| or |pos - r| + |r - l|. Which is same as |pos - l| + (r - l) or |pos - r| + (r - l). Which is the same as (r - l) + min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) ?\n\nNo, because for example, if pos is between l and r, then |pos - l| + |r - l| is (pos - l) + (r - l) = r - l + pos - l. Whereas |pos - r| + |r - l| is (r - pos) + (r - l) = 2r - pos - l. Which is different.\n\nBut in this case, the movement steps from pos to l and then to r is |pos - l| + (r - l) steps. Whereas movement steps from pos to r and then to l is |pos - r| + (r - l) steps. Which one is better depends on which is smaller between |pos - l| and |pos - r|.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal path is to move directly to the position that requires fewer steps. But since the movement steps are |pos - l| + (r - l) or |pos - r| + (r - l), then the minimal between the two is (r - l) + min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|).\n\nBut how can we know which is better?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps is |pos - l| + |pos - r| + (r - l) ?\n\nNo, that's not. Because moving from pos to l to r is |pos - l| + (r - l) steps. Moving from pos to r to l is |pos - r| + (r - l) steps. So the total steps for movement is (r - l) + min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|).\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal movement steps is |pos - l| + |pos - r| + (r - l) - something? Not sure.\n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let's think of the movement steps as follows: regardless of the order, the movement steps from pos to l to r is |pos - l| + |l - r|. Similarly, from pos to r to l is |pos - r| + |r - l|. But since |l - r| is same as |r - l|, the total movement steps is either |pos - l| + |r - l| or |pos - r| + |r - l|. So the minimal movement steps is (|r - l|) + min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ). But then, the total steps for movement is that plus 2 for closing.\n\nBut how can we model this in code?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal steps for closing left and right is:\n\nsteps = (distance from pos to l) + (distance from l to r) + 2\n\nOR\n\nsteps = (distance from pos to r) + (distance from r to l) + 2\n\nWhich is same as (distance from pos to l) + (r - l) + 2 or (distance from pos to r) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut since r - l is fixed, the minimal between the two is (r - l) + min( distance from pos to l, distance from pos to r ) + 2.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Because, for example, if pos is closer to l, then moving to l first is better. Then moving to r. So steps is (distance from pos to l) + (r - l) steps for movement, plus 2 for closing.\n\nSo, the total steps would be (distance from pos to l) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut what if pos is already between l and r? For example, pos is in [l, r], then moving from pos to l is (pos - l) steps, then moving to r is (r - l) steps. So total movement steps is (pos - l) + (r - l) = (r - l) + (pos - l) = r - l + (pos - l) = r - l + (pos - l) = r - l + (pos - l) = r - l + (pos - l) ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to think about this. For example, if you need to close both left and right, the minimal steps would be:\n\nThe minimal steps to reach either l or r, then move to the other, and then perform the two closes.\n\nBut perhaps the total movement steps can be considered as the distance from pos to l, plus the distance between l and r, or the distance from pos to r, plus the distance between r and l. But since the distance between l and r is fixed, the minimal movement steps is the minimal between |pos - l| and |pos - r|, added to (r - l).\n\nSo, the total steps for closing both left and right is (min(|pos - l|, |pos - r|) + (r - l)) + 2.\n\nBut wait, for example, in the first sample input: pos is 3, l is 2, r is 4. So min(|3-2|, |3-4|) is 1. (r - l) is 2. So total movement steps is 1 + 2 = 3. Then adding 2 gives 5, which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: if pos is 2, l=2, r=4. Then min(|2-2|, |2-4|) is 0. r-l is 2. movement steps 0 + 2 = 2. Adding 2 gives 4 steps. Let's see: pos is already at l. Then, move to r (steps 2). Close left (already at l, so closing left (but l is 2, which is the left end. So closing left would close tabs from a=1 to i-1 (i is 2). So that's tabs 1. Then, close right from r (4) which is 1 step. So steps are 0 (movement to l) + 1 (close left) + 2 (movement to r) + 1 (close right) = 4 steps. Which matches the calculation.\n\nSo that formula seems to hold.\n\nNow, what if we need to close only left or only right?\n\nCase: need to close left only (l > 1 and r == n). Then steps are |pos - l| + 1.\n\nBecause you need to move to l, then close left (1 step).\n\nCase: need to close right only (r < n and l == 1). Steps are |pos - r| + 1.\n\nBut what if the current position is already at l (for closing left) or r (for closing right)?\n\nThen steps are 0 + 1 = 1.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the algorithm would be:\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck whether we need to close left (left_close = l > 1) and/or right (right_close = r < n).\n\nIf left_close and right_close:\n\n   steps = min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2\n\nelif left_close:\n\n   steps = |pos - l| + 1\n\nelif right_close:\n\n   steps = |pos - r| + 1\n\nBut wait, what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range?\n\nFor example, if pos is in [l, r], and we need to close left and right.\n\nIn that case, the steps would be min( |pos - l|, |pos - r| ) + (r - l) + 2.\n\nBut what if pos is already at l? Then |pos - l| is 0. So steps is 0 + (r - l) + 2.\n\nWhich is (r - l) + 2 steps.\n\nWhich makes sense: move to r from l (steps r - l), then close right (1 step), and close left (1 step). Wait, but the movement steps are (r - l) steps, then two closes. So total steps is (r - l) + 2.\n\nYes.\n\nBut another scenario: pos is already at l. So, need to close left (but l is already the left end, so closing left would close tabs to the left of l, which is nothing. So, is that necessary?\n\nWait, no. Because if l > 1, then we need to close tabs to the left of l. So, even if the current position is l, you need to close left. But when you are at l, closing left would close all tabs from a (initially 1) to l-1. So, that's correct.\n\nSo, the formula holds.\n\nBut what if the current position is not in [l, r]? For example, pos is to the left of l. Then, the steps would be:\n\nFor example, pos is 1, l is 3, r is 5, n is 6. So, need to close left (tabs 1 and 2) and right (tabs 6). So, steps would be min(|1 - 3|, |1 - 5|) = min(2,4) = 2. (r - l) is 2. So steps is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6. Let's see:\n\nMove to l (3) from pos 1: 2 steps. Close left (1 sec). Now, the a is 3, and the current position is 3. Then move to r (5) from 3: 2 steps. Close right (1 sec). Total steps: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 6. Which matches the formula.\n\nSo, the formula seems to work.\n\nNow, what about when the current position is not in [l, r], but we need to close only left or only right?\n\nFor example, pos is 1, l is 2, r is 5 (n=5). So, need to close left (tabs 1). So, steps are |pos - l| + 1 = |1 - 2| + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. Which is correct: move from 1 to 2 (1 step), close left (1 step).\n\nAnother example: pos is 6, l is 2, r is 5 (n=6). Need to close right (tabs 6). So steps are |6 - 5| + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. Which is correct: move from 6 to 5 (1 step), close right (1 step).\n\nSo, the formula works here.\n\nNow, what about when the current position is not in [l, r], but we need to close both left and right?\n\nAnother example: pos is 1, l is 3, r is 5, n=6. As before, steps is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 steps.\n\nBut what if the pos is 6, l=3, r=5, n=6. Need to close left (tabs 1-2) and right (tab 6). So, steps would be min(|6 - 3|, |6 -5|) = min(3, 1) = 1. (r - l) is 2. So steps is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 steps.\n\nLet's see:\n\nOption 1: move to r (5) first. Steps from 6 to 5: 1 step. Then move to l (3): 2 steps. Close right (from 5: close right, which closes 6. Then close left (from 3, close left, which closes 1-2). So steps: 1 (move to r) + 2 (move to l) + 1 (close right) + 1 (close left) = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 steps. Which matches.\n\nAlternatively, moving to l (3) first: steps from 6 to 3 is 3 steps. Then move to r (5): 2 steps. Then 2 closes. Total steps: 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 steps. Which is worse. So the formula correctly takes the min between the two options.\n\nThus, the formula seems to hold.\n\nNow, how to implement this in code?\n\nThe plan is:\n\nRead n, pos, l, r.\n\nCheck if l == 1 and r == n. If yes, output 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute left_close = (l > 1)\n\nCompute right_close = (r < n)\n\nif left_close and right_close:\n\n   steps = min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) ) + (r - l) + 2\n\nelif left_close:\n\n   steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_close:\n\n   steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n   # this case is when l == 1 and r == n, which is already handled earlier.\n\n   steps = 0\n\nBut wait, what if l == 1 and r < n? Then, left_close is false (since l is 1), right_close is true. So steps is abs(pos - r) + 1.\n\nBut what if pos is already at r? Then steps is 0 + 1 = 1, which is correct.\n\nAnother case: l=1, r=3, n=5. So need to close right. So steps is |pos - 3| + 1.\n\nBut what if pos is 3? Then steps is 0 + 1 = 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when the current pos is already in [l, r]?\n\nFor example, pos is 2, l=1, r=3. Then steps is |2 - 3| + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. But in reality, you need to move to r (3) and close right. Which is 1 step. So steps is 1 + 1 = 2 steps? Wait, no. Because the movement steps is |pos - r| = 1 step. Then close right (1 sec). So total steps is 1 + 1 = 2. Which is correct.\n\nSo the formula holds.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the current position is in [l, r], but we need to close right. So, the formula is correct.\n\nAnother case: l=2, r=4, pos=3. Need to close left (l>1) and right (r < n, assuming n is 5). So steps is min( |3-2|, |3-4| ) + (4-2) + 2 = min(1,1) + 2 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 steps. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the current position is already in [l, r], and we need to close both left and right. So, the formula gives the correct steps.\n\nNow, let's think about edge cases.\n\nTest case 1:\n\nn=1, pos=1, l=1, r=1. Output is 0. Correct.\n\nTest case 2:\n\nn=2, pos=1, l=1, r=1. So need to close right (tabs 2). steps is |1 - 1| + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, pos=2, l=1, r=1. Need to close right (tabs 2). So steps is |2 - 1| + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. Which is correct: move from 2 to 1 (1 step), then close right (1 step). But wait, when you are at 1, closing right would close tabs from 2 to current b (which is 2). So yes.\n\nAnother case: n=3, pos=2, l=1, r=3. So no need to close anything. Output is 0.\n\nAnother case: n=3, pos=2, l=1, r=2. So need to close right (tabs 3). steps is |2 - 2| + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, pos=1, l=2, r=3. Need to close left (tabs 1). steps is |1 - 2| + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 steps. Correct: move to 2 (1 step), close left (1 step).\n\nSo, the formula seems to cover all cases.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut wait, what if the current position is already in the [l, r] range, but we need to close left and right?\n\nFor example, pos is 3, l=2, r=4, n=5. Need to close left (tabs 1) and right (tabs 5). So steps is min( |3-2|, |3-4| ) + (4-2) + 2 = 1 + 2 + 2 = 5 steps. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if pos is already at l? For example, pos is 2, l=2, r=4, n=5. Then steps is min(0, |2-4|=2) + (4-2) + 2 → 0 + 2 + 2 = 4 steps. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the code logic is:\n\nif l == 1 and r == n: print 0\n\nelse:\n\nleft_close = l > 1\n\nright_close = r < n\n\nif left_close and right_close:\n\n    steps = min( abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r) ) + (r - l) + 2\n\nelif left_close:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n\nelif right_close:\n\n    steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n\nelse:\n\n    steps = 0\n\nWait, but what if l == 1 and r < n? Then, left_close is false (since l is 1), right_close is true. So steps is |pos - r| + 1. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about when l > 1 and r == n? Then, left_close is true, right_close is false. So steps is |pos - l| + 1. Correct.\n\nSo, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut wait, what about when the current pos is already in the [l, r] range, but we need to close left and right?\n\nYes, the code handles it.\n\nNow, let's check the examples.\n\nFirst example input:\n\n6 3 2 4 → n=6, pos=3, l=2, r=4.\n\nl is 2 > 1, r is 4 < 6 → left and right close needed.\n\nsteps = min( |3-2|=1",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to close all tabs outside the specified range [l, r] while starting from a given position pos. The operations allowed are moving the cursor left or right and closing tabs to the left or right of the cursor.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Immediate Check**: If the desired range [l, r] already covers all tabs (i.e., l=1 and r=n), no operations are needed, so the answer is 0.\n2. **Determine Closing Needs**: Check if there are tabs to the left of l (left_close) and/or to the right of r (right_close).\n3. **Calculate Steps**:\n   - If both left and right tabs need closing, calculate the minimum steps required to move to either end of the range [l, r], then move to the other end, and perform the closing operations.\n   - If only left tabs need closing, calculate steps to move to l and close left.\n   - If only right tabs need closing, calculate steps to move to r and close right.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())\n\nif l == 1 and r == n:\n    print(0)\nelse:\n    left_close = l > 1\n    right_close = r < n\n    if left_close and right_close:\n        min_move = min(abs(pos - l), abs(pos - r))\n        steps = min_move + (r - l) + 2\n    elif left_close:\n        steps = abs(pos - l) + 1\n    elif right_close:\n        steps = abs(pos - r) + 1\n    else:\n        steps = 0\n    print(steps)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Immediate Check**: If the range [l, r] is the entire set of tabs, no action is needed.\n- **Left and Right Close Calculation**: When both ends need closing, the optimal path involves moving to the nearest end of the range, then moving to the other end, and performing the two closing operations. This minimizes movement steps.\n- **Single Side Close**: If only one side needs closing, the steps are simply the movement to the respective end plus one second for closing.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps by considering the shortest path to the necessary ends of the range and accounting for the operations required to close the tabs.",
