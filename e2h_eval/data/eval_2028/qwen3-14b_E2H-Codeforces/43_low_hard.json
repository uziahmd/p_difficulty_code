He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem statement carefully.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a given string could have been formed by a specific process. Let me break down the steps of how the string is built:\n\n1. A starts with some number of 'a's. So the initial string is all 'a's. But there must be at least one 'a' here.\n2. B appends some number of 'b's to the end. So after B's step, the string is a bunch of 'a's followed by 'b's. Also, there must be at least one 'b' here. So the string after B's step has at least one 'a' and one 'b'.\n3. Then C appends some number of 'c's. The number of 'c's added must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string at that point. Also, note that the number of 'c's could be equal to both counts, but that's allowed.\n\nSo the final string must satisfy certain conditions. Let me think about what these conditions are.\n\nFirst, the order of characters must be correct. All 'a's must come before 'b's, which must come before 'c's. Because A adds 'a's first, then B adds 'b's, then C adds 'c's. So the string must be a sequence of a's followed by b's followed by c's. If there's any 'c' before a 'b' or any 'b' before an 'a', that's invalid.\n\nSo the first check is that the string is in the form a*b*c*. So the characters should be grouped, with all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So for example, 'aabbc' is okay, but 'abac' is not because the 'c' comes before the 'b's.\n\nSo first, I need to check that the string is composed of a block of a's, then a block of b's, then a block of c's. Any deviation from this structure would immediately result in a 'NO'.\n\nOnce that's confirmed, the next step is to check the counts.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ncount_a = number of a's in the string\ncount_b = number of b's\ncount_c = number of c's\n\nBut wait, when C adds the c's, the count of c's must be equal to either the count of a's (from before adding c's) or the count of b's (from before adding c's). Wait, but when C adds the c's, the count of a's and b's are the same as in the string before adding the c's. Because the c's are added after the a's and b's.\n\nSo the original string before adding c's is a's followed by b's. Then, the count of a's is count_a_initial (which is the same as count_a in the final string), and count_b_initial is count_b in the final string. Then, the count_c in the final string must be equal to either count_a_initial or count_b_initial.\n\nBut wait, the count_c is exactly the number of c's added. Because before adding the c's, there were zero c's. So the count_c in the final string is exactly the number added by C. So the condition is that count_c must be equal to count_a_initial (the original a's) or count_b_initial (original b's). But since the original a's and b's are the same as in the final string (because the c's are added after), then the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nWait, no. Because in the final string, count_a is the same as the original count of a's (since no a's were added after the initial step). Similarly for count_b. So the count_c must be equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nSo the conditions are:\n\n- The string is in the form a*b*c* (so all a's first, then all b's, then all c's)\n- There's at least one a and one b (since A and B added at least one each)\n- The count of c's is equal to count_a or count_b.\n\nBut also, since C adds the c's, the count_c can't be zero. Wait, no. Because the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. So the count_c must be at least 1? Or can it be zero?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" The term \"some number\" here probably means at least one. Because if it was zero, then C didn't append anything. But let's check the problem statement again.\n\nLooking back: The problem says that C appends some number of letters '",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific process where the string is initially composed of 'a's, followed by 'b's, and finally 'c's. The number of 'c's added must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's present before adding the 'c's.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Character Order**: The string must consist of all 'a's followed by all 'b's and then all 'c's. Any deviation from this order (e.g., 'c' appearing before 'b') makes the string invalid.\n2. **Check Minimum Counts**: There must be at least one 'a' and one 'b' in the string since both A and B added at least one of their respective characters.\n3. **Check Count Conditions**: The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef check_string(s):\n    # Check the order: all a's first, then all b's, then all c's\n    # We can iterate through the string and ensure that the characters are in order\n    i = 0\n    n = len(s)\n    \n    # Check for a's first\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'a':\n        i += 1\n    # Now check for b's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'b':\n        i += 1\n    # Now check for c's\n    while i < n and s[i] == 'c':\n        i += 1\n    \n    if i != n:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Now count the number of a, b, c\n    count_a = s.count('a')\n    count_b = s.count('b')\n    count_c = s.count('c')\n    \n    # Check if there is at least one a and one b\n    if count_a == 0 or count_b == 0:\n        return \"NO\"\n    \n    # Check if count_c is equal to count_a or count_b\n    if count_c == count_a or count_c == count_b:\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"\n\n# Read input and process each test case\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    # Split the input into list of strings\n    test_cases = input_str.split(', ')\n    results = []\n    for case in test_cases:\n        result = check_string(case)\n        results.append(result)\n    print('[' + ', '.join(results) + ']')\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The code first checks if the string is composed of all 'a's followed by all 'b's and then all 'c's. This is done by iterating through the string and ensuring that each character group transitions correctly from 'a' to 'b' to 'c'.\n2. **Count Validation**: After confirming the order, the code counts the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'. It ensures there is at least one 'a' and one 'b' as required by the problem constraints.\n3. **Condition Check**: Finally, the code checks if the number of 'c's matches either the number of 'a's or 'b's, which is necessary according to the problem's rules.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks all the required conditions in linear time relative to the length of the string, making it suitable for the given input constraints.",
