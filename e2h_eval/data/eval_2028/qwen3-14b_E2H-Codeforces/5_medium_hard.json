Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ — the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which can be a lowercase letter or '?'. The goal is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair is a left and a right boot with compatible colors. And then output those pairs.\n\nCompatibility rules: two specific colors must be the same. A '?' can match any color, including another '?'. So for example, if a left boot is 'a' and a right is '?', that's okay. Or if both are '?', that's also okay.\n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs, making sure each boot is used at most once.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, I think we can model this as a bipartite graph matching problem, where left boots are on one side, right on the other, and edges represent compatibility. Then, finding the maximum matching. However, with n up to 150,000, standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp would be too slow. Because Hopcroft-Karp is O(E√V), and E could be O(n²) in worst case. Which is not feasible for n=1.5e5.\n\nSo we need a greedy approach or some way to compute the maximum efficiently without checking all possibilities.\n\nAlternative idea: group the boots by their colors, considering the question marks.\n\nLet me think. Let's first consider the specific colors (non '?').\n\nFor each color c (from a-z), count how many left boots have color c (call it left_c) and how many right boots have color c (right_c). The maximum possible pairs for color c is min(left_c, right_c). But since a '?' can be used as a wildcard, perhaps we can use them to fill in the gaps.\n\nBut how to handle the '?'s?\n\nLet me think. First, process the specific colors. For each color c, pair as many left and right boots as possible. Then, use the remaining '?'s from left and right to pair with each other or with the leftover specific colors.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a better way. Let me think:\n\nLet's separate the left and right boots into two groups:\n\n- Left boots with specific colors (not '?')\n- Left boots with '?'\n\nSame for right boots.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n1. Pair left specific with right specific. For each color c, pair as many as possible. For example, for color 'a', take min(left_a, right_a) pairs. Then subtract those from left and right counts.\n\nBut how to track which boots are used? Well, perhaps first, we can collect all the left and right boots for each color, and then pair them.\n\nBut how to do that in practice?\n\nAlternatively, think about the following:\n\nWe can first pair left and right boots where both are specific colors and same. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (including those with '?'), we can pair the '?'s with others.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to:\n\n- Pair as many specific color pairs as possible (left c with right c).\n\n- Then, pair the remaining left '?'s with the remaining right boots (specific or '?') and vice versa.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nAlternatively, here's a plan:\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of counts.\n\nLet’s first process all the non-question mark colors.\n\nFor each color c (a-z):\n\n- Let left_count[c] be the number of left boots with color c.\n- Let right_count[c] be the number of right boots with color c.\n\nThe number of pairs between left and right for color c is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). But after pairing, we can subtract these from left_count and right_count.\n\nThen, for the remaining left and right boots (those that couldn't be matched with their specific color), we have:\n\nLeft_remaining: left_question_marks + left_colors_with_unmatched_counts.\n\nRight_remaining: right_question_marks + right_colors_with_unmatched_counts.\n\nBut how to pair them?\n\nThe remaining left and right boots can be paired using the question marks. For example, a left '?' can pair with any right boot (specific or '?'), and a right '?' can pair with any left boot.\n\nBut how to maximize the number of pairs here?\n\nLet me think. The total number of left and right boots that are not yet paired is:\n\nleft_total = sum over all left_count[c] (after initial pairing) + left_question_marks ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, during the initial step, for each color c, we pair min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). So for example, if left has 5 a's and right has 3 a's, we pair 3, leaving left with 2 a's. These 2 a's are now unpaired, and can't be paired with anything except a '?' on the other side.\n\nSo after pairing the specific colors, the left has some specific colors (unpaired) and some '?'s. Similarly for the right.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the remaining left and right boots. How?\n\nLet me think of the remaining left and right:\n\n- For left, there are:\n\n   - Some left boots with specific colors (say, L_s) that couldn't be paired (because there were not enough right boots of that color).\n\n   - Some left boots with '?' (L_q).\n\nSimilarly for right:\n\n   - Some right boots with specific colors (R_s) that couldn't be paired.\n\n   - Some right boots with '?' (R_q).\n\nNow, the maximum number of pairs is:\n\nmin( (L_s + L_q), (R_s + R_q) ) ?\n\nNo, because not all can be paired. For example, if L_s is 2, and R_s is 3, and L_q is 1, R_q is 1. Then, the total possible pairs is 2+1+1 = 4? No, but the sum of L_s + L_q is 3, sum of R_s + R_q is 4. So the maximum possible is 3.\n\nBut how to pair them optimally?\n\nThe idea is to pair the L_s with R_q, and R_s with L_q, and then pair the remaining with each other.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think:\n\nLet’s first pair as many as possible between L_s and R_q. For each specific color in L_s, we can pair it with a R_q. Similarly, pair R_s with L_q.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nAlternatively, the number of pairs that can be formed between L_s and R_q is the total number of L_s (since each can be paired with a R_q). Similarly for R_s and L_q.\n\nBut we have to make sure that the total doesn't exceed the available R_q and L_q.\n\nLet me think:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA = number of left specific unpaired (L_s) = sum over all colors c (left_count[c] after initial pairing)\n\nB = number of right specific unpaired (R_s) = sum over all colors c (right_count[c] after initial pairing)\n\nC = number of left '?'s (L_q) = original left '?' count minus any used in previous steps (but in our initial step, we didn't use them)\n\nWait, in the initial step, we only paired specific colors. So the left '?'s are still all available. Similarly for the right '?'s.\n\nSo, after initial pairing, the left '?' count is the original number of '?'s in l string. Same for the right.\n\nSo, the remaining left and right boots are:\n\nLeft: A (specific colors) and C (question marks)\n\nRight: B (specific colors) and D (question marks)\n\nWe need to pair these.\n\nThe maximum possible pairs here is the minimum between (A + C) and (B + D). But how to achieve that?\n\nLet me think of this as a bipartition. We can pair:\n\n- All possible A with D (each specific left can be paired with a right '?').\n\n- All possible B with C (each specific right can be paired with a left '?').\n\n- Then, the remaining (C - ...) and (D - ...) can be paired together.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nLet me think:\n\nLet me first pair as much as possible between A and D. Since A is the number of left specific unpaired, and D is the number of right '?'. So the maximum possible here is min(A, D). Let's say we pair x = min(A, D) pairs here. Then, after that, the remaining A' = A - x, and D' = D - x.\n\nSimilarly, pair as much as possible between B and C. Let y = min(B, C). Then, after that, B' = B - y, and C' = C - y.\n\nNow, the remaining A' and B' are specific colors that couldn't be paired with the question marks. But they can't be paired with each other (since they are specific, and different colors). However, the remaining C' and D' are question marks. So they can be paired between themselves. The number of pairs here is min(C', D').\n\nBut the total pairs here is x + y + min(C', D').\n\nBut what is the total possible?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let me think about the total possible pairs here. The maximum possible is (A + C) + (B + D) - max(A + C, B + D). Which is min(A + C, B + D). So the sum of all possible pairs is min(A + C, B + D).\n\nBut how to reach that?\n\nAnother approach is to pair the specific with the question marks, and then pair the remaining question marks.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nTotal possible pairs is:\n\nnumber of pairs between A and D (but can't exceed A and D) +\n\nnumber of pairs between B and C (but can't exceed B and C) +\n\nnumber of pairs between the remaining (C - ...) and (D - ...).\n\nBut this may not be optimal. For example, suppose A=3, B=3, C=3, D=3.\n\nIf we pair A with D (3 pairs), then B with C (3 pairs), and nothing remains. Total 6 pairs. Which is min(3+3, 3+3) = 6. Correct.\n\nAnother example: A=2, B=2, C=2, D=2. Suppose we pair A with D (2 pairs), B with C (2 pairs) → 4 pairs. Which is min(4,4)=4.\n\nAnother example: A=2, B=1, C=3, D=2. So A + C = 5, B + D = 3 → total pairs is 3. How?\n\nPair A with D (min(2,2) = 2 pairs). Then B (1) with C (3) → 1 pair. Now, C is 3-1=2, D is 2-2=0. So remaining C is 2, D is 0. Can't pair. So total is 2+1=3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother scenario: A=2, B=3, C=1, D=3. So A + C = 3, B + D = 6 → min is 3. How?\n\nPair A (2) with D (3) → 2 pairs. Then B (3) with C (1) → 1 pair. Remaining B is 3-1=2, D is 3-2=1. Then, C is 0, D is 1. So can't pair further. Total 2+1=3. Correct.\n\nBut suppose in another scenario, pairing B with C first would be better. Like, if A=1, B=1, C=1, D=1. If you pair A with D (1 pair) and B with C (1 pair) → total 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut if you pair B with D (1 pair) and A with C (1 pair) → same result.\n\nSo regardless of the order, the total is the same. So perhaps the order doesn't matter. Thus, the approach of pairing A with D, then B with C, then the remaining C and D can be paired.\n\nBut how to compute this?\n\nSo, the algorithm would be:\n\n1. For each color c (a-z), pair as many left and right boots as possible (i.e., min(left_count[c], right_count[c])). Record these pairs.\n\n2. After that, collect all the left boots that are specific colors and not yet paired (call them left_s) and all the right boots that are specific colors and not yet paired (call them right_s). Also, collect all the left '?'s (left_q) and right '?'s (right_q).\n\n3. Now, pair left_s with right_q as much as possible. For example, take the left_s (each is a specific color) and pair them with right_q (each is '?'). The number of such pairs is min(len(left_s), len(right_q)).\n\n4. Then, pair right_s with left_q as much as possible. The number is min(len(right_s), len(left_q)).\n\n5. Then, pair the remaining left_q and right_q. The number is min(remaining left_q, remaining right_q).\n\nSo, the sum of all these steps gives the maximum possible pairs.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut the problem is not just counting, but actually finding the pairs. So, we need to track which boots are used, and which are not.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFirst, process the specific color pairs.\n\nFor example, for each color c in a-z:\n\n- collect all left boots with color c (indices) and right boots with color c (indices).\n\n- pair them as much as possible. For example, if there are 5 left and 3 right, pair the first 3 left with the first 3 right.\n\nBut how to track which ones are already paired? We need to mark them as used.\n\nOnce that is done, we collect the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired) which have specific colors (they couldn't be paired with their corresponding color on the other side) and the '?'s.\n\nThen, for the second phase, pairing left_s with right_q.\n\nWe can collect all the left_s (specific colors) and right_q (question marks). Then, pair each left_s with a right_q. For example, take the first k left_s and pair with first k right_q, where k is the minimum between the two.\n\nSimilarly for the right_s and left_q.\n\nThen, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to collect the indices of these boots?\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each left boot, track whether it's been used.\n\n- Same for right boots.\n\nSo, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, read n, l, r.\n\nInitialize arrays for left and right boots, tracking whether they are used.\n\nThen, for each color c in a-z:\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used.\n\n   collect all right indices where r[j] == c and not used.\n\n   pair as many as possible. For example, take min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs. For each pair, mark them as used.\n\nBut how to collect these lists? For each color, we can precompute the list of left and right indices. But since we need to process them in order, perhaps we can create for each color a list of left and right indices, and then for each color, process them.\n\nBut for the first step, for each color, we can iterate through all left and right boots and collect their indices. But that would be O(n * 26) time, which is acceptable for n=1.5e5.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to precompute for each color, the list of left and right indices.\n\nBut for the first step, the code would be:\n\nused_left = [False] * n\n\nused_right = [False] * n\n\npairs = []\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_indices = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n    right_indices = [j for j in range(n) if r[j] == c and not used_right[j]]\n\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_indices), len(right_indices))\n\n    for k in 0 to num_pairs - 1:\n\n        pairs.append( (left_indices[k]+1, right_indices[k]+1) )\n\n        used_left[left_indices[k]] = True\n\n        used_right[right_indices[k]] = True\n\nWait, but this would require for each color, to collect the indices. However, this approach may not be efficient for large n. Because for each color, we have to loop through all n elements. For 26 letters, that would be O(26n) = O(n), which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize by precomputing for each color, the list of indices for left and right.\n\nBut for code purposes, perhaps it's easier to process each color in a loop.\n\nOnce that's done, the first step is complete.\n\nThen, collect the remaining left and right boots.\n\nFor the left_remaining, collect all left boots not used, with color not '?'.\n\nSimilarly for right_remaining.\n\nThen, collect left_q (all left not used, with color '?')\n\nand right_q (all right not used, with color '?')\n\nThen, process the second phase: pairing left_remaining (specific) with right_q.\n\nSo, collect left_s = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nright_q = [j for j in range(n) if not used_right[j] and r[j] == '?']\n\nTake the minimum of len(left_s) and len(right_q), say m. Pair the first m left_s with first m right_q. Mark them as used.\n\nThen, collect right_s = [j for j in range(n) if not used_right[j] and r[j] != '?']\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nTake the minimum of len(right_s) and len(left_q), say p. Pair the first p right_s with first p left_q. Mark as used.\n\nThen, collect the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nleft_q_remaining = [i for i in ...]\n\nright_q_remaining = [j for j in ...]\n\npair as many as possible between them. For example, min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining)), and pair each.\n\nBut how to collect these lists?\n\nBut in code, perhaps we can collect all the left_s, right_q, etc. as lists, and then process them.\n\nBut for the code, let's think:\n\nAfter the first phase, for the left and right boots, we have:\n\nleft_available = [i for i in 0..n-1 if not used_left[i]]\n\nBut perhaps we can collect the left_s and left_q as follows:\n\nleft_s = []\nleft_q = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not used_left[i]:\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            left_s.append(i)\n        else:\n            left_q.append(i)\n\nSimilarly for right_s and right_q.\n\nThen, the second phase:\n\nWe can pair left_s with right_q.\n\nFor example, take the first k = min(len(left_s), len(right_q)) pairs.\n\nFor each pair in 0..k-1:\n\n   pairs.append( (left_s[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) )\n\n   mark used_left[left_s[i]] = True\n\n   mark used_right[right_q[i]] = True\n\nThen, collect new left_s and right_s (but after this, the left_s and right_q have been modified).\n\nBut after this step, the left_s and right_q are updated. Then, collect again:\n\nright_s = [j for j in range(n) if not used_right[j] and r[j] != '?']\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nThen pair right_s with left_q.\n\nSimilarly, take min(len(right_s), len(left_q)) pairs.\n\nThen, collect remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nFinally, pair them.\n\nBut how to collect these?\n\nBut perhaps in code, after the first step, we can collect the left_s and left_q, then process them step by step.\n\nBut for code, perhaps the following steps:\n\nAfter the first phase, collect all left_s and left_q, right_s and right_q.\n\nThen:\n\n# Step 2: Pair left_s with right_q\nleft_s = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\nright_q = [j for j in range(n) if not used_right[j] and r[j] == '?']\nk = min(len(left_s), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(k):\n    pairs.append( (left_s[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) )\n    used_left[left_s[i]] = True\n    used_right[right_q[i]] = True\n\n# Step 3: Pair right_s with left_q\nright_s = [j for j in range(n) if not used_right[j] and r[j] != '?']\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\np = min(len(right_s), len(left_q))\nfor i in range(p):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i]+1, right_s[i]+1) )\n    used_left[left_q[i]] = True\n    used_right[right_s[i]] = True\n\n# Step 4: Pair remaining left_q and right_q\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\nright_q = [j for j in range(n) if not used_right[j] and r[j] == '?']\nm = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(m):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) )\n    used_left[left_q[i]] = True\n    used_right[right_q[i]] = True\n\nBut wait, in step 2, after pairing left_s and right_q, the left_s are marked as used. So when collecting right_s in step 3, it's the right boots that are not used and have specific colors. Similarly for left_q in step 3.\n\nBut in code, after step 2, the left_s are marked as used. So the left_q in step 3 is the ones not used and with '?'.\n\nThis seems correct.\n\nBut what about the order in which the pairs are made? For example, in step 2, pairing left_s with right_q. But in code, the left_s are collected as all the left boots not used and not '?'. So for example, if there are multiple colors, but they are all left_s. However, since they are all specific colors, they can be paired with any right_q. So the order in which we pair them does not matter. Similarly for the rest.\n\nThis approach should give the maximum number of pairs.\n\nBut why? Because:\n\nThe first step pairs as many as possible between specific colors.\n\nThen, the second step uses the left specific and right '?' to pair as much as possible.\n\nThird step uses right specific and left '?'.\n\nFourth step uses the remaining '?'s.\n\nThis should cover all possibilities and maximize the total.\n\nNow, the problem is to implement this in Python, handling the indices correctly.\n\nBut for n up to 1.5e5, the code needs to be efficient. However, creating lists for left_s, right_q, etc. in each step may be O(n) per step, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for example, in the first step, for each color, we generate the list of left and right indices. However, that would be O(n) per color, leading to O(26n) time. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize that.\n\nAlternative approach for the first step:\n\nWe can precompute for each color, the list of left and right indices. Then, for each color, process the pairs.\n\nBut in code, for the first step, the code would be:\n\nused_left = [False]*n\nused_right = [False]*n\n\npairs = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    # collect all left indices with color c and not used\n    left_list = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i] and l[i] == c:\n            left_list.append(i)\n    \n    # collect all right indices with color c and not used\n    right_list = []\n    for j in range(n):\n        if not used_right[j] and r[j] == c:\n            right_list.append(j)\n    \n    # pair as many as possible\n    num = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for k in range(num):\n        pairs.append( (left_list[k]+1, right_list[k]+1) )\n        used_left[left_list[k]] = True\n        used_right[right_list[k]] = True\n\nBut this would be O(n*26) time. Which for n=1.5e5 is 3.9e6 operations. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut for Python, this may be slow. Because for each color, looping through all n elements. For 26 letters, that's 26*n iterations. For n=1.5e5, that's 3.9e6, which is manageable.\n\nAlternatively, we can precompute for each color, the list of indices once. For example:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color_indices = defaultdict(list)\nright_color_indices = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    left_color_indices[l[i]].append(i)\n\nfor j in range(n):\n    right_color_indices[r[j]].append(j)\n\nThen, for each color c, we can process left and right lists. However, during the first phase, we need to process the lists, removing the elements that are already used. But this approach would not work directly, because once we pair some elements, we need to remove them from the lists. However, since we process the colors in order, perhaps we can track the current index in the lists.\n\nBut this would complicate the code.\n\nAlternatively, during the first phase, for each color c, we can process the left and right lists as follows:\n\nfor each color c in a-z:\n\n    left_list = list of indices for left boots with color c (precomputed)\n    right_list = list of indices for right boots with color c (precomputed)\n    take the first m elements from left_list and right_list, where m is min(len(left_list), len(right_list)), but also considering that some of them may have been used already.\n\nBut this approach would not work, because the precomputed lists include all the indices, but during processing, some of them may have been already used.\n\nSo perhaps the initial approach of looping through all elements for each color is better, even though it's O(26n) time.\n\nBut for Python, perhaps it's better to find a way to avoid that.\n\nAlternative idea: For the first phase, for each color c, we can collect the list of left and right indices once, and then process them with pointers.\n\nBut during the first phase, for each color c, we can have:\n\nleft_ptr = 0\n\nright_ptr = 0\n\nBut how to track which indices are already used?\n\nAlternatively, during the first phase, for each color c, we can collect all left indices with color c, and all right indices with color c. Then, for each color, pair as many as possible, but only those that are not yet used.\n\nBut how to track that? Well, for the first phase, the used arrays are initially all False. So during the first phase, for each color, the left_list is all left indices with color c, and same for right_list. Then, we can pair as many as possible. Once paired, they are marked as used.\n\nSo, for example, precompute for each color c, the list of left indices and right indices. Then, during the first phase, for each color c:\n\nleft_list = precomputed list of left indices with color c.\n\nright_list = precomputed list of right indices with color c.\n\nnum_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\nfor k in 0 to num_pairs-1:\n\n    pairs.append( (left_list[k]+1, right_list[k]+1) )\n\n    mark used_left[left_list[k]] = True\n\n    mark used_right[right_list[k]] = True\n\nBut this is incorrect. Because the precomputed lists may have indices that were already used in previous steps. For example, if a left index was processed for color 'a' and paired, but later when processing color 'a' again, it's already used.\n\nWait no. Because during the first phase, we process each color once. For example, for color 'a', we collect all left indices with color 'a' (which are not used yet, since used arrays are initialized to False). Then, pair them with right indices of color 'a' (also not used). Once paired, they are marked as used. So during the first phase, for each color c, the left_list and right_list are those not used yet. But how?\n\nBecause when we process color 'a', we collect all left indices with color 'a' that are not used. But in the code above, the precomputed lists contain all indices of color 'a', including those that may have been used in previous steps. Which is not correct.\n\nThus, the initial approach of for each color, looping through all the indices again is necessary. Because the used arrays are being updated as we go.\n\nSo, the code for the first phase must check for used status each time.\n\nTherefore, the initial approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead n, then l and r.\n\nThen, for each color in 'a' to 'z', process as described.\n\nOnce that is done, collect the left_s, left_q, etc.\n\nBut for the code, in Python, the first step can be written as:\n\nn = int(input())\nl = input().strip()\nr = input().strip()\n\nused_left = [False]*n\nused_right = [False]*n\npairs = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    # collect left indices with color c and not used\n    left_list = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i] and l[i] == c:\n            left_list.append(i)\n    # collect right indices with color c and not used\n    right_list = []\n    for j in range(n):\n        if not used_right[j] and r[j] == c:\n            right_list.append(j)\n    # pair as many as possible\n    num = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for k in range(num):\n        pairs.append( (left_list[k]+1, right_list[k]+1) )\n        used_left[left_list[k]] = True\n        used_right[right_list[k]] = True\n\nThen, after this, collect left_s, left_q, right_s, right_q.\n\nBut in code:\n\nleft_s = []\nleft_q = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not used_left[i]:\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            left_s.append(i)\n        else:\n            left_q.append(i)\n\nright_s = []\nright_q = []\nfor j in range(n):\n    if not used_right[j]:\n        if r[j] != '?':\n            right_s.append(j)\n        else:\n            right_q.append(j)\n\nThen, step 2: pair left_s with right_q.\n\nk = min(len(left_s), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(k):\n    pairs.append( (left_s[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) )\n    used_left[left_s[i]] = True\n    used_right[right_q[i]] = True\n\nThen, collect new left_q and right_s:\n\nleft_q_new = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?':\n        left_q_new.append(i)\nright_s_new = []\nfor j in range(n):\n    if not used_right[j] and r[j] != '?':\n        right_s_new.append(j)\n\nWait, but after the previous step, some elements in left_s and right_q are marked as used. So after pairing left_s with right_q, the left_s elements are now marked as used. So, for the next step, when collecting left_q, it's the left boots not used and with '?'. Similarly for right_s.\n\nBut in code, after step 2, we can re-collect left_q and right_s.\n\nBut perhaps it's more efficient to collect them again.\n\nBut in code, after step 2, we can collect:\n\n# Step 3: pair right_s with left_q\n# collect right_s and left_q again\nright_s = []\nfor j in range(n):\n    if not used_right[j] and r[j] != '?':\n        right_s.append(j)\nleft_q = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?':\n        left_q.append(i)\np = min(len(right_s), len(left_q))\nfor i in range(p):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i]+1, right_s[i]+1) )\n    used_left[left_q[i]] = True\n    used_right[right_s[i]] = True\n\nThen, step 4:\n\n# collect remaining left_q and right_q\nleft_q = []\nfor i in range(n):\n    if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?':\n        left_q.append(i)\nright_q = []\nfor j in range(n):\n    if not used_right[j] and r[j] == '?':\n        right_q.append(j)\nm = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(m):\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) )\n    used_left[left_q[i]] = True\n    used_right[right_q[i]] = True\n\nBut this code would be O(n) for each of these steps. Which for n=1.5e5 is acceptable.\n\nNow, the problem is that the code may be too slow for Python, but given that the constraints are tight, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut let's test with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n10\ncodeforces\ndodivthree\n\nSample Output: 5 pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the code would generate that.\n\nBut let's not get into that now.\n\nNow, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nBut what about the case where there are multiple ways to pair? For example, when there are multiple options for pairing, the code chooses the first ones. But the problem allows any correct pairing.\n\nNow, the code may not be optimal? For example, is there a scenario where the first approach (pairing specific colors first) is not optimal?\n\nNo, because pairing specific colors first is the optimal way. Because pairing specific colors with specific colors gives a certain number of pairs. Then, the question marks can be used to fill in the gaps.\n\nBut perhaps there's a scenario where pairing some specific colors with question marks first would allow more pairs overall. For example, if there are left specific colors and right question marks, and right specific colors and left question marks. But the code pairs the left specific with right question marks first. Which is correct.\n\nBut the code's approach is correct.\n\nSo, the code should work.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python, handling multiple test cases. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as per the examples. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as follows:\n\nThe first line contains n.\n\nThe second line contains the string l.\n\nThe third line contains the string r.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nBut perhaps the actual input is multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains n...\n\nBut the sample input shows four different inputs. Which suggests that the problem may have multiple test cases. But looking back at the problem statement, the original problem says:\n\nThe input is given as per the first example. But perhaps the user provided multiple test cases in the sample. However, the problem statement says:\n\nIn the input, the first line contains n, then l, then r.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are four test cases. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases?\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user provided an example with four inputs and outputs. However, the actual problem says that the input is given as per the first example. So perhaps the code should process a single test case. However, the sample input seems to be multiple test cases, but that may be part of the way the user presented the example. For example, perhaps the sample input is four separate test cases, each with their own output.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input is a single test case. Therefore, the code should read n, l, r, and output the answer.\n\nBut the sample input shows four test cases, which may be a mistake. However, the user's note says:\n\n\"Your task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\"\n\nSo, the code must read from stdin, which for the problem is a single test case. However, the sample input shows multiple test cases. But perhaps that's a formatting error.\n\nBut regardless, the code must process a single test case.\n\nThus, the code should read n, then l, then r.\n\nBut the sample input may be a mistake. So, proceeding under the assumption that the code must process a single test case.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is:\n\n10\ncodeforces\ndodivthree\n\nWhich would be the first test case.\n\nBut the code should process that.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nBut in Python, the code for reading input would be:\n\nn = int(input())\nl = input().strip()\nr = input().strip()\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces. However, the problem says that the strings l and r are of length n, so the input lines for l and r should be exactly n characters long.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut the code for the first phase may be slow for large n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of compatible pairs of boots where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot.
