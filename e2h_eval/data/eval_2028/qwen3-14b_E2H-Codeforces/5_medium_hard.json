Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color, which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The goal is to pair as many left-right boots as possible where their colors are compatible. Compatibility is when either both are same letters, or one is a question mark (which can match any color, including another question mark).\n\nThe output needs to be the maximum number of such pairs, followed by the indices of each pair. Each boot can be used once.\n\nHmm. How do I approach this?\n\nFirst, think about how to maximize the pairs. The key is to find matches between left and right boots, considering that '?' can be flexible.\n\nLet me think about the strategy. Maybe first match the specific colors (non-?) where they are the same. Then use the '?'s to cover the remaining.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nLet me think step by step.\n\nStep 1: For each color (excluding '?'), count the number of left and right boots. For example, for color 'a', if there are x left boots and y right boots, the maximum possible pairs for this color is min(x, y). But since the '?' can also be used here, maybe we need to handle them after handling the specific colors.\n\nWait, but maybe the '?' can be used to match with specific colors. So perhaps the optimal way is:\n\n- First, match as many specific color pairs as possible. For example, for each color c (not '?'), pair left c's with right c's. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those not yet paired), use the '?'s to pair them.\n\nBut how to handle the '?'s? Because a '?' on the left can pair with any right boot (including those with specific colors or '?') and vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, here's an approach:\n\nWe can process the specific colors first, then handle the '?'s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nLet me think of using counts.\n\nLet me think of creating two dictionaries: left_count and right_count. For each color (excluding '?'), count how many left and right boots there are. Then, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). However, this is not entirely correct because we can't use the same left or right boot in multiple pairs. So, perhaps we need to track which boots are already used.\n\nBut that's not feasible for large n (up to 150,000). So we need an efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nFor each color c (not '?'), the number of pairs possible is the minimum of the number of left c's and right c's. But once these are matched, the remaining left and right boots (those not matched) can be paired with '?'s.\n\nBut the problem is that the '?' can be used as either left or right. So perhaps:\n\nFirst, match all possible specific color pairs. Then, for the remaining left and right boots (those not yet matched), pair them using the '?'s. But how?\n\nWait, let's think of the steps:\n\n1. Pair left and right boots with same specific color. For example, for each color c, pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, if there are 5 left 'a's and 3 right 'a's, we can pair 3 of them. Then, the left 'a's have 2 left, and right 'a's have zero.\n\n2. Now, collect all the remaining left boots (those not yet paired) and the remaining right boots. These include the ones with specific colors (but not matched) and the ones with '?'.\n\nNow, for the remaining, the '?' can be used to pair with any other.\n\nBut how to maximize the number of pairs here?\n\nFor example, suppose there are some left '?' and some right '?'. Also, some left with specific colors and some right with specific colors. How to pair them optimally?\n\nThe optimal way is to pair as many as possible between left and right, using the '?'s to cover the others.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nLet me think. Suppose after step 1, we have:\n\nLeft_remaining: a list of left boots not yet paired. These can be either specific colors or '?'.\n\nRight_remaining: same for right.\n\nNow, the idea is to pair as many as possible between left_remaining and right_remaining. Since '?' can match anything.\n\nSo, how to pair these?\n\nWe can think of it as:\n\n- For each left '?' and right '?', they can be paired. But also, left '?' can pair with right specific colors, and vice versa.\n\nBut the problem is to maximize the total pairs. So, perhaps the best way is to pair all possible left '?' with right '?', then pair the remaining left '?' with right specific colors (if any), and the remaining right '?' with left specific colors (if any), and finally pair the specific colors between left and right if possible.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nAnother approach is to count the number of left '?' and right '?'.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nleft_q = number of left boots that are '?' and not yet paired.\n\nright_q = number of right boots that are '?' and not yet paired.\n\nAlso, there are some left boots with specific colors (let's call them left_s) and right boots with specific colors (right_s).\n\nBut in this case, left_s and right_s are those that were not matched in step 1.\n\nNow, the maximum number of pairs possible between left_remaining and right_remaining is min( (left_q + left_s), (right_q + right_s) ), but how?\n\nWait, no. Because for example, if there are left_s (specific colors) and right_s (specific colors), but none of them can be matched (since they are different), then the only way to pair them is to use the '?'s.\n\nBut how to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible pairs is the sum of:\n\n- The number of pairs between left_remaining and right_remaining, considering that '?' can match anything.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAn efficient way is to first pair all left '?' with right '?', then pair the remaining left '?' with right specific colors, and remaining right '?' with left specific colors, and finally pair any left and right specific colors that match.\n\nBut again, how to do that.\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of pairs is the sum of:\n\nnumber of left_remaining + number of right_remaining - max( (number of left_remaining - number of right_remaining), 0 )\n\nWait, that's not correct. Because if you have 5 left and 3 right, you can pair 3. So the maximum possible is min( left_remaining, right_remaining ) ?\n\nNo. Wait, no. Because for example, if left_remaining has 3 left '?' and 2 right '?', then you can pair all 3 left '?' with 2 right '?', but then there's 1 left '?' left. But you can pair that with any right boot (specific or ?) that hasn't been paired yet.\n\nBut this seems complicated.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for the remaining boots:\n\nWe can collect all left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nWe can create two lists: left_remaining and right_remaining.\n\nThen, for each left in left_remaining, try to find a right in right_remaining that is compatible, and pair them.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nBut for the purposes of the problem, we need not only the count but also the actual pairs.\n\nBut given the constraints of n up to 1.5e5, we need an O(n) or O(n log n) solution.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nAfter pairing all the specific color matches (step 1), the remaining left and right boots can be considered as follows:\n\nEach left boot is either a specific color (not matched yet) or a '?', same for right.\n\nSo, for the remaining:\n\nLet's collect all left boots that are not paired (call them L) and right boots not paired (R).\n\nNow, for L and R, we can pair as follows:\n\nWe can pair each left '?' with a right '?', then pair left '?' with right non-? (if possible), and right '?' with left non-? (if possible), and then pair non-? left with non-? right if they match.\n\nBut how to do this optimally.\n\nBut perhaps the maximum number of pairs is the sum of the number of left and right boots minus the maximum of (number of left, number of right). Because the maximum possible pairs is min( len(L), len(R) ). Wait, no. Because for example, if L has 3 elements (all '?') and R has 2 elements (all 'a'), then you can pair all 2 elements of R with the first two of L. Then, you can pair the third L with any of the R's? No, because R is already used.\n\nWait, no. Once the R elements are used, they cannot be used again. So the maximum possible pairs is min(len(L), len(R)).\n\nWait, but in this case, len(L) is 3, len(R) is 2. So maximum pairs is 2.\n\nYes. So regardless of the colors, the maximum number of pairs is min(len(L), len(R))? No, that's not correct. Because if you have L with 2 elements (both 'a') and R with 2 elements (both 'b'), then you can't pair them. So the maximum pairs is zero. But len(L) and len(R) are equal. So min(len(L), len(R)) is 2, but actual maximum is zero. So that approach is wrong.\n\nAh, right. So the previous idea is incorrect. Therefore, the problem is more complex.\n\nSo, the problem is that even if you have equal numbers of left and right boots, they may not be compatible.\n\nSo, how to pair the remaining boots optimally?\n\nLet me think again. The remaining boots are those that couldn't be matched in the first step (specific color pairs). So, for these, the only way to pair them is:\n\nEither:\n\n- Left '?' with any right (including '?')\n\n- Right '?' with any left (including '?')\n\n- Or, left and right have same specific color.\n\nBut how to pair them optimally.\n\nAn approach could be:\n\nWe can first pair all left '?' with right '?'. Then, for the remaining left '?' and right '?', we can pair them with the opposite side's specific colors.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, we can model this as a bipartite graph where edges exist between compatible left and right boots. Then, finding the maximum matching. But for n up to 1.5e5, this is impossible with standard algorithms like Hopcroft-Karp.\n\nThus, we need a greedy approach.\n\nLet me think of the following steps for the second phase (after handling specific color pairs):\n\n1. Collect all left boots not yet paired (call them L) and all right boots not yet paired (call them R).\n\n2. Create two dictionaries:\n\n   - left_color_counts: for each color c (excluding '?'), count how many left boots have that color (but not yet paired). Similarly for right.\n\n   For example, for left_color_counts, for each color c (not '?'), count the number of left boots in L that have color c.\n\n   Similarly for right_color_counts.\n\n3. For each color c, the number of pairs possible between left and right is min(left_color_counts[c], right_color_counts[c]). So, we can pair these, which would be specific color pairs again.\n\n   But wait, this is the same as step 1. However, perhaps in this step, after the first step, there are some left and right boots with same colors but not yet paired.\n\n   So, perhaps this is part of the first step, but maybe I missed some pairs. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps step 1 is not sufficient. Because maybe some left and right boots with the same color could be paired in step 1, but due to the order of processing, they weren't. But that's unlikely if we process all colors.\n\nWait, perhaps the first step is to pair all possible same-color pairs between left and right (for non-? colors). Then, in the second step, pair the remaining with '?'.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- For each color c (not '?'), pair as many left and right boots as possible. For example, for each c, take the min of the number of left c's and right c's, and pair them. Then, subtract those from the counts.\n\nBut how to track which boots are paired.\n\nBut for the purpose of counting, perhaps we can first collect all the possible pairs, then process them, and then proceed.\n\nBut how to track which boots are used.\n\nThis seems complicated. But perhaps we can track for each color, the list of indices for left and right boots. For example, for color 'a', we have a list of left indices and a list of right indices. Then, for each color, pair as many as possible between the left and right lists.\n\nOnce that is done, the remaining left and right boots (those not paired) will be processed in the next step.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nLet me outline the steps:\n\nFirst, process all the non-? colors.\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left boots with color c (indices) into left_c_list.\n\n   collect all right boots with color c (indices) into right_c_list.\n\n   the number of pairs possible is min(len(left_c_list), len(right_c_list)).\n\n   for each i in 0 to (min-1):\n\n       pair left_c_list[i] with right_c_list[i]\n\n   add these pairs to the result.\n\nThen, after this step, for each left and right boot, if they are not paired, they are either '?' or have a color that couldn't be matched (because the other side had fewer of that color).\n\nThen, collect all unpaired left boots (L) and unpaired right boots (R).\n\nNow, for the remaining boots, we need to pair as much as possible.\n\nBut how.\n\nNow, the remaining L and R consist of:\n\nLeft boots with color '?' (unpaired) and left boots with some color c (unpaired because there were not enough right boots with c).\n\nSame for R.\n\nNow, the idea is to pair the '?' with any available boots.\n\nBut how to maximize this.\n\nOne approach is to pair all left '?' with right '?', then pair the remaining left '?' with right non-? (if any), and the remaining right '?' with left non-? (if any), and finally pair any left and right non-? that have the same color.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nLet left_q be the list of unpaired left boots with '?'\n\nLet right_q be the list of unpaired right boots with '?'\n\nLet left_s be the list of unpaired left boots with non-? colors.\n\nLet right_s be the list of unpaired right boots with non-? colors.\n\nNow, for the first part, pair left_q and right_q as much as possible. For example, take the min(len(left_q), len(right_q)), and pair each left_q[i] with right_q[i].\n\nThen, after that, we have some left_q_remaining and right_q_remaining.\n\nThen, pair the left_q_remaining with right_s. For example, for each left_q in left_q_remaining, pair with any right_s that hasn't been paired yet. Similarly for the right_q_remaining with left_s.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nBut since '?' can match any color, we can pair all left_q_remaining with any right_s not yet paired, and vice versa.\n\nBut to maximize the number of pairs, we can pair as follows:\n\nTake the remaining left_q and right_s. For each left_q, pair with a right_s (if any). The number of such pairs is min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_s)).\n\nSimilarly, take the remaining right_q and left_s. Pair them as min(len(right_q_remaining), len(left_s)).\n\nBut then, after that, there may be some left_s and right_s left. For those, we can pair them if they have the same color.\n\nSo, for example, if there are left_s with color 'a' and right_s with color 'a', pair them.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nSo, the overall steps are:\n\n1. Pair all same-color non-? pairs.\n\n2. Collect the remaining left and right boots.\n\n3. Pair as many as possible between left_q and right_q.\n\n4. Pair remaining left_q with right_s.\n\n5. Pair remaining right_q with left_s.\n\n6. Pair same-color pairs between left_s and right_s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps we can do the following:\n\nAfter step 1, collect all unpaired left and right boots.\n\nThen, create four groups:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in left boots if l[i] == '?' and not paired]\n\nright_q = [i for i in right boots if r[i] == '?' and not paired]\n\nleft_s = [i for i in left boots if l[i] != '?' and not paired]\n\nright_s = [i for i in right boots if r[i] != '?' and not paired]\n\nNow, for the first part, pair left_q and right_q. The number of pairs is min(len(left_q), len(right_q)). For example, take the first k elements from left_q and first k elements from right_q, and pair them.\n\nThen, the remaining left_q and right_q are the ones not paired in this step.\n\nNow, for the remaining left_q (say, left_q_remaining) and right_s, pair them. For each element in left_q_remaining, pair with any element in right_s that hasn't been paired yet. Since '?' can match any color.\n\nSimilarly for right_q_remaining and left_s.\n\nOnce that is done, there may be some left_s and right_s left. For those, we can check for same color pairs.\n\nSo, for example, create a frequency map for left_s and right_s. For each color c, the number of left_s with c and right_s with c. Then, for each color, pair min(left_count, right_count) pairs.\n\nBut how to track which ones are paired.\n\nBut this seems manageable.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nBut considering that the code must generate the actual pairs, not just the count, we need to track which boots are used.\n\nSo, perhaps the code should maintain a used array for left and right boots.\n\nLet me outline the code structure.\n\nInitialize two arrays, left_used and right_used, of size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for step 1:\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used.\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used.\n\n   the number of pairs is min(len(left_list), len(right_list)).\n\n   for each i in 0 to (number of pairs -1):\n\n       pair left_list[i] with right_list[i]\n\n       mark them as used.\n\nThen, collect the remaining left and right boots.\n\nThen, for step 2:\n\nCollect left_q, right_q, left_s, right_s as before.\n\nPair left_q and right_q as much as possible.\n\nThen, pair left_q_remaining with right_s (any available).\n\nThen, pair right_q_remaining with left_s (any available).\n\nThen, pair left_s and right_s with same color.\n\nBut how to collect the left_q, etc.\n\nBut how to collect the left_q, etc. after step 1.\n\nBut perhaps during step 1, we can collect all the unpaired boots.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the entire process, we can track which boots are used.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used = [False]*n\n\nright_used = [False]*n\n\npairs = []\n\nThen, for step 1:\n\nfor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not left_used[i]]\n\n    right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not right_used[i]]\n\n    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(k):\n\n        pairs.append( (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) )\n\n        left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n\n        right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\nThen, after this step, collect the remaining left and right boots.\n\nBut for large n, building these lists for each color may be O(n * 26) time, which is acceptable since 26*1.5e5 is manageable.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, this is O(26n) time, which is okay.\n\nOnce step 1 is done, collect the remaining left and right boots (those not used yet).\n\nNow, for step 2:\n\nWe need to pair the remaining boots.\n\nLet me collect the remaining left and right boots:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nleft_s = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nright_s = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nNow, for these lists, proceed to pair them.\n\nFirst, pair left_q and right_q:\n\nk = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(k):\n\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) )\n\n    left_used[left_q[i]] = True\n\n    right_used[right_q[i]] = True\n\nThen, collect the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\nleft_q_remaining = [i for i in left_q[k:]]\n\nright_q_remaining = [i for i in right_q[k:]]\n\nNow, pair left_q_remaining with right_s:\n\nfor each left in left_q_remaining:\n\n    find any right in right_s that is not used yet.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nBut since we can choose any, perhaps we can iterate through right_s and pair them.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nfor i in range(len(left_q_remaining)):\n\n    if there are any right_s not used:\n\n        take the first available right_s, pair with left_q_remaining[i]\n\n        mark them as used.\n\nSimilarly for right_q_remaining with left_s.\n\nBut how to track which ones are available.\n\nBut perhaps, we can collect the right_s as a list, and for each element in that list, if not used, pair with left_q_remaining.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\navailable_right_s = [i for i in right_s if not right_used[i]]\n\navailable_left_s = [i for i in left_s if not left_used[i]]\n\nThen, for the left_q_remaining:\n\nfor i in range(len(left_q_remaining)):\n\n    if available_right_s:\n\n        pair left_q_remaining[i] with available_right_s[0]\n\n        mark them as used.\n\n        remove available_right_s[0] from available_right_s.\n\nSimilarly for right_q_remaining and available_left_s.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\navailable_right_s = [i for i in right_s if not right_used[i]]\n\navailable_left_s = [i for i in left_s if not left_used[i]]\n\n# Pair left_q_remaining with available_right_s:\n\nfor i in range(len(left_q_remaining)):\n\n    if available_right_s:\n\n        idx = available_right_s[0]\n\n        pairs.append( (left_q_remaining[i]+1, idx+1) )\n\n        left_used[left_q_remaining[i]] = True\n\n        right_used[idx] = True\n\n        available_right_s.pop(0)\n\nSimilarly for right_q_remaining and available_left_s:\n\nfor i in range(len(right_q_remaining)):\n\n    if available_left_s:\n\n        idx = available_left_s[0]\n\n        pairs.append( (idx+1, right_q_remaining[i]+1) )\n\n        left_used[idx] = True\n\n

Now, for these, we need to pair them if they have the same color.\n\nSo, for the remaining available_left_s and available_right_s:\n\nWe can create a frequency map for the left_available and right_available.\n\nFor example, for each color c, count how many left_available have color c and how many right_available have color c.

For each color, that's O(n) time. So 26*O(n) time. Then, the same for the other steps.\n\nBut perhaps, for Python, this is manageable.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps we can optimize the first step.\n\nInstead of for each color in 'a' to 'z', collect the left and right lists, perhaps we can precompute for each color.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    process...\n\nBut in code, perhaps:\n\nimport string\n\nfor c in string.ascii_lowercase:\n\n    ...\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut now, the code for the first step.\n\nBut in code, for each color, collect the left and right lists. Then pair them.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps:\n\nBut for each color, we can loop through the entire string once. However, that would be O(n * 26) time.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, that's 3.9e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, for each color, we can collect the indices once.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nOnce the code is written, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line being n, then l, then r.\n\nBut the sample input shows that there are multiple test cases. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input shows multiple test cases. Wait, the user provided examples with multiple inputs, but the problem says that the input is as per the first line being n, then l, then r. Wait, no. The problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains n. The second line contains l. Third line contains r.\n\nBut in the sample input, the user provided multiple test cases, but that's probably part of the example. But the actual problem expects that the code reads one test case.\n\nWait, the original problem's sample input shows:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nBut perhaps this is a list of test cases, but in reality, the code is supposed to read one test case.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains n...\n\nSo, the code should read n, then l, then r.\n\nBut the sample input seems to have multiple test cases. However, perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the sample input. For example, the sample input might have multiple test cases, but according to the problem statement, the code should read one test case.\n\nBut the problem's sample output shows outputs for each of those test cases. So perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. But that's not clear.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe problem says, \"the following is a competitive programming problem\" and gives the input and output examples. But the actual problem requires reading a single test case. The sample input seems to be multiple test cases, but perhaps that's a formatting error.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains n...\n\nSo, the code should read n, then l, then r.\n\nSo, the sample input given by the user is perhaps a list of test cases, but for the actual code, the code should read one test case.\n\nBut in the code submission, the code should read from stdin, which for the problem is one test case.\n\nSo, the code should read:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l.\n\nRead r.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nl = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nr = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nBut then, the sample input given by the user may have multiple lines. But the code should read three lines per test case.\n\nBut perhaps the user's sample input is for multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to handle one test case.\n\nSo, assuming that the code handles one test case.\n\nNow, proceeding with the code.\n\nNow, the code structure:\n\nRead n, l, r.\n\nInitialize left_used and right_used as lists of False.\n\npairs = list()\n\nThen, for each color in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    collect left_list and right_list.\n\n    pair as min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) pairs.\n\nThen, collect the remaining left and right boots.\n\nThen, proceed with the steps for the remaining.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut for the code, the first step can be implemented as:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nBut perhaps not needed. Let's proceed.\n\nIn code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nl = input().strip()\n\nr = input().strip()\n\nleft_used = [False] * n\n\nright_used = [False] * n\n\npairs = []\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_list = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if not left_used[i] and l[i] == c:\n\n            left_list.append(i)\n\n    right_list = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n\n        if not right_used[i] and r[i] == c:\n\n            right_list.append(i)\n\n    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(k):\n\n        pairs.append( (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) )\n\n        left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n\n        right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut this is O(26n) time. For n=1.5e5, it's 3.9e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, for n=1.5e5, looping 26 times may be slow. But perhaps we can optimize.\n\nAlternative approach for the first step:\n\nWe can precompute for each color, the list of indices for left and right.\n\nBut for code, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nOnce that is done, collect the remaining left and right boots.\n\nThen, collect left_q, left_s, right_q, right_s.\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nleft_s = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nright_s = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, pair left_q and right_q as follows:\n\nk = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(k):\n\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) )\n\n    left_used[left_q[i]] = True\n\n    right_used[right_q[i]] = True\n\nThen, collect the remaining left_q_remaining and right_q_remaining.\n\nleft_q_remaining = [i for i in left_q[k:]]\n\nright_q_remaining = [i for i in right_q[k:]]\n\nNow, pair left_q_remaining with right_s.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nWe can collect the right_s that are not used yet.\n\navailable_right_s = [i for i in right_s if not right_used[i]]\n\nThen, for each left in left_q_remaining:\n\n    if available_right_s is not empty:\n\n        take the first element from available_right_s and pair.\n\nSimilarly for right_q_remaining and available_left_s.\n\nBut for code:\n\navailable_right_s = [i for i in right_s if not right_used[i]]\n\navailable_left_s = [i for i in left_s if not left_used[i]]\n\nfor i in range(len(left_q_remaining)):\n\n    if available_right_s:\n\n        idx = available_right_s[0]\n\n        pairs.append( (left_q_remaining[i]+1, idx+1) )\n\n        left_used[left_q_remaining[i]] = True\n\n        right_used[idx] = True\n\n        available_right_s.pop(0)\n\nfor i in range(len(right_q_remaining)):\n\n    if available_left_s:\n\n        idx = available_left_s[0]\n\n        pairs.append( (idx+1, right_q_remaining[i]+1) )\n\n        left_used[idx] = True\n\n        right_used[right_q_remaining[i]] = True\n\n        available_left_s.pop(0)\n\nThen, collect the remaining left and right boots (those not used yet) that have non-? colors.\n\navailable_left = [i for i in range(n) if not left_used[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\navailable_right = [i for i in range(n) if not right_used[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_list = [i for i in available_left if l[i] == c]\n\n    right_list = [i for i in available_right if r[i] == c]\n\n    k = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(k):\n\n        pairs.append( (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) )\n\n        left_used[left_list[i]] = True\n\n        right_used[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut again, this is O(26n) time.\n\nBut this seems manageable.\n\nNow, the code.\n\nBut what about the order in which the pairs are added? For example, in the first step, the code pairs left and right for each color in order. But since the problem allows any valid pairing, this is acceptable.\n\nNow, testing this code against the sample input.\n\nBut perhaps the code works.\n\nNow, what about the case where a '?' is paired with a specific color. For example, a left '?' paired with a right 'a'.\n\nBut in the code, after the first step, the code pairs left_q with right_q, then left_q_remaining with right_s, etc.\n\nSo, the code should handle that.\n\nNow, what about the case where after all steps, there are some left and right boots with same colors but not paired?\n\nBut the last step handles that.\n\nBut in the code, available_left and available_right are collected, then for each color, the code pairs them.\n\nBut perhaps, the code can be optimized by building frequency maps and processing them.\n\nBut for code, perhaps it's easier to proceed as written.\n\nNow, the code may have some inefficiencies, but for the problem's constraints, it should pass.\n\nNow, let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=10\n\nl = 'codeforces'\n\nr = 'dodivthree'\n\nLet me see.\n\nBut perhaps the code would generate the correct output.\n\nBut since the code is written, perhaps it's time to code it.\n\nBut in Python, for the first step, looping through each color and then for each character in l and r, it may be slow for n=1.5e5. Because for each color, we loop through all n characters.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize that.\n\nAlternative approach for step 1:\n\nWe can precompute for each color, the list of indices for left and right.\n\nFor example, for left, create a dictionary mapping color to list of indices.\n\nBut for code:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color = defaultdict(list)\n\nright_color = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n\n    if l[i] != '?':\n\n        left_color[l[i]].append(i)\n\n    if r[i] != '?':\n\n        right_color[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color and right_color:\n\nBut no, that's not helpful for the initial step.\n\nAlternatively, during the first step, for each color c in 'a' to 'z', collect the left and right lists.\n\nBut perhaps for code, it's better to use list comprehensions.\n\nBut for code, perhaps the initial",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots. Each boot can be either a specific color (denoted by a lowercase letter) or an indefinite color (denoted by a question mark '?'). A specific color is compatible with itself, while an indefinite color can be paired with any other color, including another indefinite color.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Pairing of Specific Colors**: First, we pair all left boots with specific colors that match corresponding right boots with the same specific color. This is done by iterating through each possible color from 'a' to 'z' and pairing as many as possible.\n2. **Handling Indefinite Colors**: After handling specific colors, we handle the remaining boots that are either unpaired or have indefinite colors. We first pair indefinite left boots with indefinite right boots.
