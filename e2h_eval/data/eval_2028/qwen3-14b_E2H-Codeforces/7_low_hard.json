The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to determine if a given number n can be the number of vertices in a snowflake graph as defined. Let's think about what the snowflake structure looks like.\n\nThe problem says that the snowflake is built in a certain way. Let me try to understand the construction steps again. \n\nInitially, there's one vertex. Then, we add k new vertices connected to it. So after the first step, there are 1 + k vertices. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) must be connected to k new vertices. And this process is done at least once. So the second step adds k * k new vertices. Wait, no. Because each of the initial k vertices is connected to k new ones. So each of those k nodes adds k children. So that's k * k new nodes. But then, the total number of nodes after two steps would be 1 + k + k^2.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that this step (adding k new vertices to each leaf node) should be done at least once. So the initial step (adding k nodes to the root) is mandatory. Then, the next step (adding k nodes to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimum snowflake would be when we do this once. For example, with k=4, the minimal snowflake would have 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21? But according to the example given, for n=6, the answer is NO. Let me check the sample input and output.\n\nLooking at the sample input:\n\nFor example, when n=6, the output is NO. Let's think why. Let's see possible k values.\n\nLet me think of the structure. The snowflake's structure is such that it's a tree. Because every time we add nodes, they are connected to existing nodes. So the graph is a tree. Let me model the number of nodes as follows.\n\nThe snowflake is constructed in layers. The first layer is the root. The second layer has k nodes connected to the root. Then, each of these k nodes has k children. So the third layer has k^2 nodes. Then, if we proceed further, each of those nodes would have k children, adding k^3 nodes, etc. But the process of adding layers (the step where each leaf is connected to k new nodes) must be done at least once. So the construction requires that after the initial step (adding the first k nodes), we do at least one more step. So the minimal number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. \n\nWait, but the initial step is adding k nodes. Then the second step (which must be done at least once) adds k^2 nodes. So the minimal total is 1 + k + k^2. For example, when k=2, minimal n is 1+2+4=7. So for n=6, it's impossible. Which matches the sample input where n=6 gives NO.\n\nSo the problem reduces to checking if n can be written in the form of 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1 (since the second step must be done at least once). Wait, no. Wait, the initial step is adding k nodes (so that's the first expansion). Then, the second step (which must be done at least once) is adding k nodes to each of the leaves. So the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2. But maybe there are more steps. For example, after adding the second layer (k^2 nodes), you could add another layer, which would add k^3 nodes. So the total would be 1 + k + k^2 + k^3. But how many layers can there be?\n\nThe construction process is: start with the root. Then, add a layer of k nodes. Then, each of the leaves (which are the nodes added in the previous step) get k children. This step is done at least once. So the process can be repeated any number of times. So the number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1. Wait, no. Because the first step is adding k nodes (so m=1?), then the next step adds k^2 (m=2?), etc. So the total number of nodes is sum_{i=0}^m k^i, where m ≥ 2? Wait, no. Let me re-express:\n\nOriginal structure:\n\n- Start with 1 node (level 0).\n\n- Then, add k nodes connected to the root (level 1). So sum is 1 + k.\n\n- Then, each of the level 1 nodes adds",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph as defined by the rules. The snowflake graph is constructed in layers, starting from a single root node and expanding outward with each layer having `k` times more nodes than the previous one. The challenge is to check if there exists a value of `k > 1` such that the total number of nodes in the graph equals `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph starts with a single node. Each subsequent layer adds `k` times more nodes than the previous layer. The total number of nodes after `m` layers is given by the geometric series sum: `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m`, where `m >= 1`.\n2. **Geometric Series Check**: For a given `n`, we need to check if it can be represented as a geometric series sum for some integer `k > 1` and `m >= 1`. This involves iterating through possible values of `k` and checking if the series sum matches `n`.\n3. **Efficient Search**: Given the constraints (up to `10^18`), we need an efficient approach. We iterate over possible values of `k` starting from 2 up to a certain limit, and for each `k`, we compute the geometric series sum until it exceeds `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    # Check for all possible k >= 2\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/2)) + 2\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        total = 1  # start with root\n        current = 1\n        steps = 0\n        while True:\n            steps += 1\n            current *= k\n            total += current\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            if total > n:\n                break\n    # Also check for cases where m=1 (i.e., 1 + k)\n    # Wait, m must be at least 1, but according to the problem statement, the second step must be done at least once.\n    # So the minimal is 1 + k + k^2. So the case of 1 + k is not allowed. Wait, let's recheck the problem statement.\n    # The initial step is adding k new vertices. Then the next step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once.\n    # So the minimal is 1 + k + k^2. Hence, the sum must be at least 1 + k + k^2.\n    # Therefore, for the case of m=1 (sum is 1 + k) is invalid. But according to our earlier code, when steps is 1, it adds k to the total. So the loop checks for m >=1, which would include the case of 1 + k (steps=1). However, according to the problem statement, the second step must be done at least once. Thus, the minimal is 1 + k + k^2. Hence, the code above needs to check for m >=2.\n\n    # Wait, the original problem says that after the initial step (adding k new vertices), the next step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) should be done at least once. So the minimal is 1 + k + k^2. So the sum must be at least 1 + k + k^2. Therefore, in the code above, the loop should ensure that steps is at least 2. So the code above is incorrect because it allows steps=1 (which gives 1 + k).\n\n    # Let's correct that. We need to check for sum = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m >= 1 (so steps is at least 2). Wait, no. Because m is the number of terms. Let me re-express:\n\n    # The sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m >= 1 (since the second step is done once). So for m=1, the sum is 1 + k. But according to the problem statement, the second step (adding k to each leaf) must be done at least once. Which implies that the minimal is 1 + k + k^2. So m must be at least 2. So the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m where m >= 2.\n\n    # Therefore, in the code above, the loop should start with steps=2. So the code needs to be adjusted.\n\n    # Let's redo the code.\n\n    # So for each k, we need to check if there exists m >= 2 such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n.\n\n    # The sum is (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1) = n.\n\n    # So for each k >=2, we can compute the sum for m=2, m=3, etc., until the sum exceeds n.\n\n    # So the previous code was wrong because it allowed m=1 (steps=1). Let's fix that.\n\n    # So the correct approach is to check for each k >=2, compute the sum starting from 1 + k + k^2, then add higher terms.\n\n    # Let's rewrite the code accordingly.\n\n    # Re-initialize the function\n    def check_k(k, n):\n        total = 1  # root\n        current = 1\n        steps = 0\n        while True:\n            steps += 1\n            current *= k\n            total += current\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            if total > n:\n                break\n        return False\n\n    # Now, we need to check for m >= 2, which means that steps >= 2. Because for steps=2, the sum is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n    # So for each k, the initial sum is 1 + k (steps=1), then adding k^2 (steps=2) gives sum 1 + k + k^2. So the code above for check_k will check for steps starting at 1. But we need to make sure that steps is at least 2. Wait, no. Because in the code above, for steps=1, the sum is 1 + k. For steps=2, it's 1 + k + k^2. So the function check_k will return True if the sum equals n for any steps >= 1. But according to the problem statement, the minimal is steps=2 (sum 1 + k + k^2). So the code above would incorrectly accept n=1 + k (steps=1). Therefore, we need to adjust the code to only consider steps >=2.\n\n    # So, for each k, we need to start with steps=2, i.e., sum is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n    # Let's adjust the check_k function.\n\n    def check_k(k, n):\n        total = 1 + k  # steps=1\n        current = k\n        steps = 1\n        while True:\n            steps += 1\n            current *= k\n            total += current\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            if total > n:\n                break\n        return False\n\n    # Now, for each k >=2, we check if the sum starting from steps=2 (i.e., sum 1 + k + k^2 + ...) equals n.\n\n    # Also, for the case when k=2, the sum can be 1 + 2 + 4 =7, 1+2+4+8=15, etc.\n\n    # So now, the code for is_snowflake would be:\n\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/2)) + 2\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        total = 1 + k\n        current = k\n        steps = 1\n        while True:\n            steps += 1\n            current *= k\n            total += current\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            if total > n:\n                break\n    # Also, check for cases where the sum is exactly 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m for m >=2\n    # Additionally, we need to handle cases where k is large enough that k^2 exceeds n, but the sum 1 + k + k^2 is equal to n.\n\n    # Also, check for cases where the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m where m is such that k^m is not too big.\n\n    # What about cases where k is very large? For example, n=1 + k + k^2. Then k^2 = n -1 -k. So solving for k.\n\n    # We also need to check for the possibility that the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m where m is large. But for large k, the sum grows quickly.\n\n    # Also, there's a case when the sum is exactly 1 + k, but that's not allowed. So the code above ensures that steps starts from 1, then adds k^2, etc.\n\n    # However, the code above may miss some cases where the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m where m is small.\n\n    # Additionally, we need to check for the case where m=1, but according to the problem statement, that's not allowed. So the code is correct now.\n\n    # Another case: n=6. The code checks for k=2. The initial total is 1+2=3. Then steps=2: current=2*2=4, total=3+4=7>6. So returns false. For k=3, initial total=1+3=4, steps=2: current=3*3=9, total=4+9=13>6. So no. So returns false. Hence, n=6 is NO.\n\n    # Now, for the sample input n=13, the code would check for k=3: steps=1: total=1+3=4, steps=2: 4 + 9 =13 → yes. So returns True.\n\n    # So the code seems correct.\n\n    # Also, what about when n=255? Let's see: 255 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255. That's sum from i=0 to 7 of 2^i. So sum is 2^8 -1 = 255. So for k=2, m=7 steps. The code would check this.\n\n    # Now, the code may need to handle very large k. For example, n=1 + k + k^2. For k^2 = n -1 -k. So solving for k, but for very large n, k could be up to sqrt(n).\n\n    # So the code is correct now.\n\n    # Also, note that for k=2, the maximum possible sum before exceeding n is up to log_2(n). So the loop is manageable.\n\n    # Now, let's re-implement the code correctly.\n\n    # So the corrected code for is_snowflake is:\n\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/2)) + 2\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        total = 1 + k\n        current = k\n        steps = 1\n        while True:\n            steps += 1\n            current *= k\n            total += current\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            if total > n:\n                break\n    # Also, check for cases where the sum is 1 + k + ... + k^m for m=2, but k is larger than sqrt(n). For example, n=1 + k + k^2, where k is large. For example, n=1 + k + k^2 = (k^2 +k +1). For large k, this is roughly k^2. So k is about sqrt(n). So the max_k is set to sqrt(n) + 2, which covers these cases.\n\n    # However, there is another case where the sum is exactly 1 + k^m for some m ≥ 2. For example, if the snowflake has only two layers: the root, then k nodes, then no further expansion. But according to the problem statement, the second step must be done at least once. So the minimal is 1 + k + k^2. Hence, this case is not allowed.\n\n    # Therefore, the code above should cover all possibilities.\n\n    # However, there's another case where the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is 2 or more. But what if k is such that k^2 is larger than n, but the sum 1 + k is less than n? For example, n=5, k=2: sum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 >5. So no. But if n=4, it's 1 + 2 + 4 =7>4. So no. But what if the sum is 1 + k?\n\n    # No, because the problem requires that the second step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) is done at least once. So the minimal is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n    # So the code is correct.\n\n    # Also, what about n=3? The code would check for k=2: total starts at 1+2=3. So returns True. But according to the problem statement, the second step must be done at least once. So 1 + k is 3. But that would mean only the first step (adding k nodes) and no further steps. Which is not allowed. Hence, the code is wrong here.\n\n    # Oh no! There's a mistake here. The code currently checks for steps starting at 1 (i.e., sum 1 + k), which is not allowed. Because the second step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. Hence, the minimal sum is 1 + k + k^2. So the code should not consider steps=1. It should start with steps=2.\n\n    # Let's re-express the check_k function again.\n\n    # The correct approach is to check for the sum 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m ≥ 1 (since m is the number of steps after the first step). Wait, no. The problem says that the second step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal is 1 + k + k^2. So the sum must have at least three terms: 1, k, k^2.\n\n    # Therefore, the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m where m ≥ 1 (i.e., the number of additional steps after the first k addition). So for m=1, the sum is 1 + k + k^2. For m=2, it's 1 + k + k^2 + k^3, etc.\n\n    # So, the code should start with the sum being 1 + k + k^2, and then add further terms.\n\n    # So, the code for check_k should start with total = 1 + k + k^2, and then add k^3, etc.\n\n    # So the code for check_k is:\n\n    def check_k(k, n):\n        total = 1 + k + k*k\n        current = k*k\n        while True:\n            current *= k\n            total += current\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            if total > n:\n                break\n        return False\n\n    # And then, for each k >= 2, we check if this returns true.\n\n    # But wait, for example, when n=13, k=3: 1 + 3 + 9 =13 → returns true. So yes.\n\n    # For n=6, k=2: 1+2+4=7>6 → no.\n\n    # So this code would correctly return true for n=13 and false for n=6.\n\n    # However, this approach misses the case where the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m for m=1 (i.e., just 1 + k + k^2). So the code is now correct.\n\n    # So the is_snowflake function should be:\n\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/2)) + 2\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        total = 1 + k + k*k\n        if total == n:\n            return True\n        current = k*k\n        while True:\n            current *= k\n            total += current\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            if total > n:\n                break\n    # Also, check for cases where k is larger than sqrt(n). For example, if n=1 + k + k^2 where k is large. But since k^2 is part of the sum, k must be <= sqrt(n-1 -k). But since k is large, this is unlikely.\n\n    # However, for n=6, the code would check k=2: total is 1+2+4=7>6, so no. For k=3: 1+3+9=13>6. So returns false.\n\n    # For n=7, it's 1+2+4=7. So returns true.\n\n    # But what about n=15? 1+2+4+8=15. So k=2, m=3. The code would check for k=2: initial total is 7, then current=4*2=8, total=7+8=15 → yes.\n\n    # Now, the code needs to handle this correctly.\n\n    # So, the final code for the is_snowflake function is as follows:\n\n    # Also, we need to check for k=2 up to sqrt(n) + 2, but what about cases where k is larger than that? For example, if n=1 + k + k^2, and k is large. Let's say n=1 + k + k^2 = k^2 +k +1. For large k, this is approximately k^2, so k is around sqrt(n). Hence, the max_k is set to sqrt(n) + 2, which covers these cases.\n\n    # However, what about cases where the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m with m=1 (i.e., 1 +k +k^2) and k is larger than sqrt(n)? For example, n=1 +k +k^2 = 1 +k +k^2. If k is larger than sqrt(n), then k^2 would be larger than n, which is not possible. Hence, the max_k is sufficient.\n\n    # So the code is correct now.\n\n    # Now, let's implement this in the Python function.\n\n    # Also, the sample input includes n=1, which returns NO. Other cases like n=2,3 are also NO.\n\n    # So the code is now:\n\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/2)) + 2\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        total = 1 + k + k * k\n        if total == n:\n            return True\n        current = k * k\n        while True:\n            current *= k\n            total += current\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            if total > n:\n                break\n    # Also, check for the case where the sum is exactly 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m where m=1 (i.e., 1 +k +k^2). But this is already covered in the loop.\n\n    # Additionally, we need to consider the case where the snowflake has only one layer (1 + k), but that's not allowed. Hence, the code is correct.\n\n    # Now, what about cases where the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m where m >=1 and k is not in the range up to sqrt(n) + 2?\n\n    # For example, n=1 + k + k^2 where k is large, but n is small. For instance, n=1 + 100 + 10000 = 10101. For this, k=100, and max_k is sqrt(10101) + 2 ≈ 100 + 2 = 102. So the code would check k=100 and find that 1 + 100 + 10000 = 10101, which matches n=10101. Hence, returns True.\n\n    # So the code should handle all cases.\n\n    # Finally, the code needs to check for k=2 up to max_k and return True if any of them satisfies the condition.\n\n    # Now, let's implement this in the final code.\n\n    # Also, we need to handle very large numbers efficiently. Since the loop for k runs up to sqrt(n), which for n=1e18 is 1e9, which is too large for t=1e4 test cases. Wait, this is a problem. For t=1e4 and each test case having O(sqrt(n)) time, it's not feasible for n=1e18.\n\n    # Wait, this approach is not efficient enough. For n=1e18, sqrt(n) is 1e9, which is way too large for even a single test case. So we need a more efficient approach.\n\n    # Let's rethink.\n\n    # The sum S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = (k^(m+1) - 1)/(k - 1). We need to find if there exists k > 1 and m >= 2 such that S = n.\n\n    # Rearranging, k^(m+1) - 1 = (k - 1) * n.\n\n    # For fixed k, m can be determined. But how?\n\n    # Alternatively, for each possible m, we can try to find k such that the equation holds.\n\n    # Let's think about possible values of m. Since the minimal sum for m=2 is 1 + k + k^2. For n=1e18, the maximum possible m is small. For example, if k=2, then m can be up to about 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18).\n\n    # So for each possible m (starting from 2 up to 60), we can try to solve for k in the equation (k^(m+1) - 1)/(k - 1) = n.\n\n    # This is a better approach because m can be up to around 60, which is manageable.\n\n    # So the plan is:\n\n    # For each test case n, iterate m from 2 to 60:\n\n    # For each m, solve for k in the equation (k^(m+1) - 1)/(k - 1) = n.\n\n    # Since k must be an integer > 1, we can perform a binary search for k in the range [2, upper_bound].\n\n    # Let's formalize this.\n\n    # For each m from 2 to 60:\n\n    # Compute the value of k such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n.\n\n    # This sum is S = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k - 1).\n\n    # We need to find if there exists an integer k >= 2 such that this equation holds.\n\n    # For each m, perform a binary search on k in the range [2, n], since for k=2 and m=60, the sum is about 2^61, which is larger than 1e18.\n\n    # For each m, binary search k from 2 to something like n^(1/(m+1)) + 1.\n\n    # This approach reduces the complexity significantly.\n\n    # Let's proceed with this approach.\n\n    # Now, implement this in code.\n\n    # For each test case n:\n\n    # For m in 2 to 60:\n\n    #   low = 2, high = something like n^(1/(m+1)) + 2\n\n    #   perform binary search to find if there exists k such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n.\n\n    # How to compute the sum for given k and m?\n\n    # The sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = (k^(m+1) - 1)/(k - 1).\n\n    # But for large exponents, we need to compute this carefully to avoid overflow. However, since n is up to 1e18, and m is up to 60, k^m can be up to (n)^(1/(m+1)) * k^m, which may be manageable.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can compute the sum incrementally and stop if it exceeds n.\n\n    # Let's implement this.\n\n    # For each m from 2 to 60:\n\n    #   low = 2, high = 2 (initial guess)\n\n    #   find the upper bound for k.

This is done by iterating over possible values of `m` from 2 to 60 and using binary search to find a corresponding `k` that satisfies the sum condition.

For k=3, initial total=1+3=4, steps=2: current=3*3=9, total=4+9=13>6. So no. So returns false. Hence, n=6 is NO.\n\n    # Now, for the sample input n=13, the code would check for k=3: steps=1: total=1+3=4, steps=2: 4 + 9 =13 → yes.

So solving for k, but for very large n, k could be up to sqrt(n).\n\n    # So the code is correct now.\n\n    # Also, note that for k=2, the maximum possible sum before exceeding n is up to log_2(n).

For example, n=1 + k + k^2, where k is large. For example, n=1 + k + k^2 = (k^2 +k +1). For large k, this is roughly k^2. So k is about sqrt(n). So the max_k is set to sqrt(n) + 2, which covers these cases.\n\n    # However, there is another case where the sum is exactly 1 + k^m for some m ≥ 2. For example, if the snowflake has only two layers: the root, then k nodes, then no further expansion. But according to the problem statement, the second step must be done at least once. So the minimal is 1 + k + k^2. Hence, this case is not allowed.\n\n    # Therefore, the code above should cover all possibilities.\n\n    # However, there's another case where the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is 2 or more. But what if k is such that k^2 is larger than n, but the sum 1 + k is less than n? For example, n=5, k=2: sum is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 >5. So no. But if n=4, it's 1 + 2 + 4 =7>4. So no. But what if the sum is 1 + k?\n\n    # No, because the problem requires that the second step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) is done at least once. So the minimal is 1 + k + k^2.\n\n    # So the code is correct.\n\n    # Also, what about n=3? The code would check for k=2: total starts at 1+2=3. So returns True. But according to the problem statement, the second step must be done at least once. So 1 + k is 3. But that would mean only the first step (adding k nodes) and no further steps. Which is not allowed. Hence, the code is wrong here.\n\n    # Oh no! There's a mistake here. The code currently checks for steps starting at 1 (i.e., sum 1 + k), which is not allowed. Because the second step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. Hence, the minimal sum is 1 + k + k^2. So the code should not consider steps=1.

Wait, no. The problem says that the second step (adding k new vertices to each leaf) must be done at least once. So the minimal is 1 + k + k^2.

For example, if n=1 + k + k^2 where k is large. But since k^2 is part of the sum, k must be <= sqrt(n-1 -k). But since k is large, this is unlikely.\n\n    # However, for n=6, the code would check k=2: total is 1+2+4=7>6, so no. For k=3: 1+3+9=13>6. So returns false.\n\n    # For n=7, it's 1+2+4=7.

The code would check for k=2: initial total is 7, then current=4*2=8, total=7+8=15 → yes.\n\n    # Now, the code needs to handle this correctly.\n\n    # So, the final code for the is_snowflake function is as follows:\n\n    # Also, we need to check for k=2 up to sqrt(n) + 2, but what about cases where k is larger than that? For example, if n=1 + k + k^2, and k is large. Let's say n=1 + k + k^2 = k^2 +k +1. For large k, this is approximately k^2, so k is around sqrt(n). Hence, the max_k is set to sqrt(n) + 2, which covers these cases.\n\n    # However, what about cases where the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m with m=1 (i.e., 1 +k +k^2) and k is larger than sqrt(n)? For example, n=1 +k +k^2 = 1 +k +k^2. If k is larger than sqrt(n), then k^2 would be larger than n, which is not possible. Hence, the max_k is sufficient.\n\n    # So the code is correct now.\n\n    # Now, let's implement this in the Python function.\n\n    # Also, the sample input includes n=1, which returns NO. Other cases like n=2,3 are also NO.\n\n    # So the code is now:\n\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/2)) + 2\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        total = 1 + k + k * k\n        if total == n:\n            return True\n        current = k * k\n        while True:\n            current *= k\n            total += current\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            if total > n:\n                break\n    # Also, check for the case where the sum is exactly 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m where m=1 (i.e., 1 +k +k^2). But this is already covered in the loop.\n\n    # Additionally, we need to consider the case where the snowflake has only one layer (1 + k), but that's not allowed. Hence, the code is correct.\n\n    # Now, what about cases where the sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m where m >=1 and k is not in the range up to sqrt(n) + 2?\n\n    # For example, n=1 + k + k^2 where k is large, but n is small. For instance, n=1 + 100 + 10000 = 10101. For this, k=100, and max_k is sqrt(10101) + 2 ≈ 100 + 2 = 102. So the code would check k=100 and find that 1 + 100 + 10000 = 10101, which matches n=10101. Hence, returns True.\n\n    # So the code should handle all cases.\n\n    # Finally, the code needs to check for k=2 up to max_k and return True if any of them satisfies the condition.\n\n    # Now, let's implement this in the final code.\n\n    # Also, we need to handle very large numbers efficiently. Since the loop for k runs up to sqrt(n), which for n=1e18 is 1e9, which is too large for t=1e4 test cases. Wait, this is a problem. For t=1e4 and each test case having O(sqrt(n)) time, it's not feasible for n=1e18.\n\n    # Wait, this approach is not efficient enough. For n=1e18, sqrt(n) is 1e9, which is way too large for even a single test case. So we need a more efficient approach.\n\n    # Let's rethink.\n\n    # The sum S = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = (k^(m+1) - 1)/(k - 1). We need to find if there exists k > 1 and m >= 2 such that S = n.\n\n    # Rearranging, k^(m+1) - 1 = (k - 1) * n.\n\n    # For fixed k, m can be determined. But how?\n\n    # Alternatively, for each possible m, we can try to find k such that the equation holds.\n\n    # Let's think about possible values of m. Since the minimal sum for m=2 is 1 + k + k^2. For n=1e18, the maximum possible m is small. For example, if k=2, then m can be up to about 60 (since 2^60 is around 1e18).\n\n    # So for each possible m (starting from 2 up to 60), we can try to solve for k in the equation (k^(m+1) - 1)/(k - 1) = n.\n\n    # This is a better approach because m can be up to around 60, which is manageable.\n\n    # So the plan is:\n\n    # For each test case n, iterate m from 2 to 60:\n\n    # For each m, solve for k in the equation (k^(m+1) - 1)/(k - 1) = n.\n\n    # Since k must be an integer > 1, we can perform a binary search for k in the range [2, upper_bound].\n\n    # Let's formalize this.\n\n    # For each m from 2 to 60:\n\n    # Compute the value of k such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n.\n\n    # This sum is S = (k^{m+1} - 1)/(k - 1).\n\n    # We need to find if there exists an integer k >= 2 such that this equation holds.\n\n    # For each m, perform a binary search on k in the range [2, n], since for k=2 and m=60, the sum is about 2^61, which is larger than 1e18.\n\n    # For each m, binary search k from 2 to something like n^(1/(m+1)) + 1.\n\n    # This approach reduces the complexity significantly.\n\n    # Let's proceed with this approach.\n\n    # Now, implement this in code.\n\n    # For each test case n:\n\n    # For m in 2 to 60:\n\n    #   low = 2, high = something like n^(1/(m+1)) + 2\n\n    #   perform binary search to find if there exists k such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n.\n\n    # How to compute the sum for given k and m?\n\n    # The sum is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m = (k^(m+1) - 1)/(k - 1).\n\n    # But for large exponents, we need to compute this carefully to avoid overflow. However, since n is up to 1e18, and m is up to 60, k^m can be up to (n)^(1/(m+1)) * k^m, which may be manageable.\n\n    # Alternatively, we can compute the sum incrementally and stop if it exceeds n.\n\n    # Let's implement this.\n\n    # For each m from 2 to 60:\n\n    #   low = 2, high = 2 (initial guess)\n\n    #   find the upper bound for k. Since sum is at least 1 + k + k^2 >= 1 + 2 + 4 =7, for m=2.\n\n    #   For a given m, the maximum possible k is such that 1 + k + ... + k^m <= n.\n\n    #   To find an upper bound for k, note that for k >= 2, the sum is at least k^m. So k^m <= n => k <= n^(1/m).\n\n    #   So for binary search, set high to be n^(1/m) + 2.\n\n    #   Perform binary search between low=2 and high=n^(1/m)+2.\n\n    # For each candidate k in binary search:\n\n    #   compute the sum s = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m.\n\n    #   if s == n, return True.\n\n    #   if s < n, search higher.\n\n    #   else, search lower.\n\n    # Now, the code can be implemented as follows.\n\n    # Let's proceed to code this approach.\n\n    # Let's write the code for the is_snowflake function using this approach.\n\n    # First, handle edge cases:\n\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    # Now, iterate m from 2 to 60\n    for m in range(2, 61):\n        # Find k such that sum_{i=0}^m k^i = n\n        # The sum is S = (k^{m+1} - 1) / (k - 1)\n        # Binary search for k in [2, ...]\n        # To find upper bound for k:\n        # k^m <= n => k <= n^(1/m)\n        # So high = int(n ** (1/m)) + 2\n        # But calculating n^(1/m) can be done via math.pow or binary search.\n        # Let's use binary search for k.\n\n        # Binary search for k in [2, ...]\n        low = 2\n        high = 2\n        # Find a suitable high\n        while True:\n            # Check if high^m <= n\n            # We can calculate high^m incrementally to avoid overflow\n            temp = 1\n            for _ in range(m):\n                temp *= high\n                if temp > n:\n                    break\n            if temp <= n:\n                high *= 2\n            else:\n                break\n        # Now, high is an upper bound\n        # Perform binary search between low and high\n        while low <= high:\n            mid = (low + high) // 2\n            # Compute the sum for mid and m\n            sum_val = 0\n            current = 1\n            for _ in range(m + 1):\n                sum_val += current\n                if sum_val > n:\n                    break\n                current *= mid\n            if sum_val == n:\n                return True\n            elif sum_val < n:\n                low = mid + 1\n            else:\n                high = mid - 1\n    return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    t = int(data[0])\n    results = []\n    for i in range(1, t + 1):\n        n = int(data[i])\n        if is_snowflake(n):\n            results.append(\"YES\")\n        else:\n            results.append(\"NO\")\n    print('\\n'.join(results))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()",
