The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The problem is about determining whether a given number n can be the number of vertices in a snowflake graph as defined. Let's start by understanding what the snowflake graph structure looks like.\n\nFrom the description, the snowflake is built in a certain way. Let me break down the construction steps:\n\n1. Start with one vertex.\n2. Connect it to k new vertices (k > 1). So after this step, there are 1 + k vertices.\n3. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (so those leaves) are each connected to k new vertices. This step must be done at least once. \n\nSo the process is like building layers. The initial step creates a central node with k children. Then, each of those children (which are leaves) gets k children. And this process can be repeated multiple times. However, the step of adding new children to the leaves must be done at least once. \n\nLet me think about the structure. Let's model the number of vertices after each step. Let's say we have m layers. Wait, maybe not layers. Let's think recursively. \n\nThe initial step is level 0: 1 node. Then level 1 adds k nodes. Then each of those k nodes has k children. So for level 2, each of the level 1 nodes adds k nodes. But then, the total number of nodes after each step depends on how many times we perform the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, think of the snowflake as a tree where each node except the ones in the last layer has exactly k children. But the construction requires that the initial step is done once (the root has k children), and then each leaf (those in the first level) must have their children added once. So the minimum depth is 2. For example, the minimal snowflake for k=4 would have 1 + 4 + 4*4 = 1 + 4 + 16 = 21? Wait no, maybe not. Wait the example says that the minimal for k=4 is shown, but the sample input includes n=13 as a YES. Let me check the sample input.\n\nIn the sample input, for n=13, the answer is YES. Let's think about how that could be. Let's see:\n\nSuppose k=3. Let's think of the steps. \n\nStart with 1 node. Then add 3 nodes (total 4). Then each of those 3 nodes has 3 children. So adding 3*3=9 nodes. Total is 4+9=13. That's exactly the case. So that's a valid snowflake. So for n=13, there exists a k (like 3) such that the snowflake can be constructed.\n\nSo the structure is that the snowflake is a tree where each node except those in the last layer has exactly k children. The tree has depth at least 2. Also, the root has exactly k children, and each of the leaves in the previous step (like the first level) must have their children added once. So the tree must have at least two levels beyond the root. Wait, the initial step is the root with k children (level 1). Then, the next step adds k children to each of those level 1 nodes. So that's level 2. So the depth is 2. But the process can be repeated again. So for example, if we do another step, each of the level 2 nodes would get k children, leading to level 3. \n\nBut the problem says that the step of adding children to leaves must be done at least once. So the minimal case is when we do that once. So the snowflake can be built with any number of layers as long as the process is followed.\n\nSo the total number of nodes in such a tree depends on the number of layers and the value of k. Let's model it. \n\nLet's suppose that the tree has d layers. Wait, perhaps more accurately, the tree is built in such a way that each time we expand the leaves. So the tree is a full k-ary tree, but with some constraints on the depth. \n\nWait, for example, if the tree has depth m (where depth is the maximum number of edges from the root to a leaf), then the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m. But the problem says that the initial step (adding k children to the root) is required, and then the expansion step (adding children to the leaves) must be done at least once. So the minimal depth is 2. So the tree must have at least two levels beyond the root. \n\nWait, the root is level 0. Then level 1 (children of root) is added. Then, each of those nodes is expanded once (so level",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given number of vertices `n` can form a valid snowflake graph as defined. The snowflake graph is constructed in such a way that it starts with one vertex, then adds `k` new vertices connected to the initial vertex, and each leaf node (those connected to only one other node) is further expanded by connecting them to `k` new vertices at least once.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: The snowflake graph is essentially a tree where each node (except those in the last layer) has exactly `k` children. This structure can be viewed as a full k-ary tree with a minimum depth of 2.\n2. **Mathematical Formulation**: For a valid snowflake graph with `d` layers (starting from the root), the total number of vertices is given by the sum of a geometric series: `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^d`. However, the construction must ensure at least two layers beyond the root, so the minimum depth is 2.\n3. **Checking Validity**: For each test case, we need to check if there exists a `k > 1` such that the number of vertices `n` can be represented as the sum of a geometric series with at least two terms (i.e., depth ≥ 2).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    # Check for possible k and depth d >= 2\n    # For each possible depth d starting from 2 upwards\n    # We need to find if there exists a k > 1 such that sum_{i=0}^d k^i = n\n    # Or sum_{i=0}^{d-1} k^i + ... ?
