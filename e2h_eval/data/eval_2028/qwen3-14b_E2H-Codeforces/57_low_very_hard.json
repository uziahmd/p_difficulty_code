His teacher knows that in total Vasya got at least x points for both tours of the Olympiad. The teacher has the results of the first and the second tour of the Olympiad but the problem is, the results have only points, no names. The teacher has to know Vasya's chances.Help Vasya's teacher, find two numbers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have won. Note that the total results' table sorts the participants by the sum of points for both tours (the first place has the participant who has got the most points). If two or more participants have got the same number of points, it's up to the jury to assign places to them according to their choice. It is guaranteed that each participant of the Olympiad participated in both tours of the Olympiad.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers n, x (1 ≤ n ≤ 105; 0 ≤ x ≤ 2·105) — the number of Olympiad participants and the minimum number of points Vasya earned.The second line contains n space-separated integers: a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the first tour.The third line contains n space-separated integers: b1, b2, ..., bn (0 ≤ bi ≤ 105) — the participants' points in the second tour.The participants' points are given in the arbitrary order. It is guaranteed that Vasya was present in the Olympiad — there are two integers i, j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ n) such, that ai + bj ≥ x.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers — the best and the worst place Vasya could have got on the Olympiad.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5 2\\n1 1 1 1 1\\n1 1 1 1 1', '6 7\\n4 3 5 6 4 4\\n8 6 0 4 3 4']\n\n### Output\n['1 5', '1 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first text sample all 5 participants earn 2 points each in any case. Depending on the jury's decision, Vasya can get the first (the best) as well as the last (the worst) fifth place.In the second test sample in the best case scenario Vasya wins again: he can win 12 points and become the absolute winner if the total results' table looks like that — {4:8, 6:4, 3:6, 4:4, 4:3, 5:0}.In this table all participants are sorted by decreasing points and we can see how much a participant earned in the first and in the second tour.In the worst case scenario Vasya can get the fifth place if the table looks like that — {4:8, 4:6, 6:4, 5:4, 4:3, 3:0}, and he earned 4 and 3 points in the first and second tours, correspondingly.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about finding the best and worst possible ranks Vasya can have based on his minimum total points x. The teacher has the first and second tour scores for all participants, but they are not linked to names. So, we need to consider all possible pairings of a_i and b_j (but each participant has exactly one a and one b, right? Wait no, the input gives two lists: a1...an are the first tour points for each participant, and b1...bn are the second tour points. But the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So for each participant, their first tour score is a_i and second tour is b_i? Or are the a's and b's for the same participants but in different order? No, wait, the problem says that the participants' points are given in arbitrary order. So, for example, the first list is the first tour scores of all participants, and the second list is the second tour scores. However, the pairing between a_i and b_j for a particular participant isn't known. Because the teacher doesn't know which a_i corresponds to which b_j. But Vasya is one of the participants, and he has some a_i and b_j such that their sum is at least x. Our job is to find the best and worst possible rank he could have.\n\nSo the key here is that we can pair the a's and b's in any way possible (as long as each a is paired with exactly one b, and vice versa), and then determine for Vasya's possible (a_i + b_j) value (which is at least x) what's the best and worst possible rank he can get.\n\nWait, but how do we model Vasya's possible scores? Because the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. But when considering the best and worst possible ranks, we need to choose a pairing where Vasya's total is as high as possible (to get best rank) or as low as possible (to get worst rank), but ensuring that his total is at least x.\n\nWait, no. The problem states that the teacher knows that Vasya got at least x points. So in reality, Vasya's actual total is some value >=x, but the teacher doesn't know which. However, the teacher needs to find the best and worst possible positions Vasya could have, given that his total is at least x. So the way to model this is that we can choose any possible pairing of a's and b's (so that each participant has one a and one b), and in that pairing, there must be at least one participant (Vasya) whose a_i + b_j is >=x. Then, for that pairing, compute the rank of that participant. But since the teacher doesn't know which pairing is correct, we need to find the best possible (minimum possible) rank and the worst possible (maximum possible) rank that Vasya can have across all possible pairings where there's at least one participant (Vasya) with total >=x.\n\nWait, but how does the pairing work? Because the problem says that each participant participated in both tours. So each participant has exactly one a_i and one b_j. So the pairing is a permutation. For example, if we have a list a and list b, then the actual pairing is a permutation p where for each participant i, their first tour is a_i and second tour is b_p[i]. So the total for participant i is a_i + b_p[i].\n\nBut the problem is that we need to find, among all possible permutations p, the best and worst possible rank that Vasya can have. However, Vasya is one of the participants, but we don't know which one. But the problem says that there exists at least one pair (i,j) such that a_i + b_j >=x. So in our case, for the purposes of finding the best and worst possible ranks, we can choose which participant is Vasya (i.e., which a_i and b_j are assigned to him) as long as their sum is at least x. Then, for that choice of pairing, compute his rank.\n\nBut how do we model this? Because for the best possible rank, we want to assign to Vasya a pair (a_i, b_j) such that his total is as high as possible, and arrange the other pairs so that as many others as possible have lower totals. For the worst possible rank, we want to assign to Vasya a pair (a_i, b_j) with sum exactly x (or as low as possible, but still >=x), and arrange others to have higher sums.\n\nBut the problem is that the pairing must be a permutation. So for example, if",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the best and worst possible ranks Vasya could have achieved in an Olympiad based on his minimum total points from two tours. The solution involves considering all possible pairings of scores from the first and second tours while ensuring that Vasya's total score is at least a given value `x`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Best Possible Rank**: To find the best possible rank, we maximize Vasya's total score by pairing the highest values from the first tour with the highest values from the second tour. This ensures that Vasya's score is as high as possible, potentially placing him at the top.\n2. **Worst Possible Rank**: To find the worst possible rank, we minimize Vasya's total score while still meeting the minimum requirement `x`. This involves pairing the lowest possible values from the first tour with the lowest possible values from the second tour, ensuring that Vasya's score is just enough to meet the minimum requirement.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    x = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    b = list(map(int, input[idx:idx+n]))\n    idx += n\n    \n    # Sort a and b\n    a_sorted = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Best place\n    # We want to maximize Vasya's total, so pair largest a with largest b\n    # So the maximum possible total for Vasya is a_sorted[-1] + b_sorted[-1]\n    max_vasya = a_sorted[-1] + b_sorted[-1]\n    \n    # Count how many people have sum >= max_vasya\n    # Since we can arrange others to have lower sums, the best place is 1\n    best = 1\n    \n    # Worst place\n    # We need to find the minimal possible total for Vasya which is >=x\n    # To get the worst place, we want as many people as possible to have sum > Vasya's sum\n    # So we need to find the minimal sum s >=x such that when Vasya has s, others can have higher sums\n    # To do this, we can consider all possible s >=x, and find the minimal s that can be achieved by some a_i + b_j\n    # Then, count how many pairs have sum > s\n    \n    # First, find the minimal possible s >=x that can be achieved by some a_i + b_j\n    # We can find the minimal s by trying to pair smallest a with smallest b such that their sum is >=x\n    # But since the pairing must be a permutation, it's not straightforward\n    # However, for the worst case, we can assume that Vasya's score is the minimal possible s >=x, and then count how many pairs can be greater than s\n    \n    # To find the minimal s >=x that is achievable:\n    # Sort a in ascending order, and b in descending order, and find the first a_i + b_j >=x\n    # Or sort a in ascending and b in ascending, and find the minimal s\n    # Actually, to find the minimal possible s >=x that can be achieved by any a_i + b_j, we can do the following:\n    # Sort a in ascending, sort b in ascending\n    # For each a_i in a_sorted, find the minimal b_j such that a_i + b_j >=x\n    # Then take the minimal among these\n    \n    # Let's find the minimal possible s that is >=x\n    min_s = float('inf')\n    a_sorted_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_sorted_asc = sorted(b)\n    \n    # Use two pointers to find minimal s >=x\n    i = 0\n    j = len(b_sorted_asc) - 1\n    found = False\n    while i < len(a_sorted_asc) and j >= 0:\n        current_sum = a_sorted_asc[i] + b_sorted_asc[j]\n        if current_sum >= x:\n            min_s = min(min_s, current_sum)\n            j -= 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    if min_s == float('inf'):\n        # Not possible (but problem says it is guaranteed)\n        pass\n    \n    # Now, we need to find how many pairs have sum > min_s\n    # To compute this, we can sort the a and b in such a way that we can count the number of pairs (a_i, b_j) where a_i + b_j > min_s\n    \n    # Sort a in ascending, b in ascending\n    a_asc = sorted(a)\n    b_asc = sorted(b)\n    \n    # For each a_i, find the number of b_j such that a_i + b_j > min_s\n    # Which is equivalent to b_j > (min_s - a_i)\n    # So for each a_i, find the first index in b_asc where b_j > (min_s - a_i)\n    # The number of such elements is len(b_asc) - idx\n    \n    count = 0\n    for ai in a_asc:\n        target = min_s - ai\n        # find first index in b_asc where value > target\n        idx_b = bisect.bisect_right(b_asc, target)\n        count += len(b_asc) - idx_b\n    \n    # But since we are considering the worst case scenario, we need to subtract 1 if Vasya's own sum is included in the count\n    # Because Vasya's sum is min_s, and others can have sum > min_s\n    # So the worst place is count + 1\n    worst = count + 1\n    \n    print(best, worst)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Best Rank Calculation**: By pairing the highest scores from both tours, we ensure Vasya's score is maximized, leading to the best possible rank of 1.\n- **Worst Rank Calculation**: Using a two-pointer technique to find the minimal score Vasya can have while still meeting the minimum requirement `x`, we then count how many other participants can have higher scores.
