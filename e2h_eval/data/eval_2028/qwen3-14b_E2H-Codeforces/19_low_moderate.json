The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. Since the districts form a tree structure (since there's exactly one path between any two districts), the problem reduces to finding a connected subtree with (n - k) nodes that has the maximum possible sum of 2^i values. But since 2^i increases exponentially with i, the optimal strategy would be to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible. Because higher numbers contribute more to the sum.\n\nWait, right! Because each district's value is 2^i, which grows exponentially. So, the highest possible districts should be kept. However, the challenge is that they need to form a connected subtree. So, the problem becomes: select a subtree with (n -k) nodes, which includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible, and then remove the others.\n\nBut how do we find such a subtree?\n\nLet me think. Since the value of each node is 2^i, which is larger than all lower-numbered nodes, the optimal strategy is to include the largest possible nodes. So perhaps we can start by keeping the largest (n -k) nodes, but ensuring that they form a connected subtree. If they are connected, then that's the best. Otherwise, we need to adjust.\n\nBut how to check if the largest (n -k) nodes form a connected subtree? Well, maybe not. For example, if the largest nodes are scattered in the tree, then we might need to include some lower-numbered nodes to connect them. However, since the lower-numbered nodes have smaller values, we want to minimize their inclusion.\n\nSo, perhaps the approach is to greedily select the largest nodes, and then ensure connectivity by adding necessary lower nodes. But how to do this efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as building a subtree that includes as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Let's consider that the optimal subtree must contain the node with the highest number, because otherwise, if we exclude it, we could include it instead of some lower node, which would give a higher sum. So the highest-numbered node must be in the subtree.\n\nSimilarly, once we include the highest node, we need to include as many of the next highest nodes as possible, but connected to it.\n\nThis sounds like a problem where we can model it as a priority-based selection. Let's think of the problem as starting from the highest-numbered node and then adding the next highest nodes that are connected to the existing subtree.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a reverse process. Since we need to remove k nodes, and the remaining nodes must be connected. So, the problem is equivalent to choosing a subtree with (n -k) nodes, which has the maximum sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes included, and the nodes are numbered from 1 to n, with higher numbers being better, the optimal subtree must contain the largest possible nodes.\n\nSo here's an idea: the optimal subtree is the one that contains the largest (n -k) nodes, but connected. However, if those nodes are not connected, we have to remove some of the lower ones and include some higher ones to connect them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can perform a greedy algorithm where we start with the largest node, and then iteratively add the next largest node that is connected to the current subtree. But how to implement this?\n\nBut considering that the tree is big (up to 1e6 nodes), we need an efficient way.\n\nWait, but the sum is the sum of 2^i for the nodes. Since each node's value is unique and increases with i, the optimal subtree must consist of the largest possible nodes, but connected. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum subset of nodes with size (n -k) that forms a connected subtree. The way to maximize the sum is to take the largest (n -k) nodes, but if they are not connected, we need to find which ones to remove to make them connected.\n\nBut how to determine which nodes to remove?\n\nAlternatively, think of this as a problem where we want to keep the nodes with the largest numbers, but ensuring that they are connected. So the approach is to start with the largest node, then add the next largest nodes that are connected to the current subtree. But how to do this?\n\nWait, here's an idea inspired by Krusky's algorithm. Let's think of the nodes in order of decreasing value (so starting from n down to 1). We can build a maximum spanning tree, but in this case, the tree is already given. Wait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as trying to select the nodes to keep. The key is that the nodes to keep must form a connected",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove so that the remaining districts form a connected component and maximize the total number of fans. The districts are structured as a tree, and each district's fan count is exponentially increasing with its number. Therefore, our goal is to retain the largest possible districts while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given structure is a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two nodes.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since the fan count for district `i` is `2^i`, higher-numbered districts contribute significantly more. Hence, we aim to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the retained districts form a connected subtree. This can be achieved by starting from the highest-numbered district and iteratively adding the next highest-numbered districts that are connected to the current subtree.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    # We need to keep (n - k) districts, which should be the largest possible\n    # So we start from the largest node and try to include as many large nodes as possible\n    # We can use BFS or DFS to find which nodes are included in the subtree\n\n    # Start with the largest node\n    keep = set()\n    to_remove = set()\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    q = deque()\n    q.append(n)\n    visited[n] = True\n    keep.add(n)\n    count = 1\n\n    # We need to collect (n - k) nodes\n    target = n - k\n\n    while count < target and q:\n        u = q.popleft()\n        # Sort neighbors in descending order to prioritize larger nodes\n        for v in sorted(edges[u], reverse=True):\n            if not visited[v]:\n                visited[v] = True\n                keep.add(v)\n                q.append(v)\n                count += 1\n                if count == target:\n                    break\n\n    # Now, the nodes in 'keep' are the ones we want to keep\n    # The rest are to be removed\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if i not in keep:\n            result.append(i)\n    result.sort()\n    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and stored in an adjacency list to represent the tree.\n2. **BFS for Connectivity**: Starting from the highest-numbered district (node `n`), we use BFS to traverse and include the largest possible districts first. This ensures that we prioritize higher-numbered nodes while maintaining connectivity.\n3. **Tracking Nodes**: Nodes are tracked in a set to ensure they are included in the connected component. Once we have collected the required number of nodes (`n - k`), we determine which nodes to remove.\n4. **Output**: The nodes not included in the connected component are collected, sorted, and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently ensures that the maximum number of high-value districts are retained while maintaining connectivity, leveraging BFS for traversal and prioritizing higher-numbered nodes.",
