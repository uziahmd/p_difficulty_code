The number of fans of a contestant from district $$$i$$$ is equal to $$$2^i$$$.This year, the president decided to reduce the costs. He wants to remove $$$k$$$ contestants from the games. However, the districts of the removed contestants will be furious and will not allow anyone to cross through their districts. The president wants to ensure that all remaining contestants are from districts that can be reached from one another. He also wishes to maximize the total number of fans of the participating contestants.Which contestants should the president remove?\n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \\leq k < n \\leq 10^6$$$) — the number of districts in Panel, and the number of contestants the president wishes to remove, respectively.The next $$$n-1$$$ lines each contains two integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$, $$$a \\ne b$$$), that describe a road that connects two different districts $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ in the nation. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one path between every two districts.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ space-separated integers: the numbers of the districts of which the contestants should be removed, in increasing order of district number.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3\\n2 1\\n2 6\\n4 2\\n5 6\\n2 3', '8 4\\n2 6\\n2 7\\n7 8\\n1 2\\n3 1\\n2 4\\n7 5']\n\n### Output\n['1 3 4', '1 3 4 5']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, the maximum possible total number of fans is $$$2^2 + 2^5 + 2^6 = 100$$$. We can achieve it by removing the contestants of the districts 1, 3, and 4.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about selecting k districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component, and the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts is maximized. And we need to output the k districts in increasing order.\n\nHmm. The key here is that the tree structure is given. Since the districts are connected as a tree, removing some nodes will split the tree into parts. But the president wants all remaining contestants to be connected, so after removing k districts, the remaining n - k districts must form a connected subtree.\n\nThe goal is to maximize the sum of 2^i for the remaining districts. Since 2^i grows exponentially with i, higher-numbered districts contribute way more. So ideally, we want to keep as many high-numbered districts as possible, but ensuring that they are connected.\n\nSo the strategy would be to select the districts to keep, which are as high as possible, but connected. But how?\n\nLet me think. The optimal solution would be to keep a subtree that includes the largest possible districts. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the highest-numbered districts, perhaps we can approach this by choosing to keep the largest (n - k) districts, but ensuring they form a connected subtree.\n\nBut how to ensure connectivity? Because even if you take the top (n -k) districts, they might not form a connected component. So maybe we need to find a way to select the largest possible districts, but in a way that they are connected.\n\nWait, but the tree is connected. So perhaps we can think of it as choosing a subtree that contains as many high-numbered nodes as possible. Let's think of it as starting from the highest-numbered node and building up.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as selecting which nodes to remove. Since the sum is maximized by keeping the highest-numbered nodes, we need to remove the smallest-numbered nodes, but ensuring that the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nWait, but maybe not. Because if you remove some small nodes, but that splits the tree into parts where the high nodes are not connected. For example, imagine the tree is a straight line: 1-2-3-4-5-6. Suppose we need to remove 3 nodes. If we remove 1, 2, 3, then the remaining are 4,5,6 which are connected. But if we remove 1, 2, 4, then the remaining nodes are 3,5,6. But 3 is connected to 2 (which is removed), so 3 is disconnected from 5 and 6. Hence, that's invalid.\n\nSo the idea is to remove nodes in such a way that the remaining nodes form a connected subtree. But since the sum depends on the nodes kept, which are the ones with higher numbers, the approach is probably to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, but make sure they are connected. However, how to do that?\n\nAnother thought: the largest (n -k) nodes must form a connected subtree. So perhaps we can find the minimal set of nodes to remove such that the remaining nodes are connected and include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAn alternative approach is to model this as selecting a subtree with exactly (n -k) nodes, which has maximum sum. Since the sum is determined by the nodes in the subtree, and since each node contributes 2^i, which is unique and increases with i, the optimal subtree must contain the largest possible nodes.\n\nSo perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the largest (n -k) nodes, but connected. How can we ensure that?\n\nLet me think about the structure of the tree. Since the tree is connected, and each node has a unique number, perhaps we can perform a process where we start from the highest-numbered node and greedily include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n\nBut how to ensure that the subtree remains connected?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem where we need to remove k nodes, but the remaining nodes must form a connected component. To maximize the sum, we should remove the nodes with the smallest numbers, but in such a way that the remaining nodes are connected.\n\nBut how to do that?\n\nMaybe we can model this as follows:\n\nWe need to keep (n -k) nodes. Since the sum is maximized when we keep the largest (n -k) nodes. However, those nodes may not be connected. So we need to remove some of the smaller-numbered nodes that are in the way of connecting the larger ones.\n\nBut how to find which nodes to remove?\n\nWait, perhaps the optimal subtree is the one that includes the largest (n -k) nodes, and any necessary smaller nodes that are required to connect them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as selecting a subtree that includes the largest possible nodes. Let's think about the following approach:\n\nStart with the largest",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine which districts to remove such that the remaining districts form a connected component and the total number of fans is maximized. The districts are connected in a tree structure, and the number of fans for a district $i$ is $2^i$. Our goal is to keep the highest-numbered districts possible while ensuring connectivity.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Tree Structure**: The given districts form a tree, meaning there is exactly one path between any two districts.\n2. **Maximizing Fans**: Since $2^i$ grows exponentially with $i$, we should prioritize keeping higher-numbered districts.\n3. **Connectivity Check**: We need to ensure that the remaining districts after removal form a connected subtree. This means we need to remove nodes in a way that the remaining nodes stay connected.\n\nThe approach involves:\n1. **Greedy Selection**: Start from the highest-numbered node and work downwards, ensuring that the subtree remains connected.\n2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Use DFS to traverse the tree and determine which nodes can be removed while maintaining connectivity.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport threading\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    edges = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        a, b = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        edges[a].append(b)\n        edges[b].append(a)\n    \n    # We need to keep (n - k) nodes, which should be the largest ones possible\n    # So we will try to keep the largest nodes and remove the smallest ones that are not needed\n    # To do this, we can perform a DFS starting from the largest node and mark nodes to keep\n    \n    keep = [False] * (n + 1)\n    removed = []\n    \n    # We'll use a priority queue approach, but since we want to keep the largest nodes, we start from the largest\n    # and perform a DFS to collect as many high-numbered nodes as possible, ensuring connectivity\n    \n    # First, we need to find the subtree that includes the largest (n - k) nodes\n    # Let's try to build the subtree by starting from the largest node and then adding as many high-numbered nodes as possible\n    \n    # We need to track which nodes are kept and ensure that the number of kept nodes is (n - k)\n    # We can use a set to track the kept nodes, and perform a DFS to collect them\n    \n    # Let's use a visited array to avoid cycles\n    visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n    def dfs(u, parent):\n        # We decide to keep u if it's part of the subtree\n        # We want to keep as many high-numbered nodes as possible, so we start from the largest\n        # So we first mark the largest nodes, then check their children\n        # However, the approach here is to greedily keep the nodes with higher numbers\n        # But how to ensure that the number of kept nodes is exactly (n - k)\n        # Alternative approach: We can perform a post-order traversal and decide which nodes to keep\n        # This is similar to the problem of finding a subtree with maximum sum, but with constraints\n        \n        # Let's think differently: we need to remove k nodes. So we can start by assuming that all nodes are kept, and then remove the smallest necessary ones.\n        # However, that might not be feasible. Another approach is to find the minimal set of nodes to remove to break the tree into a connected component containing the largest nodes.\n        \n        # Here's an alternative idea inspired by the problem's nature:\n        # The optimal solution is to keep the largest (n - k) nodes, but they must form a connected subtree.\n        # To ensure that, we can start from the largest node and perform a DFS, collecting nodes in decreasing order of their numbers.\n        # If during the traversal we collect enough nodes, we stop.\n        # However, this may not be sufficient, so we need a more precise method.\n        \n        # The following approach is inspired by the fact that we want to keep as many large nodes as possible.\n        # We will perform a DFS starting from the largest node and try to include as many large nodes as possible.\n        # We'll keep track of the count of nodes kept and stop when we have enough.\n        \n        # But this approach may not work because the tree could have branches with lower-numbered nodes.\n        # Therefore, we need to prioritize keeping the larger nodes and remove the smaller ones that are not essential.\n        \n        # Let's use a priority-based approach. We can use a priority queue to always visit the largest nodes first.\n        # However, since the tree is connected, we can use a modified DFS or BFS starting from the largest node.\n        \n        # Let's try to build the subtree starting from the largest node and greedily add the largest possible nodes.\n        # We'll use a set to track which nodes are kept and perform a DFS to explore the tree.\n        \n        # Let's try this approach:\n        # 1. Start with the largest node (n)\n        # 2. Perform a DFS from this node, and keep track of the nodes visited.\n        # 3. Continue until we have collected (n - k) nodes.\n        # 4. The nodes not collected are the ones to be removed.\n        \n        # However, this may not work if the subtree rooted at n has less than (n -k) nodes. In that case, we need to find other nodes to include.\n        \n        # To handle this, we can use a priority queue (max-heap) to process nodes in decreasing order, ensuring that we include as many high-numbered nodes as possible.\n        # We can use a BFS approach where we prioritize visiting higher-numbered nodes first.\n        \n        # Let's implement this approach:\n        # Initialize a max-heap with node n\n        # Keep track of visited nodes\n        # While the number of kept nodes is less than (n -k), and the heap is not empty:\n        #   Pop the largest node\n        #   Add it to the kept set\n        #   Add its neighbors (not yet visited) to the heap\n        # This ensures that we collect the largest possible nodes, but this might not form a connected subtree.\n        # Wait, this approach might not work because the nodes added might not be connected.\n        \n        # Therefore, we need a way to ensure that the collected nodes form a connected subtree.\n        # So, the correct approach is to start from the largest node and perform a DFS/BFS, collecting nodes in a way that maintains connectivity.\n        # Once we have collected (n -k) nodes, the rest can be removed.\n        \n        # So let's proceed with this approach:\n        # Start from node n, perform a BFS/DFS, and collect nodes until we have (n -k) nodes.\n        # The nodes not collected are the ones to be removed.\n        \n        # Let's implement this:\n        # Initialize a queue with node n\n        # Mark it as visited\n        # Count = 1\n        # While count < (n -k) and queue is not empty:\n        #   Dequeue a node\n        #   For each neighbor, if not visited, enqueue it and mark as visited\n        #   Increment count\n        # The nodes not visited are the ones to be removed.\n        \n        # However, this approach may not collect enough nodes if the subtree rooted at n is too small.\n        # For example, if n is a leaf node and the required (n -k) is larger than the size of the subtree rooted at n.\n        # In such cases, we need to find other nodes to include.\n        \n        # Therefore, this approach might not work in all cases. An alternative is to perform a modified DFS that prioritizes nodes with higher numbers.\n        # However, given time constraints, let's proceed with the BFS approach and see if it works for the sample input.\n        \n        # Let's implement the BFS approach:\n        target = n - k\n        visited = [False] * (n + 1)\n        from collections import deque\n        q = deque()\n        q.append(n)\n        visited[n] = True\n        count = 1\n        while count < target and q:\n            u = q.popleft()\n            for v in edges[u]:\n                if not visited[v]:\n                    visited[v] = True\n                    count += 1\n                    q.append(v)\n        # Now, the nodes that are visited are the ones to keep\n        # The ones not visited are to be removed\n        # But wait, this may not collect enough nodes. For example, if the subtree rooted at n is too small.\n        # However, the problem says that the president wants to remove k contestants, so the remaining must be connected. Thus, the tree must have a connected component of size (n -k).\n        # Since the original tree is connected, there must be such a component.\n        \n        # So, the BFS approach starting from the largest node will collect as many nodes as possible in a connected component, but it may not collect all required nodes.\n        # However, this approach may not work for all cases. For example, if the largest node is isolated (unlikely in a tree).\n        \n        # Let's test this approach on the first sample input:\n        # Sample Input 1:\n        # 6 3\n        # Edges: 2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3\n        # The tree looks like:\n        # 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. 6 is connected to 5.\n        # Starting from node 6 (largest), the BFS would collect 6, then 2, then 1, 4, 3, 5. That's 6 nodes. But target is 6 -3=3. So the first three nodes would be 6, 2, and then maybe 5 or 1?\n        # Wait, the BFS would collect 6, then 2, then 1, 4, 3, 5. So the first three nodes are 6, 2, and then next in the queue would be 1, 4, 3, 5. So the visited nodes are 6, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5. So the count reaches 6, which is target=3? No, target is 3. So the code would stop once count reaches 3. So the visited nodes are 6, 2, and one more (say 1). Then the nodes to keep are 6, 2, 1. But the sample output requires keeping 2, 5, 6. So this approach would not work.\n        \n        # So clearly, this approach is incorrect. Hence, we need another way.\n        \n        # Let's think again. The correct approach is to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, but ensure they are connected. To do this, we can consider the following:\n        # The largest node (n) must be in the kept set. Then, we need to connect it to other large nodes. So we can perform a DFS starting from n, and for each node, decide whether to keep it based on its value.\n        # However, this seems vague. Let's look for a better approach.\n        \n        # Another idea: The problem is similar to finding a subtree with exactly m = n -k nodes that has the maximum sum of 2^i. Since the sum is maximized by including the largest nodes, we can model this as selecting the largest m nodes and ensuring they form a connected subtree. If they do, then we can remove the others. If not, we need to find the minimal set of nodes to include to connect them.\n        \n        # How to check if the largest m nodes form a connected subtree? If not, we need to include some smaller nodes to connect them.\n        \n        # But how to efficiently find which nodes to include?\n        \n        # Let's consider that the largest m nodes must be included, and we need to ensure that they are connected. We can build a subtree that contains all of them, possibly including some smaller nodes.\n        \n        # This sounds like a problem that can be solved with a greedy algorithm, where we keep the largest nodes and include necessary smaller nodes to maintain connectivity.\n        \n        # Let's try to implement this:\n        # 1. Collect all the nodes in a list sorted in descending order.\n        # 2. Start with the largest node, and perform a DFS or BFS to collect as many of the larger nodes as possible.\n        # 3. If we can collect m nodes, then those are the ones to keep. Otherwise, we need to include more nodes.\n        \n        # However, this is still unclear. Let's refer to a known solution for similar problems.\n        \n        # After some research, this problem resembles the \"maximum weight connected subgraph\" problem, which is NP-hard in general. However, given the structure of the tree and the weights being 2^i, we can find an efficient solution.\n        \n        # Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, the optimal solution is to keep the largest m nodes and connect them. To do this, we can perform a DFS from the largest node and include as many large nodes as possible, ignoring smaller ones unless necessary.\n        \n        # The correct approach is to perform a DFS starting from the largest node, and during traversal, keep track of the nodes that are part of the subtree. We will continue until we have collected m nodes.\n        \n        # Let's try this approach again, but this time, we will use a priority-based DFS. We can use a priority queue (max-heap) to always visit the largest nodes first, ensuring that we collect as many large nodes as possible.\n        \n        # Let's implement this:\n        # 1. Start with the largest node.\n        # 2. Use a priority queue (max-heap) to process nodes in descending order.\n        # 3. Keep track of visited nodes.\n        # 4.

For example, if the subtree rooted at n is too small.\n        # However, the problem says that the president wants to remove k contestants, so the remaining must be connected. Thus, the tree must have a connected component of size (n -k).\n        # Since the original tree is connected, there must be such a component.\n        \n        # So, the BFS approach starting from the largest node will collect as many nodes as possible in a connected component, but it may not collect all required nodes.\n        # However, this approach may not work for all cases. For example, if the largest node is isolated (unlikely in a tree).\n        \n        # Let's test this approach on the first sample input:\n        # Sample Input 1:\n        # 6 3\n        # Edges: 2-1, 2-6, 4-2, 5-6, 2-3\n        # The tree looks like:\n        # 2 is connected to 1, 6, 4, 3. 6 is connected to 5.\n        # Starting from node 6 (largest), the BFS would collect 6, then 2, then 1, 4, 3, 5. That's 6 nodes. But target is 6 -3=3. So the first three nodes would be 6, 2, and then maybe 5 or 1?\n        # Wait, the BFS would collect 6, then 2, then 1, 4, 3, 5. So the first three nodes are 6, 2, and then next in the queue would be 1, 4, 3, 5. So the visited nodes are 6, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5. So the count reaches 6, which is target=3? No, target is 3. So the code would stop once count reaches 3. So the visited nodes are 6, 2, and one more (say 1). Then the nodes to keep are 6, 2, 1. But the sample output requires keeping 2, 5, 6. So this approach would not work.\n        \n        # So clearly, this approach is incorrect. Hence, we need another way.\n        \n        # Let's think again. The correct approach is to keep the largest (n -k) nodes, but ensure they are connected. To do this, we can consider the following:\n        # The largest node (n) must be in the kept set. Then, we need to connect it to other large nodes. So we can perform a DFS starting from n, and for each node, decide whether to keep it based on its value.\n        # However, this seems vague. Let's look for a better approach.\n        \n        # Another idea: The problem is similar to finding a subtree with exactly m = n -k nodes that has the maximum sum of 2^i. Since the sum is maximized by including the largest nodes, we can model this as selecting the largest m nodes and ensuring they form a connected subtree. If they do, then we can remove the others. If not, we need to find the minimal set of nodes to include to connect them.\n        \n        # How to check if the largest m nodes form a connected subtree? If not, we need to include some smaller nodes to connect them.\n        \n        # But how to efficiently find which nodes to include?\n        \n        # Let's consider that the largest m nodes must be included, and we need to ensure that they are connected. We can build a subtree that contains all of them, possibly including some smaller nodes.\n        \n        # This sounds like a problem that can be solved with a greedy algorithm, where we keep the largest nodes and include necessary smaller nodes to maintain connectivity.\n        \n        # Let's try to implement this:\n        # 1. Collect all the nodes in a list sorted in descending order.\n        # 2. Start with the largest node, and perform a DFS or BFS to collect as many of the larger nodes as possible.\n        # 3. If we can collect m nodes, then those are the ones to keep. Otherwise, we need to include more nodes.\n        \n        # However, this is still unclear. Let's refer to a known solution for similar problems.\n        \n        # After some research, this problem resembles the \"maximum weight connected subgraph\" problem, which is NP-hard in general. However, given the structure of the tree and the weights being 2^i, we can find an efficient solution.\n        \n        # Since 2^i increases exponentially with i, the optimal solution is to keep the largest m nodes and connect them. To do this, we can perform a DFS from the largest node and include as many large nodes as possible, ignoring smaller ones unless necessary.\n        \n        # The correct approach is to perform a DFS starting from the largest node, and during traversal, keep track of the nodes that are part of the subtree. We will continue until we have collected m nodes.\n        \n        # Let's try this approach again, but this time, we will use a priority-based DFS. We can use a priority queue (max-heap) to always visit the largest nodes first, ensuring that we collect as many large nodes as possible.\n        \n        # Let's implement this:\n        # 1. Start with the largest node.\n        # 2. Use a priority queue (max-heap) to process nodes in descending order.\n        # 3. Keep track of visited nodes.\n        # 4.

To do this, we can perform a DFS from the largest node and include as many large nodes as possible.\n\n    # Let's proceed with the following code:\n\n    # We'll perform a DFS from the largest node, and collect nodes in a way that ensures connectivity.\n\n    # The following code is based on this logic:\n\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n\n    def main():\n        import sys\n        input = sys.stdin.read\n        data = input().split()\n        idx = 0\n        n = int(data[idx])\n        idx +=1\n        k = int(data[idx])\n        idx +=1\n        edges = [[] for _ in range(n+1)]\n        for _ in range(n-1):\n            a = int(data[idx])\n            idx +=1\n            b = int(data[idx])\n            idx +=1\n            edges[a].append(b)\n            edges[b].append(a)\n        \n        target = n - k\n        keep = [False]*(n+1)\n        visited = [False]*(n+1)\n        # We'll perform a DFS from the largest node\n        # But how to choose which nodes to keep?\n        # Let's use a priority queue to visit nodes in descending order, and perform a BFS to ensure connectivity\n\n        from collections import deque\n        # We'll use a priority queue (max-heap) to process nodes in descending order\n        # But Python's heapq is a min-heap, so we can store negative values\n        import heapq\n        heap = []\n        # Initially, we add all nodes to the heap\n        for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n            heapq.heappush(heap, -i)\n        \n        visited = [False]*(n+1)\n        count = 0\n        while heap and count < target:\n            node = -heapq.heappop(heap)\n            if visited[node]:\n                continue\n            visited[node] = True\n            count +=1\n            for neighbor in edges[node]:\n                if not visited[neighbor]:\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, -neighbor)\n        \n        # The nodes not visited are to be removed\n        res = []\n        for i in range(1, n+1):\n            if not visited[i]:\n                res.append(i)\n        res.sort()\n        print(' '.join(map(str, res)))\n\n    main()\n\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()",
