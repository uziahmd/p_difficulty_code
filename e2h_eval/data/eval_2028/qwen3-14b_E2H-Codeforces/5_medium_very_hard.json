Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color, which can be a lowercase letter or a question mark. The goal is to pair as many left-right boots as possible such that their colors are compatible. Compatibility rules: same specific color, or one of them is a question mark. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nThe output is the maximum number of pairs and their indices.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, think about how to maximize the pairs. Let's consider different cases.\n\nIdea: We can first pair the left boots with specific colors (non-?) with right boots that have the same specific color. Then, handle the remaining question marks.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\n1. For each color (excluding ?), count how many left boots have that color, and how many right boots have that color. For each color c, the number of pairs we can form here is min(left[c], right[c]). But since each boot can be used once, we need to track which ones are used.\n\nBut wait, maybe we should first pair the left and right boots with specific colors, then use the remaining question marks to pair with any remaining boots.\n\nBut how to handle the question marks? Because they can be paired with any other boots (including other ?s).\n\nSo perhaps the approach is:\n\n- First, pair all specific colors between left and right. For example, for each color c, pair as many left c with right c as possible. But how to do this without overlapping?\n\nWait, but if I process each color in order, and for each, pair the left and right boots with that color. However, since each boot can be used once, we need to track which ones are already used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can create a mapping for each color, and for each color, pair as many as possible between left and right.\n\nBut for that, perhaps we can:\n\n- Create two dictionaries: left_count and right_count. For each color (non-?), count how many left and right boots there are. Then, for each color, the number of pairs is min(left_count[c], right_count[c]). However, this might not account for overlapping usage. But maybe that's not the way to think.\n\nWait, no. Because if we pair left's 'a' with right's 'a's, that's the maximum possible for that color. So the total pairs from specific colors would be sum over all colors of min(left_count[c], right_count[c]).\n\nBut then, after that, we have some left and right boots that are not paired yet. These could be either:\n\n- Left boots with color ?, or right boots with color ?.\n\n- Or, left boots with specific colors that couldn't find a matching right (because there were more lefts than rights for that color), or vice versa.\n\nSo, the next step is to use the question marks. But how?\n\nLet me think. The remaining left boots (after pairing specific colors) can be:\n\nLeft boots that have specific colors but couldn't find a match (so, for example, if there were 3 left 'a's and 2 right 'a's, then 2 pairs are made, leaving one left 'a'). Also, there are left '?'s and right '?'s.\n\nBut the question marks can be paired with any remaining boots. So, perhaps:\n\nAfter pairing the specific colors, we can collect the remaining left and right boots. Then, pair the left '?'s with right '?'s first. Then, pair the left '?'s with the remaining specific right boots (those that didn't get paired yet), and vice versa.\n\nBut how to track which boots are used?\n\nThis seems complicated. Because for each boot, we need to know whether it's already been used.\n\nSo, the problem requires us to track which left and right boots are available for pairing.\n\nSo, perhaps the steps are:\n\n1. For each left boot and right boot, track if they are used or not.\n\n2. First, for each color (excluding ?), pair left and right boots of that color. For example, for color 'a', pair as many as possible between left and right. How to do that? For each color c, iterate through left and right boots, and pair them.\n\nBut for large n (up to 150,000), we need an efficient way.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can create for each color c (excluding ?) a list of left indices and a list of right indices. Then, for each color, pair as many as possible between left and right. For example, for color 'a', take min(len(left_a), len(right_a)) pairs. Then, mark those boots as used.\n\nBut how to do that efficiently?\n\nBut for the purpose of counting, perhaps we can first process the specific colors, then process the question marks.\n\nBut how to track which boots are used.\n\nAnother idea: For each left boot and right boot, we can track their availability. So, for each color c (not ?), we can collect the indices of left boots with color c and the indices of right boots with color c. Then, for each color, pair each left with a right, up to the minimum count. Then, mark those as used.\n\nOnce that's done, collect all the remaining left boots (those not used) and the remaining right boots (not used). Then, process the question marks.\n\nNow, the remaining left and right boots can be:\n\n- Left boots with specific colors (but their corresponding right boots are not available).\n\n- Right boots with specific colors (but their corresponding left boots are not available).\n\n- Left and right boots with ?.\n\nSo, the next step is to pair the left ? with right ?. Then, pair left ? with remaining right specific, and right ? with remaining left specific.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, suppose there are x left ? and y right ?. Then, the maximum pairs between them is min(x, y). Then, the remaining left ? can be paired with right specific (those that are not paired yet), and vice versa.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the best way is:\n\nAfter pairing specific colors, collect all the remaining left and right boots. Let's call them:\n\nleft_remain: list of left boots (each with color either ? or specific, but not paired yet)\n\nright_remain: list of right boots (same)\n\nThen, for the question marks:\n\nPair as many left ? with right ? as possible. Then, pair left ? with right specific (those that are not matched yet), and right ? with left specific.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nBut the problem is that when you pair a ? with a specific color, you need to make sure that the specific color is not already paired with another ?.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal approach is to pair as many ? with ? as possible, then pair the remaining ? with any available specific boots.\n\nBut how to track which boots are available?\n\nSo, here's a plan:\n\nFirst, create for each left and right boot, a list of indices, and track which are used.\n\nInitialize all as unused.\n\nProcess specific colors:\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left boots with color c that are not used.\n\n   collect all right boots with color c that are not used.\n\n   pair as many as possible between them. For example, for each left in left_c and right in right_c, pair them. Since the order doesn't matter, just take min(len(left_c), len(right_c)) pairs.\n\nOnce that's done, collect all the remaining left and right boots.\n\nThen, process the ?.\n\nFor the remaining boots, collect:\n\nleft_q: list of left boots with ? that are not used.\n\nright_q: list of right boots with ? that are not used.\n\nNow, pair as many left_q and right_q as possible. For example, take min(len(left_q), len(right_q)) pairs.\n\nThen, for the remaining left_q and right_q, pair them with the remaining specific boots.\n\nFor example, for each left_q, try to pair with any right that is not used and has a specific color (since the left_q can take any color). Similarly for right_q.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nBut perhaps after pairing the specific colors and the ?-? pairs, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired with the remaining specific boots.\n\nBut how to track which ones are available.\n\nAn alternative approach is:\n\nAfter the first step (specific colors), collect all left boots not used, and right boots not used.\n\nThen, for the left boots, collect:\n\nleft_available = list of (color, index) for left boots not used.\n\nSimilarly for right_available.\n\nThen, for each left in left_available, if color is ?, we can pair it with any right_available that is not used.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nThis seems like a bipartite graph problem, but with large n. So, we need an efficient way.\n\nBut perhaps, for the remaining steps, we can:\n\n- Pair left ? with right ? as much as possible.\n\nThen, for the remaining left ?, pair with any right (specific or ?) that are not used. Similarly for right ?.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for the remaining left and right boots, after the first step:\n\nWe can collect:\n\nleft_q: list of left boots with ?\n\nright_q: list of right boots with ?\n\nleft_s: list of left boots with specific colors (not used)\n\nright_s: list of right boots with specific colors (not used)\n\nThen:\n\nPair left_q and right_q as much as possible.\n\nThen, pair left_q with right_s (each left_q can pair with any right_s, since left_q is ? and right_s is specific).\n\nSimilarly, pair right_q with left_s.\n\nBut how to do this?\n\nLet me think. For example, after pairing the ?-? pairs, we can have some left_q and right_q left. Then, for each left_q, we can pair it with any right_s that hasn't been used. Similarly for right_q and left_s.\n\nBut how to choose which ones to pair to maximize the total?\n\nWell, the maximum possible would be:\n\nnumber of left_q + number of right_q - number of pairs already made between them.\n\nBut perhaps the optimal way is to pair as many as possible.\n\nSo, for the remaining left_q and right_s:\n\nWe can pair each left_q with a right_s. Since the left_q can take any color. Similarly for right_q and left_s.\n\nSo, for example, the number of pairs that can be formed is min( len(left_q) + len(left_s) , len(right_s) + len(right_q) ) ? No, perhaps not. Wait, the left_q can pair with right_s and right_q. Similarly, the right_q can pair with left_s and left_q.\n\nBut after pairing the ?-? pairs, the left_q and right_q are the remaining ones.\n\nSo, let's say after pairing the ?-? pairs, we have:\n\nleft_q_remaining = len(left_q) - num_pairs_qq\n\nright_q_remaining = len(right_q) - num_pairs_qq\n\nBut no, the num_pairs_qq is min(len(left_q), len(right_q)), so after that, one of them is zero, and the other is the difference.\n\nSo, for example, if there are more left_q than right_q, then after pairing, all right_q are used, and left_q_remaining = len(left_q) - len(right_q).\n\nThen, these left_q_remaining can be paired with any right_s (specific) that are not used. Similarly, any right_q_remaining can be paired with left_s.\n\nBut how to track which are available?\n\nBut perhaps, for the left_q_remaining and right_s, the maximum possible pairs is min( len(left_q_remaining), len(right_s) ), because each left_q can pair with any right_s.\n\nSimilarly, for the right_q_remaining and left_s, min( len(right_q_remaining), len(left_s) )\n\nBut then, the total would be:\n\npairs_qq + pairs_q_to_s + pairs_s_to_q.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nSo, the overall steps:\n\n1. Pair specific colors between left and right.\n\n   For each color c (a-z):\n\n      collect all left boots with color c not used.\n\n      collect all right boots with color c not used.\n\n      pair as many as possible between them (i.e., take the min of the counts and pair them).\n\n      record the pairs.\n\n2. Collect all remaining left and right boots.\n\n3. Pair left ? with right ?.\n\n   Take as many as possible (min(len(left_q), len(right_q))).\n\n4. Now, for the remaining left_q and right_q:\n\n   Pair left_q with right_s (specific) not used.\n\n   Take min( len(left_q_remaining), len(right_s) )\n\n   Then, pair right_q with left_s (specific) not used.\n\n   Take min( len(right_q_remaining), len(left_s) )\n\nBut how to track which left and right boots are used.\n\nBut how to implement this? Because we need to track for each left and right boot whether they are used or not.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to represent for each left and right boot, a boolean indicating if they are used.\n\nSo, let's think about data structures.\n\nWe can have:\n\n- For left boots, a list of booleans (used_left[i] = True if the i-th left boot is used).\n\n- Similarly for right boots (used_right[i] = True if used).\n\nThen, for each step, we can iterate through the left and right boots, check if they are not used, and collect them.\n\nBut for large n (150,000), this can be done with O(n) time per step.\n\nLet me outline the steps with code-like pseudocode.\n\nInitialize:\n\nn = input value.\n\nl = input string (left boots)\n\nr = input string (right boots)\n\nused_left = [False] * n\n\nused_right = [False] * n\n\npairs = []\n\nFirst, process specific colors:\n\nfor c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n    left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n    right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n    min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(min_len):\n\n        pairs.append( (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) )\n\n        used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n\n        used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut this would take O(26 * n) time, which is acceptable for n up to 1.5e5.\n\nWait, but for each character, collecting the left_list and right_list may take O(n) time. For 26 characters, that's O(26n) time. Which is acceptable.\n\nOnce that's done, collect the remaining left and right boots.\n\nNow, collect the left_q and right_q:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, pair as many as possible between left_q and right_q:\n\nmin_q = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(min_q):\n\n    pairs.append( (left_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) )\n\n    used_left[left_q[i]] = True\n\n    used_right[right_q[i]] = True\n\nNow, after that, the remaining left_q and right_q are:\n\nremaining_left_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nremaining_right_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nNow, collect the left_s (specific, not used) and right_s (specific, not used):\n\nleft_s = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nright_s = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nNow, pair the remaining left_q with right_s:\n\nTake min( len(remaining_left_q), len(right_s) )\n\nfor i in range( min( len(remaining_left_q), len(right_s) ) ):\n\n    pairs.append( (remaining_left_q[i]+1, right_s[i]+1) )\n\n    used_left[remaining_left_q[i]] = True\n\n    used_right[right_s[i]] = True\n\nSimilarly, pair the remaining right_q with left_s:\n\nremaining_right_q_after_prev = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?'] (but need to recheck after previous step?)\n\nWait, perhaps after pairing the left_q with right_s, the remaining_left_q is now empty (if we took all possible), or some left_q are left. Similarly, the right_s may be partially used.\n\nBut perhaps, after pairing the left_q with right_s, we can then pair the remaining right_q with left_s.\n\nBut how to collect them again?\n\nAlternatively, after the previous steps, collect the remaining left_q and right_q again, and then pair them with the remaining specific boots.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to collect all left_q (those not used) and all right_s (those not used), and pair as much as possible.\n\nBut in code, after the previous steps, the left_q and right_s are:\n\nleft_q_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_s_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, for each left_q in left_q_remaining, pair with a right_s in right_s_remaining. Take min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_s_remaining)).\n\nSimilarly for the right_q_remaining and left_s_remaining.\n\nBut how to do that.\n\nSo, code-wise:\n\n# Pair remaining left_q with right_s\n\nleft_q_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_s_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nmin_val = min( len(left_q_remaining), len(right_s_remaining) )\n\nfor i in range(min_val):\n\n    pairs.append( (left_q_remaining[i]+1, right_s_remaining[i]+1) )\n\n    used_left[left_q_remaining[i]] = True\n\n    used_right[right_s_remaining[i]] = True\n\n# Then, pair remaining right_q with left_s\n\nright_q_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nleft_s_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\nmin_val = min( len(right_q_remaining), len(left_s_remaining) )\n\nfor i in range(min_val):\n\n    pairs.append( (left_s_remaining[i]+1, right_q_remaining[i]+1) )\n\n    used_left[left_s_remaining[i]] = True\n\n    used_right[right_q_remaining[i]] = True\n\nBut this approach would work?\n\nYes. Because the left_q can pair with any right_s (specific), and right_q can pair with any left_s (specific).\n\nBut what about the order in which we pair them? For example, if we pair left_q with right_s first, then the remaining right_q can pair with left_s.\n\nBut this seems correct.\n\nSo, putting all together.\n\nBut the problem is that the code above, when building the lists like left_q_remaining, may take O(n) time for each step. However, since we have 4 such steps (after the first processing), each O(n) time, the total time is acceptable for n up to 1.5e5.\n\nBut for Python, even with 1.5e5 elements, this should be manageable.\n\nBut let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nFor example, the first sample input is:\n\nn=10\n\nl = codeforces\n\nr = dodivthree\n\nSample Output is 5 pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the code would correctly compute that.\n\nBut how to handle the pairing of specific colors first.\n\nBut the code seems to handle that.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible edge cases.\n\nEdge Case 1: All left and right boots are '?'. Then, the maximum pairs is n. All pairs are (i, i) or any permutation.\n\nEdge Case 2: Some left have specific colors and some right have specific colors, but no matches. Then, the pairs would be formed by using the ?s.\n\nAnother Edge Case: When some left and right have ? and specific colors. For example, left has a ?, and right has a 'a'. They can be paired.\n\nBut according to the code, during the third step, when pairing left_q with right_s, that would happen.\n\nAnother Edge Case: When there are more left_q than right_s. Then, after pairing, some left_q remain, but they can't be paired with anything else.\n\nBut the code would pair as much as possible.\n\nNow, the problem is that the code may not be optimal. For example, maybe pairing a left_q with a right_s first may leave some right_q that can't be paired with left_s, but if we had paired the right_q with the left_s first, we could have more pairs.\n\nBut since the problem allows any correct answer, the code's approach is acceptable as long as it's correct.\n\nBut is there a case where the code's approach gives less than the maximum possible pairs?\n\nLet me think of an example.\n\nSuppose:\n\nn=2\n\nleft: ['?', 'a']\n\nright: ['b', '?']\n\nIn this case:\n\nProcessing specific colors first: 'a' in left and 'b' in right. No matches.\n\nThen, left_q is [0], right_q is [1].\n\nPair them: 0 and 1. So one pair.\n\nNow, left_s is [1], right_s is [0]. But they can't be paired (a vs b). So total pairs is 1.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=2\n\nleft: ['?', 'a']\n\nright: ['a', '?']\n\nProcessing specific colors: for 'a', left has index 1, right has index 0. Pair them. So that's one pair.\n\nThen, left_q is [0], right_q is [1]. Pair them. Total pairs is 2. Correct.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=2\n\nleft: ['?', 'a']\n\nright: ['?', 'a']\n\nProcessing specific colors: for 'a', left has index 1, right has index 1. Pair them. Then, left_q is [0], right_q is [0]. Pair them. Total 2 pairs.\n\nAnother example:\n\nn=2\n\nleft: ['?', '?']\n\nright: ['a', 'b']\n\nProcessing specific colors: nothing.\n\nleft_q is [0,1], right_q is empty.\n\nThen, pair left_q with right_s (which are [0,1] in right). So, pair 0 with 0, 1 with 1. Total 2 pairs. Correct.\n\nAnother example where pairing left_q with right_s first may leave some right_q unpaired, but if we had paired right_q with left_s first, but there are no left_s.\n\nBut in that case, the code's approach is correct.\n\nSo, the code's approach seems to be correct.\n\nNow, the next step is to implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to handle the lists for each color.\n\nBut for the first step, processing each color from 'a' to 'z':\n\nIn Python, for each character in 'a' to 'z', we can loop through each possible character.\n\nBut for each color c in 'a' to 'z', collect the left and right indices that are not used and have color c.\n\nBut for large n, this could be O(26n) time.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, 26*1.5e5 is 3.9e6 operations, which is acceptable.\n\nBut in Python, for each color, we can generate the lists.\n\nBut generating these lists for each color may be time-consuming. Alternatively, we can pre-process for each color, the list of indices.\n\nBut perhaps it's better to process for each color, collect the indices on the fly.\n\nBut for the first step, let's proceed.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as lists of False.\n\npairs = list of tuples.\n\nThen, for each color in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n   collect right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n   min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n   for i in 0..min_len-1:\n\n       add pair (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1)\n\n       mark used_left and used_right as True.\n\nBut this approach is O(n) for each color. For 26 colors, O(26n) time.\n\nOnce that is done, collect the left_q and right_q.\n\nThen, pair as many as possible between left_q and right_q.\n\nThen, pair left_q with right_s, then right_q with left_s.\n\nBut how to collect the left_q and right_q.\n\nBut in code:\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\nThen, for the first pairing between left_q and right_q:\n\nmin_q = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in range(min_q):\n\n   pairs.append( ... )\n\n   mark used_left and used_right.\n\nThen, collect the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut perhaps, after that, we can collect the remaining left_q and right_q again, but perhaps it's easier to collect the left_q_remaining and right_s_remaining as follows:\n\nleft_q_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\nright_s_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\nThen, pair them as much as possible.\n\nSame for right_q_remaining and left_s_remaining.\n\nBut this is O(n) for each of these steps.\n\nNow, the problem is that the code may not be efficient enough for n=1.5e5. Because for each step, creating new lists with list comprehensions may take O(n) time. However, given that the total steps are O(1) per step, and the total time is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, each list comprehension is O(n), and with multiple steps, but for Python, it's manageable.\n\nNow, implement this in code.\n\nBut in Python, for each color, looping through all the characters may be slow. For example, for each color in 'a' to 'z', we have to loop through all n characters. But perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nWe can precompute for each color, the list of left and right indices. But for that, we can create two dictionaries: left_color_indices and right_color_indices. For example, for each color c, left_color_indices[c] is a list of indices where l[i] == c. Similarly for right. But then, during processing, we need to track which indices are used.\n\nBut even with that, for each color, we can process the left and right indices.\n\nBut perhaps this is not necessary, as the code as written will work.\n\nNow, code.\n\nBut in Python, for each color in 'a' to 'z':\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_list = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == c and not used_left[i]]\n\n    right_list = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == c and not used_right[i]]\n\n    min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(min_len):\n\n        pairs.append( (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) )\n\n        used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n\n        used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n\nBut this is O(26n) time. For n=1.5e5, 26*1.5e5 = 3.9e6 steps. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut for each color, we can optimize by precomputing the lists once. However, in practice, for Python, it's manageable.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\nBut the actual input is given as four separate test cases? Wait, the user provided the example input as a list of four entries. But in reality, the input is given as per the problem statement.\n\nWait, the original problem says that the input is three lines: first line is n, second line is l, third line is r.\n\nBut the example shows multiple test cases. For example, the first sample input is:\n\nInput:\n\n10\n\ncodeforces\n\ndodivthree\n\nOutput: 5 pairs.\n\nBut the user's example seems to have four different inputs and outputs. But perhaps that's the sample input and output for multiple test cases. But the code needs to process one test case per run.\n\nBut the user's note says that the code should read from stdin and output to stdout. So, the code must read n, then l, then r, and output the pairs.\n\nSo, the code must read from standard input.\n\nNow, the code for the problem.\n\nBut in Python, for reading input, perhaps:\n\nimport sys\n\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\nl = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nr = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is read properly. Also, sometimes, after reading n, there may be a newline, etc. So, perhaps read the lines properly.\n\nOnce the code reads n, l, r, then proceed.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement the steps as discussed.\n\nBut in code:\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as lists of False.\n\nThen process each color.\n\nThen process the ? pairs.\n\nThen process the remaining.\n\nBut in code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n\n    l = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    r = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\n    used_left = [False]*n\n\n    used_right = [False]*n\n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Process specific colors first\n\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n        left_list = []\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            if not used_left[i] and l[i] == c:\n\n                left_list.append(i)\n\n        right_list = []\n\n        for i in range(n):\n\n            if not used_right[i] and r[i] == c:\n\n                right_list.append(i)\n\n        min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n        for i in range(min_len):\n\n            pairs.append( (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) )\n\n            used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n\n            used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n\n    # Now process ? ? pairs\n\n    left_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\n    right_q = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\n    min_q = min(len(left_q), len(right_q))\n\n    for i in range(min_q):\n\n        pairs.append( (left_q[i]+1, right_q[i]+1) )\n\n        used_left[left_q[i]] = True\n\n        used_right[right_q[i]] = True\n\n    # Now process left_q with right_s\n\n    left_q_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == '?']\n\n    right_s_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] != '?']\n\n    min_val = min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_s_remaining))\n\n    for i in range(min_val):\n\n        pairs.append( (left_q_remaining[i]+1, right_s_remaining[i]+1) )\n\n        used_left[left_q_remaining[i]] = True\n\n        used_right[right_s_remaining[i]] = True\n\n    # Now process right_q with left_s\n\n    right_q_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == '?']\n\n    left_s_remaining = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] != '?']\n\n    min_val = min(len(right_q_remaining), len(left_s_remaining))\n\n    for i in range(min_val):\n\n        pairs.append( (left_s_remaining[i]+1, right_q_remaining[i]+1) )\n\n        used_left[left_s_remaining[i]] = True\n\n        used_right[right_q_remaining[i]] = True\n\n    print(len(pairs))\n\n    for a, b in pairs:\n\n        print(a, b)\n\nBut wait, this code may not be efficient enough for large n. Because for each color, it's looping through all n elements. For example, in the first part, for each color in 'a' to 'z', we have two loops of O(n) time. For 26 letters, that's O(26n) time. Which for n=1.5e5 is 3.9e6 steps. Which is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way. For example, precompute for each color, the list of indices once, and then process them.\n\nBut for the code as written, perhaps it's acceptable.\n\nTesting with the sample input:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nn=10\n\nl = codeforces\n\nr = dodivthree\n\nBut let's see:\n\nThe code would first process each color. For example, 'c' in l and r?\n\nBut let's not go into details. The code would generate the pairs, and the output would be 5 pairs as expected.\n\nBut what about the order of processing the colors? For example, if a color is processed first, and the code pairs all possible, but perhaps there's a better way. But since the code is greedy, it's possible that it's not optimal. However, the problem requires maximum pairs, and the approach is correct.\n\nBut is there a case where the code fails to find the maximum?\n\nLet me think of a scenario where pairing specific colors in a different order would allow more pairs.\n\nFor example, suppose:\n\nn=2\n\nl = ['a', 'b']\n\nr = ['b', 'a']\n\nProcessing 'a' first:\n\nleft_list for 'a' is [0], right_list for 'a' is [1]. Pair (0+1, 1+1) â†’ (1, 2). Then, for 'b', left_list is [1], right_list is [0]. Pair (2, 1). Total pairs 2.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother scenario:\n\nn=2\n\nl = ['a', '?']\n\nr = ['?', 'a']\n\nProcessing 'a' first:\n\nleft_list for 'a' is [0], right_list for 'a' is [1]. Pair (1, 2). Then, the ? in left and right are [1], [0]. Pair them. So total 2 pairs. Correct.\n\nAnother scenario where the code may not find the maximum.\n\nBut I can't think of any scenario where the code's approach would not find the maximum possible pairs.\n\nSo, the code is correct.\n\nBut in Python, for large n, the code may be too slow. For example, for each color, looping through all n elements. For 26 colors, that's 26 * 2 * n steps.\n\nBut for n=1.5e5, 26*2*1.5e5 is 7.8e6 steps. Which is acceptable for Python.\n\nBut perhaps we can optimize the first part. For example, precompute for each color, the list of indices once.\n\nBut for the code as written, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nBut in practice, for Python, list comprehensions are faster than for loops. So, perhaps for each color, we can generate the left_list and right_list with list comprehensions.\n\nBut in the current code, for each color, the code loops through all n elements. So, for each color c, left_list is generated as [i for i in range(n) if ... ].\n\nBut in code, perhaps the following:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_list = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == c]\n\n    right_list = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == c]\n\n    min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(min_len):\n\n        pairs.append(...)\n\nBut this would be the same as before. However, for each color, the list comprehensions are O(n) time.\n\nBut perhaps this is better than the previous code, which uses for loops inside the color processing.\n\nSo, the code can be modified to use list comprehensions.\n\nBut the code as written earlier uses for loops for generating left_list and right_list. Which may be slower than list comprehensions.\n\nSo, perhaps changing that part to:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n\n    left_list = [i for i in range(n) if not used_left[i] and l[i] == c]\n\n    right_list = [i for i in range(n) if not used_right[i] and r[i] == c]\n\n    min_len = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n\n    for i in range(min_len):\n\n        pairs.append( (left_list[i]+1, right_list[i]+1) )\n\n        used_left[left_list[i]] = True\n\n        used_right[right_list[i]] = True\n\nThis would be more efficient.\n\nBut the code may have a problem when the same color is processed multiple times. However, since the code processes each color once, and marks the used boots, this is correct.\n\nNow, the code may be optimized.\n\nAnother optimization: for the first part, for each color, we can collect all left and right indices once.\n\nBut regardless, the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nBut since the sample input has multiple test cases,",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs between left and right boots.

For each color from 'a' to 'z', we collect all unused left and right boots with that color and pair them up.\n2. **Indefinite Color Pairing**: After handling specific colors, we handle the remaining boots with indefinite colors ('?').
