Each boot has a color which is denoted as a lowercase Latin letter or a question mark ('?'). Thus, you are given two strings $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$, both of length $$$n$$$. The character $$$l_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot and the character $$$r_i$$$ stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.A lowercase Latin letter denotes a specific color, but the question mark ('?') denotes an indefinite color. Two specific colors are compatible if they are exactly the same. An indefinite color is compatible with any (specific or indefinite) color.For example, the following pairs of colors are compatible: ('f', 'f'), ('?', 'z'), ('a', '?') and ('?', '?'). The following pairs of colors are not compatible: ('f', 'g') and ('a', 'z').Compute the maximum number of pairs of boots such that there is one left and one right boot in a pair and their colors are compatible.Print the maximum number of such pairs and the pairs themselves. A boot can be part of at most one pair.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 150000$$$), denoting the number of boots for each leg (i.e. the number of left boots and the number of right boots).The second line contains the string $$$l$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th left boot.The third line contains the string $$$r$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It contains only lowercase Latin letters or question marks. The $$$i$$$-th character stands for the color of the $$$i$$$-th right boot.\n\n## Output\nPrint $$$k$$$ â€” the maximum number of compatible left-right pairs of boots, i.e. pairs consisting of one left and one right boot which have compatible colors.The following $$$k$$$ lines should contain pairs $$$a_j, b_j$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_j, b_j \\le n$$$). The $$$j$$$-th of these lines should contain the index $$$a_j$$$ of the left boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair and index $$$b_j$$$ of the right boot in the $$$j$$$-th pair. All the numbers $$$a_j$$$ should be distinct (unique), all the numbers $$$b_j$$$ should be distinct (unique).If there are many optimal answers, print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10\\ncodeforces\\ndodivthree', '7\\nabaca?b\\nzabbbcc', '9\\nbambarbia\\nhellocode', '10\\ncode??????\\n??????test']\n\n### Output\n['5\\n7 8\\n4 9\\n2 2\\n9 10\\n3 1', '5\\n6 5\\n2 3\\n4 6\\n7 4\\n1 2', '0', '10\\n6 2\\n1 6\\n7 3\\n3 5\\n4 8\\n9 7\\n5 1\\n2 4\\n10 9\\n8 10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Colored Boots problem. Let's read the problem carefully again.\n\nSo, there are n left boots and n right boots. Each has a color which can be a lowercase letter or '?'. The goal is to find the maximum number of pairs where each pair is a left and a right boot with compatible colors. And then output those pairs.\n\nCompatibility rules: two specific colors must be the same. A '?' can match any color, including another '?'. So for example, a '?' on the left can pair with any right boot (specific or ?), and vice versa.\n\nThe challenge is to maximize the number of such pairs. Also, each boot can be in at most one pair.\n\nHmm. How to approach this?\n\nFirst, think about how to model the pairings. Since each pair uses one left and one right boot, it's a bipartite matching problem. But given the constraints on n (up to 150,000), we need an efficient algorithm.\n\nBut considering that the problem allows for some greedy strategies, maybe we can find a way to pair them without needing a full bipartite matching algorithm (which would be O(n^3) or worse for large n).\n\nLet me think about the possible steps:\n\n1. First, pair up the left and right boots that have specific colors and match. For example, if a left boot is 'a' and a right boot is 'a', they can be paired. But how to do this optimally?\n\nBut maybe we can process the specific colors first. For example, for each color c (excluding '?'), count the number of left boots with color c and the number of right boots with color c. The maximum possible pairs for color c is the minimum of these two counts. Then, after pairing these, the remaining boots (those with '?') can be matched in some way.\n\nBut wait, the '?' can be used as wildcards. However, the problem is that the '?' can also be used to match other '?', but perhaps we should prioritize using them to match specific colors first, to maximize the total pairs.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n- First, for each color c (not '?'), count the number of left boots (l_count[c]) and right boots (r_count[c]). For each color c, the number of pairs is min(l_count[c], r_count[c]). These pairs are made between left and right boots of color c. Then, subtract these from the counts of l and r for that color.\n\n- Then, we have remaining left and right boots with '?'. Also, there might be some leftover specific colors that couldn't be fully matched. For example, if there are more left boots of color 'a' than right boots of 'a', then the excess left 'a's can be paired with right '?', or vice versa.\n\nWait, but after the first step, for the specific colors, we have already used all possible matches between same-colored specific boots. Now, the remaining boots are:\n\n- Left boots with color c (specific) that couldn't find a matching right boot of same color. Similarly for right boots.\n\n- Left and right boots with '?'.\n\nSo the next step is to pair the remaining left and right boots. How?\n\nFor the remaining left and right boots, we can think of the '?' as being able to match anything. So, the idea is to pair as many as possible between the remaining specific colors and the '?'s, and then pair the remaining '?'s between themselves.\n\nBut how to do that optimally?\n\nLet me think. Suppose after the first step, there are some left boots with specific colors and some right boots with specific colors. Let's say, for example, that there are x left boots of color 'a' and y right boots of color 'b' (but no 'a' on the right). Then, these can't be paired. However, if there are some '?' on the right, then the left 'a's can be paired with those '?'s. Similarly, the right 'b's can be paired with left '?'s.\n\nSo perhaps, after handling the same-color pairs, we can process the remaining specific colors by trying to pair them with '?'s on the opposite side.\n\nBut how to manage this? Let's think:\n\nLet's collect:\n\nLeft_specific: list of left boots with non '?' colors (after the initial pairing)\nRight_specific: list of right boots with non '?' colors (after initial pairing)\nLeft_question: list of left boots with '?'\nRight_question: list of right boots with '?'\n\nWait, but after the initial pairing, the left and right boots with specific colors may have some leftovers. For example, suppose there were 5 left 'a's and 3 right 'a's. Then, after initial pairing, there are 2 left 'a's left. These can be paired with right '?'s, or left '?'s can be paired with right 'a's, etc.\n\nSo the idea is:\n\nAfter initial pairing, for each specific color, we have left and right counts. But since we've already taken the min for each color, the remaining are:\n\nFor each color c (non '?'), left_remaining[c] = original l_count[c] - matched_pairs, and similarly for right_remaining[c].\n\nBut perhaps, we can process these remaining left and right specific boots by pairing them with the opposite side's '?'.\n\nBut how to do this optimally?\n\nFor example, for left_remaining[c], each can be paired with a right '?'.\n\nSimilarly, right_remaining[c] can be paired with left '?'.\n\nSo, the number of possible pairs here is min(left_remaining[c], right_question_count) for each color c? Or perhaps, we can pair as much as possible.\n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following steps:\n\n1. For each color c (not '?'), compute the number of left and right boots. Pair them as much as possible. Subtract the matched ones from the counts.\n\n2. Now, collect all left boots with specific colors (non '?') that are not yet paired. Similarly for right.\n\n3. Then, pair these left specific boots with right '?'s. For example, for each left boot with color c, we can pair it with a right '?'. Similarly, pair right specific boots with left '?'s.\n\nBut how to do this in code?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum possible pairs is the sum of:\n\n- All the same-color pairs (from step 1)\n\nPlus:\n\n- The number of left specific boots that can be paired with right '?'\n\nPlus:\n\n- The number of right specific boots that can be paired with left '?'\n\nPlus:\n\n- The number of remaining '?' pairs (the min of left '?' and right '?' counts, but after pairing with the specific ones?)\n\nWait, but the pairing between left specific and right '?' and between right specific and left '?' may not be independent. For example, suppose there are 5 left '?' and 5 right '?'. Also, there are 3 left 'a's and 4 right 'b's. Then, the left 'a's can be paired with right '?', and the right 'b's can be paired with left '?'. But if we pair all left 'a's with right '?', then the left '?'s may have less to pair with the right '?'s.\n\nBut perhaps, the optimal way is to pair as much as possible between left specific and right '?', and between right specific and left '?', and then pair the remaining '?'s.\n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the following variables:\n\nAfter step 1:\n\nleft_spc = list of left boots with non '?' colors that are not yet paired.\n\nright_spc = list of right boots with non '?' colors that are not yet paired.\n\nleft_q = list of left boots with '?'\n\nright_q = list of right boots with '?'\n\nNow, the number of left_spc is L_spc, right_spc is R_spc.\n\nWe can pair each left_spc with a right_q. Let's take as many as possible. For example, the number of such pairs is min(L_spc, len(right_q)). Similarly, for right_spc and left_q: min(R_spc, len(left_q)).\n\nBut once we pair some of them, the remaining left_q and right_q will be adjusted.\n\nBut perhaps, the order in which we pair them matters. For example, if we pair left_spc with right_q first, then the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired. Alternatively, if we pair right_spc with left_q first, then the remaining can be paired.\n\nWhich order gives a better result? Well, perhaps both approaches are equivalent, but for the purpose of code, we can choose one.\n\nBut let's think. Suppose there are 3 left_spc, 2 right_q, and 2 right_spc, 3 left_q.\n\nIf we pair left_spc with right_q: 2 pairs. Then, the remaining left_spc is 1. Then pair right_spc with left_q: 2 pairs. Then, the remaining left_q is 1, and right_q is 0. Then, the remaining left_q and right_q can't be paired. Total pairs: 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nAlternatively, if we pair right_spc with left_q first: 2 pairs. Then, pair left_spc with right_q: 2 pairs. Then, remaining left_q is 1, right_q is 0. Same total.\n\nSo the order doesn't matter in this case. So perhaps, regardless of the order, the maximum possible is min(L_spc + R_spc, len(left_q) + len(right_q)) ?\n\nWait, not sure. Let's see: the total number of possible pairs is the sum of:\n\nnumber of left_spc paired with right_q (say x) + number of right_spc paired with left_q (say y) + number of pairs between remaining left_q and right_q (say z).\n\nBut x + y + z can be up to min(L_spc + R_spc + (len(left_q) + len(right_q)) - ... )\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum possible is the sum of:\n\nx = min(L_spc, len(right_q))\n\ny = min(R_spc, len(left_q) - x?)\n\nNo, because after pairing x, the left_q may have been reduced.\n\nWait, this seems complicated. Maybe the optimal way is to pair as much as possible between left_spc and right_q, and between right_spc and left_q, and then pair the remaining '?'s.\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nAlternative approach: the total number of pairs possible is the sum of:\n\nsame_color_pairs + \n\nmin( (number of left_spc), (number of right_q) ) + \n\nmin( (number of right_spc), (number of left_q) ) + \n\nmin( (number of left_q - (number of right_spc paired with left_q)), (number of right_q - (number of left_spc paired with right_q)) ) )\n\nBut perhaps not. Because when pairing left_spc with right_q, the number of right_q used is x = min(L_spc, len(right_q)), and then the remaining right_q is len(right_q) - x. Similarly, when pairing right_spc with left_q, the number of left_q used is y = min(R_spc, len(left_q)), and the remaining left_q is len(left_q) - y. Then, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as min( (len(left_q) - y), (len(right_q) - x) ), but that's only if they are both positive.\n\nBut this seems a bit messy. However, perhaps the optimal way is to pair left_spc with right_q first, then right_spc with left_q, then the remaining '?'s.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, think of the total number of available '?'s on both sides. Let's say:\n\ntotal_available_q = len(left_q) + len(right_q)\n\nBut after pairing the left_spc and right_spc with the q's, the remaining q's can be paired as min(len(left_q) - used_left_q, len(right_q) - used_right_q). But perhaps this is getting too complex.\n\nAnother approach: after the initial same-color pairing, the remaining left and right boots are:\n\nleft_non_q: list of left boots with non '?' colors that are not yet paired.\n\nright_non_q: list of right boots with non '?' colors that are not yet paired.\n\nleft_q: list of left boots with '?'\n\nright_q: list of right boots with '?'\n\nNow, the maximum number of pairs we can form is:\n\npairs = same_color_pairs + \n\nnumber of pairs between left_non_q and right_q (each left non_q can be paired with a right_q) +\n\nnumber of pairs between right_non_q and left_q (each right non_q can be paired with a left_q) +\n\nnumber of pairs between remaining left_q and right_q (each can be paired).\n\nBut how to compute that.\n\nBut the problem is that the pairing between left_non_q and right_q may use up some of the right_q, which could have been used to pair with right_non_q.\n\nSo, perhaps the optimal way is to pair as much as possible between left_non_q and right_q, and between right_non_q and left_q, and then the remaining q's can be paired.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nLet me think of the steps again:\n\nOnce the same-color pairs are done, for the remaining left_non_q and right_non_q, we can proceed as follows:\n\nWe can pair each left_non_q with a right_q, and each right_non_q with a left_q.\n\nBut how to do this in code.\n\nLet me think of the following:\n\nWe can iterate through the left_non_q and pair them with right_q as long as there are right_q left. Then, iterate through the right_non_q and pair them with left_q as long as there are left_q left. Then, pair the remaining left_q and right_q.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used.\n\nBut for the purpose of the code, perhaps we can collect the indices of the left_non_q and right_non_q, and then try to pair them.\n\nBut for the problem, we need to output the actual pairs, not just the count. So, we need to track which left and right boots are paired.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me outline the steps in code:\n\nFirst, process same-color pairs:\n\nWe can create a frequency dictionary for left and right, excluding '?'.\n\nFor each color c in 'a' to 'z', the number of pairs is min(l_count[c], r_count[c]).\n\nBut how to track which left and right boots are paired.\n\nWait, but for the same-color pairs, we can greedily pair them. For example, for each color c, take the first l_count[c] left boots with color c and pair them with the first r_count[c] right boots with color c.\n\nBut how to track which ones are used.\n\nBut perhaps, for the initial step, we can collect for each color c, the list of left and right boots with that color, then pair them up.\n\nBut for large n, we need an efficient way.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps:\n\nWe can create for each color c, a list of left indices (positions) where the color is c (excluding '?'), and same for right.\n\nThen, for each color c, the number of pairs is min(len(left_list[c]), len(right_list[c])).\n\nWe can then pair the first min(...) elements of left_list[c] with the first min(...) elements of right_list[c].\n\nOnce that is done, we can remove those elements from the left and right lists (or mark them as used), so that they are not considered in the later steps.\n\nBut for the code, perhaps we can use pointers or track which boots are already paired.\n\nBut for the problem, we need to track which boots are used. So, perhaps we can have a boolean array for left and right boots, indicating whether they are already paired.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, here's the plan:\n\nInitialize two arrays: used_left and used_right, both of size n, initialized to False.\n\nThen, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\n   collect all left indices where l[i] == c and not used_left[i]\n\n   collect all right indices where r[i] == c and not used_right[i]\n\n   the number of pairs for this color is min(len(left_c), len(right_c)).\n\n   for i in 0 to min(len(left_c), len(right_c)) - 1:\n\n       pair left_c[i] with right_c[i]\n\n       mark used_left[left_c[i]] = True\n\n       mark used_right[right_c[i]] = True\n\nThis way, after this step, all same-color pairs are made, and the used arrays track which boots are already paired.\n\nThen, proceed to the next steps.\n\nNow, for the remaining boots, we have:\n\nleft_non_q: list of left indices where l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]\n\nright_non_q: list of right indices where r[i] != '?' and not used_right[i]\n\nleft_q: list of left indices where l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]\n\nright_q: list of right indices where r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]\n\nNow, the next step is to pair left_non_q with right_q, then right_non_q with left_q, then the remaining q's with each other.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nFor example, for left_non_q and right_q:\n\nFor each left index in left_non_q, we can pair it with a right_q index. But since the right_q can be any, we can pair them in any order.\n\nSimilarly for right_non_q and left_q.\n\nOnce these are done, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining)).\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, let's collect the lists:\n\nleft_non_q = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] != '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_non_q = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] != '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nleft_q = [i for i in range(n) if l[i] == '?' and not used_left[i]]\n\nright_q = [i for i in range(n) if r[i] == '?' and not used_right[i]]\n\nThen, for pairing left_non_q with right_q:\n\nTake as many as possible. For each left in left_non_q, pair with a right in right_q.\n\nBut since we can pair them in any order, we can iterate through left_non_q and right_q, pairing until one of them is exhausted.\n\nSimilarly for pairing right_non_q with left_q.\n\nOnce that's done, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired between themselves.\n\nBut how to do this in code.\n\nLet's think about the code steps.\n\nAfter the same-color pairs are processed, we can proceed as follows:\n\nWe can have:\n\nfor the left_non_q and right_q:\n\nwe can iterate through each left in left_non_q and try to pair with a right in right_q.\n\nBut since we can pair them in any order, we can take the first k elements of left_non_q and pair them with the first k elements of right_q, where k is the minimum of the lengths of left_non_q and right_q.\n\nSimilarly for the right_non_q and left_q.\n\nSo, for example:\n\nk1 = min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))\n\nfor i in 0 to k1-1:\n\n   pair left_non_q[i] with right_q[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nThen, for the remaining right_non_q and left_q:\n\nk2 = min(len(right_non_q), len(left_q))\n\nfor i in 0 to k2-1:\n\n   pair right_non_q[i] with left_q[i]\n\nmark them as used.\n\nThen, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as min(len(left_q_remaining), len(right_q_remaining)).\n\nBut how to track the remaining after the first two steps.\n\nWait, after the first step (pairing left_non_q with right_q), the right_q list would have len(right_q) - k1 elements left. Similarly, the left_non_q list would be empty (since we took all of them, or part of them if right_q was smaller).\n\nBut for code, perhaps we can process the left_non_q and right_q as follows:\n\nTake the first k elements of left_non_q and pair them with the first k elements of right_q.\n\nBut in code, how to do that?\n\nLet me think. For example:\n\nleft_non_q is a list of indices. right_q is a list of indices.\n\nWe can pair them as follows:\n\nfor i in range(min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))):\n\n   pair left_non_q[i] with right_q[i]\n\n   mark them as used.\n\nThen, the same for right_non_q and left_q.\n\nBut after that, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired as:\n\nremaining_left_q = left_q after previous steps.\n\nremaining_right_q = right_q after previous steps.\n\nBut how to track that.\n\nBut perhaps, after pairing left_non_q and right_q, the remaining right_q is right_q[k1:].\n\nSimilarly, after that, the remaining left_q is left_q (if we didn't use any of them yet).\n\nWait, no. The left_q is the list of left boots with '?', not yet used. The left_non_q is the list of left boots with specific colors, not yet used.\n\nSo, during the first step, we pair left_non_q (specific) with right_q (wildcard). So, after that, the left_non_q list is empty (if all of them were paired), or some of them are left (if right_q was shorter).\n\nBut the left_non_q list is processed in the first step, and the right_q is processed as well.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nAfter the same-color pairs are processed, collect the four lists: left_non_q, right_non_q, left_q, right_q.\n\nThen:\n\n# Pair left_non_q with right_q\nk1 = min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(k1):\n    a = left_non_q[i]\n    b = right_q[i]\n    # pair a and b\n    used_left[a] = True\n    used_right[b] = True\n    add to the answer list.\n\n# Now, pair right_non_q with left_q\nk2 = min(len(right_non_q), len(left_q))\nfor i in range(k2):\n    a = right_non_q[i]\n    b = left_q[i]\n    # pair a and b (but note that a is a right boot, and b is a left boot)\n    # Wait, no. Wait, right_non_q is a list of right boots with specific colors. So, for each of them, we can pair with a left_q (which is a left boot with '?'). So the pair is (left_q[i], right_non_q[i]).\n    # So, the pair is (b, a), where b is left_q[i], a is right_non_q[i].\n    # So:\n    used_left[left_q[i]] = True\n    used_right[right_non_q[i]] = True\n    add to answer list (left_q[i], right_non_q[i])\n\n# Now, pair remaining left_q and right_q\nremaining_left_q = [x for x in left_q if not used_left[x]]\nremaining_right_q = [x for x in right_q if not used_right[x]]\n# Wait, but after the previous steps, the left_q and right_q may have some elements that are already used. But no, because in the previous steps, we paired the left_non_q with right_q (so right_q's first k1 elements are marked as used), and right_non_q with left_q (so left_q's first k2 elements are marked as used). But how to track that?\n\nWait, no. The left_q is the list of left boots with '?' that are not used. So during the first step, when we pair left_non_q with right_q, the right_q elements are marked as used. So the remaining right_q elements are those not in the first k1 elements. Similarly, during the second step, when we pair right_non_q with left_q, the left_q elements are marked as used. So the remaining left_q elements are those not in the first k2 elements.\n\nBut in code, the left_q and right_q are lists of indices that are not yet used. So during the first step, we take the first k1 elements of left_non_q and pair them with first k1 elements of right_q. Those right_q elements are now used, so they are not available for further pairing. Similarly, during the second step, the first k2 elements of left_q are paired with the first k2 elements of right_non_q, and those left_q elements are now used.\n\nSo after that, the remaining left_q is the elements from k2 onwards (if any), and the remaining right_q is the elements from k1 onwards (if any).\n\nThus, the remaining left_q and right_q can be paired. The maximum number of pairs is min( len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q) )\n\nSo, for code:\n\n# After the first two steps, the remaining left_q and right_q are:\n\nremaining_left_q = left_q[k2:]\nremaining_right_q = right_q[k1:]\n\nThen, for each i in 0 to min(len(remaining_left_q), len(remaining_right_q)) - 1:\n\n   pair remaining_left_q[i] with remaining_right_q[i]\n\n   mark them as used.\n\nBut how to track this in code. Well, during the first two steps, the left_q and right_q lists are not modified. So, perhaps, after the first two steps, we can collect the remaining left_q and right_q, and then pair them.\n\nBut how to do that. Let me think.\n\nIn code:\n\nAfter the first two steps, the left_q and right_q lists are as they were, but some elements are already marked as used. However, when we created left_q and right_q, they were all not used. So during the first two steps, when we pair elements, we mark them as used. Thus, the remaining_left_q and remaining_right_q can be obtained by taking the elements of left_q and right_q that are not yet used.\n\nBut since the left_q and right_q lists are static (they are the original lists of indices not used before these steps), but during the steps, some of their elements are marked as used, we can loop through them again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the first two steps, we can track which elements are used. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the first two steps, we can process the left_non_q and right_q as follows:\n\nfor i in range(k1):\n\n   pair left_non_q[i] with right_q[i]\n\n   mark used_left[left_non_q[i]] = True\n\n   mark used_right[right_q[i]] = True\n\nSimilarly for the second step.\n\nThen, after that, the remaining left_q and right_q are those not yet used.\n\nBut to pair them, we can iterate over the left_q and right_q lists again, and pair as many as possible.\n\nBut how to do that. For example, take the first m elements of left_q and first m elements of right_q, where m is min(len(left_q), len(right_q)).\n\nBut since the left_q and right_q lists are already not used, we can pair them.\n\nWait, no. Because during the first two steps, some elements of left_q and right_q may have been used. For example, during the second step, when we pair right_non_q with left_q, we take the first k2 elements of left_q and mark them as used.\n\nSo, after the first two steps, the remaining elements in left_q are those from index k2 onwards. Similarly for right_q.\n\nBut how to track that. Well, perhaps during the first two steps, we can process the left_q and right_q in a way that allows us to track the remaining.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Perhaps, during the first two steps, we can process the left_q and right_q lists as follows:\n\nAfter pairing left_non_q with right_q (k1 pairs), the remaining right_q elements are those from index k1 onwards.\n\nSimilarly, during the second step, pairing right_non_q with left_q (k2 pairs), the remaining left_q elements are those from index k2 onwards.\n\nThus, for the third step, we can take the remaining left_q (left_q[k2:]) and remaining right_q (right_q[k1:]) and pair them as min(len(left_q[k2:]), len(right_q[k1:])) pairs.\n\nSo, in code:\n\n# Pair remaining left_q and right_q\nk3 = min(len(left_q) - k2, len(right_q) - k1)\nfor i in range(k3):\n    a = left_q[k2 + i]\n    b = right_q[k1 + i]\n    used_left[a] = True\n    used_right[b] = True\n    add to answer list.\n\nBut wait, in the first step, we paired k1 elements from right_q. So the remaining right_q is len(right_q) - k1 elements. Similarly, in the second step, we paired k2 elements from left_q, so remaining left_q is len(left_q) - k2 elements.\n\nBut how to compute k3? It's min( len(left_q) - k2, len(right_q) - k1 )\n\nBut this assumes that the left_q and right_q lists are not modified during the first two steps. Which they are not. Because during the first two steps, we only marked some elements as used, but the lists themselves are not modified.\n\nSo, for example, left_q is a list of indices of left boots with '?', not used before. After the first two steps, some of them are marked as used, but the list remains as is.\n\nThus, the third step would require to iterate over the left_q and right_q lists, but skipping those that are already used. However, this would be time-consuming if done naively.\n\nBut in our approach, during the first two steps, we have processed the left_non_q and right_non_q, and during the first two steps, we have used parts of the left_q and right_q. However, the code as outlined above would pair the first k1 elements of right_q with left_non_q, and the first k2 elements of left_q with right_non_q. Then, the remaining left_q and right_q are the ones not processed yet.\n\nBut this is only true if during the first two steps, we have used exactly the first k1 elements of right_q and the first k2 elements of left_q. Which is the case if we process them in order.\n\nThus, the code can proceed as follows:\n\nCollect left_non_q, right_non_q, left_q, right_q.\n\nThen:\n\nk1 = min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))\nfor i in range(k1):\n    a = left_non_q[i]\n    b = right_q[i]\n    add pair (a, b)\n    mark used_left[a] = True\n    mark used_right[b] = True\n\nk2 = min(len(right_non_q), len(left_q))\nfor i in range(k2):\n    a = left_q[i]\n    b = right_non_q[i]\n    add pair (a, b)\n    mark used_left[a] = True\n    mark used_right[b] = True\n\nThen, the remaining left_q is left_q[k2:], and remaining right_q is right_q[k1:].\n\nk3 = min( len(left_q) - k2, len(right_q) - k1 )\nfor i in range(k3):\n    a = left_q[k2 + i]\n    b = right_q[k1 + i]\n    add pair (a, b)\n    mark used_left[a] = True\n    mark used_right[b] = True\n\nBut this would work only if the left_q and right_q lists are ordered in a way that allows this. For example, if during the first two steps, the first k1 elements of right_q are used, and the first k2 elements of left_q are used.\n\nBut this is correct because the left_q and right_q lists are lists of indices that are not used before these steps. So, during the first two steps, we can process the first elements of these lists, and then the remaining are the rest.\n\nThus, this approach would work.\n\nSo, putting all together, the steps are:\n\n1. Process same-color pairs between left and right boots.\n\n2. Collect the left_non_q, right_non_q, left_q, right_q.\n\n3. Pair left_non_q with right_q as much as possible.\n\n4. Pair right_non_q with left_q as much as possible.\n\n5. Pair the remaining left_q and right_q as much as possible.\n\nNow, the code needs to generate the pairs and track which boots are used.\n\nBut how to collect the left_non_q, right_non_q, left_q, right_q.\n\nFor that, perhaps during the initial processing, we can collect all the indices for each color and then process them.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps it's better to pre-process the lists.\n\nBut for n up to 150,000, even O(n) steps are acceptable.\n\nLet me think about the code structure.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead l and r.\n\nInitialize used_left and used_right as [False] * n.\n\nThen, for same-color pairs:\n\nCreate a dictionary for left colors and right colors.\n\nBut perhaps for each color, collect the indices.\n\nBut for efficiency, perhaps:\n\nFor each color in 'a' to 'z', collect the list of left indices and right indices.\n\nBut for code, perhaps:\n\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\nleft_color_map = defaultdict(list)\nright_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n\nfor i in range(n):\n    if l[i] != '?':\n        left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n    if r[i] != '?':\n        right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\nThen, for each color c in left_color_map and right_color_map:\n\nBut perhaps, for each color c in 'a' to 'z':\n\nBut to avoid checking all 26 letters, perhaps we can iterate through all possible colors present in left_color_map and right_color_map.\n\nAlternatively, for each color in left_color_map:\n\nBut perhaps, for each color in the union of left and right colors.\n\nBut perhaps, the code can process each color from 'a' to 'z'.\n\nBut for code:\n\nfor c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n    left_list = left_color_map.get(c, [])\n    right_list = right_color_map.get(c, [])\n    num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n    for i in range(num_pairs):\n        left_idx = left_list[i]\n        right_idx = right_list[i]\n        used_left[left_idx] = True\n        used_right[right_idx] = True\n        add to answer list.\n\nBut this would miss the cases where the same color exists in both left and right. Wait, no, because for each color, we take the min of the left and right lists and pair them.\n\nBut this is not correct. Because, for example, if a color 'a' is present in both left and right, and we process it once, but the left and right lists may have multiple entries.\n\nBut this code would process each color once, and pair as many as possible.\n\nBut how to collect the left_color_map and right_color_map. Because, during the initial processing, the left_color_map and right_color_map are built with all the indices where the color is not '?'. But during the same-color pairing, we process them and mark them as used.\n\nBut in the code above, the left_color_map and right_color_map are built before any processing. So, the code would pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) entries of each color, but those entries may have already been used in previous steps. Wait, no. Because the code is building the left_color_map and right_color_map before processing any pairs. So, the lists contain all the indices for that color, regardless of whether they are used or not. But during the same-color processing, the code would pair them, but some of them may have been used in previous steps. Wait no, because the same-color processing is done for each color in order, and the code is processing all colors, but the used arrays are being marked as True. However, the code as written would pair the same color multiple times. For example, if a left boot is processed for color 'a' and then again for another color. But that's not possible, since the left boots are either in the left_color_map for their color or not. So, the code as written would process each left and right boot once for their color.\n\nWait, no. The left_color_map is built with all left boots that have a color (not '?'). So, for example, a left boot with color 'a' is in left_color_map['a']. Once paired, it's marked as used. But during the same-color processing, the code would process each color once, and for each color, pair the left and right boots in their lists. However, during this process, the code may pair some left boots with the same color multiple times, but that's not possible since the used array is being marked.\n\nWait, no. Because for each color, the code is processing all left and right boots of that color. But once a left boot is marked as used, it's not processed again in other color loops. But in the code above, for each color, the code processes all left and right boots of that color. However, the code for same-color pairing is not correct. Because, for example, if a left boot is in left_color_map['a'], but has already been paired in a previous color (like 'a') processing, then in the code above, it would be included again in the list for 'a' and processed again, leading to errors.\n\nWait, no. Because the left_color_map is built before any processing. So, for example, if a left boot has color 'a', it is in left_color_map['a']. When we process color 'a', we pair the first min(len(left_list), len(right_list)) entries. However, during this processing, the used_left array is marked as True for those entries. But when processing other colors (say, 'b'), the code would process the left_color_map['b'] entries, which are not used yet.\n\nBut during the same-color processing, the code would process all colors. However, the same left boot can't be in more than one color's list. Because the left boots are in the left_color_map only for their own color. So, once a left boot is paired in the same-color processing, it's marked as used and won't be processed again in other steps.\n\nTherefore, the code for same-color pairing is correct.\n\nWait, but the code for same-color pairing is processing each color once. For example, for each color c, we take the left_list",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the number of compatible pairs of boots, where each pair consists of one left boot and one right boot. The compatibility rules are such that specific colors must match exactly, while a question mark ('?') can match any color, including another question mark.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Same Color Pairing**: First, we pair left boots with right boots that have the same specific color. This is done by iterating through each possible color (from 'a' to 'z') and pairing as many matching left and right boots as possible.\n2. **Wildcard Pairing**: After handling same-color pairs, we handle the remaining boots with specific colors by pairing them with boots that have wildcards ('?'). This involves two steps:\n   - Pairing remaining specific color left boots with right wildcard boots.\n   - Pairing remaining specific color right boots with left wildcard boots.\n3. **Wildcard-Wildcard Pairing**: Finally, we pair the remaining wildcard boots from both left and right sides.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    l = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n    r = input[idx]\n    idx += 1\n\n    used_left = [False] * n\n    used_right = [False] * n\n    pairs = []\n\n    # Step 1: Pair same color\n    left_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n    right_color_map = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(n):\n        if l[i] != '?':\n            left_color_map[l[i]].append(i)\n        if r[i] != '?':\n            right_color_map[r[i]].append(i)\n\n    for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':\n        left_list = left_color_map.get(c, [])\n        right_list = right_color_map.get(c, [])\n        num_pairs = min(len(left_list), len(right_list))\n        for i in range(num_pairs):\n            left_idx = left_list[i]\n            right_idx = right_list[i]\n            used_left[left_idx] = True\n            used_right[right_idx] = True\n            pairs.append((left_idx + 1, right_idx + 1))\n\n    # Collect remaining non-? left and right\n    left_non_q = []\n    right_non_q = []\n    left_q = []\n    right_q = []\n\n    for i in range(n):\n        if not used_left[i]:\n            if l[i] != '?':\n                left_non_q.append(i)\n            else:\n                left_q.append(i)\n        if not used_right[i]:\n            if r[i] != '?':\n                right_non_q.append(i)\n            else:\n                right_q.append(i)\n\n    # Step 2: Pair left_non_q with right_q\n    k1 = min(len(left_non_q), len(right_q))\n    for i in range(k1):\n        a = left_non_q[i]\n        b = right_q[i]\n        used_left[a] = True\n        used_right[b] = True\n        pairs.append((a + 1, b + 1))\n\n    # Step 3: Pair right_non_q with left_q\n    k2 = min(len(right_non_q), len(left_q))\n    for i in range(k2):\n        a = left_q[i]\n        b = right_non_q[i]\n        used_left[a] = True\n        used_right[b] = True\n        pairs.append((a + 1, b + 1))\n\n    # Step 4: Pair remaining left_q and right_q\n    # The remaining left_q starts from k2\n    # The remaining right_q starts from k1\n    remaining_left = left_q[k2:]\n    remaining_right = right_q[k1:]\n    k3 = min(len(remaining_left), len(remaining_right))\n    for i in range(k3):\n        a = remaining_left[i]\n        b = remaining_right[i]\n        used_left[a] = True\n        used_right[b] = True\n        pairs.append((a + 1, b + 1))\n\n    print(len(pairs))\n    for p in pairs:\n        print(p[0], p[1])\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Same Color Pairing**: We use dictionaries to map each color to the list of indices where that color appears on the left and right.
