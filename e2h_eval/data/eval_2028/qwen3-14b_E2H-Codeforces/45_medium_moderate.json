There will be n players participating, and the tournament will follow knockout rules from the very first game. That means, that if someone loses a game he leaves the tournament immediately.Organizers are still arranging tournament grid (i.e. the order games will happen and who is going to play with whom) but they have already fixed one rule: two players can play against each other only if the number of games one of them has already played differs by no more than one from the number of games the other one has already played. Of course, both players had to win all their games in order to continue participating in the tournament.Tournament hasn't started yet so the audience is a bit bored. Ostap decided to find out what is the maximum number of games the winner of the tournament can take part in (assuming the rule above is used). However, it is unlikely he can deal with this problem without your help.\n\n## Input\nThe only line of the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1018) — the number of players to participate in the tournament.\n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum number of games in which the winner of the tournament can take part.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '4', '10']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2', '2', '4']\n\n## Note\nIn all samples we consider that player number 1 is the winner.In the first sample, there would be only one game so the answer is 1.In the second sample, player 1 can consequently beat players 2 and 3. In the third sample, player 1 can't play with each other player as after he plays with players 2 and 3 he can't play against player 4, as he has 0 games played, while player 1 already played 2. Thus, the answer is 2 and to achieve we make pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) and then clash the winners.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. The task is to find the maximum number of games the winner can play in a knockout tournament, given a certain number of players n. The key rule here is that two players can only play against each other if the number of games they've already played differs by at most one. \n\nHmm. Let's think about how the tournament structure works. In a standard knockout tournament with n players, the winner has to play log2(n) games if it's a perfect binary tree. But here, the structure isn't fixed, and we need to arrange the matches in a way that maximizes the number of games the winner plays, under the given constraint.\n\nWait, the problem says that the grid is arranged in a way that follows that rule. So the question is, given n players, what's the maximum possible number of games the winner can have, considering that the tournament is arranged optimally to maximize that number.\n\nLet me look at the examples. For n=3, the output is 2. How does that work? The winner plays two games. Let's see: first, player 1 beats player 2. Then, player 1 beats player 3. But according to the rule, when they play the second game, the player 1 has already played 1 game, and player 3 has played 0. The difference is 1, which is allowed. So that's okay. So the answer is 2.\n\nFor n=4, the output is 2. Wait, why can't the winner play 3 games? Because in a normal knockout, with 4 players, the winner plays 2 games (since it's a binary tree of depth 2). But maybe there's a way to arrange the matches so that the winner plays more? But according to the example, it's not possible. Let me think: for n=4, the maximum is 2. So why?\n\nBecause the rule might restrict that. Let's say the winner needs to play against someone else. Suppose the winner plays 3 games. That would require that in each round, the opponent has played either the same number of games or one less. Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of Fibonacci numbers. Because maybe the maximum number of games is related to the Fibonacci sequence. Because for each game the winner plays, they need to have opponents that have a certain number of games. Let me think.\n\nLet's say that the maximum number of games the winner can play is k. To achieve this, the winner must have played k games. Each time they play a game, they must have an opponent that has played either k-1, k-2, etc. But perhaps the structure requires that the number of players needed to allow the winner to have k games is something like the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nLet me think of it recursively. Suppose that to have a player reach k games, they must have played against opponents who themselves have certain numbers of games. For example, to have a player play k games, they must have played against someone who has played k-1 games (since the first game they play is against someone with 0 games, then next against someone with 1 game, etc.)\n\nWait, maybe the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games is the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number minus 1. Or something along those lines. Let's think:\n\nFor example, when k=1, the minimum players is 2. For k=2, the minimum players is 3 (as in the example). For k=3, the minimum players would be 5? Because to get to 3 games, the winner must have played in a way that each step requires previous steps.\n\nLet me think. Let's say that for the winner to play k games, the number of players required is f(k), where f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because, in order to get to the k-th game, the winner must have played against someone who has played k-1 games (so that their difference is 1). But that opponent must have come from a subtree that requires f(k-1) players. Also, the winner would have to have played against another player in previous rounds, which may require f(k-2) players. Wait, maybe this is similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nLet me think of it as follows: To have a player reach k games, the tournament must be structured such that in each of their games, the opponent is from a group that allows the required number of games. For example, the first game, the winner plays against someone who has 0 games. So that's 1 game. For the second game, the winner has played once, so the opponent must have played 0 or 1. But to get to the second game, the winner must have beaten someone in the first round. Then, in the second game, the opponent could be someone who has played once (so that the difference is zero) or zero (difference 1). But to maximize the number of games, perhaps the opponent must have played once. But how can that happen?\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. Let's say that for the winner to have played k games, the tournament must have had two subtrees: one that gives the winner's path, and another that gives the opponent's path. For example, in order for the winner to play k games, they must have played in the first game, then in the second, etc. Let's model this as follows:\n\nThe minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games is equal to the sum of the minimal players required for the winner to have k-1 games and the minimal players required for the winner to have k-2 games. Because, in order for the winner to play their k-th game, they must have an opponent that has played k-1 games (so that the difference is 1). But that opponent must have come from a subtree that required f(k-1) players. Additionally, the winner must have played in previous rounds, which requires that they have a certain number of players. Wait, perhaps this is similar to the Fibonacci sequence.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let's define f(k) as the minimal number of players required for the winner to have played k games. Then:\n\nFor k=0, the winner hasn't played any games. So f(0) = 1 (only one player, but since the tournament starts with n >= 2, maybe this is not applicable).\n\nFor k=1, the winner must play one game, so there are two players. So f(1) = 2.\n\nFor k=2, the winner must have played two games. How? First, they play against someone (say, player A), then they play against someone else (player B). But for the second game, the opponent (player B) must have played either 0 or 1 games. If the winner has played 1 game already, then the opponent must have played 0 or 1. If the opponent has played 1 game, that means that player B had to have played one game before facing the winner. So, the minimal number of players would be f(1) + f(1) = 2 + 2 = 4? But wait, that would be for the case where the winner plays against someone who has played 1 game. However, the sample input for n=3 gives output 2. Which implies that for k=2, the minimal number of players is 3. So my previous reasoning is wrong.\n\nSo maybe the formula is different. Let's think again. For the winner to play k games, they must have a sequence of opponents where each opponent has played at most one game less than the current number of games the winner has played. So, for the first game, the winner has 0 games, opponent has 0. Then after winning, the winner has 1 game. For the next game, the opponent must have 0 or 1 games. To maximize the number of games, the winner should have opponents that have played as many games as possible. So, for the second game, the opponent should have played 1 game. But how can that opponent have played 1 game? That requires that the opponent has already won one game. So, the winner's path would be: first game against someone (player A), then in the second game against someone (player B) who has already played one game. So, player B must have come from a sub-tournament where they have played one game. Thus, the minimal number of players for the winner to have k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Because, the winner's path requires that in the k-th game, they face an opponent who has played k-1 games (so that the difference is 1). That opponent comes from a subtree that requires f(k-1) players. But the winner must have also had a path of k-1 games, which requires f(k-1) players? Or perhaps I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of it as the following recurrence:\n\nTo have a winner play k games, the tournament must have a structure where the winner plays in each round against an opponent who has played either k-1 or k-2 games. Wait, perhaps the minimal number of players required for the winner to have k games is f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2). Let's check the base cases:\n\nFor k=1, f(1) = 2.\n\nFor k=2, f(2) = f(1) + f(0) ?\n\nBut what is f(0)? Well, if the winner has played zero games, then there's only one player, which is the winner. So f(0) = 1.\n\nThen f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3, which matches the example where n=3 gives k=2. For k=3, f(3) = f(2)+f(1) = 3+2=5. So for n=5, the maximum number of games is 3. Let's see if that's correct.\n\nIf there are 5 players, can the winner play 3 games?\n\nLet's imagine:\n\nGame 1: winner (W) vs A. W wins. (W has 1 game)\n\nGame 2: W vs B. But B must have played 0 or 1 games. If B has played 1 game, then B must have won one game. So, suppose B was in a sub-tournament of 2 players (B vs C, B wins). Then W plays B. Now W has 2 games. Then, for the third game, W needs to face someone who has played 1 or 2 games. Let's say that the opponent has played 2 games. How can that happen?\n\nIn that case, the opponent must have played two games. So, for example, D and E play each other (D wins), then D plays against someone else. Wait, but how does that fit into the structure?\n\nAlternatively, the structure for k=3 would require that the winner has to have a path where each step requires that the opponent comes from a subtree that allows the required number of games.\n\nSo for k=3, the minimal players is 5. So if n=5, the answer is 3.\n\nThen, for n=5, the answer is 3. For n=6, perhaps the answer is still 3, because 5 is the minimal required for 3 games. So the maximum number of games is the largest k such that f(k) ≤ n.\n\nSo the approach is to find the maximum k where f(k) ≤ n, where f(k) is the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with f(0)=1, f(1)=2, f(2)=3, f(3)=5, f(4)=8, etc. Because each f(k) = f(k-1) + f(k-2).\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k such that f(k) ≤ n. Then, the answer is k.\n\nBut let's test with the sample inputs:\n\nSample Input 2: n=3. The maximum k is 2, since f(2)=3. Output is 2. Which matches.\n\nSample Input 3: n=4. The f(2)=3, f(3)=5. So 5>4, so the maximum k is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSample Input 4: n=10. Let's compute f(k):\n\nf(0)=1\n\nf(1)=2\n\nf(2)=3\n\nf(3)=5\n\nf(4)=8\n\nf(5)=13.\n\nSo for n=10, the maximum k is 4 (since f(4)=8 ≤ 10, f(5)=13>10). So the answer is 4. Which matches the sample output of 4.\n\nYes! So that seems to fit. So the problem becomes finding the maximum k such that the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number (if we start from 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...) is less than or equal to n.\n\nWait, let's recheck the sequence. The f(k) is defined as:\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1) = 2\n\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 3\n\nf(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 5\n\nf(4) = 8\n\nf(5) = 13\n\nSo the sequence is 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc. Which is the Fibonacci numbers shifted. For example, the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(1) = 1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13, etc. Then f(k) = F(k+2). Because:\n\nFor k=0, f(0)=1 = F(2) = 1.\n\nk=1, f(1)=2 = F(3) = 2.\n\nk=2, f(2)=3=F(4)=3.\n\nk=3, f(3)=5=F(5)=5.\n\nYes. So f(k) = F(k+2), where F is the standard Fibonacci sequence (F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, F(3)=2, etc.)\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum k where F(k+2) ≤ n.\n\nBut how do we compute this for very large n (up to 1e18)?\n\nWe can precompute the Fibonacci numbers up to the point where they exceed 1e18, then for a given n, perform a binary search on the list to find the maximum k such that F(k+2) ≤n.\n\nBut first, let's generate the Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum possible value (which is up to 1e18).\n\nLet me compute the sequence:\n\nF(1)=1\n\nF(2)=1\n\nF(3)=2\n\nF(4)=3\n\nF(5)=5\n\nF(6)=8\n\nF(7)=13\n\nF(8)=21\n\nF(9)=34\n\nF(10)=55\n\nF(11)=89\n\nF(12)=144\n\nF(13)=233\n\nF(14)=377\n\nF(15)=610\n\nF(16)=987\n\nF(17)=1597\n\nF(18)=2584\n\nF(19)=4181\n\nF(20)=6765\n\n...\n\nLet me compute until the value exceeds 1e18.\n\nBut for the code, we can generate all the Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18. Let's see:\n\nLet me write down the steps.\n\nInitialize a list of Fibonacci numbers. Start with F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1. Then generate each next term as the sum of the previous two. Continue until the term exceeds 1e18.\n\nOnce we have that list, for a given n, we need to find the maximum k such that F(k+2) <=n.\n\nWait, for example, for n=2, the F(k+2) is 2. Which is F(3) = 2. So k+2=3 → k=1. Which matches the sample input of 2 → output 1.\n\nAnother example: n=3. F(4) is 3. k+2=4 → k=2. Which is the sample input of 3 → output 2.\n\nYes. So the answer is the maximum k where F(k+2) ≤n.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Precompute all Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18.\n\n- For a given n, find the largest index m such that F(m) ≤n. Then, the answer is (m - 2).\n\nWait, because F(m) = F(k+2), so m = k+2 → k = m-2.\n\nSo for example, if n=3, F(4)=3. m=4 → k=4-2=2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if n is between F(m) and F(m+1)?\n\nFor example, if n=4, which is between F(4)=3 and F(5)=5. Then the maximum m is 4, so the answer is 4-2=2. Which matches the sample input of 4 → output 2.\n\nAnother example: n=10. The F(6) is 8, F(7)=13. So m=6, answer is 6-2=4. Which matches the sample input of 10 → output 4.\n\nYes. So the steps are:\n\nGenerate all Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18. Then for input n, find the maximum m such that F(m) ≤n. The answer is m-2.\n\nBut what about when n is 1? Well, the constraints say n ≥2. So we don't need to handle that.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nFirst, generate the list of Fibonacci numbers. Let's generate them in a list. Let's see:\n\nStart with fib = [1, 1]. Then next is 2, then 3, etc.\n\nBut for the code, let's generate them until the next term exceeds 1e18.\n\nOnce the list is generated, for a given n, perform a binary search to find the largest m where fib[m] <=n.\n\nWait, but the list is generated as F(1), F(2), F(3), ... So for example, the list is [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...].\n\nSo for example, the index in the list is m, and the value is F(m). So for n=3, the largest m where F(m) <=3 is 4 (since F(4) is 3). So the list would be:\n\nindex 0: 1 (F(1))\n\nindex 1: 1 (F(2))\n\nindex 2: 2 (F(3))\n\nindex 3: 3 (F(4))\n\nindex 4: 5 (F(5))\n\netc.\n\nSo the code will need to generate all F(m) up to 1e18.\n\nSo let's generate that list.\n\nOnce that is done, for input n, find the largest m such that F(m) <=n. Then the answer is m-2.\n\nBut let's test for n=2. The F(3) is 2. m=3, answer is 3-2=1. Correct.\n\nAnother example: n=5. F(5)=5. m=5, answer 5-2=3. Which would be correct as the maximum games is 3.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nIf n is 1, but according to input constraints, n is at least 2.\n\nGenerate the list of Fibonacci numbers.\n\nFind the largest m where F(m) <=n.\n\nAnswer is m-2.\n\nBut how to generate the list.\n\nLet me code that part.\n\nInitialize a list, say fib = [1, 1]. Then while the next term is <= 1e18, append it.\n\nBut for Python, even for 1e18, the Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, so the list will be small.

So F(88) is 1.1e18, which is less than 1e18? Wait, no. 1.1e18 is larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum Fibonacci number would be F(87) = 6.79e17, and then F(88) is 1.1e18.\n\nSo the list would include up to F(87) and F(88) (if F(88) is <=1e18?), but 1.1e18 is larger than 1e18. So for n up to 1e18, the maximum m is up to 87, if the value is <=n.\n\nSo the code can generate all the Fibonacci numbers up to 1e18, then for each input n, perform a binary search on this list.\n\nSo in code:\n\nGenerate the list of Fibonacci numbers, starting from F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, etc., until the next term exceeds 1e18.\n\nOnce the list is generated, for a given n, find the maximum m where fib[m] <=n.\n\nBut how to index the list. Let's say we have a list called fib_list, which contains [F(1), F(2), F(3), ..., F(k)] where F(k) is the last term <= 1e18.\n\nSo for example, in code:\n\nfib_list = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fib_list[-1] + fib_list[-2]\n\n    if next_val > 1e18:\n\n        break\n\n    fib_list.append(next_val)\n\nBut in Python, 1e18 is a float. So better to use integers. So perhaps:\n\nmax_n = 10**18\n\nfib_list = [1, 1]\n\nwhile True:\n\n    next_val = fib_list[-1] + fib_list[-2]\n\n    if next_val > max_n:\n\n        break\n\n    fib_list.append(next_val)\n\nOnce this list is generated, for a given n, we can perform a binary search to find the largest m where fib_list[m] <=n.\n\nBut note that the list is 0-based. For example, fib_list[0] is F(1) = 1, fib_list[1] is F(2) = 1, fib_list[2] is F(3) = 2, etc.\n\nSo for example, if we find that the largest element in fib_list that is <=n is at index i, then the corresponding m is i+1 (since F(1) is at index 0, F(2) is at index 1, etc.)\n\nWait, no. Let's think: the list is built as follows:\n\nInitially, fib_list = [1, 1]. These are F(1) and F(2). Then next term is 2 (F(3)), then 3 (F(4)), etc. So for the list, the index is (m-1) where m is the term number. So for example, fib_list[0] = F(1), fib_list[1] = F(2), fib_list[2] = F(3), fib_list[3] = F(4), etc.\n\nSo if we find that the largest F(m) <=n is F(m), then the index in the list is (m-1). So for example, if m=3, index is 2.\n\nSo for a given n, we need to find the maximum m where F(m) <=n. Once found, the answer is m-2.\n\nBut how to find m?\n\nOnce we find the index i in fib_list where fib_list[i] is the largest value <=n, then m = i+1.\n\nBecause:\n\ni = m-1 → m = i+1.\n\nThus, the answer is (i+1) - 2 = i -1.\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nIf the list is [F(1), F(2), F(3), ... F(k)], then for each index i, the value is F(i+1). Because:\n\ni=0 → F(1)\n\ni=1 → F(2)\n\ni=2 → F(3)\n\nSo for a given value in the list at index i, the term is F(i+1).\n\nSo, if the largest F(m) <=n is found at index i, then m = i+1.\n\nSo the answer is m-2 = (i+1) - 2 = i-1.\n\nSo for example, when n=3, which is F(4)=3. The index i is 3 (since fib_list[3] = 3). Then m = 3+1=4. Answer is 4-2=2. Correct.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nOnce the list is generated, perform a binary search on the list to find the largest value <=n. Let's say that value is at index i. Then answer is i-1.\n\nBut what if n is larger than all elements in the list? For example, if n is larger than the last element in fib_list. Then, the maximum m is the length of the list, but that would be for F(k) where k is the length of the list. Wait, no. The list stops when the next value exceeds 1e18. So the last element in the list is the largest F(m) <=1e18.\n\nBut if n is larger than that, then the maximum m is the same as the last element's m. Wait, no. For example, if the list ends with F(k), and n is larger than F(k), but less than F(k+1) (which is beyond 1e18). But since n can be up to 1e18, then if the last element in the list is F(k), and n is larger than F(k), then the maximum m is k, since F(k) <=n, and F(k+1) is larger than 1e18, which is larger than n.\n\nSo the code must handle that case. For example, if n is larger than the last element in the list, then the answer is (length of list) - 1.\n\nWait, let's think again. Let's suppose the list is [F(1), F(2), ..., F(k)]. The next term F(k+1) is larger than 1e18. Now, if the input n is 1e18, which is larger than F(k), but less than F(k+1). Then, the maximum m is k, because F(k) <=n, and F(k+1) >n.\n\nSo during the binary search, if the n is larger than all elements in the list, then the answer is the index of the last element (i = len(fib_list)-1), and the answer is i-1.\n\nSo the code needs to find the largest element in the list that is <=n. So the binary search can be done using the bisect module in Python.\n\nIn Python, the bisect module has bisect_right, which returns the insertion point for the given value. For example, if we have a sorted list, and we want to find the largest element <=n, then we can use bisect_right to find the insertion point, and subtract 1.\n\nSo for example:\n\nimport bisect\n\nindex = bisect.bisect_right(fib_list, n) - 1\n\nif index >=0:\n\n   answer = index -1 \n\nelse:\n\n   ... but since n >=2, and fib_list starts with 1, 1, etc., index can't be negative.\n\nWait, for example, if n is 1, but according to input constraints, n is at least 2. So for n=2, the fib_list has elements [1, 1, 2, 3, ...]. bisect_right(fib_list, 2) returns 3 (since the elements are [1,1,2,",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of games the winner of a knockout tennis tournament can play, given the constraint that two players can only compete if the difference in the number of games they have already played is at most one. The solution involves understanding the structure of the tournament and leveraging properties of the Fibonacci sequence.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Tournament Structure**: The key insight is that the maximum number of games a player can participate in follows a pattern similar to the Fibonacci sequence. This is because each game the winner plays requires an opponent who has played a number of games that differs by at most one.\n2. **Fibonacci Sequence Insight**: The minimum number of players required for a winner to play `k` games is determined by the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, the minimum number of players required for `k` games is given by the (k+2)-th Fibonacci number.\n3. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: Generate all Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum possible value (10^18) since this helps in efficiently determining the maximum number of games for any given number of players `n`.\n4. **Binary Search**: For a given number of players `n`, use binary search on the precomputed Fibonacci numbers to find the largest value that is less than or equal to `n`. This value corresponds to the maximum number of games the winner can play.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    max_n = 10**18\n    fib_list = [1, 1]  # F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1\n    while True:\n        next_val = fib_list[-1] + fib_list[-2]\n        if next_val > max_n:\n            break\n        fib_list.append(next_val)\n    \n    index = bisect.bisect_right(fib_list, n) - 1\n    if index < 0:\n        print(0)\n    else:\n        print(index - 1)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Precompute Fibonacci Numbers**: The code generates all Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum value of `10^18`. This is done using a loop that continues until the next Fibonacci number exceeds `10^18`.\n2. **Binary Search for Maximum Games**: Using the `bisect` module, the code efficiently finds the largest Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to the input `n`. The position of this number in the Fibonacci list determines the maximum number of games the winner can play, which is derived by adjusting the index accordingly.\n\nThis approach ensures that the solution is efficient and handles very large values of `n` up to `10^18` effectively. The use of precomputed Fibonacci numbers and binary search ensures optimal performance.",
