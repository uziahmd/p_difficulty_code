Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).\n\n## Input\nThe first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nOutput one number â€” length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['abcd', 'ababa', 'zzz']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '2']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the longest substring that appears at least twice in a given string. The occurrences can overlap, which is important. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the input is a string, and the output is the maximum length of such a substring. For example, in the sample input 'ababa', the answer is 3 because 'aba' appears twice (positions 0-2 and 2-4), overlapping. So overlapping is allowed.\n\nThe challenge is to check all possible substrings and see which ones appear more than once, then find the maximum length among them.\n\nBut how do I efficiently check all possible substrings?\n\nLet me think. The brute force approach would be to generate all possible substrings for all possible lengths, then check if they appear at least twice. But since the string can be up to 100 characters long, this might be feasible.\n\nLet me calculate the possible number of substrings. For a string of length n, the number of possible substrings is O(n^2). For n=100, that's 10^4 substrings. For each substring, I need to check if it occurs at least twice. But how?\n\nFor each possible substring length, starting from the maximum possible (n-1) down to 1, check if there's any substring of that length that occurs at least twice. Once found, return that length as the maximum.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n- Iterate possible lengths from the maximum possible (length of string - 1) down to 1.\n- For each length L, generate all substrings of length L, and check if any of them appears at least twice.\n- The first L where this is true is the answer. If none found, return 0.\n\nBut how to check if a substring appears at least twice?\n\nFor each L, we can collect all substrings of length L, and track their counts. For example, using a dictionary where keys are the substrings, and values are the number of times they appear. Then, for any key with value >=2, we can note that L is a candidate. Since we're checking from largest L downwards, once we find such an L, we can return it immediately.\n\nYes. So the steps would be:\n\nFor the given string s:\n\nmax_len = 0\n\nfor L in range(len(s)-1, 0, -1):\n\n    seen = {}\n\n    for i in range(0, len(s) - L + 1):\n\n        substr = s[i:i+L]\n\n        if substr in seen:\n\n            # if already seen once, then this is the second occurrence\n\n            return L as the answer (since we are checking from largest to smallest)\n\n        else:\n\n            seen[substr] = 1\n\n    # after checking all substrings of length L, if any had duplicates, we would have returned\n\nSo wait, but in this approach, for each L, we check all substrings of that length. If any substring occurs more than once, then we can return L as the answer. Because we are checking from largest to smallest, the first L where this is true is the maximum possible.\n\nBut how to handle cases where a substring occurs more than once, but not in the first occurrence?\n\nWait, for example, if a substring occurs three times. Then, during the checking for that L, when we process the second occurrence, we can check if it's already in the 'seen' dictionary. If yes, then return L.\n\nBut the code above would return L as soon as the first duplicate is found. However, for a particular L, there may be multiple substrings that have duplicates. But once any one of them is found, we can return L as the answer.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nCheck for each possible L, starting from the largest possible. For each L, check all possible substrings of that length. For each substring, if it's already been seen before (in the current L's iteration), then return L as the answer. Otherwise, add it to the 'seen' set. If after checking all substrings for L, no duplicates are found, proceed to check L-1.\n\nThis approach would work. Because once we find the largest possible L where there's at least one duplicate substring, we can return it immediately.\n\nBut wait, what if there are multiple substrings of the same L that are duplicated, but the first occurrence of a duplicate is not the earliest? For example, suppose for L=3, there are two occurrences of 'abc' at positions 0 and 3. Then, during the loop, when i=0, substr is added to 'seen'. Then when i=3, substr is again checked, and since it's in 'seen', we return L=3. So this works.\n\nBut what if a substring occurs more than once, but not overlapping? Like, for example, in 'aaaaa', for",
