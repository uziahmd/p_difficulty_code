In this game, she has three tiles in her hand. Each tile she owns is a suited tile, which means it has a suit (manzu, pinzu or souzu) and a number (a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$). In this problem, we use one digit and one lowercase letter, which is the first character of the suit, to represent a suited tile. All possible suited tiles are represented as 1m, 2m, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9m, 1p, 2p, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9p, 1s, 2s, $$$\\ldots$$$, 9s.In order to win the game, she must have at least one mentsu (described below) in her hand, so sometimes she should draw extra suited tiles. After drawing a tile, the number of her tiles increases by one. She can draw any tiles she wants, including those already in her hand.Do you know the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw so that she can win?Here are some useful definitions in this game:  A mentsu, also known as meld, is formed by a koutsu or a shuntsu;  A koutsu, also known as triplet, is made of three identical tiles, such as [1m, 1m, 1m], however, [1m, 1p, 1s] or [1m, 4m, 7m] is NOT a koutsu;  A shuntsu, also known as sequence, is made of three sequential numbered tiles in the same suit, such as [1m, 2m, 3m] and [5s, 7s, 6s], however, [9m, 1m, 2m] or [1m, 2p, 3s] is NOT a shuntsu. Some examples:   [2m, 3p, 2s, 4m, 1s, 2s, 4s] — it contains no koutsu or shuntsu, so it includes no mentsu;  [4s, 3m, 3p, 4s, 5p, 4s, 5p] — it contains a koutsu, [4s, 4s, 4s], but no shuntsu, so it includes a mentsu;  [5p, 5s, 9m, 4p, 1s, 7p, 7m, 6p] — it contains no koutsu but a shuntsu, [5p, 4p, 6p] or [5p, 7p, 6p], so it includes a mentsu. Note that the order of tiles is unnecessary and you can assume the number of each type of suited tiles she can draw is infinite.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three strings — the tiles in Tokitsukaze's hand. For each string, the first character is a digit ranged from $$$1$$$ to $$$9$$$ and the second character is m, p or s.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the minimum number of extra suited tiles she needs to draw.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1s 2s 3s', '9m 9m 9m', '3p 9m 2p']\n\n### Output\n['0', '0', '1']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, Tokitsukaze already has a shuntsu.In the second example, Tokitsukaze already has a koutsu.In the third example, Tokitsukaze can get a shuntsu by drawing one suited tile — 1p or 4p. The resulting tiles will be [3p, 9m, 2p, 1p] or [3p, 9m, 2p, 4p].\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about determining the minimum number of tiles Tokitsukaze needs to draw to form a mentsu, which can be either a triplet (koutsu) or a sequence (shuntsu). The input is three tiles, and we have to find the minimum draws required.\n\nFirst, let's think about what conditions would allow the current tiles (plus some drawn tiles) to form a mentsu. The key is to check if the existing three tiles can already form a mentsu. If not, figure out how many more tiles are needed.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases.\n\nFor a triplet (koutsu), all three tiles must be the same. So, if the three given tiles are all same, then answer is 0. For example, the second example in the input: '9m 9m 9m' gives 0.\n\nIf not, then check if they can form a sequence (shuntsu). A sequence requires three consecutive numbers in the same suit. For example, 1s, 2s, 3s. But the three tiles may not be in order. So, for the three tiles, we need to check if they are in the same suit, and their numbers form a consecutive sequence.\n\nBut wait, the initial three tiles may not form a sequence. For example, if they are 1s, 3s, 2s, then they can form a sequence. But if they are 1s, 2s, 4s, then they can't. So, for the initial three tiles, check if they can form a sequence when sorted.\n\nSo, for the initial three tiles, first check if they are all same (triplet) → answer 0. Else, check if they can form a sequence. If yes, then answer 0. Otherwise, we need to find how many tiles to add to get a mentsu.\n\nBut what if the current tiles can't form a mentsu? Then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nSo, the problem is to find the minimal number of tiles to add so that there exists a mentsu in the hand.\n\nNow, the initial three tiles plus some drawn tiles. The question is, what's the minimal number of draws needed.\n\nLet me think about possible scenarios.\n\nCase 1: The initial three tiles already form a mentsu. Then answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: They don't. Then we need to find the minimal number of tiles to add.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the possibilities for forming a mentsu after adding some tiles.\n\nFor example, if the initial three tiles can be part of a triplet or sequence when adding some tiles.\n\nLet me think about the possible ways.\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles can form a triplet with one more tile. Like, if two of them are same. For example, if the tiles are 1m, 1m, 2m. Then adding one more 1m would make a triplet. So the answer would be 1. Or, if the tiles are 1m, 1m, 1p. Then adding one more 1m and one more 1p would make a triplet? No, because triplet requires three same tiles. So, in this case, you need to add two tiles (two 1m's, or two 1p's, or one 1m and one 1p? No, no. Wait, for a triplet, you need three identical tiles. So if you have two 1m, then you need to add one 1m. So that's one tile. But if you have two different tiles, like 1m, 1p, 1s, then you need to add two tiles (like two 1m's, or two 1p's, etc.) to make a triplet. But that would take two tiles. However, maybe there's a better way to form a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal number is 1 or 2, depending on the situation.\n\nBut how do I approach this systematically?\n\nLet me think of all possibilities. The minimal number of tiles to add can be 0, 1, 2, or maybe even more. But since the problem says that the answer is the minimum, perhaps the possible answers are 0, 1, 2, or 3?\n\nWait, but the problem says that after drawing, the number of tiles increases by one each time. So, for example, if the initial three tiles can't form a mentsu, but adding one tile allows it, then answer is 1. If adding two tiles allows it, then answer is 2, etc.\n\nBut how can we find the minimal steps?\n\nLet me think of possible scenarios:\n\nFirst, check if the initial three tiles can form a mentsu. If yes, answer is 0.\n\nIf not, then check if adding one tile can make a mentsu. If yes, answer is 1.\n\nElse, check if adding two tiles can make a mentsu. Answer is 2.\n\nElse, answer is 3? Well, but maybe there's a way with two tiles. Let me think.\n\nBut for example, if the initial three tiles are all different and not in a sequence. For example, 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, adding 3m would make a sequence (1,2,3,4). But then, you can choose three of them. Wait, but after adding one tile, you have four tiles. So, you can have a sequence of three. For example, adding 3m gives 1m, 2m, 3m, 4m. So there is a sequence of 1-2-3, or 2-3-4. So, the answer would be 1.\n\nSo in this case, adding one tile is sufficient.\n\nAnother example: the third input example: '3p 9m 2p'. The existing tiles are 3p, 2p, and 9m. So, the 3p and 2p are in the same suit (p). So, if you add 1p, then you have 1p, 2p, 3p. That's a sequence. So answer is 1.\n\nSo, how can I check for all possibilities?\n\nThe approach is:\n\nCheck whether the current three tiles can form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check if there's a way to add one tile to make a mentsu. If yes, return 1.\n\nElse, check if adding two tiles can make a mentsu. Return 2.\n\nBut how to check these conditions?\n\nLet me think about each step.\n\nFirst, checking if the current three tiles form a mentsu.\n\nTo check for triplet: all three are same.\n\nFor sequence: all three are same suit, and their numbers are consecutive when sorted.\n\nSo, for the three tiles, first check if they are all same. If yes, then 0.\n\nElse, check if they are in same suit, and when sorted, numbers are consecutive. For example, 1s, 3s, 2s → sorted as 1,2,3 → consecutive. So yes.\n\nIf that is true, then answer is 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nNow, if the initial three can't form a mentsu, then check if adding one tile can help.\n\nHow can adding one tile help?\n\nPossibly:\n\nCase A: Form a triplet. For example, if two of the tiles are same. Adding another same tile would form a triplet.\n\nCase B: Form a sequence. For example, the existing tiles have two tiles in the same suit, and adding a third that completes the sequence.\n\nOr, the existing tiles have two tiles in the same suit, and adding a third that is adjacent to them.\n\nBut how to check all possibilities?\n\nLet me think.\n\nFor example, suppose the three tiles are 1m, 2m, 4m. Then adding 3m would allow a sequence. So, the answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: 1m, 1m, 2m. Adding another 1m would make triplet. So answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: 1m, 1p, 1s. Then, adding two tiles (say, 1m and 1p) would make a triplet (but that would require two tiles). But maybe there's a better way. However, for this case, the answer would be 2 (since adding two tiles to form a triplet). However, perhaps adding one tile to form a sequence? No, because the existing tiles are all different suits. So, no. So, the answer would be 2.\n\nBut how to find that.\n\nSo, the approach for checking if adding one tile can make a mentsu is:\n\nCheck all possibilities where adding one tile would allow a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo, for triplet possibility:\n\nCheck for each tile type (the count of each tile in the current three). For example, if there are two tiles of the same type, then adding one more would form a triplet. So, for example, if the current tiles have two 1m's, then adding one more 1m would form a triplet. So, this is possible. So, if any of the counts of the current tiles is 2, then adding one tile would form a triplet. But what if the current counts are 1,1,1? Then, adding two tiles would be needed for triplet. But that's not possible with adding one.\n\nSo, in this case, the triplet possibility would not be possible with adding one tile.\n\nSo, for the triplet case, if any of the tile types has two occurrences, then adding one tile can make a triplet. So, in that case, answer is 1.\n\nFor the sequence case, adding one tile can complete a sequence. How to check that?\n\nLet me think. For example, suppose the current three tiles have two in same suit. For example, 1m, 2m, 3p. Then, the two m's are 1 and 2. Adding 3m would form a sequence. So, that's possible. Or, if the two m's are 1 and 3. Then adding 2m would form a sequence. So, for the same suit, check if there are two tiles, and see if adding a third can form a sequence.\n\nBut also, perhaps the three tiles have two in same suit, and another tile in a different suit. But then, adding a tile in the same suit as the two could form a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, the three tiles may have two tiles in the same suit, and the third in another suit. For example, 1m, 2m, 3s. Then, adding a 3m would allow a sequence of 1m, 2m, 3m. So, yes. But in this case, the existing tiles have two m's. So, for the same suit, check if there are two tiles, and see if adding a third can form a sequence.\n\nBut how to check for all possibilities.\n\nSo, here's an idea: For each possible suit, collect the numbers of the tiles in that suit. Then, check if there's a way to add one tile to form a sequence.\n\nFor example, suppose the current tiles have two tiles in suit 'm', with numbers 1 and 3. Then, adding 2m would form a sequence. Or, if the numbers are 1 and 2, adding 3m. Or if the numbers are 2 and 3, adding 1m. So, in any case, if there are two tiles in the same suit, and the numbers are x and y (x < y), then check if there's a possible z such that adding z would form a sequence. For example, if x and y are consecutive (like 1 and 2), then adding 3 would form a sequence (1,2,3). Or adding 0 (invalid, since numbers are 1-9). So, only adding 3. If x and y are 1 and 3, then adding 2. If x and y are 2 and 3, adding 1. Also, if x and y are 1 and 4, then there's no way to add a single tile to form a sequence (since 1, 4, and adding something else would need to have two consecutive numbers. For example, adding 2 would give 1,2,4. Not a sequence. Adding 3 would give 1,3,4. Not a sequence. Adding 5 would not help. So, no.)\n\nBut if there are two tiles in the same suit, then check if there's a possible third tile that can be added to form a sequence. If yes, then adding that tile would allow a sequence.\n\nAdditionally, if there are three tiles in the same suit. For example, 1m, 2m, 4m. Then, adding 3m would form a sequence. So, the existing three tiles have two in the same suit? No, three in same suit. Wait, but the original three tiles may not form a sequence. For example, 1m, 2m, 4m. So, adding 3m would allow a sequence. So, in this case, the current three tiles have three in same suit, but not consecutive. So, adding one tile (3m) can make a sequence.\n\nSo, for the case where the three tiles are in the same suit, but not consecutive, then adding one tile can make a sequence.\n\nSo, the steps to check if adding one tile can form a sequence:\n\nCheck for each suit that has at least two tiles. For each such suit, collect the numbers of the tiles in that suit. Then, check if adding a tile can form a sequence.\n\nFor example, if in suit 'm', the numbers are [1,2,4]. Then, adding 3 would make a sequence. So, yes. So, the answer is 1.\n\nAnother example: if in suit 'm', numbers are [1,3,5]. Then, adding 2, 4, or 6 would not create a sequence. But adding 2 would allow [1,2,3], but there is a 3 in the existing tiles. Wait, existing tiles are [1,3,5]. Adding 2 would give [1,3,5,2]. So, there's a sequence 1,2,3. So, yes. So, adding 2 would form a sequence. So, in this case, adding one tile is possible.\n\nSo, how to check this for any set of numbers in a suit.\n\nSo, for the numbers in a suit, let's sort them. Suppose there are k numbers. Let's say, for example, the numbers are [a, b, c] (sorted). Then, to form a sequence, there must be three consecutive numbers. But with the current numbers, plus one more.\n\nSo, for example, if the numbers are [1,2,4], adding 3 gives 1,2,3,4. So, there is a sequence of 1,2,3.\n\nIf the numbers are [1,3,5], adding 2 gives 1,2,3,5. So, there is 1,2,3. So, yes.\n\nIf the numbers are [1,2,3], then already a sequence. But the original three tiles are in the same suit, but not forming a sequence? Wait, no. Because if the three numbers are 1,2,3, then the original three tiles would form a sequence, so the answer would have been 0. So, in this case, the code would have already checked that.\n\nSo, the scenario where we have to check adding one tile is when the original three tiles do not form a sequence.\n\nSo, for a suit with three tiles, but not forming a sequence, can adding one tile help? For example, if the numbers are [1,2,4], adding 3. So, yes. If the numbers are [1,3,5], adding 2. Yes. If the numbers are [1, 4, 5], adding 2 would allow 1,2,3? No, because there is no 3. But adding 2 and 3 would be two tiles. But we are considering adding only one tile. So, adding 2 would not form a sequence. Adding 3 would not form a sequence. But adding 6 would form 4,5,6. So, adding 6. So, in this case, yes. So, adding one tile (6) would allow a sequence of 4,5,6.\n\nSo, for the numbers [1,4,5], adding 6 gives a sequence of 4,5,6. So, yes.\n\nThus, for a suit with three tiles, but not forming a sequence, adding one tile may be possible.\n\nSo, how to check this.\n\nFor each suit, collect the numbers of the tiles in that suit. Let's say the numbers are sorted as [a, b, c].\n\nIf the numbers are in the same suit, and the length is 3, then check if there's a way to add one tile to make a sequence.\n\nBut in this case, the existing three tiles are already in the same suit, but not forming a sequence. So, for example, [1,2,4]. Adding 3. So, the new list would have 1,2,3,4. So, there's a sequence of 1-2-3 or 2-3-4.\n\nBut how to check for that.\n\nAnother approach: For any two numbers in the same suit, check if adding a third can form a sequence.\n\nBut perhaps the best way is to look for possible sequences that can be formed with the existing numbers plus one more.\n\nSo, for each suit, collect all the numbers present. For example, if the numbers in the suit are S. Then, for each possible number x (from 1 to 9), check if adding x would allow a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor example, suppose the existing numbers in the suit are {1, 2, 4}. Then, adding 3 would allow the sequence 1-2-3 and 2-3-4. So, yes.\n\nSo, for any x, check if there exists three consecutive numbers in S ∪ {x}.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nAn alternative approach is to check for all possible sequences of three consecutive numbers. For each such possible sequence (like 1-2-3, 2-3-4, ..., 7-8-9), check if the existing numbers in the suit plus the new tile x covers all three numbers. For example, for the sequence 1-2-3, if the existing numbers are {1,2}, then adding 3 would cover all three. Or if existing numbers are {1,3}, then adding 2 would cover all three. Or if existing numbers are {2,3}, adding 1 would cover all three.\n\nSo, for the suit, for each possible triplet of consecutive numbers (like 1-2-3, etc.), check if the existing numbers in the suit are missing exactly one of the three numbers. If so, then adding that missing number would allow a sequence.\n\nSo, for example, existing numbers in the suit are [1,2,4]. For the triplet 1-2-3, existing numbers have 1 and 2. Missing 3. So adding 3. For the triplet 2-3-4, existing numbers have 2 and 4. Missing 3. So adding 3. For triplet 3-4-5, existing numbers have 4. Missing 3 and 5. So adding one tile can't cover both. So, only triplets that require exactly one tile to be added.\n\nSo, for the suit, if there exists any such triplet where the existing numbers are missing exactly one number, then adding that number will allow a sequence.\n\nSo, for each suit, we can check this.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor the current three tiles, check:\n\n1. If they already form a mentsu (triplet or sequence) → answer 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if adding one tile can form a mentsu. How?\n\nCheck for triplet possibility:\n\nCheck if any of the tile counts is 2. Because adding one more of the same tile would make a triplet. For example, if there are two 1m tiles, then adding one more makes three.\n\nIf yes → answer is 1.\n\nElse, check for sequence possibility:\n\nCheck for each suit, if there exists a way to add one tile to form a sequence. For example, if the suit has two tiles, and adding a third to make a sequence. Or three tiles, but missing one number in a triplet.\n\nIf any such possibility exists → answer is 1.\n\nIf neither triplet nor sequence can be formed with adding one tile → check if adding two tiles can form a mentsu. Then answer is 2.\n\nBut wait, what about cases where adding two tiles can form a triplet or sequence?\n\nFor example, if the initial three tiles are all different and in different suits. Then, adding two tiles of same type would make a triplet. So, answer is 2.\n\nBut in that case, the minimal is 2.\n\nBut how to check if adding two tiles can form a mentsu.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the answer is the minimal number of tiles to draw. So, if adding one tile can't form a mentsu, then the answer is either 2 or higher. But what's the maximum possible?\n\nLet me think. For example, if the initial three tiles are all different suits and numbers, like 1m, 2p, 3s. Then, to form a triplet, you need to add two tiles of the same type. For example, adding two 1m's. Then you have three 1m's. So, answer is 2.\n\nAlternatively, to form a sequence, you need to add two tiles. For example, adding 2m and 3m. Then, you have 1m, 2m, 3m. So, answer is 2.\n\nSo, in this case, the answer is 2.\n\nAnother example: initial tiles are 1m, 1p, 1s. Then, to form a triplet, you need to add two tiles. For example, two 1m's → triplet of 1m. Or two 1p's → triplet of 1p. So answer is 2.\n\nSo, in this case, the answer is 2.\n\nSo, the minimal number of tiles needed is 2.\n\nBut what about if the initial tiles cannot form a mentsu with adding one tile, but can form a mentsu with adding two tiles. Then the answer is 2.\n\nSo, the question is, after checking that adding one tile is not possible, can we always form a mentsu by adding two tiles?\n\nYes. Because for any three tiles, adding two tiles can form a triplet or a sequence.\n\nSo, the answer in this case is 2.\n\nBut why?\n\nBecause:\n\nIf you can't form a triplet with one tile, then you have at most one tile of each type. So, adding two tiles of the same type would make a triplet. So, answer is 2.\n\nAlternatively, for a sequence: for any three tiles, you can add two tiles to form a sequence. For example, if the three tiles are all in different suits, then you can choose a suit and add two tiles to form a sequence. For example, 1m, 2p, 3s. Choose to form a sequence in m. Add 2m and 3m. Now you have 1m, 2m, 3m. So, sequence.\n\nThus, the minimal number of tiles needed is 2.\n\nWait, but in some cases, adding two tiles can form a triplet or a sequence. So, regardless of the initial configuration, if adding one tile is not possible, then adding two tiles is sufficient.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be 2 in that case.\n\nSo, putting this together, the algorithm is:\n\nCheck if the current three tiles form a mentsu. If yes → 0.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if adding one tile can form a mentsu. If yes → 1.\n\nElse → 2.\n\nSo, the answer can be 0, 1, or 2.\n\nWait, what about cases where adding two tiles is needed? Like the third example in the problem. The input was '3p 9m 2p'. The existing tiles are 3p, 2p, and 9m. So, the three tiles are not forming a mentsu. Can adding one tile form a mentsu?\n\nIn this case, for the p suit, the numbers are 2 and 3. Adding 1p or 4p would allow a sequence. So, answer is 1. Which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: initial tiles are 1m, 2p, 3s. So, no mentsu. Adding one tile can't form a mentsu. Because, for triplet: you have only one of each. So adding one tile would not form a triplet. For sequence: you need to have three in same suit. So, adding one tile can't form a sequence. So, answer would be 2.\n\nSo, the algorithm seems to hold.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\nFirst, check if the current three tiles form a mentsu. If yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check if adding one tile can form a mentsu. How?\n\nCheck for triplet possibility: if any of the counts is 2. Because adding one more would make 3.\n\nCheck for sequence possibility: for each suit, check if adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nIf any of these is possible, return 1.\n\nElse, return 2.\n\nSo, how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about how to represent the tiles. Let's parse the input into a list of three tiles. Each tile is a string like '1m', '2p', etc.\n\nFirst, check if the three tiles form a triplet. That is, all three are same.\n\nIf yes, return 0.\n\nElse, check if they form a sequence. To do this, check if all three are same suit, and when sorted, their numbers are consecutive.\n\nFor example, for tiles ['1s', '2s', '3s'] → sorted numbers are [1,2,3] → consecutive. So yes.\n\nIf that's the case, return 0.\n\nElse, proceed.\n\nThen, check if adding one tile can form a mentsu.\n\nFirst, check for triplet possibility. Count the frequency of each tile. For example, if there are two of the same tile, then adding one more would form a triplet.\n\nSo, for example, if the tiles are ['1m', '1m', '2p'], then the frequencies are {'1m': 2, '2p': 1} → so there's a count of 2. So, adding one tile of '1m' would form a triplet. So, return 1.\n\nSo, in code, we can count the frequency of each tile. If any frequency is 2, then return 1 for triplet possibility.\n\nBut what if there are two different tiles with count 2? Like, for example, the three tiles are ['1m', '1m', '2m', '2m']? Wait, no, the initial input is three tiles. So, the frequencies can be:\n\n- All three same → handled earlier.\n\n- Two same and one different → frequencies are 2 and 1.\n\n- All different → frequencies are 1,1,1.\n\nSo, in code, for the triplet possibility, check if any of the counts is 2. If yes, then adding one tile can form a triplet.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ntiles = [...] # the three input tiles\n\ncounts = Counter(tiles)\n\nif any(v >= 2 for v in counts.values()):\n\n    # possible to form triplet with adding one tile.\n\nBut wait, if the count is exactly 2, then adding one more. If the count is 3, but that's already handled in the first check (since the first check would have found that all three are same).\n\nSo, in the case where the initial three are not forming a triplet, but there are two same tiles, then adding one more would make a triplet. So, possible.\n\nSo, this is a condition that would return 1.\n\nThen, check for sequence possibility.\n\nFor this, we need to check for each suit, whether adding one tile can form a sequence.\n\nSo, group the tiles by their suit. For each suit, collect the numbers.\n\nFor example, tiles are ['3p', '9m', '2p'] → grouped by suit:\n\np: [3, 2]\n\nm: [9]\n\nSo, for suit p, we have numbers [2,3]. Adding 1 or 4 would form a sequence. So, possible.\n\nThus, the code needs to check for each suit, the numbers in that suit, and see if there's a way to add one tile to form a sequence.\n\nHow to implement this?\n\nFor each suit, collect the numbers in that suit. Let's call this list numbers_in_suit.\n\nFor example, for the suit 'p' in the example above, numbers_in_suit is [2,3].\n\nNow, for this list, check if there exists a number x (from 1-9) such that adding x to numbers_in_suit would allow a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n\nHow?\n\nWe can generate all possible triplets of consecutive numbers (like 1-2-3, 2-3-4, etc.) and check if adding x can complete one of them.\n\nFor example, for numbers_in_suit [2,3], the possible triplets that can be completed by adding one tile are:\n\n- 1-2-3: existing numbers have 2,3 → need to add 1.\n\n- 2-3-4: existing numbers have 2,3 → need to add 4.\n\nSo, in this case, adding either 1 or 4 would allow a sequence. So, yes.\n\nSo, for each suit, process the numbers_in_suit and check if there exists any possible x that can complete a sequence.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAn approach is:\n\nFor the numbers_in_suit, sorted as a list. Let's say sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers_in_suit).\n\nThen, for each possible triplet of consecutive numbers, check if adding a tile can complete it.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to check for possible gaps in the sorted_numbers.\n\nFor example, sorted_numbers is [2,3]. The possible gaps are between 2 and 3 (no gap), but the next number after 3 is 4, and before 2 is 1. So, adding 1 or 4 would allow a sequence.\n\nAnother example: sorted_numbers is [1, 3]. Then, adding 2 would allow the sequence 1-2-3.\n\nAnother example: sorted_numbers is [1, 4]. Then, adding 2 would not form a sequence. Adding 2 and 3 would, but that's two tiles. But here, we are looking for adding one tile. So, no.\n\nBut adding 5 would allow 4-5-? No. So, no.\n\nSo, for sorted_numbers, the idea is to check if there exists a possible x that can be added to form a consecutive triplet.\n\nSo, for the numbers_in_suit, sorted as s_list.\n\nIf len(s_list) == 2:\n\nWe can check if the two numbers are consecutive. For example, 2 and 3. Then, adding 1 or 4 would allow a sequence. So, possible.\n\nOr, if the two numbers are not consecutive, like 2 and 4. Then, adding 3 would allow 2-3-4. So, possible.\n\nIf len(s_list) == 1:\n\nThen, adding two numbers would form a sequence, but with one tile added, it's not possible. So, no.\n\nIf len(s_list) == 3:\n\nCheck if they are already consecutive. But that would have been handled in the first check. So, if not, then check if adding one tile can make a sequence. For example, sorted_numbers is [1,2,4]. Then, adding 3 would allow 1-2-3. Or 2-3-4. So, yes.\n\nSo, for len(s_list) == 3:\n\nCheck if there is a gap between any two consecutive numbers that can be filled with one tile.\n\nFor example, [1,2,4] has a gap between 2 and 4 (needs 3). So, adding 3 would allow 1-2-3 or 2-3-4.\n\nAnother example, [1,3,5]. Adding 2 allows 1-2-3. Adding 4 allows 3-4-5. Adding 6 allows 5-6-7 (but no 6 and 7 in the list). So, no. So, adding 2 or 4 would allow a sequence.\n\nSo, for a sorted list of three numbers, check if there exists a gap of 2 between any two consecutive numbers (like 1 and 3 → gap of 2), which can be filled with one tile.\n\nBut also, check if the first number is 1, and the second is 2, and the third is 4. Then, adding 3 would allow 1-2-3.\n\nSo, for the sorted list, check for any i where s_list[i+1] - s_list[i] > 1. Then, check if inserting a number between them would allow a triplet.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, for the sorted list, check if there exists a possible triplet that can be formed with the existing numbers plus one more.\n\nSo, for any possible triplet (a, a+1, a+2), check if the existing numbers in the suit have two of them, and adding the third.\n\nFor example, for the sorted list [1,2,4], check for triplet (1,2,3): existing has 1 and 2. Need 3. So, adding 3.\n\nCheck for triplet (2,3,4): existing has 2 and 4. Need 3. So adding 3.\n\nCheck for triplet (3,4,5): existing has 4. Need 3 and 5. Can't with one tile.\n\nSo, in this case, adding 3 would allow two possible triplets.\n\nSo, for each possible triplet (a, a+1, a+2), check if the existing numbers in the suit have at least two of the three numbers. If so, then adding the third would form a sequence.\n\nSo, for the numbers_in_suit, for each possible triplet (a, a+1, a+2), check if the count of numbers in the existing list that are in the triplet is at least 2. Then, adding the missing one would form the triplet.\n\nSo, how to code this.\n\nFor example:\n\nfor a in range(1, 8):\n\n    triplet = [a, a+1, a+2]\n\n    existing_in_triplet = [num for num in sorted_numbers if num in triplet]\n\n    if len(existing_in_triplet) >= 2:\n\n        # adding the missing one would form a sequence.\n\n        return True\n\nBut how to check if there is exactly one missing number.\n\nWait, for example, existing_in_triplet is [a, a+1]. Then, adding a+2.\n\nOr existing_in_triplet is [a, a+2]. Then, adding a+1.\n\nOr existing_in_triplet is [a+1, a+2]. Then, adding a.\n\nBut for the existing_in_triplet, the length is 2. So, in that case, adding the third number would complete the triplet.\n\nSo, for any triplet (a, a+1, a+2), if the existing numbers in the suit contain exactly two of them, then adding the third would complete the sequence.\n\nSo, for the numbers_in_suit, sorted_numbers, for each possible a from 1 to 7, check if the existing numbers in the suit contain two of the triplet a, a+1, a+2.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, for the sorted_numbers, check if there exists a possible x such that adding x would allow a sequence of three consecutive numbers.\n\nSo, for the sorted_numbers, for each pair of numbers, check if there's a possible x that can be added to form a sequence.\n\nBut this might be complicated.\n\nBut given that the numbers_in_suit can be up to three elements, perhaps it's manageable.\n\nSo, for the numbers_in_suit, sorted as s_list.\n\nIf len(s_list) == 2:\n\n    a, b = s_list[0], s_list[1]\n\n    if b - a == 1:\n\n        # can add a-1 or b+1 (if within 1-9)\n\n        # for example, 2 and 3. Adding 1 or 4.\n\n        # so possible.\n\n        return True\n\n    elif b - a == 2:\n\n        # can add a+1\n\n        return True\n\n    else:\n\n        # e.g., 2 and 4. Then, adding 3 would create 2,3,4.\n\n        # or 2 and 5, then adding 3 or 4. But that would not form a sequence.\n\n        # wait, for example, a=2, b=5. Then adding 3 would allow 2,3,5? No. Not consecutive.\n\n        # So, no.\n\n        # So, only if the difference is 2, then adding the middle number.\n\n        # So, for example, 2 and 4, adding 3.\n\n        # So, yes.\n\n        # So, if the difference is 2, then yes.\n\n        return True\n\n    else:\n\n        # for example, a=2, b=5. Difference is 3. Then, adding any number would not allow a sequence.\n\n        # So, no.\n\n        # So, return False.\n\nWait, no. For example, if the numbers are 2 and ",
