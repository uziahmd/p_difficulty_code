The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each loses, which corresponds to the number of red spots they have.\n\nFirst, let me understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. Each character is R, S, or P. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what each player plays. Then determine who wins, and increment their loss counts accordingly.\n\nBut since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round one by one is impossible. That would take way too long. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key here is to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, so that we can calculate the number of losses in each cycle and multiply by the number of cycles, then add the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think about how the sequences work. For each round, Nikephoros's move is A[i % m], where m is the length of A. Similarly, Polycarpus's move is B[j % k], where k is the length of B. But since the rounds are sequential, for the i-th round (assuming starting from 0?), the indices for A and B would be i mod m and i mod k, respectively.\n\nSo for each round, we can compute the moves of both players, determine the outcome, and count the losses. However, with n up to 2e9, doing this for each round is O(n), which is not feasible.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, the pattern of moves for both players will repeat. So the sequence of outcomes will repeat every LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call this period_length.\n2. For the first period_length rounds, simulate each round and record the number of losses for each player. Let's call these total_a (losses for Nikephoros) and total_b (losses for Polycarpus).\n3. Then, the total number of full periods in n rounds is n // period_length. Multiply total_a and total_b by this number to get the total for all full periods.\n4. Then, compute the remaining rounds: rem = n % period_length. Simulate those rem rounds and add their counts to the totals.\n\nBut wait, what if the period_length is very large? For example, if m and k are both 1000, then LCM(1000, 1000) is 1000, which is manageable. Because m and k are up to 1000, the maximum LCM would be 1000*1000 = 1,000,000. Which is acceptable because even for n=2e9, the number of steps would be 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it period_length.\n- Simulate for period_length rounds, count the number of losses for each player in that period.\n- Multiply by the number of full periods (full = n // period_length)\n- Then simulate the remaining rounds (rem = n % period_length) and add those counts.\n\nBut how to compute LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a, b) = a * b / GCD(a, b). So I need a function to compute GCD. Python has math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, but since m and k are positive, it's okay.\n\nSo first, compute the GCD of m and k, then LCM is m*k // GCD.\n\nNow, for the simulation part:\n\nFor each round in 0 to period_length - 1:\n\n- Get A's move: A[round % m]\n- Get B's move: B[round % k]\n- Determine who wins, and increment the counts.\n\nOnce I have the counts per period, multiply by full periods.\n\nThen, for the remaining rem rounds, do the same for 0 to rem-1.\n\nBut how to handle the simulation for the period_length rounds?\n\nLet me think. For example, if m is 3 and k is 4, then LCM is 12. So for each of 12 rounds, we check the moves.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A string, m = len(A)\n\nRead B string, k = len(B)\n\nCompute period_length = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute full_periods = n // period_length\n\nrem = n % period_length\n\nThen, simulate for period_length rounds, count the number of losses for each player in one period.\n\nThen, total_a = full_periods * a_per_period\n\ntotal_b = full_periods * b_per_period\n\nThen simulate rem rounds, add to total_a and total_b.\n\nBut how to simulate the rounds?\n\nFor each i in 0 to period_length - 1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\ndetermine outcome.\n\nSo for each of these steps, we can loop from 0 to period_length - 1, which is up to 1e6 steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, how to determine the outcome between a_move and b_move.\n\nThe rules:\n\nRock beats scissors (R beats S)\n\nScissors beat paper (S beats P)\n\nPaper beats rock (P beats R)\n\nIf same, draw.\n\nElse, the winner is the one who beats the other.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b):\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a, b) is (R, S) or (S, P) or (P, R): then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a loss (so Nikephoros's loss count is not incremented, but Polycarpus's is incremented by 1).\n\nWait, no. Wait: the loser gets a pinch. So when Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus is the loser, so his count increases by 1. When Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nSo for each round, if a beats b: Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so add 1 to the second number). If b beats a: then Nikephoros gets a spot (add 1 to the first number).\n\nSo for each pair (a, b):\n\nif a == b: nothing.\n\nelse:\n\ncheck if a beats b. If yes: then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nElse, Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nSo how to code that.\n\nWe can have a helper function, or check the combinations.\n\nAlternatively, for a and b, determine the outcome.\n\nAnother approach is to create a dictionary or a lookup table for each possible pair.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot. So Nikephoros's loss count is 0, Polycarpus's is +1.\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nYes. So for each pair, this returns (a_loss, b_loss). So for each round, we add these to the totals.\n\nSo, during the simulation of the period_length rounds, we can accumulate the total_a and total_b per period.\n\nOnce that is done, multiply by full_periods and then add the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, for the code:\n\nImplementing this.\n\nBut let's think about the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\", m = 3.\n\nB is \"RSPP\", k =4.\n\nSo LCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo for 12 rounds, simulate each.\n\nBut the sample input has n=7 rounds. So full_periods is 0, rem=7. So simulate 7 rounds.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nIn the example, the output is 3 and 2.\n\nSo the code needs to process that.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nNow, the code in Python:\n\nRead n from input. But wait, the input format is:\n\nThe first line contains integer n.\n\nSecond line is sequence A.\n\nThird line is sequence B.\n\nBut in the example given, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is read as follows: the first line is n, then the next line is A, then the next line is B. So in the sample input, the first line is 7, then 'RPS', then 'RSPP'.\n\nBut the user provided the input as a list, but in reality, the code should read from stdin. So in code:\n\nRead n as int(input())\n\nThen read A as input().strip()\n\nThen read B as input().strip()\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nimport math\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nThen, m = len(A), k = len(B)\n\nperiod_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\nThen simulate for period_length rounds.\n\nBut for each round from 0 to period_length - 1:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nthen compute the result.\n\nSo, for the code:\n\nThen, for the full periods, multiply the per-period counts by full_periods.\n\nThen for the remaining rem rounds, simulate 0 to rem-1.\n\nSo, the code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\ndef get_result(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return (0, 0)\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return (0, 1)\n\n    else:\n\n        return (1, 0)\n\nlcm = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\n# Now compute per_period_a and per_period_b\n\nper_period_a = 0\n\nper_period_b = 0\n\nfor i in range(lcm):\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    res_a, res_b = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n\n    per_period_a += res_a\n\n    per_period_b += res_b\n\nfull_periods = n // lcm\n\nrem = n % lcm\n\ntotal_a = full_periods * per_period_a\n\ntotal_b = full_periods * per_period_b\n\n# Now process rem rounds\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    a_move = A[i % m]\n\n    b_move = B[i % k]\n\n    res_a, res_b = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n\n    total_a += res_a\n\n    total_b += res_b\n\nprint(total_a, total_b)\n\nWait, but what if the LCM is zero? Well, m and k are at least 1, so LCM is at least 1.\n\nBut let's test the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn =7\n\nA is RPS (m=3)\n\nB is RSPP (k=4)\n\nlcm(3,4) is 12.\n\nfull_periods = 7//12 = 0. rem =7.\n\nSo simulate 7 rounds.\n\nLet me check the sample:\n\nRound 0:\n\ni=0:\n\na_move = A[0%3] = A[0] = R\n\nb_move = B[0%4] = B[0] = R. Draw. (0,0). So no change.\n\nRound 1:\n\ni=1: a is A[1%3]=A[1]=P. B[1%4]=B[1]=S. P vs S: S beats P? Wait, the get_result function says:\n\nif (a is R and b S) or (a S and b P) or (a P and b R) → a wins.\n\nIn this case, a is P, b is S. So (a, b) is P vs S. Which is not in the conditions. Because the condition for a to win is (P and R). So in this case, a is P, b is S. So the code checks if (a == 'P' and b == 'R')? No. So else clause: return (1, 0). Which means that Nikephoros (a) loses, so his count increases by 1. So in this case, the round is P vs S. S beats P. So Nikephoros loses. So the code returns (1, 0). So total_a increases by 1.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the first round was R vs R (draw), then P vs S (Nikephoros loses). So that's the second round. Wait, the sample explanation shows the rounds as:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (so his count increases by 1).\n\nBut according to the code, for i in 0..n-1. So for n=7 rounds, i runs from 0 to 6.\n\nLet me check the sample's rounds:\n\nThe sample says:\n\nRound 1: R-R (draw)\n\nRound 2: P vs S (Nikephoros loses)\n\nRound 3: S vs P (Polycarpus loses)\n\nRound 4: R vs P (Nikephoros loses)\n\nRound 5: P vs R (Polycarpus loses)\n\nRound 6: S vs S (draw)\n\nRound 7: R vs P (Nikephoros loses)\n\nTotal for Nikephoros: 3 losses (rounds 2,4,7). Polycarpus: 2 (rounds 3,5).\n\nSo the code's simulation for rem=7 rounds (i from 0 to 6):\n\nLet me compute each of these 7 rounds.\n\ni from 0 to 6:\n\ni=0:\n\na: A[0%3] = A[0] = R\n\nb: B[0%4] = B[0] = R → draw. (0,0)\n\ni=1:\n\na: A[1%3] = A[1] = P\n\nb: B[1%4] = B[1] = S → P vs S. According to the code, (a is P, b is S). The code checks if (a is R and b S) → no. Or (a S and b P) → no. Or (a P and b R) → no. So else clause. So returns (1, 0). So Nikephoros loses. So total_a +=1.\n\ni=2:\n\na: A[2%3] = A[2] = S\n\nb: B[2%4] = B[2] = P → S vs P. So a is S, b is P. Check if (a S and b P) → yes. So returns (0, 1). So Polycarpus's count increases by 1. So total_b +=1.\n\ni=3:\n\na: A[3%3=0] = R\n\nb: B[3%4=3] = B[3] = P → R vs P. a is R, b is P. So (a R and b P → no. Check if a beats b. The condition is (a R and b S) → no. So else. So returns (1,0). So Nikephoros loses. total_a +=1.\n\ni=4:\n\na: A[4%3=1] = P\n\nb: B[4%4=0] = R → P vs R. a is P, b is R. So (a P and b R → yes. So returns (0,1). So Polycarpus's count increases by 1. total_b +=1.\n\ni=5:\n\na: A[5%3=2] = S\n\nb: B[5%4=1] = S → S vs S → draw. (0,0).\n\ni=6:\n\na: A[6%3=0] = R\n\nb: B[6%4=2] = P → R vs P. So again, Nikephoros loses. (1,0). total_a +=1.\n\nSo after 7 rounds:\n\ntotal_a is 1 (i=1) + 1 (i=3) + 1 (i=6) → total 3.\n\ntotal_b is 1 (i=2) + 1 (i=4) → total 2. Which matches the sample output. So the code works for the sample.\n\nAnother sample input is the second example:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo n=5, A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8), B is \"R\" (k=1). LCM(8, 1) is 8.\n\nfull_periods = 5 // 8 = 0. rem=5.\n\nsimulate 5 rounds.\n\nEach round, A's move is R (since i%8 for i from 0 to 4 is 0,1,2,3,4 → all R. B's move is R (since i%1 is 0 for all i). So all rounds are draws. So total_a and total_b are 0. Hence output is 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about edge cases?\n\nCase where n is 0? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1.\n\nAnother case: when m or k is 1.\n\nAnother case: when the sequences are same, and same length. For example, A and B are same. So all rounds are draws.\n\nAnother case: when one sequence is longer than the other.\n\nBut the code should handle all of that.\n\nNow, the code's time complexity is O(lcm(m, k)) which is up to 1e6 steps. For m and k up to 1000, LCM can be up to 1e6. So for each test case, it's acceptable.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, for very large numbers, the code may take some time, but given that 1e6 steps are manageable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplement compute_lcm as a helper function.\n\nBut in Python, math.gcd exists. Also, note that for Python versions, but assuming that it's available.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def get_result(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return (0, 0)\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            return (0, 1)\n        else:\n            return (1, 0)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    lcm = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    per_period_a = 0\n    per_period_b = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        res_a, res_b = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n        per_period_a += res_a\n        per_period_b += res_b\n    \n    full_periods = n // lcm\n    rem = n % lcm\n    \n    total_a = full_periods * per_period_a\n    total_b = full_periods * per_period_b\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        res_a, res_b = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n        total_a += res_a\n        total_b += res_b\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the code, the compute_lcm is inside the main function. But that's okay.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample:\n\nn=7, A=RPS, B=RSPP.\n\nAs discussed, code returns 3 2.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=5, A=RRRRRRRR, B=R.\n\nOutput 0 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A=R, B=S. Then the result is (1,0). So output is 1 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, A=R, B=R. Output is 0 0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, A=RS, B=RP. Let's compute:\n\nlcm(2,2)=2.\n\nfor i=0:\n\nA[0%2]=R, B[0%2]=R → draw.\n\ni=1:\n\nA[1%2]=S, B[1%2]=P → S vs P → a wins. So (0,1). So per_period_a is 0, per_period_b is 1.\n\nfull_periods = 2//2=1. rem=0.\n\nso total_a is 0 *1 =0, total_b is 1*1=1. So output 0 1.\n\nBut for n=2, the two rounds are R vs R (draw) and S vs P (a wins). So Polycarpus has 1 loss. So output is 0 1. Correct.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code should be written as per the problem's instructions.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. Given the constraints, a direct simulation of all rounds is infeasible, so we use a more efficient approach leveraging the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Game Rules**: Each player uses a cyclic sequence of moves. The winner of each round is determined by standard rock-paper-scissors rules.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The sequences of moves for both players repeat every LCM of the lengths of their respective sequences. This allows us to compute results for one full cycle and then extrapolate for the total number of rounds.\n3. **Simulation of One Cycle**: Calculate the number of losses for each player over one full cycle of the LCM length.\n4. **Extrapolation**: Multiply the results from one cycle by the number of complete cycles in the total number of rounds. Then simulate any remaining rounds after the complete cycles.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def get_result(a, b):\n        if a == b:\n            return (0, 0)\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            return (0, 1)\n        else:\n            return (1, 0)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    lcm = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    per_period_a = 0\n    per_period_b = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        res_a, res_b = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n        per_period_a += res_a\n        per_period_b += res_b\n    \n    full_periods = n // lcm\n    rem = n % lcm\n    \n    total_a = full_periods * per_period_a\n    total_b = full_periods * per_period_b\n    \n    for i in range(rem):\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n        res_a, res_b = get_result(a_move, b_move)\n        total_a += res_a\n        total_b += res_b\n    \n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds and the two sequences of moves for each player.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences determines the period after which both sequences repeat their moves.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: For each round within one LCM period, we determine the outcome and accumulate the number of losses for each player.\n4. **Full Periods and Remainder**: Calculate the number of full periods and the remaining rounds. Use the results from one cycle to compute the total losses for all full periods and simulate the remaining rounds separately.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles up to 2 billion rounds by reducing the problem size using the periodicity of the sequences, ensuring optimal performance even for large inputs.",
