The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence of moves that they cycle through. I have to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., loses a round).\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then two lines for sequences A and B. Each character is R, S, or P. For each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what move each player makes, then check who wins.\n\nBut since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round one by one is impossible. That would take way too long. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nSo the key here is to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, so that we can calculate the number of losses in each cycle and multiply by the number of cycles, plus the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think. For each round, the move of Nikephoros (A) is determined by the index modulo m (the length of A). Similarly for Polycarpus (B) it's index modulo k. So for each round i (starting from 0?), the moves are A[i % m] and B[i % k].\n\nBut since the sequences A and B are cyclic, the combination of their moves will repeat after LCM(m, k) rounds. Because LCM(m, k) is the least common multiple of m and k. So the pattern of moves for both players repeats every LCM(m, k) rounds.\n\nSo the idea is: compute the number of losses for each player in one full cycle (of length LCM(m, k)), then multiply by the number of full cycles in n rounds. Then handle the remaining rounds (n mod LCM(m, k)).\n\nBut wait, what if LCM(m, k) is larger than n? Then there's no full cycles, but just the partial part.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute the LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length.\n\n2. For each of the first cycle_length rounds, compute the moves for A and B, check who wins, and count the number of losses for each player in this cycle.\n\n3. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n\n4. The remaining rounds are rem = n % cycle_length.\n\n5. So total losses for each player is total_cycles * (losses_in_cycle_A, losses_in_cycle_B) plus the losses in the first rem rounds of the cycle.\n\nBut how do I compute the losses in the first cycle_length rounds?\n\nBut for cycle_length, since m and k can be up to 1000, their LCM could be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000 is 1e6). Wait, 1000 and 1000 have LCM 1000. But for example, if m and k are coprime, then LCM(m, k) is m*k. So for m and k up to 1000, LCM(m, k) can be up to 1e6. So for each cycle_length, which is up to 1e6, we can simulate all the rounds once. Even for n up to 2e9, this is manageable because 1e6 is acceptable for a loop.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nCalculate the LCM of m and k.\n\nThen, simulate all the rounds in one cycle (cycle_length rounds), count the number of times each player loses in that cycle.\n\nThen, multiply by the number of full cycles (total_cycles) and add the counts from the remaining rounds.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\nCompute the number of losses in a single cycle (cycle_length rounds) and the number of losses in the first rem rounds of the cycle.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute the LCM. Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So I need to compute GCD first.\n\nImplementing GCD can be done with Euclidean algorithm.\n\nSo first, code for GCD:\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\nThen LCM is (m * k) // gcd(m, k).\n\nOnce I have that, I can proceed.\n\nNow, for each round in the cycle_length rounds, I need to get the move of A and B.\n\nFor example, for round i (starting from 0?), the move of A is A[i % m], and B is B[i % k].\n\nBut for the cycle_length, since it's LCM(m, k), then after that, the pattern repeats. So for i from 0 to cycle_length - 1, the moves for A and B will be the same as for i + cycle_length.\n\nSo for each i in 0..cycle_length-1, compute the moves and check who wins.\n\nSo for each such i, we can compute the move of A and B, then determine if A wins, B wins, or draw.\n\nFor each of those, increment the counts for the respective losses.\n\nOnce we have the counts for a full cycle, then multiply by the number of full cycles (total_cycles) and add the counts from the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, for the remaining rem rounds, we can simulate each of the first rem rounds (i from 0 to rem-1) and compute the same way.\n\nBut how to compute the total for the full cycles and the remainder.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A string, m = len(A)\n\nRead B string, k = len(B)\n\nCompute LCM of m and k.\n\nCompute cycle_length = LCM(m, k)\n\nCompute total_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nrem = n % cycle_length\n\nThen compute:\n\nlosses_in_cycle_A = number of times A loses in one cycle.\n\nlosses_in_cycle_B = number of times B loses in one cycle.\n\nThen compute the total for full cycles: total_A = total_cycles * losses_in_cycle_A, total_B = total_cycles * losses_in_cycle_B.\n\nThen compute the losses in the first rem rounds (call them rem_A and rem_B) and add to total_A and total_B.\n\nSo the problem becomes how to compute the losses_in_cycle_A, losses_in_cycle_B, rem_A, rem_B.\n\nNow, how to compute these values.\n\nFor the cycle_length rounds, we can loop from 0 to cycle_length - 1, and for each i, get A's move and B's move.\n\nFor each i:\n\na_move = A[i % m]\n\nb_move = B[i % k]\n\nThen determine who wins.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), we can check:\n\nif a == b: draw, no loss.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a beats b) then B loses, so Nikephoros (A) wins, so Polycarpus (B) gets a spot. So increment B's loss count.\n\nElse, A loses, so Nikephoros (A) gets a spot. So increment A's loss count.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nThe loser gets pinched. So for each round, if there's a winner, the loser is the one who gets a red spot.\n\nSo for example, if A plays R and B plays S: R beats S, so B loses. So Nikephoros (A) wins, so B gets a spot. So Nikephoros's count (number of red spots) is incremented by 0, and Polycarpus's count is incremented by 1.\n\nWait, the output is two numbers: the number of red spots on Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n\nSo when Nikephoros loses, he gets a spot. When Polycarpus loses, he gets a spot.\n\nSo for each round:\n\nif A wins: B loses → Polycarpus's count increases by 1.\n\nif B wins: A loses → Nikephoros's count increases by 1.\n\nif draw: nothing.\n\nSo during the simulation, for each round, we check which case it is.\n\nSo for each i in 0 to cycle_length - 1:\n\ncompute a = A[i%m], b = B[i%k]\n\nif a == b: continue.\n\nelse:\n\ndetermine if a beats b.\n\nif a beats b: then B loses → Polycarpus's count +=1.\n\nelse: A loses → Nikephoros's count +=1.\n\nSo for the cycle, we can compute for each of the cycle_length rounds, and accumulate the counts.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows:\n\ndef compute_loss_counts(cycle_length, A, m, B, k):\n\n    a_losses = 0\n\n    b_losses = 0\n\n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n\n        a_move = A[i % m]\n\n        b_move = B[i % k]\n\n        if a_move == b_move:\n\n            continue\n\n        # determine who wins\n\n        if (a_move == 'R' and b_move == 'S') or (a_move == 'S' and b_move == 'P') or (a_move == 'P' and b_move == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B loses\n\n            b_losses +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A loses\n\n            a_losses +=1\n\n    return a_losses, b_losses\n\nWait, but for the code, the function would need to return the number of times A lost (so Nikephoros's spots) and B lost (Polycarpus's spots).\n\nSo for the cycle, we can compute a_losses and b_losses.\n\nThen, for the full cycles, multiply by total_cycles.\n\nThen, for the rem rounds, we can do the same, but only for the first rem rounds.\n\nSo for the rem rounds, we can loop from i=0 to rem-1, and compute the same way.\n\nSo putting it all together.\n\nBut for the case where cycle_length is 0? No, m and k are at least 1, so LCM is >=1.\n\nNow, considering the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\", m=3.\n\nB is \"RSPP\", k=4.\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo for 7 rounds, total_cycles = 7 // 12 = 0, rem=7.\n\nSo simulate 7 rounds.\n\nLet me check the sample explanation.\n\nThe rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → P is paper, S is scissors. Scissors beats paper. So B wins. A loses. So Nikephoros (A) gets a spot. So a_losses +=1.\n\nWait, the sample says that in the first sample, Nikephoros has 3 losses and Polycarpus 2.\n\nWait, the sample input is:\n\nThe first input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is RPS (m=3). So for each round, the sequence is R, P, S, R, P, S, R, etc.\n\nB is RSPP (k=4). So sequence is R, S, P, P, R, S, P, P, etc.\n\nSo for the 7 rounds:\n\nRound 1: i=0 → A[0%3] = R, B[0%4] = R → draw.\n\nRound 2: i=1 → A[1%3] = P, B[1%4] = S → P vs S. S beats P. So B wins. A loses. So Nikephoros (A) has a spot. So a_losses +=1.\n\nRound 3: i=2 → A[2%3] = S, B[2%4] = P. S vs P. S beats P. A wins. B loses. So b_losses +=1.\n\nRound 4: i=3 → A[0%3] = R, B[3%4] = P. R vs P. P beats R. B wins. A loses. a_losses +=1.\n\nRound 5: i=4 → A[1%3] = P, B[4%4=0] → R. P vs R. P beats R. A wins. B loses. b_losses +=1.\n\nRound 6: i=5 → A[5%3=2] → S, B[5%4=1] → S. Draw.\n\nRound 7: i=6 → A[6%3=0] → R, B[6%4=2] → P. R vs P. B wins. A loses. a_losses +=1.\n\nSo total a_losses is 3 (rounds 2,4,7), and b_losses is 2 (rounds 3,5). Which matches the sample output of 3 2.\n\nSo the code for the rem rounds would correctly calculate that.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nBut for large n, say 2e9, and cycle_length up to 1e6, then the code for computing the cycle is O(1e6) which is acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nFirst, read the input. But the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is A.\n\nThird line is B.\n\nWait, the input in the sample is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, perhaps the input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n, then the second line is A, third line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first line is 7, then the second line is RPS, third line is RSPP.\n\nSo in code, read n as integer, then read A as input().strip(), then read B as input().strip().\n\nSo code:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nThen compute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute the LCM.\n\nThen compute cycle_length.\n\nThen compute the a_cycle_loss and b_cycle_loss for the full cycle.\n\nThen compute total_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n\nrem = n % cycle_length.\n\nThen compute the a_rem_loss and b_rem_loss for the first rem rounds.\n\nTotal a = total_cycles * a_cycle_loss + a_rem_loss.\n\nSame for b.\n\nSo the code can be structured as follows.\n\nBut how to compute the LCM.\n\nImplementing GCD and LCM.\n\nNow, code:\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n\n    while b:\n\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\nBut note that for Python 3, the division is integer division.\n\nSo, m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\ncycle_length = lcm(m, k)\n\nBut for m and k up to 1e3, their LCM is up to 1e6, which is manageable.\n\nNow, the code for calculating the losses in the cycle and the rem.\n\nSo, for the full cycle:\n\ndef get_losses(cycle_length, A, m, B, k):\n\n    a_loss = 0\n\n    b_loss = 0\n\n    for i in range(cycle_length):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B loses\n\n            b_loss +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A loses\n\n            a_loss +=1\n\n    return a_loss, b_loss\n\nBut for the rem rounds, we can do the same, but for rem rounds.\n\nSo:\n\ndef get_partial_losses(num_rounds, A, m, B, k):\n\n    a_loss = 0\n\n    b_loss = 0\n\n    for i in range(num_rounds):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            # A wins, B loses\n\n            b_loss +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            # B wins, A loses\n\n            a_loss +=1\n\n    return a_loss, b_loss\n\nBut in code, we can use the same code for both cases.\n\nSo, in the code:\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\ncycle_length = lcm(m, k)\n\ntotal_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nrem = n % cycle_length\n\nThen:\n\nif cycle_length == 0:\n\n    ... but m and k are at least 1, so no.\n\nSo compute a_cycle_loss, b_cycle_loss = get_losses(cycle_length, A, m, B, k)\n\nThen, a_rem_loss, b_rem_loss = get_partial_losses(rem, A, m, B, k)\n\ntotal_a = total_cycles * a_cycle_loss + a_rem_loss\n\ntotal_b = total_cycles * b_cycle_loss + b_rem_loss\n\nprint(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut wait, what if cycle_length is zero? Well, no, since m and k are at least 1.\n\nBut what if n is zero? Well, according to the problem statement, n is at least 1.\n\nSo the code should handle that.\n\nNow, testing the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=7\n\nA = RPS (m=3)\n\nB = RSPP (k=4)\n\ncycle_length = LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\ntotal_cycles = 7//12 = 0. rem=7.\n\nSo compute a_cycle_loss and b_cycle_loss for 12 rounds, but since total_cycles is zero, it's not used. Then compute rem=7 rounds.\n\nWhich gives the a_rem_loss = 3, b_rem_loss = 2. So output is 3 2.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother sample is the second example:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (m=8), B is \"R\" (k=1).\n\nLCM(8,1) is 8.\n\nn=5 rounds.\n\ntotal_cycles = 5//8=0, rem=5.\n\nSo simulate 5 rounds.\n\nEach round:\n\nA's move is R (since i%8 is 0,1,2,3,4 for i=0-4, all R.\n\nB's move is R (i%1 is 0 for all i).\n\nSo all rounds are draws. So a_rem_loss and b_rem_loss are 0. Output 0 0.\n\nWhich matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: when n is exactly equal to cycle_length.\n\nSo for example, n=12, then total_cycles is 1, rem=0. So the total is a_cycle_loss and b_cycle_loss.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's think about the code's efficiency.\n\nFor m and k up to 1e3, the LCM can be up to 1e6. So for each cycle_length, the get_losses function runs in O(1e6) time. Which is acceptable.\n\nFor n up to 2e9, but the code is O(1e6) for the cycle_length, and O(rem) for the remainder, which is up to 1e6. So overall, O(1e6) time.\n\nWhich is acceptable.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut for very large n, but the code is okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nImplementing the functions.\n\nBut in Python, for very large numbers, but the code is okay.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m, k.\n\nCompute LCM.\n\nThen compute the cycle losses and rem losses.\n\nBut in code, the code for get_losses and get_partial_losses can be combined into one function, but for code brevity, perhaps write it as a helper function.\n\nBut for code, perhaps write:\n\ndef compute_losses(num_rounds, A, m, B, k):\n\n    a_loss = 0\n\n    b_loss = 0\n\n    for i in range(num_rounds):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            b_loss +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            a_loss +=1\n\n    return a_loss, b_loss\n\nThen, for the cycle_length, compute a_cycle, b_cycle = compute_losses(cycle_length, A, m, B, k)\n\nAnd for rem, compute a_rem, b_rem = compute_losses(rem, A, m, B, k)\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n\n    while b:\n\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    cycle_length = lcm(m, k)\n\n    # Compute the losses in one cycle\n\n    a_cycle, b_cycle = compute_losses(cycle_length, A, m, B, k)\n\n    total_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\n    rem = n % cycle_length\n\n    a_rem, b_rem = compute_losses(rem, A, m, B, k)\n\n    total_a = total_cycles * a_cycle + a_rem\n\n    total_b = total_cycles * b_cycle + b_rem\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nBut wait, the function compute_losses is not defined. So need to define it.\n\nBut in Python, functions can be inside the main function? Or perhaps, define it inside.\n\nBut in code, the code must be written as a script.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef compute_losses(num_rounds, A, m, B, k):\n\n    a_loss = 0\n\n    b_loss = 0\n\n    for i in range(num_rounds):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            b_loss +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            a_loss +=1\n\n    return a_loss, b_loss\n\nBut in code, the functions need to be defined.\n\nPutting it all together.\n\nBut what if the cycle_length is 0? Well, since m and k are at least 1, the LCM is at least 1.\n\nNow, testing.\n\nBut for the sample input, the code works.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, the function compute_losses is called twice.\n\nBut for the case where cycle_length is 1e6, and rem is 1e6, then the code will run in O(2e6) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nBut for Python, even 1e6 steps are acceptable.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the code, the main function needs to be called.\n\nBut in Python, the code is:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef gcd(a, b):\n\n    while b:\n\n        a, b = b, a % b\n\n    return a\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\ndef compute_losses(num_rounds, A, m, B, k):\n\n    a_loss = 0\n\n    b_loss = 0\n\n    for i in range(num_rounds):\n\n        a = A[i % m]\n\n        b = B[i % k]\n\n        if a == b:\n\n            continue\n\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n            b_loss +=1\n\n        else:\n\n            a_loss +=1\n\n    return a_loss, b_loss\n\ndef main():\n\n    n = int(input())\n\n    A = input().strip()\n\n    B = input().strip()\n\n    m = len(A)\n\n    k = len(B)\n\n    cycle_length = lcm(m, k)\n\n    a_cycle, b_cycle = compute_losses(cycle_length, A, m, B, k)\n\n    total_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\n    rem = n % cycle_length\n\n    a_rem, b_rem = compute_losses(rem, A, m, B, k)\n\n    total_a = total_cycles * a_cycle + a_rem\n\n    total_b = total_cycles * b_cycle + b_rem\n\n    print(total_a, total_b)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nWait, but for the case when cycle_length is 0? But m and k are at least 1, so cycle_length is at least 1.\n\nBut what if m or k is 0? But according to the problem statement, m and k are between 1 and 1000.\n\nYes, since the input says that the sequences are given as strings of length m and k, which are at least 1.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, testing the first sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThe code computes cycle_length as LCM(3,4)=12.\n\ncompute_losses(12, ...) will process 12 rounds. Then total_cycles is 0, rem is 7. compute_losses(7, ...) gives the correct 3 and 2.\n\nThus, the code outputs 3 2.\n\nAnother sample input is:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nWhich gives cycle_length = LCM(8,1)=8. n=5, rem=5. compute_losses(5, ...) gives 0,0. So output 0 0.\n\nAnother test case: n=12, A=RPS, B=RSPP. Then total_cycles is 1, rem=0. So compute the 12 rounds. Let's see what the code returns.\n\nBut for the 12 rounds, what's the total a_cycle and b_cycle?\n\nWell, for each of the 12 rounds, we can compute.\n\nBut perhaps it's tedious, but the code would handle it.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: n=1, A is 'R', B is 'R'. Output is 0 0.\n\nEdge case 2: n=1, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then A wins. So B loses. Output 0 1.\n\nEdge case 3: n=2, A is 'R', B is 'S'. Then for 2 rounds, each round A wins. So B has 2 losses. Output 0 2.\n\nAnother case: A is 'R', B is 'P'. Then B wins. So A has 1 loss per round.\n\nSo code should handle that.\n\nAnother case: when the cycle_length is 1. For example, A is 'R', B is 'R'. Then cycle_length is 1. For n=2e9, the code will compute total_cycles = 2e9, and rem=0. So the code returns 0 and 0.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python.\n\nBut what about the time constraints? For m and k up to 1000, the LCM can be up to 1e6, and for each compute_losses, it's O(1e6) steps. So for two calls, O(2e6) steps, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nThus, the code should pass all test cases.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently handle up to 2 billion rounds by leveraging the cyclical nature of the players' strategies.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every `k` rounds. The combined cycle of both sequences will repeat every `LCM(m, k)` rounds, where LCM is the least common multiple of `m` and `k`.\n\n2. **Cycle Calculation**: Calculate the LCM of the lengths of the two sequences to determine the length of the combined cycle. This helps in breaking down the problem into manageable parts.\n\n3. **Simulate One Cycle**: Compute the number of losses for each player during one full cycle of length `LCM(m, k)`.\n\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Determine how many full cycles fit into the total number of rounds and handle the remaining rounds separately. This allows us to compute the total losses efficiently without simulating each round individually.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\ndef compute_losses(num_rounds, A, m, B, k):\n    a_loss = 0\n    b_loss = 0\n    for i in range(num_rounds):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            b_loss += 1\n        else:\n            a_loss += 1\n    return a_loss, b_loss\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    A = input[1]\n    B = input[2]\n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    cycle_length = lcm(m, k)\n    a_cycle, b_cycle = compute_losses(cycle_length, A, m, B, k)\n    total_cycles = n // cycle_length\n    rem = n % cycle_length\n    a_rem, b_rem = compute_losses(rem, A, m, B, k)\n    total_a = total_cycles * a_cycle + a_rem\n    total_b = total_cycles * b_cycle + b_rem\n    print(f\"{total_a} {total_b}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read and parsed into the number of rounds `n`, and the sequences `A` and `B`.\n\n2. **GCD and LCM Calculation**: The GCD and LCM functions are used to determine the length of the combined cycle of both players' strategies.\n\n3. **Loss Calculation**: The `compute_losses` function calculates the number of losses for each player over a given number of rounds. This function is used twice: once for the full cycle and once for the remaining rounds after accounting for full cycles.\n\n4. **Combining Results**: The total number of losses is computed by multiplying the losses per full cycle by the number of full cycles and adding the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the cyclical nature of the strategies, ensuring that the solution is both optimal and scalable.",
