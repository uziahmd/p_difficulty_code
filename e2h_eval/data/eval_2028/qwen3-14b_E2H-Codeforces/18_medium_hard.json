The frog has two positive integers $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$. From a position $$$k$$$, it can either jump to position $$$k+a$$$ or $$$k-b$$$.Let $$$f(x)$$$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $$$[0, x]$$$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $$$0$$$.Given an integer $$$m$$$, find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$$$. That is, find the sum of all $$$f(i)$$$ for $$$i$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$m$$$.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains three integers $$$m, a, b$$$ ($$$1 \\leq m \\leq 10^9, 1 \\leq a,b \\leq 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer, the desired sum.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 5 3', '1000000000 1 2019', '100 100000 1', '6 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['19', '500000001500000001', '101', '10']\n\n## Note\nIn the first example, we must find $$$f(0)+f(1)+\\ldots+f(7)$$$. We have $$$f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$$$. The sum of these values is $$$19$$$.In the second example, we have $$$f(i) = i+1$$$, so we want to find $$$\\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$$$.In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem says that a frog starts at 0 and can jump either +a or -b. But the frog can't step outside [0, x] for a given x. For each i from 0 to m, compute f(i) which is the number of distinct positions reachable under that constraint, then sum all those f(i)s.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what f(x) represents. The frog can reach positions by making any number of jumps, but each time it can't go beyond 0 or x. So for each x, we have to find all positions reachable by the frog under these constraints.\n\nBut how do we model the reachable positions? Let's think about the possible positions the frog can reach without any restrictions. The frog can reach any position that is a linear combination of a and b, but since the frog can only add a or subtract b. Wait, but the frog can make multiple jumps. So the positions reachable are those that can be written as k*a - l*b, where k and l are non-negative integers. However, since the frog starts at 0, maybe the positions are all numbers of the form (k*a - l*b), but with the constraints that during the jumps, the frog never steps outside [0, x].\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to model this using the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b. Let me think. If the frog can reach any multiple of gcd(a,b), but that's under the assumption that there's no restriction on the positions. But here, the restrictions are that the frog can't go below 0 or above x. So maybe the reachable positions are all numbers in some arithmetic progression, but constrained within [0, x].\n\nWait, but even with the constraints, the positions reachable would be all numbers that are congruent to 0 modulo d, where d is gcd(a, b). Because adding and subtracting multiples of a and b allows you to reach any multiple of their gcd. However, the frog can't go beyond x or below 0. So for each x, the reachable positions are the numbers between 0 and x that are multiples of d, but also can be reached through the allowed jumps without stepping outside the interval.\n\nBut maybe there's more to it. For example, if a and b are not coprime, then the reachable positions are multiples of their gcd. But even so, the frog can't reach every such multiple. For example, suppose a=5 and b=3. Their gcd is 1, so in theory, any integer can be reached. But when x is small, like 5, maybe the frog can't reach all positions. Let's take the first example: when x=5, the frog can reach 0, 5 (by jumping +a once), and 5-3=2 (so jumping +a then -b). Then from 2, can you jump again? Let's see: 2+5=7, which is larger than x=5, so that's invalid. Or 2-3=-1, which is invalid. So the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. So f(5)=3. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the key seems to be that the frog can reach positions that are multiples of d = gcd(a, b), but under certain conditions. However, the problem is that even though a number is a multiple of d, the frog might not be able to reach it because of the constraints on the path (i.e., during the jumps, it can't go outside [0,x]).\n\nBut how do we model this?\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of the possible positions. Let's say that d = gcd(a, b). Then, the reachable positions must be multiples of d. Let's denote a = d * a', b = d * b', where gcd(a', b') = 1. Then, the problem reduces to the case where a' and b' are coprime. Because any reachable position is a multiple of d.\n\nSo, for the rest of the analysis, let's assume that d=1. Because if d is not 1, we can divide everything by d. Let me think: the positions reachable are multiples of d. So for the problem, we can model the problem as a' and b' being coprime, and considering the positions divided by d. Then, the problem becomes equivalent to the original problem with a' and b', and the reachable positions are the ones that are multiples of d. So the number of reachable positions in [0, x] would be equal to the number of reachable positions in [0, x/d] for the a' and b' case multiplied by d? Not sure. Maybe I need to adjust the problem accordingly.\n\nBut perhaps the main idea is that the reachable positions are all numbers that are congruent to 0 mod d. But even then, the frog may not be able to reach them all because of the constraints of the path. For example, in the first sample, d=1, and a=5, b=3. The frog can reach 0, 2, 5, etc. But for x=7, the answer is 8. Let's see: the positions are 0, 2, 5, 7 (from 5+2?), but wait. Let me think again.\n\nIn the first example, when x=7, the frog can reach positions:\n\nStarting from 0, you can jump to 5 (0+5) or -3 (invalid). Then from 5, you can jump to 5+5=10 (invalid) or 5-3=2. From 2, you can jump to 2+5=7 (valid) or 2-3=-1 (invalid). From 7, you can jump to 7+5=12 (invalid) or 7-3=4. From 4, you can jump to 4+5=9 (invalid) or 4-3=1. From 1, you can jump to 1+5=6 (valid) or 1-3=-2 (invalid). From 6, you can jump to 6+5=11 (invalid) or 6-3=3. From 3, you can jump to 3+5=8 (invalid) or 3-3=0. So the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5, 7, 4, 1, 6, 3. That's 8 positions, which matches the sample. All of them are multiples of 1 (which is d in this case). So for x=7, the number of reachable positions is 8.\n\nSo the key is that once the frog can reach a position, it can reach others via combinations of adding a and subtracting b. But the problem is that even if a number is congruent to 0 mod d, the frog may not be able to reach it because of the constraints on the path.\n\nBut how do we find for a given x, the number of positions reachable?\n\nLet me think about the case when a and b are coprime. Let's assume that d=1. Then, the frog can reach any integer that can be expressed as a linear combination of a and b, but with coefficients such that the path doesn't go out of [0, x]. However, since the frog can move forward and backward, perhaps the set of positions reachable is all integers between 0 and x that are congruent to 0 mod d (which is 1 here), but that's not necessarily true. Wait, but since a and b are coprime, the frog can reach any integer eventually. However, the constraints of not going outside [0, x] complicate things.\n\nBut in the example where a=5, b=3, which are coprime, the frog can reach positions like 0, 2, 5, 7, etc. So for x=7, the maximum reachable is 7. But why can't the frog reach 1? Well, in the example, it can reach 1. Oh right, because from 4, subtracting 3 gives 1. So the frog can reach 1. So in that case, all numbers from 0 to x (assuming x is large enough) are reachable? But that's not the case. Wait, for example, if x is 4. Then, the frog can reach 0, 5 (but that's over x=4, so not allowed), so only 0, 2, and 4? Wait, no. Let me think again. How does the frog reach 4?\n\nIf x is 4, then the frog can't jump to 5. So from 0, the frog can only jump to 5 (invalid) or -3 (invalid). So the only reachable position is 0. So f(4) would be 1. But according to the sample input, when x=4, f(4)=1. Which matches.\n\nSo for x=4, the frog can't reach any other positions except 0. But when x is 5, it can reach 0, 5, 2. When x is 6, then from 2, you can jump to 7 (invalid) or 2-3=-1 (invalid). From 5, you can jump to 5-3=2 (already there) or 5+5=10 (invalid). So in x=6, the reachable positions are 0, 2,5. So f(6)=3. But according to the sample, f(6) is 3. So for x=6, the frog can't reach 4, 1, etc. So even though a and b are coprime, the frog can't reach all numbers up to x. So what's the pattern here?\n\nHmm. Maybe the key is to find the minimal steps required to reach certain positions, but that seems computationally expensive for large x.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the problem in terms of BFS. For each x, perform a BFS starting from 0, and track all positions reachable without going out of [0, x]. But since m can be up to 1e9, this approach is impossible for large m. So we need a mathematical formula or pattern that can be computed quickly.\n\nBut how to find f(x) for arbitrary x?\n\nLet me consider the case where a and b are coprime. Let's say that the frog can reach any number >= some value. For example, in the classic coin problem, the largest amount that cannot be formed with coins of denominations a and b (coprime) is ab - a - b. But in our case, the frog can move both directions. So maybe the reachable positions are all numbers greater than or equal to some value. But how does this apply when the frog is restricted to [0, x]?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows. Since the frog can move forward by a or backward by b, the problem resembles a graph where nodes are positions, and edges are transitions. The frog can reach a position if there's a path from 0 to it without stepping outside [0, x].\n\nBut again, for large x, this is not feasible to compute directly. So we need to find a pattern or formula for f(x).\n\nAnother thought: The frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d. Let me focus on that. Suppose that d = gcd(a, b). Then, the positions reachable are multiples of d. So for each x, the maximum possible number of positions is floor(x / d) + 1 (since 0, d, 2d, ... up to kd where kd ≤ x). But this is only possible if the frog can reach all those positions. But in reality, the frog may not be able to reach all of them due to the constraints of the path.\n\nSo the problem reduces to determining for each multiple of d (let's call it k*d) whether it is reachable, given that the frog can't step outside [0, x]. But how?\n\nLet me consider the case where d=1, and a and b are coprime. Let's think of the problem as a graph where each node is a position. The frog can move from k to k+a or k-b, provided that the new position is between 0 and x.\n\nBut for a given x, the reachable positions are those that can be reached by moving forward and backward, without stepping out of bounds. Now, perhaps once the frog can reach a certain position, it can reach all positions beyond that. For example, in the first sample, when x is large enough, the frog can reach all positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a BFS where the frog can move forward or backward. However, for large x, this approach is not feasible. So perhaps we can model the problem in terms of the minimal steps required to reach certain positions.\n\nBut perhaps there's a way to find for each x, the minimal number of steps required to reach each position. But again, for large x, this seems unmanageable.\n\nAnother angle: Let's consider that the frog can reach any position that is a multiple of d, and that is ≥ some value. For example, once the frog can reach a certain position, it can generate more positions by adding a or subtracting b. But this depends on the values of a and b.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem as follows: the frog can reach any position that is in the set S = {0, a, 2a, ..., k*a} ∪ {positions generated by subtracting b steps from these positions, ensuring they are ≥0}.\n\nBut again, how to model this for general x?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to find the minimal value of x such that all multiples of d up to x are reachable. Once x is larger than that threshold, all multiples of d up to x are reachable. Then, for x less than that threshold, some positions are not reachable.\n\nLet me think of the case where a and b are coprime. Then, the largest number that cannot be expressed as a linear combination of a and b with non-negative coefficients is ab - a - b. However, in our case, the frog can use negative coefficients (by subtracting b steps). So maybe the problem is different.\n\nWait, the frog can move forward and backward. For example, if the frog can reach a position k, then it can reach k + a, provided that it's within x. Also, it can reach k - b, provided that it's ≥0. So the frog can reach positions in both directions. This makes the problem different from the classic coin problem.\n\nLet me think of the problem as a graph where each node is a position. The frog can move from k to k+a or k-b. The question is, for a given x, what is the number of nodes reachable from 0 in this graph, with the constraint that all positions in the path are between 0 and x.\n\nNow, the key observation here is that the frog can reach any position that is congruent to 0 mod d, where d is gcd(a,b). So for the rest of the analysis, let's assume that d=1. Because otherwise, we can divide a and b by d, and the problem becomes equivalent to the case where d=1, but scaled by d.\n\nSo let's proceed under the assumption that a and b are coprime. Then, the reachable positions are all integers that are in [0, x], and can be reached via some combination of +a and -b steps, without leaving the interval [0, x].\n\nNow, the question is, how to find the number of such positions for a given x.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each x, the number of reachable positions is equal to the number of integers in [0, x] that can be written as a linear combination of a and b with coefficients such that the path is always within [0, x]. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think recursively. The frog can reach 0. From 0, it can jump to a (if a <=x). From a, it can jump to a+a=2a (if 2a <=x), or a - b (if a -b >=0). Similarly for other positions.\n\nBut again, for large x, this approach is not feasible.\n\nAlternative idea: For a given x, the reachable positions are all numbers in [0, x] that are congruent to 0 mod d (which is 1 here) and are ≥ (some value). For example, once the frog can reach a certain position, it can reach all positions beyond that by adding a's and subtracting b's. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, in the first example, when a=5 and b=3, and x=7, the reachable positions are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Wait, no, according to the sample, when x=7, the answer is 8. But according to the earlier analysis, the reachable positions are 0,2,5,7,4,1,6,3. Which are all numbers from 0 to 7. So in this case, all positions are reachable. So for x=7, which is larger than 5+3-1=7? Wait, the classic coin problem says that the largest unrepresentable number is ab -a -b = 5*3 -5 -3 = 15-8=7. So the largest number that cannot be formed with positive coefficients is 7. But here, the frog can reach 7. So that suggests that the classic problem's result is not directly applicable here.\n\nBut in this case, the frog can reach 7 by adding a once (from 0 to 5) and then adding a again (but 5+5=10 is too big). No, that's not possible. Wait, but the frog can reach 7 by jumping from 2 to 2+5=7. So how did the frog reach 2? It came from 5-3=2. So the path was 0 →5 →2 →7. So the frog can reach 7 even though it's the largest unrepresentable number in the classic problem. So the difference is that the frog can subtract b steps, allowing it to reach numbers that would require negative coefficients in the classic problem.\n\nThis suggests that the problem is different. So for a and b coprime, perhaps the frog can reach any position ≥ (some value), and all positions below that may or may not be reachable.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. Since the frog can move forward and backward, the problem resembles a graph where each position can reach others. For example, once the frog can reach position k, it can reach k+a and k-b. So for positions that are in the range [0, x], the reachable positions form a connected component. But since the frog can move in both directions, perhaps once the frog can reach a certain position, it can reach all positions beyond a certain point.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nAnother observation: The frog can reach any position that is ≥ (b - a) or something like that. Wait, maybe not. Let's think of the case where a=5 and b=3. The frog can reach 0, 5, 2, 7, etc. For example, from 7, you can subtract 3 to get 4. From 4, subtract 3 to get 1. From 1, add 5 to get 6. From 6, subtract 3 to get 3. From 3, subtract 3 to get 0. So once the frog can reach positions up to x, it can reach all positions in between by subtracting b steps. So for example, if the frog can reach x, then it can reach x - b, x - 2b, etc., as long as they are ≥0. And similarly, adding a steps. So perhaps once the frog can reach a certain position, it can reach all positions that are congruent to that position mod gcd(a,b) (which is 1 in this case) and are in the range [0, x].\n\nWait, but if that's the case, then for x ≥ some value, the frog can reach all positions between 0 and x. For example, in the first sample, when x is 7, the frog can reach all positions. So for x ≥ some value, the answer is x+1. But for smaller x, it's less.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding for each x, the number of positions that are reachable, which is:\n\nIf x is large enough that all positions from 0 to x are reachable, then f(x) = x + 1.\n\nOtherwise, f(x) is the number of positions that can be reached.\n\nBut how to find when x is large enough?\n\nLet me think about the minimal x where all positions from 0 to x are reachable. Let's denote this x as T. Once x ≥ T, then f(x) = x + 1.\n\nSo the question becomes: find T, and for x < T, compute f(x) accordingly.\n\nBut how to find T?\n\nIn the first example, T is 7. Because when x=7, the frog can reach all positions. For x=7, the largest unrepresentable number in the classic problem is 7, but the frog can reach it. So perhaps T is (a + b - 1) or something similar?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as follows: once the frog can reach a and b, then it can reach any position beyond that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem in terms of BFS. The frog can reach any position that is reachable through the allowed moves, and once it can reach a certain position, it can generate others. But for large x, we can assume that once the frog can reach a and b, then all positions are reachable.\n\nBut I'm stuck here. Let's think of another approach.\n\nSuppose that a and b are coprime. Then, the frog can reach any integer that is ≥ (some value). Let's find this value. For example, in the first sample, a=5, b=3. The frog can reach 0, 2, 5, 7, etc. Then, from 5, you can subtract 3 to get 2, then add 5 to get 7, subtract 3 to get 4, etc. So it seems that once the frog can reach a position that is ≥ b, then it can generate all positions by subtracting b steps. For example, if the frog can reach position k ≥ b, then k - b is also reachable, and so on. So if the frog can reach a position that is ≥ b, then it can reach all positions down to 0 by subtracting b steps. But how?\n\nWait, for example, if the frog can reach position k, and k ≥ b, then from k, it can reach k - b. Then from k - b, subtract b again, and so on until reaching a position less than b. But this depends on the value of k.\n\nBut if the frog can reach a position that is ≥ b, and also can reach positions that allow adding a steps, then it can reach all positions. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's imagine that the frog can reach any position that is ≥ (b - a) or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: The frog can reach any position that is ≥ (a - b) or something. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a graph where the frog can move forward by a or backward by b. The frog starts at 0. The question is, for a given x, what is the number of nodes reachable in this graph.\n\nBut for large x, this is impractical to compute. However, perhaps the number of positions that are not reachable is bounded by some value, and for x larger than that, all positions are reachable.\n\nLet me think of the following example. Let a=5 and b=3. For x=5, the reachable positions are 0, 2, 5. For x=6, same. For x=7, all positions are reachable. So T=7. What is the relation between a, b and T? In this case, T= a + b - 1 = 5 + 3 -1 =7. Which matches. Another example: if a=3 and b=2. Then T would be 3+2-1=4. Let's see. For x=4, can the frog reach all positions?\n\nFrom 0: jump to 3 (if x≥3). Then from 3, subtract 2 to reach 1. From 1, add 3 to reach 4. From 4, subtract 2 to reach 2. So yes, positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So for x=4, f(x)=5. So T=4 which is a + b -1.\n\nAnother example: a=2, b=1. Then T=2+1-1=2. For x=2, the frog can reach 0, 2, 1 (from 2-1=1). So yes, all positions. So T=2.\n\nAnother example: a=4, b=5. They are coprime. T=4+5-1=8. Let's see. For x=8, can the frog reach all positions?\n\nStart from 0. Jump to 4. From 4, jump to 4+4=8. From 8, subtract 5 to get 3. From 3, add 4 to get 7. Subtract 5 to get 2. Add 4 to get 6. Subtract 5 to get 1. Add 4 to get 5. Subtract 5 to get 0. So yes, all positions from 0 to 8 are reachable. So T seems to be a + b - 1.\n\nSo this suggests that for a and b coprime, once x ≥ a + b -1, all positions from 0 to x are reachable. For x < a + b -1, some positions are not reachable.\n\nIf this hypothesis is correct, then for x >= a + b -1, f(x) = x + 1. Otherwise, f(x) is the number of positions reachable, which depends on x.\n\nSo the problem now splits into two parts:\n\nFor each x, if x >= T (where T = a + b -1), then f(x) = x + 1.\n\nOtherwise, we need to compute f(x) as the number of reachable positions.\n\nBut how to compute f(x) for x < T?\n\nWell, since T can be up to 2e5 (since a and b are up to 1e5), for m up to 1e9, we can precompute f(x) for x up to T, and for x >= T, use the formula x + 1.\n\nBut what if a and b are not coprime? Let's recall that we first divide a and b by their gcd. So the general approach would be:\n\nCompute d = gcd(a, b). Let a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Then, the problem reduces to the case where a' and b' are coprime. Then, T' = a' + b' - 1. But then, the actual T is T' * d. Because the positions are multiples of d. So for the original problem, the threshold is T = d*(a' + b' - 1) = d*(a/d + b/d -1) ?\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. When we divide by d, the positions are multiples of d. So the original problem's positions are k*d, where k is an integer. So the threshold for the original problem would be T_original = d * T', where T' is the threshold for the reduced problem (with a' and b' coprime). But T' is a' + b' -1. So T_original = d*(a' + b' -1) = d*( (a/d) + (b/d) -1 ) = (a + b -d)/d *d ? Wait, let's compute:\n\nd*(a/d + b/d - 1) = a + b -d. So T_original = a + b -d.\n\nWait, for example, in the first sample, a=5, b=3. d=1, so T_original = 5+3 -1 =7, which matches. Another example: a=4, b=5 (coprime), d=1, T_original=4+5-1=8, which matches. For a=2, b=2, d=2. a'=1, b'=1. T' = 1+1-1=1. T_original = 2*1=2. For x=2, the frog can reach positions 0, 2 (since adding a=2 once, but subtracting b=2 would take it to 0). So f(2) would be 2, but according to the formula, for x >= T_original (which is 2), f(x) =x+1. But for x=2, x+1 is 3, but the actual reachable positions are 0 and 2. So something's wrong here.\n\nWait, this suggests that my previous reasoning is incorrect. Because in this case, when a and b are both 2, then d=2, a'=1, b'=1. The reduced problem is a'=1, b'=1. Then, T' = a' + b' -1 = 1+1-1=1. So T_original = d*T' = 2*1=2. But for x=2, the frog can reach 0 and 2, but not 1 (since 1 is not a multiple of 2). So for x=2, the number of reachable positions is 2 (0 and 2). However, according to the formula for x >= T_original (which is 2), f(x) should be x+1. But x+1 would be 3, which is incorrect. Hence, my earlier hypothesis is wrong.\n\nSo what's wrong with the previous reasoning?\n\nAh! The T_original is not simply d*T'. Because in the reduced problem, the positions are multiples of d. So for the reduced problem (a' and b' coprime), the threshold T' is such that for x' >= T', all positions from 0 to x' are reachable in the reduced problem (i.e., positions are integers, not multiples of d). But when scaled back to the original problem, the positions are multiples of d. So for the original problem, the threshold would be T_original = T' * d. But in this case, T' = a' + b' -1 = 1 + 1 -1 = 1. So T_original = 1 * d = 2. For the reduced problem, when x' >= T', all positions from 0 to x' are reachable. So for x' = 1, which is T', the reduced problem has all positions from 0 to 1 reachable. But in the original problem, the positions are multiples of d=2. So for x_original = T_original = 2, which corresponds to x' = 2/d = 1. In the reduced problem, all positions from 0 to 1 are reachable. Which means that in the original problem, positions 0*d = 0, 1*d = 2 are reachable. Which matches our example. So for x_original >= T_original (which is 2), the number of reachable positions is floor(x_original / d) + 1. Because all multiples of d up to x_original are reachable.\n\nSo in the example where a=2, b=2, d=2, T_original = 2. For x_original = 2, the number of reachable positions is floor(2/2) +1 = 1 +1 = 2, which is correct. For x_original = 3, which is >= T_original, the number of reachable positions is floor(3/2) +1 = 1 +1 = 2. But wait, the frog can't reach 2 + 2 =4, which is beyond x_original=3. So the reachable positions are 0 and 2. So the formula holds. So for x_original >= T_original, the number of reachable positions is floor(x_original /d) +1. Because in the reduced problem, all positions from 0 to x' = x_original/d are reachable, which translates to multiples of d up to x_original.\n\nThus, the general formula for f(x) is:\n\nIf x >= T_original, then f(x) = floor(x/d) +1.\n\nElse, it depends on the number of reachable positions for x, which we need to calculate.\n\nSo the threshold T_original is d * (a' + b' - 1) where a' = a/d, b' = b/d.\n\nBut wait, when a' and b' are coprime, then T' = a' + b' -1. So T_original = d * T' = d*(a' + b' -1) = d*(a/d + b/d -1) = (a + b -d).\n\nYes, because:\n\nd*(a'/d + b'/d -1) = a' + b' -d = (a/d + b/d) -d ? No, wait:\n\nWait, a' = a/d, b' = b/d. Then T' = a' + b' -1. Multiply by d: T_original = d*(a' + b' -1) = d*a' + d*b' -d = a + b -d.\n\nYes. So T_original = a + b -d.\n\nSo, for x >= T_original, f(x) = floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nBut in the case where a and b are not coprime, and x is larger than T_original, the frog can reach all multiples of d up to x. Hence, the count is floor(x/d) + 1.\n\nSo the problem now is to compute for each x from 0 to m:\n\nsum_{x=0}^m f(x), where f(x) is:\n\nif x >= T_original: floor(x/d) + 1\n\nelse: the number of reachable positions for x, which we need to compute.\n\nNow, the challenge is to compute this sum efficiently.\n\nFirst, let's compute d = gcd(a, b). Then compute T_original = a + b - d. Also compute a' = a/d, b' = b/d.\n\nThen, for x < T_original, we need to compute f(x), which is the number of multiples of d up to x that are reachable by the frog under the constraints.\n\nBut how?\n\nFor x < T_original, we can model the problem as follows: since T_original is a + b -d, which for a and b up to 1e5, T_original can be up to 2e5 (since d is at least 1). For example, if a and b are both 1e5, then d is 1e5, so T_original = 1e5 + 1e5 - 1e5 = 1e5. So the maximum T_original is O(1e5), which is manageable.\n\nSo for x < T_original, we can precompute f(x) using BFS or dynamic programming. Once we have these values, we can compute the sum for x up to T_original-1, and for x >= T_original, compute the sum using the formula.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Compute d = gcd(a, b), a' = a/d, b' = b/d.\n\n2. Compute T_original = a + b -d.\n\n3. For x in [0, T_original], compute f(x).\n\n   For x < T_original, we need to find how many multiples of d are reachable in [0, x].\n\n   To compute this, we can model the problem as follows:\n\n   Let’s create a set of reachable positions in the reduced problem (where a' and b' are coprime). For the reduced problem, the positions are integers (since we divided by d). The original problem's positions are multiples of d. So, for the reduced problem, the frog can jump +a' or -b'.\n\n   So, for the reduced problem, the reachable positions in [0, x_reduced], where x_reduced = floor(x / d), are the positions that are reachable. Then, the number of reachable positions in the original problem is equal to the number of reachable positions in the reduced problem multiplied by 1 (since each corresponds to a multiple of d in the original problem).\n\n   So, for x_original < T_original, we compute x_reduced = floor(x_original / d). Then, for the reduced problem with a' and b', compute the number of reachable positions in [0, x_reduced]. This number is the value of f(x_original).\n\n   Therefore, the problem reduces to solving the reduced problem (a' and b' coprime) for x_reduced up to T_reduced = T_original / d = (a + b -d)/d = a'/d + b'/d - 1 ?\n\nWait, no. T_original is a + b -d. For the reduced problem, T_reduced = a' + b' - 1. Let's compute:\n\nT_original = a + b -d = d*a' + d*b' -d = d*(a' + b' -1) = d*T_reduced.\n\nSo T_reduced = T_original /d = a' + b' -1.\n\nWhich makes sense. So for the reduced problem, x_reduced can be up to T_reduced -1 (since x_original < T_original implies x_reduced < T_original /d = T_reduced).\n\nThus, for the reduced problem, the threshold is T_reduced = a' + b' -1. For x_reduced >= T_reduced, all positions from 0 to x_reduced are reachable. For x_reduced < T_reduced, we need to compute the number of reachable",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of distinct integers a frog can reach on a number line given specific jump constraints and then compute the sum of these values for all integers from 0 to a given value $ m $. The solution involves analyzing the problem in terms of greatest common divisors (GCD) and precomputing reachable positions efficiently.\n\n### Approach\n1. **GCD Analysis**: The frog's jumps are determined by two integers $ a $ and $ b $. The key insight is that the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of the GCD of $ a $ and $ b $. This simplifies the problem by reducing it to a smaller problem with coprime values.\n2. **Threshold Calculation**: For each position $ x $, there exists a threshold $ T $ beyond which all positions are reachable. This threshold is derived from the formula $ T = a + b - \\text{gcd}(a, b) $.\n3. **Precomputation for Small Values**: For values below the threshold $ T $, we use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to precompute the number of reachable positions. This is feasible because the threshold is relatively small (up to $ 2 \\times 10^5 $).\n4. **Summation for Large Values**: For values above the threshold, the number of reachable positions follows a simple arithmetic progression, allowing efficient summation using mathematical formulas.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    m = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    a = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n    b = int(input[idx]); idx +=1\n\n    d = math.gcd(a, b)\n    a_prime = a // d\n    b_prime = b // d\n\n    T_original = a + b - d\n\n    # Precompute for reduced problem\n    def compute_reduced_f(x_red, a_red, b_red):\n        visited = [False] * (x_red + 1)\n        q = deque()\n        q.append(0)\n        visited[0] = True\n        count = 1\n        while q:\n            current = q.popleft()\n            # Try adding a_red\n            next_add = current + a_red\n            if next_add <= x_red and not visited[next_add]:\n                visited[next_add] = True\n                count += 1\n                q.append(next_add)\n            # Try subtracting b_red\n            next_sub = current - b_red\n            if next_sub >= 0 and not visited[next_sub]:\n                visited[next_sub] = True\n                count += 1\n                q.append(next_sub)\n        return count\n\n    # Now compute the sum for all i from 0 to m\n    total_sum = 0\n    max_x_red = (T_original - 1) // d\n    if max_x_red >= 0:\n        # Precompute f_reduced for x_red from 0 to max_x_red\n        f_reduced = [0] * (max_x_red + 1)\n        for x_red in range(max_x_red + 1):\n            f_reduced[x_red] = compute_reduced_f(x_red, a_prime, b_prime)\n    else:\n        f_reduced = []\n\n    # Now calculate the sum up to min(m, T_original -1)\n    upper = min(m, T_original - 1)\n    sum_small = 0\n    for x in range(0, upper + 1):\n        x_red = x // d\n        if x_red <= max_x_red:\n            sum_small += f_reduced[x_red]\n        else:\n            # This should not happen since upper is min(m, T_original -1)\n            pass\n    total_sum += sum_small\n\n    # Now handle the part where x >= T_original\n    if m >= T_original:\n        # Compute sum from x = T_original to m of (floor(x/d) +1)\n        # Let k = floor(x/d)\n        # For each k, find how many x's have floor(x/d) =k\n        # k ranges from k_min = floor(T_original /d) to k_max = floor(m/d)\n        k_min = T_original // d\n        k_max = m // d\n        sum_large = 0\n        for k in range(k_min, k_max + 1):\n            # Number of x in [k*d, (k+1)*d -1] that are >= T_original and <= m\n            lower = max(T_original, k * d)\n            upper = min((k + 1) * d - 1, m)\n            if lower > upper:\n                continue\n            count = upper - lower + 1\n            sum_large += count * (k + 1)\n        total_sum += sum_large\n\n    print(total_sum)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **GCD Calculation**: The GCD of $ a $ and $ b $ is computed to reduce the problem to a simpler form with coprime values.\n2. **Threshold Determination**: The threshold $ T $ is calculated to determine when all positions become reachable.\n3. **BFS Precomputation**: For values below the threshold, BFS is used to precompute the number of reachable positions efficiently.\n4. **Efficient Summation**: For values above the threshold, the sum is computed using arithmetic progression properties, ensuring efficiency even for large values of $ m $.\n\nThis approach ensures that we handle both small and large values efficiently, leveraging mathematical insights and precomputation to achieve optimal performance.",
