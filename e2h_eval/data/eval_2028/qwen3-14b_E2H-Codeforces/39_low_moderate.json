Chess rook moves along straight lines up and down, left and right, as many squares as it wants. And when it wants, it can stop. The queen walks in all directions vertically and diagonally at any distance. You can see the examples below.  To reach the goal, Egor should research the next topic:There is an $$$N \\times N$$$ board. Each cell of the board has a number from $$$1$$$ to $$$N ^ 2$$$ in it and numbers in all cells are distinct.In the beginning, some chess figure stands in the cell with the number $$$1$$$. Note that this cell is already considered as visited. After that every move is determined by the following rules:   Among all not visited yet cells to which the figure can get in one move, it goes to the cell that has minimal number. If all accessible cells were already visited and some cells are not yet visited, then the figure is teleported to the not visited cell that has minimal number. If this step happens, the piece pays a fee of $$$1$$$ vun. If all cells are already visited, the process is stopped. Egor should find an $$$N \\times N$$$ board on which the rook pays strictly less vuns than the queen during the round with this numbering. Help him to find such $$$N \\times N$$$ numbered board, or tell that it doesn't exist.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains one integer $$$N$$$  — the size of the board, $$$1\\le N \\le 500$$$.\n\n## Output\nThe output should contain $$$N$$$ lines.In $$$i$$$-th line output $$$N$$$ numbers  — numbers on the $$$i$$$-th row of the board. All numbers from $$$1$$$ to $$$N \\times N$$$ must be used exactly once.On your board rook must pay strictly less vuns than the queen.If there are no solutions, print $$$-1$$$.If there are several solutions, you can output any of them. \n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1', '4']\n\n### Output\n['-1', '4 3 6 12 \\n7 5 9 15 \\n14 1 11 10 \\n13 8 16 2']\n\n## Note\nIn case we have $$$1 \\times 1$$$ board, both rook and queen do not have a chance to pay fees.In second sample rook goes through cells $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 5 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 2 \\to 8 \\to 16 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14$$$. Queen goes through $$$1 \\to 3 \\to 4 \\to 2 \\to 5 \\to 6 \\to 9 \\to 7 \\to 13 \\to 8 \\to 11 \\to 10 \\to 12 \\to 15 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 14 \\to \\textbf{(1 vun)} \\to 16$$$.As a result rook pays 1 vun and queen pays 2 vuns.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. The task is to create an N x N board where the rook pays strictly fewer vuns than the queen during their traversal based on the given movement rules. If it's not possible, output -1.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the movement rules. Let me recap:\n\nThe process starts at cell 1. Each move, the figure (rook or queen) chooses the next unvisited cell with the smallest number that it can reach in one move. If there are no such cells, it teleports to the smallest unvisited cell, paying 1 vun. This continues until all cells are visited.\n\nThe goal is to arrange the numbers on the board such that the rook's total fees are less than the queen's.\n\nHmm. So for a given N, I need to construct a numbering where the rook's path has fewer teleportations (i.e., fewer times when it can't move to the next smallest number via its movement) than the queen's path.\n\nLet me think about how to approach constructing such a board. Since the problem requires that the rook's fee is strictly less than the queen's, perhaps I need to find a pattern where the queen has more instances where it can't proceed to the next minimal number via its movement, thus requiring more teleportations.\n\nBut how can I design such a numbering? Maybe there's a specific pattern or arrangement that ensures the rook's movement is more efficient than the queen's.\n\nLooking at the sample input for N=4, the output shows a certain arrangement. Let me think about that example. The rook's path had 1 vun, while the queen had 2. How was that achieved?\n\nIn that case, the queen had to teleport twice. So maybe the queen's movement is more flexible, but in some cases, the order of numbers forces the queen to have more teleportations. For example, if the queen can't reach the next smallest number because it's not in her movement path, she has to teleport.\n\nSo the key is to arrange numbers such that the rook's path can reach the next minimal numbers more often than the queen can. How?\n\nLet me think about the movement differences between the rook and the queen. The rook moves in straight lines (same row or column), while the queen can move any direction (including diagonally). So the queen has more movement options. Therefore, in general, the queen can reach more cells from any given position. However, if the numbers are arranged in a way that the next minimal number is in a position that the rook can reach but the queen cannot, then the queen would have to teleport. But that's not possible since the queen can reach any cell that the rook can reach, plus more. So the queen's movement options are a superset of the rook's.\n\nWait, that's important. So the queen can reach any cell that the rook can reach, plus more. So for any step where the rook can move to a cell, the queen can also do so. Therefore, when choosing the next cell (the minimal unvisited one), the queen has more options. So, the queen's path should have fewer teleportations than the rook's? Wait, but the sample shows the opposite. So perhaps my reasoning is wrong here.\n\nWait in the sample, the rook paid 1 vun and the queen paid 2. How is that possible? Because the queen's movement is more flexible, but in that case, the queen had to teleport more. That suggests that the way the numbers are arranged made the queen's path have more teleport steps. How?\n\nAh, perhaps because the queen's movement options are more, but the order of numbers is such that the next minimal number is not reachable by the queen, but the rook can reach it. No, that's impossible because the queen can reach any cell that the rook can reach. So if the rook can reach a cell, the queen can reach it too. Therefore, the queen's movement options are more, which implies that the queen can reach the next minimal number more often than the rook. Therefore, the queen would have fewer teleport steps. But the sample contradicts this. So my previous reasoning must be incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the movement directions wrong. Let me check again. The rook moves along rows and columns. The queen can move like a rook and a bishop. So the queen can move diagonally as well. Therefore, the queen can reach any cell that the rook can reach, plus those that are diagonal. So the queen has more movement options. Thus, the queen can reach more cells than the rook. Therefore, for any given position, the queen has a larger set of reachable cells than the rook. Therefore, when looking for the next minimal cell, the queen has more options. So why in the sample, the queen has more teleport steps than the ro",

This pattern leverages the rook's straight-line movement capabilities, ensuring that the next smallest number is often reachable without teleportation. The queen, having more movement options, might encounter situations where the next smallest number is not reachable directly, leading to more teleportations. This approach ensures the rook's fees are strictly less than the queen's, meeting the problem's requirements.",
