Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. Hmm. So the standard knapsack approach won't work here because the m is too big for O(nm) time. So I need a smarter way.\n\nLet me think. Since the weights are only 1, 2, or 3, maybe I can handle each weight category separately. For example, for all items of weight 1, I can take as many as possible, but maybe there's a way to optimize by considering combinations with other weights.\n\nWait, but even if I sort the items by cost per unit weight, perhaps? For example, for items of weight 1, we should take the ones with highest cost first. Similarly for weight 2 and 3. But how do I combine them optimally?\n\nLet me think about the approach. Let's separate the items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3. For each group, sort them in descending order of cost. Then, precompute prefix sums for each group. Then, for each possible number of items taken from the weight 1 group, and similarly for weight 2 and 3, find the combination that fits into the total weight m.\n\nBut even that might not be straightforward. Because the total weight is m, and we have to consider all possible combinations of taking some items from each group. However, since the weights are small (1, 2, 3), maybe we can find an efficient way.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a variation of the knapsack problem with multiple constraints. But given the small weights, perhaps we can model it with dynamic programming, but optimized for the weight limits.\n\nAnother idea: For each possible number of weight 3 items taken, and weight 2 items taken, compute how many weight 1 items can be taken. But even that might be too slow if done naively.\n\nWait, let's think about the maximum possible number of items for each weight:\n\nFor weight 1: up to m items.\n\nFor weight 2: up to m//2 items.\n\nFor weight 3: up to m//3 items.\n\nBut with n up to 1e5, but m up to 3e5, maybe we can process each group and precompute their prefix sums.\n\nSo here's a plan:\n\n1. Split the items into three lists based on their weight. Sort each list in descending order of cost. Then compute the prefix sums for each list.\n\nFor example, for weight 1 items, sorted in descending order, the prefix sum array will have the maximum cost for taking 0, 1, 2, ... items.\n\nSame for weight 2 and 3.\n\nOnce these prefix sums are computed, the problem reduces to choosing how many items to take from each group such that the total weight is <= m, and the sum of their prefix sums is maximized.\n\nBut how to efficiently find this combination?\n\nLet me think about the variables. Let's say we take x items from weight 1, y items from weight 2, z items from weight 3. The total weight is x*1 + y*2 + z*3 ≤ m. We need to maximize sum_1[x] + sum_2[y] + sum_3[z].\n\nBut iterating over all possible x, y, z would be O(m^2), which is not feasible for m up to 3e5.\n\nSo that's not going to work. Need a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible number of weight 3 items (z), and for each possible number of weight 2 items (y), compute the maximum possible x such that x + 2y + 3z ≤ m. Then compute the sum for that combination. But again, with z up to m//3 (about 1e5) and y up to m//2 (about 1.5e5), this would be O( (m/3) * (m/2) ) which is O( (m^2)/6 ), which is way too big for m=3e5.\n\nThat's 3e5 squared divided by 6, which is 1.5e11 operations. Not feasible.\n\nHmm. So that's not going to work. Need another way.\n\nAnother thought: For each weight group, since they are sorted, perhaps for a given total weight, we can find the optimal combination of items from different groups.\n\nLet me think. Suppose I fix the number of items taken from the weight 3 group, say z. Then, the remaining weight is m - 3*z. Now, the problem reduces to solving the same problem but with m' = m - 3*z, and items of weight 1 and 2. How to solve this?\n\nFor the weight 1 and 2 case, perhaps we can find an optimal way. Let's think: For a given m', how to choose between weight 1 and 2 items.\n\nLet me think of this as a two-dimensional problem. Suppose we have a certain number of weight 1 items and weight 2 items. How to select the best combination.\n\nBut again, for each z, solving this for m' could take O(m') time. But since z can be up to m//3, which is 1e5, this would be O(1e5 * m'), which might be acceptable if m' is small. Wait, but m' could be up to 3e5. So that would be O(1e5 * 3e5) = 3e10 operations. Which is way too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, precompute for each possible weight limit, the maximum value. How?\n\nLet me think. For the weight 1 and 2 items, perhaps we can use a dynamic programming approach. Let's say dp[i] is the maximum value for weight i. But with m up to 3e5, and n up to 1e5, but for each item, the weight is either 1 or 2. But even that would be O(m) time for each group. Wait, but maybe we can do this more efficiently.\n\nWait, for the weight 1 and 2 items, after sorting each group in descending order, we can use a greedy approach. Because for weight 1 items, each gives 1 unit of weight and some value. For weight 2 items, each gives 2 units of weight and some value. So, perhaps we can find the optimal number of weight 2 items and weight 1 items for a given capacity.\n\nBut how? Let's think of the following approach:\n\nSuppose we have a capacity of W. We can take some number of weight 2 items, say y, and then take as many weight 1 items as possible (W - 2*y). But how to choose y optimally?\n\nBut since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, the best way is to take the top y items. Similarly for weight 1. So for a given W, the maximum value is max over all possible y (from 0 to min(W//2, len(weight2)) ) of (sum2[y] + sum1[ min( W - 2*y, len(sum1) ) ] )\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently for a given W?\n\nThe problem is that for each W, we need to find the best y. However, if we can precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2, then for a given W, the optimal y can be found by checking all possible y in the range [max(0, (W - len1) // 2 ), ...], but that might still be O(W) per query.\n\nBut in our case, for each possible z (number of weight 3 items), we need to compute this for W = m - 3*z. So perhaps for each z, we can compute the optimal combination for the remaining weight using this method.\n\nBut even that, for each z, the time would be O(k), where k is the number of possible y values. If we can find the optimal y quickly, perhaps using binary search.\n\nLet me think. For the weight 2 and 1 items, given W, what is the best way to choose y?\n\nWe can take up to y_max = min( len2, W//2 ). For each possible y, we can take up to (W - 2*y) items of weight 1. Let me denote that as x = min( W - 2*y, len1 ). The total value is sum2[y] + sum1[x].\n\nBut how to find the optimal y in [0, y_max]. Let me consider that the sum2 is non-decreasing (since we take the top y items), and sum1 is also non-decreasing. However, when you increase y, you take more weight 2 items (which may be better than weight 1 items). So, the optimal y is somewhere where the trade-off between taking a weight 2 item (which takes 2 units) versus two weight 1 items (taking 2 units) is best.\n\nBut how to find this y quickly.\n\nLet me think of the following approach: For a given W, the optimal y is in the range 0 to y_max. For each possible y, the value is sum2[y] + sum1[ min( W - 2y, len1 ) ].\n\nBut since the sum2 and sum1 are prefix sums, we can precompute them. Now, the question is, for a given W, how to find the optimal y quickly.\n\nLet me think of the possible y as follows: For each possible y, we can compute the maximum possible value. However, trying all possible y is O(y_max), which for W up to 3e5, could be up to 1.5e5 per z. And if z is up to 1e5, then total time is 1.5e5 * 1e5 = 1.5e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo that approach isn't feasible. Need to find a better way.\n\nAlternative idea: For the weight 1 and 2 items, find the optimal combination using a two-pointer approach.\n\nLet me think. Suppose we have the weight 2 items sorted in descending order, and weight 1 items sorted in descending order. For a given W, the optimal strategy is to take as many weight 2 items as possible, but sometimes replacing one weight 2 item with two weight 1 items if that's better.\n\nBut how to find the optimal balance between the two.\n\nLet me think of the following approach. Let's say that we take y weight 2 items and x weight 1 items, where 2y + x <= W. The maximum x is W - 2y. But since the weight 1 items are sorted, x can be up to min(W - 2y, len1). So the total value is sum2[y] + sum1[ min(W - 2y, len1) ].\n\nNow, since sum2 is non-decreasing and sum1 is non-decreasing, but as y increases, W-2y decreases. So the function is not necessarily unimodal. However, maybe we can find the optimal y by considering that for each possible y, we can take up to some value. However, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 2 items are sorted, and the weight 1 items are sorted, the optimal choice is to take some number of weight 2 items and fill the rest with weight 1 items. But how to find the best number of weight 2 items.\n\nLet me consider that for each possible y, the maximum number of weight 1 items is W - 2y. However, since the weight 1 items are sorted, the best is to take as many as possible. So the value is sum2[y] + sum1[ min( W - 2y, len1 ) ].\n\nBut how to find the maximum of this function over y in 0 <= y <= y_max, where y_max is min( len2, W//2 ).\n\nNow, here's an idea: since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, and the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, for each y, the value is sum2[y] + sum1[ min( W - 2y, len1 ) ].\n\nBut the optimal y is likely to be in a small range. For example, we can try all possible y around the point where 2y is approximately W - x, where x is the number of weight 1 items. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each W, the optimal y is between max(0, (W - len1) // 2 ) and min( len2, W//2 ). Because, if we take more than (W - len1)/2 weight 2 items, then even if we take all weight 1 items, we can't fit them. So perhaps the optimal y is in this range. But how to find it quickly.\n\nAnother approach: For each W, the optimal number of weight 2 items is either floor(W / 2) or something similar. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, for a given W, we can try all possible y in a small window around the optimal point. For example, since the maximum possible number of weight 2 items is y_max = min( len2, W//2 ), and the minimum is 0. However, if we can find that the optimal y is in the vicinity of (W - x)/2, where x is the number of weight 1 items, perhaps we can find the best y by checking a few candidates.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose W is 5. The possible y can be 0, 1, or 2 (since 2*2=4 ≤5). For each y:\n\ny=0: x=5. Take sum1[5] if possible.\n\ny=1: 2*1=2. x=5-2=3. sum2[1] + sum1[3].\n\ny=2: 2*2=4. x=1. sum2[2] + sum1[1].\n\nWhich is better depends on the actual values.\n\nBut how to find the best y quickly.\n\nAnother idea: for a given W, the maximum value is the maximum between taking as many weight 2 items as possible and filling the rest with weight 1 items, or taking one less weight 2 item and adding two weight 1 items, etc.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each W, the optimal y is the one where the value of the next weight 2 item is compared to two weight 1 items. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the weight 1 and 2 items are sorted, perhaps we can precompute for each possible number of weight 2 items, and then for each W, find the optimal number of weight 2 items.\n\nBut I'm stuck here.\n\nLet me think back to the original problem. Since the weights are only 1, 2, 3, perhaps the solution can be split into handling weight 3 items, and then for the remaining weight, handle the 1 and 2 items optimally.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\n- Preprocess the weight 1, 2, 3 items into sorted lists and compute prefix sums.\n\nFor example:\n\nsum1[i] = sum of the first i weight 1 items.\n\nsum2[i] = sum of first i weight 2 items.\n\nsum3[i] = sum of first i weight 3 items.\n\nThen, for each possible number of weight 3 items taken (z), from 0 to min(len3, m//3), compute the remaining weight as rem = m - 3*z. Then, compute the maximum value for rem weight using the weight 1 and 2 items, and add sum3[z] to it. The overall maximum of all these possibilities is the answer.\n\nSo the key is to compute for a given rem, the maximum value from the 1 and 2 items.\n\nNow, how to compute that efficiently.\n\nLet me think of the following approach for the 1 and 2 items:\n\nFor a given rem, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible y (number of 2 items) of sum2[y] + sum1[ min(rem - 2*y, len1) ].\n\nBut how to find this maximum quickly.\n\nLet me think that for each possible y, the rem - 2*y can be negative. So we need to take y such that 2*y <= rem. So y can be from 0 to y_max = min( len2, rem//2 )\n\nNow, for each possible y in this range, we can calculate the corresponding value.\n\nBut trying all possible y for each rem would be O(y_max) per rem, which could be expensive.\n\nBut if we can find the optimal y quickly, perhaps using some properties.\n\nLet me think about the possible y values. For each y, the value is sum2[y] + sum1[ min(rem - 2y, len1) ]\n\nLet me denote x = min(rem - 2y, len1). So the total is sum2[y] + sum1[x].\n\nBut since sum1 is non-decreasing, and sum2 is non-decreasing, but the term rem - 2y decreases as y increases, so x decreases as y increases. So, the sum1[x] decreases as y increases, while sum2[y] increases.\n\nTherefore, the function is not monotonic, but perhaps has a single peak. If that's the case, then we can use ternary search to find the maximum.\n\nBut is the function unimodal?\n\nLet me think: when y increases, sum2[y] increases, but sum1[x] decreases. Depending on the rates, the function could have a single maximum.\n\nBut I'm not sure if it's strictly unimodal. However, assuming that it is, ternary search could be used.\n\nBut how to confirm this?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose rem is fixed. For y=0, x is rem. For y=1, x is rem-2. For y=2, x is rem-4. And so on. The sum2 increases with y, but the sum1 decreases. The total may first increase, reach a maximum, then decrease. So it's possible that the function is unimodal. If that's the case, then ternary search can find the maximum.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, given the time constraints, perhaps trying this approach is worth it.\n\nSo, for each rem, perform a ternary search on y in [0, y_max], and find the maximum value.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, since the possible y_max is up to 1.5e5 for rem up to 3e5, and for each z (up to 1e5), this would be O(log y_max) per rem. So total time would be O( (number of z) * log y_max ), which for 1e5 * 20 is 2e6 operations, which is manageable.\n\nBut how to handle the ternary search correctly. Also, note that for some cases, the optimal y may be at the edges.\n\nBut perhaps this approach is feasible.\n\nAlternatively, since the sum2 and sum1 are sorted, perhaps we can find the optimal y by considering that for each possible y, the value is sum2[y] + sum1[ min(rem - 2y, len1) ].\n\nLet me think of the following: the optimal y is such that the next weight 2 item (if any) is not better than two weight 1 items.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for a given rem, the optimal number of weight 2 items is the maximum y where the value of the y-th weight 2 item is >= the value of the two best weight 1 items that can be taken in place of it.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nLet me think of a different approach. Since the weight 2 items are sorted in descending order, and the weight 1 items are sorted in descending order, for each possible number of weight 2 items taken, the best is to take as many as possible. However, for each weight 2 item taken, it uses 2 units of weight. Alternatively, two weight 1 items can be taken for the same weight. So, for the optimal selection, we can compare the value of the current weight 2 item with the sum of the two best weight 1 items.\n\nThis is similar to the approach used in the classic problem where you have items of weight 1 and 2, and you want to maximize the value.\n\nSo here's an idea:\n\nWe can precompute the prefix sums for weight 1 and 2. Then, for a given rem, we can start by taking as many weight 2 items as possible, and then fill the rest with weight 1 items. However, we can check if replacing a weight 2 item with two weight 1 items would give a better value.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently.\n\nLet me think: suppose we have y_max = min( len2, rem//2 ). Take y = y_max. Then, the remaining weight is rem - 2*y. Take as many weight 1 items as possible. However, if there are some weight 1 items left, perhaps we can replace some of the weight 2 items with weight 1 items.\n\nBut how to find the optimal number of weight 2 items.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following approach:\n\nWe can take the maximum between:\n\n- Taking y = floor( (rem) / 2 ), and then taking as many weight 1 as possible.\n\nOR\n\n- Taking y = floor( (rem) / 2 ) - 1, and then taking as many weight 1 as possible.\n\nBut this may not capture all possibilities, but it's a starting point.\n\nAlternatively, we can iterate over y in the range [max(0, y_max - k), y_max], for some small k, like 100. Since the optimal y is likely to be near the maximum possible y, or near the point where the weight 2 items are comparable to two weight 1 items.\n\nBut what is the maximum possible value of k? Well, if we take k as 300, then for each rem, we check 300 possible y values, which would be acceptable.\n\nBut why would this work?\n\nBecause the optimal y is where the value of the next weight 2 item is not better than two weight 1 items. So, for example, if we have a lot of high-value weight 1 items, we might prefer to take fewer weight 2 items and more weight 1 items.\n\nBut if we check a few possible values around the maximum y, we can find the best one.\n\nBut how to determine how many values to check.\n\nAlternatively, considering that for each rem, the optimal y is between 0 and y_max, and that for each possible y, we can compute the value. But since y_max can be up to 1.5e5, checking all of them is not feasible.\n\nHmm. So, back to the ternary search idea. Let's proceed with that.\n\nLet me think of the function f(y) = sum2[y] + sum1[ min(rem - 2*y, len1) ].\n\nIf this function is unimodal, then ternary search can find the maximum. However, if it's not, then it might not work. But given that the function first increases and then decreases, perhaps it's safe to assume that it is unimodal.\n\nLet me think of an example where the function is not unimodal. Suppose sum2 is [0, 3, 5], sum1 is [0, 2, 4, 6]. For rem = 4. The possible y values are 0, 1, 2.\n\nFor y=0: rem - 0 =4 → sum1[4] (but if len1 is 3, then min(4,3)=3 → sum1[3]=6. Total is 0+6=6.\n\ny=1: 2*1=2. rem - 2 = 2 → sum1[2] =4. Total is 3 +4=7.\n\ny=2: 2*2=4 → rem -4 =0 → sum1[0] =0. Total is 5+0=5.\n\nSo the function increases then decreases. So it's unimodal.\n\nAnother example: sum2 = [0, 3, 5, 6], sum1 = [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]. rem=5.\n\nPossible y_max is 2 (since 5//2 = 2).\n\ny=0: rem=5 → sum1[5] (if len1 is 4, min is 4 → 8. Total 0+8=8.\n\ny=1: 2 → rem-2=3 → sum1[3] =6 → 3+6=9.\n\ny=2: 4 → rem-4=1 → sum1[1] =2 → 5+2=7.\n\nSo again, the function increases then decreases.\n\nAnother example: rem=6, sum2 is [0, 3, 5, 6], sum1 is [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10].\n\ny_max is 3 (6//2=3).\n\ny=0: sum1[6] =10 → total 0+10=10.\n\ny=1: 2 → rem-2=4 → sum1[4]=8 → 3+8=11.\n\ny=2: 4 → rem-4=2 → sum1[2]=4 → 5+4=9.\n\ny=3: 6 → rem-6=0 → sum1[0]=0 → 6+0=6.\n\nSo again, function increases then decreases.\n\nSo seems like the function is unimodal. So ternary search can be applied.\n\nThus, for each rem, we can perform a ternary search on y in [0, y_max], and find the maximum value of the function f(y).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each possible z (number of weight 3 items), compute rem = m - 3*z. If rem < 0, skip. Then compute the maximum value from the 1 and 2 items with capacity rem. Add sum3[z] to it. Keep track of the maximum overall.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\n1. Read n and m.\n\n2. Read the n items. Split into three lists: w1, w2, w3.\n\n3. Sort each list in descending order of cost.\n\n4. Compute prefix sums for each list. For example, sum1[i] is the sum of the first i items in w1. Similarly for sum2 and sum3.\n\n   For example, sum1[0] = 0, sum1[1] = w1[0].cost, sum1[2] = w1[0].cost + w1[1].cost, etc.\n\n5. For each possible z in 0 to min( len3, m//3 ), compute rem = m - 3*z. If rem <0, skip.\n\n   For this rem, compute the maximum value from 1 and 2 items.\n\n   To compute that, perform a ternary search on y in [0, y_max], where y_max is min( len2, rem//2 )\n\n   The function f(y) is sum2[y] + sum1[ min( rem - 2*y, len1 ) ]\n\n   Find the maximum f(y) for y in [0, y_max]\n\n6. The overall maximum is the maximum of all these possibilities.\n\nNow, implementing the ternary search for each rem.\n\nBut how to handle the min(rem - 2*y, len1) part.\n\nSo, during the ternary search, for a given y, compute the available weight after taking 2*y units: available = rem - 2*y. Then x = min( available, len1 ). So sum1[x].\n\nSo, the code for the function f(y) would be:\n\ndef get_value(y, rem, sum1, len1, sum2):\n    available = rem - 2*y\n    x = min(available, len1)\n    return sum2[y] + sum1[x]\n\nBut how to handle the cases where y exceeds the length of sum2? Well, since y_max is min( len2, rem//2 ), the y passed to the function is within the valid range.\n\nNow, the ternary search:\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = y_max.\n\nWhile low <= high:\n\n   mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n   mid2 = high - (high - low) //3\n\n   val1 = get_value(mid1, ...)\n\n   val2 = get_value(mid2, ...)\n\n   if val1 < val2:\n\n       low = mid1 + 1\n\n   else:\n\n       high = mid2 -1\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact steps of ternary search. Alternatively, perform a loop until low and high are close enough, and then check all possible y in the remaining range.\n\nAlternatively, since the function is unimodal, we can perform a binary search for the maximum.\n\nBut perhaps for simplicity, in practice, we can iterate through all possible y in the range [max(0, y_max - 200), y_max], and pick the best among them. Because for large rem, the optimal y is likely to be near the maximum possible y, and checking 200 possibilities would be manageable.\n\nBut why would that work? Well, because the optimal y is where the value of the next weight 2 item is not better than two weight 1 items. So, the optimal y is around the point where the sum2[y] + sum1[...] is maximized. But for large data sets, checking a few hundred possibilities would be manageable.\n\nBut how to choose the number of possibilities to check. For example, if we check all y in the range [max(0, y_max - 200), y_max], then for each rem, we check 200 possibilities. For 1e5 z values, that's 2e7 operations, which is manageable.\n\nBut why 200? Well, because for each rem, the optimal y could be anywhere in the range, but in practice, the optimal y is not too far from the maximum possible y. For example, if the best option is to take y_max - k, where k is small.\n\nBut what if the optimal y is much smaller than y_max?\n\nIn that case, this approach would miss it. So this is risky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each rem, the optimal y is either the maximum possible y, or the maximum possible y minus 1, or something like that. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the sum2 and sum1 are sorted, perhaps for each rem, the optimal y is in the range [y_opt - k, y_opt +k], where y_opt is the maximum between the number of weight 2 items that can be taken and the number of weight 1 items that can be taken.\n\nBut again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each rem, we can try all possible y in the range [max(0, y_max - 300), y_max], and take the maximum. This is a heuristic, but perhaps it works for the problem's constraints.\n\nBut why would that work? Well, the problem's constraints allow for the weight of items to be up to 3, but the number of items is large. However, given that the sum1 and sum2 are sorted, the optimal y is likely to be near the maximum possible y.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of an example where the optimal y is far from y_max.\n\nExample: rem = 1000. sum2 has items with very low values, and sum1 has items with very high values. For instance, sum2 is [0, 1, 2, 3, ...], and sum1 is [0, 1000, 2000, ...]. Then, for rem=1000, the optimal y is 0, because taking 0 weight 2 items allows us to take 1000 weight 1 items, which is much better than taking any weight 2 items. In this case, the optimal y is 0, but y_max is 500 (since 1000//2=500). So checking up to 300 steps from y_max would miss this case.\n\nHence, this approach would fail for such cases.\n\nThus, this suggests that the ternary search approach is needed.\n\nBut how to implement it correctly.\n\nLet me think of the ternary search approach again. The function is unimodal, so ternary search can find the maximum.\n\nLet me code this in mind.\n\nFor a given rem, the function f(y) is unimodal. So we can perform ternary search between low=0 and high=y_max. We need to find the y that maximizes f(y).\n\nBut how to implement this. Here's a possible approach:\n\nInitialize low = 0, high = y_max.\n\nWhile low < high:\n\n   mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n   mid2 = high - (high - low) //3\n\n   if f(mid1) < f(mid2):\n\n       low = mid1 + 1\n\n   else:\n\n       high = mid2 - 1\n\nOnce the loop ends, check all values from low-2 to low+2 (to account for possible errors due to the function not being perfectly unimodal) and take the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, after the loop, check all possible y in the range [low, high], but since low and high are close, this is manageable.\n\nBut how to handle the ternary search properly.\n\nAlternatively, use binary search to find the maximum. For example, find the point where f(y) is greater than or equal to f(y+1), which would indicate that the maximum is at y.\n\nBut this requires that the function is first increasing and then decreasing.\n\nBut for this, we can perform a binary search for the peak.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, after performing the ternary search, we can check all possible y in a small window around the found value.\n\nBut regardless, implementing the ternary search and then checking nearby values would probably work.\n\nNow, putting this together.\n\nIn Python, for each rem, we can perform the ternary search as follows:\n\ndef max_1_2(rem, sum1, len1, sum2, len2):\n\n    y_max = min(len2, rem // 2)\n\n    low = 0\n\n    high = y_max\n\n    # perform ternary search\n\n    while low < high:\n\n        mid1 = low + (high - low) // 3\n\n        mid2 = high - (high - low) // 3\n\n        val1 = sum2[mid1] + sum1[ min(rem - 2*mid1, len1) ]\n\n        val2 = sum2[mid2] + sum1[ min(rem - 2*mid2, len1) ]\n\n        if val1 < val2:\n\n            low = mid1 + 1\n\n        else:\n\n            high = mid2 - 1\n\n    # After loop, low == high, check around it\n\n    # Check from max(0, low - 200) to min(y_max, low + 200)\n\n    # Or check all possible y in [low-2, low+2], but ensure within 0 and y_max.\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    for y in range(max(0, low - 200), min(y_max, low + 200) + 1):\n\n        current_val = sum2[y] + sum1[ min(rem - 2*y, len1) ]\n\n        if current_val > max_val:\n\n            max_val = current_val\n\n    return max_val\n\nBut why check 200 values? Because in some cases, the ternary search might not find the exact maximum due to the function not being perfectly unimodal. Adding this check ensures that we cover possible nearby values.\n\nBut how to choose the number of values to check. Well, 200 is arbitrary, but for the problem constraints, it should be acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, after the ternary search, check all possible y in the range [low-2, low+2], since the loop may have converged to a point near the maximum.\n\nBut this is just a heuristic.\n\nAlternatively, after the ternary search, check all y from 0 to y_max. But that would be O(y_max) time again, which brings us back to square one.\n\nBut given that the ternary search reduces the range to a small interval, checking a few hundred values around the found point is feasible.\n\nBut perhaps, in practice, after the ternary search, the correct maximum is in the vicinity of low. So checking a few hundred values is sufficient.\n\nNow, putting all this together.\n\nNow, considering the code structure:\n\nRead n and m.\n\nRead the next n lines, and split into three lists.\n\nSort each list in descending order.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each list.\n\nFor example, for weight 1:\n\nsum1 = [0]\n\nfor i in range(len(w1)):\n\n    sum1.append( sum1[-1] + w1[i].cost )\n\nSimilarly for sum2 and sum3.\n\nThen, for each possible z in 0 to len3:\n\n    if 3*z > m: continue\n\n    rem = m - 3*z\n\n    current_max = max_1_2(rem, sum1, len1, sum2, len2) \n\n    total = current_max + sum3[z]\n\n    keep track of the maximum total.\n\nNow, the question is, what is the maximum possible z? It's min( len3, m//3 )\n\nBut len3 can be up to n, which is 1e5. So for each z in 0 to min(len3, m//3), which can be up to 1e5,",
