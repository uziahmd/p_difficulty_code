The only difference is that in this version $$$n \\le 10^{18}$$$.One winter morning, Rudolf was looking thoughtfully out the window, watching the falling snowflakes. He quickly noticed a certain symmetry in the configuration of the snowflakes. And like a true mathematician, Rudolf came up with a mathematical model of a snowflake.He defined a snowflake as an undirected graph constructed according to the following rules:   Initially, the graph has only one vertex.  Then, more vertices are added to the graph. The initial vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ new vertices ($$$k > 1$$$).  Each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to $$$k$$$ more new vertices. This step should be done at least once. The smallest possible snowflake for $$$k = 4$$$ is shown in the figure.  After some mathematical research, Rudolf realized that such snowflakes may not have any number of vertices. Help Rudolf check whether a snowflake with $$$n$$$ vertices can exist.\n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.The first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$$$) — the number of vertices for which it is necessary to check the existence of a snowflake.\n\n## Output\nOutput $$$t$$$ lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case — \"YES\" if there exists such $$$k > 1$$$ that a snowflake with the given number of vertices can be constructed; \"NO\" otherwise.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['9\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n6\\n13\\n15\\n255\\n10101\\n1000000000000000000']\n\n### Output\n['NO\\nNO\\nNO\\nNO\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nYES\\nNO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine for a given n whether there exists a k>1 such that a snowflake graph with n vertices can be constructed. The problem says that the snowflake is built in a certain way. Let me try to understand the structure of the snowflake.\n\nThe initial graph starts with one vertex. Then, this vertex is connected to k new vertices. Then, each vertex that has only one connection (so those added in the first step) are each connected to k new vertices. And this process is done at least once. So, the construction is like a tree where each node has exactly k children except for the leaves. Wait, but the process is done step by step. Let me think about how the number of vertices grows.\n\nLet me think of the snowflake construction as layers. The first layer is the root. Then, the first expansion adds k children. Then, each of those k nodes gets k children. But this step must be done at least once. So the minimal snowflake would have 1 + k + k*k = 1 +k +k². For example, when k=4, the minimal is 1+4+16=21? But the example says that for n=13, the answer is YES. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the construction steps.\n\nWait the problem says: the initial vertex is connected to k new vertices. Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other (i.e., the ones added in the first step) are connected to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once. So the process is that after the initial step, we do at least one more step. So the minimal snowflake would be:\n\nInitial step: 1 node. Then add k nodes (total 1 +k). Then, each of those k nodes is connected to k new nodes. So adding k *k nodes. So total is 1 +k +k^2. For example, if k=2, then 1+2+4=7. So for n=7, it's possible.\n\nBut the example input includes n=13 and output is YES. Let's see. How can that be achieved?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the snowflake can be built with multiple layers. For example, the process is that after the initial step, you can perform multiple expansions. Each expansion step is: take all the leaves (nodes with degree 1), and add k children to each. So the number of vertices depends on how many times we do this expansion.\n\nLet me model this. Let's think of the snowflake as a tree. The root has k children. Each of these children has k children, and so on. But the expansion steps must be done at least once. So the tree has depth at least 2. Because the initial step is adding the first level, then the expansion step adds the second level. So the minimum depth is 2.\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait no. Let me think again. The initial step is adding k children. Then, each expansion step adds another level. So the number of levels is m+1, where m is the number of expansion steps. Let me think for m steps:\n\n- After the initial step (no expansion steps done yet?), or is the initial step part of the process?\n\nLet me re-read the problem statement:\n\nInitially, the graph has only one vertex. Then, more vertices are added. The initial vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices (k>1). Then, each vertex that is connected to only one other vertex is connected by edges to k new vertices. This step should be done at least once.\n\nSo the first step is adding the k children. Then, the \"step\" (the process of adding k children to each leaf) is done at least once. So the minimal case is:\n\nStart with 1 node. Add k nodes (total 1 +k). Then, do the step once: each of those k nodes (which are leaves) get k children. So adding k *k nodes. Total is 1 +k +k².\n\nSo the total number of nodes is 1 +k +k² + ... +k^m, where m is the number of expansion steps. Wait, no. Because the initial step is adding k children. Then, each expansion step adds a new level. Let me think:\n\nLet me model the number of nodes as follows. Let's say that the process has d levels. The root is level 0. Then, level 1 has k nodes. Level 2 has k² nodes, etc. The number of expansion steps is d-1, since the initial step (level 1) is done once, and then each expansion step adds a new level. But according to the problem statement, the expansion step",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine if a snowflake graph with exactly `n` vertices can be constructed for some integer `k > 1`. The snowflake graph is built in a specific hierarchical manner, and we need to check if such a configuration exists for the given `n`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Structure**: A snowflake graph starts with one vertex. This root vertex is connected to `k` new vertices (level 1). Each of these vertices then gets connected to `k` more new vertices (level 2), and this process continues for at least one additional step. The total number of vertices in such a graph after `m` expansion steps is given by the formula:\n   $$\n   n = 1 + k + k^2 + k^3 + \\ldots + k^m\n   $$\n   This is a geometric series sum, which can be simplified as:\n   $$\n   n = \\frac{k^{m+1} - 1}{k - 1}\n   $$\n\n2. **Constraints on `k`**: We need to check if there exists a `k > 1` such that the above equation holds true for a given `n`. The approach involves iterating over possible values of `k` and checking if `n` fits into the geometric series structure.\n\n3. **Efficient Checking**: For each test case, we iterate over possible values of `k` (starting from 2 up to a reasonable upper bound). For each `k`, we compute the maximum possible number of vertices using the geometric series formula and check if it matches `n`.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\n\ndef is_snowflake(n):\n    if n == 1:\n        return False\n    # Check for all possible k >= 2\n    # For each k, check if there exists m such that (k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1) == n\n    max_k = int(n ** (1/2)) + 2\n    for k in range(2, max_k + 1):\n        total = 1\n        current = 1\n        m = 0\n        while True:\n            next_term = current * k\n            if next_term > n:\n                break\n            total += next_term\n            m += 1\n            if total == n:\n                return True\n            current = next_term\n    # Also check for cases where m=1, which gives 1 + k + k^2\n    # But the loop above should cover that\n    # Additionally, check if n-1 is a power of k for some k\n    # For example, if n = 1 + k, then k = n-1, which must be >1\n    # So check if n-1 >1 and there exists a k such that n-1 = k\n    # Which is already covered in the loop\n    # Also check for cases where m=0?
