Aliens have already visited his field and left many different geometric figures on it. One of the figures is regular convex n-gon (regular convex polygon with n sides).That's why Mister B decided to use this polygon. Now Mister B must find three distinct vertices v1, v2, v3 such that the angle  (where v2 is the vertex of the angle, and v1 and v3 lie on its sides) is as close as possible to a. In other words, the value  should be minimum possible.If there are many optimal solutions, Mister B should be satisfied with any of them.\n\n## Input\nFirst and only line contains two space-separated integers n and a (3 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ a ≤ 180) — the number of vertices in the polygon and the needed angle, in degrees.\n\n## Output\nPrint three space-separated integers: the vertices v1, v2, v3, which form . If there are multiple optimal solutions, print any of them. The vertices are numbered from 1 to n in clockwise order.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 15', '4 67', '4 68']\n\n### Output\n['1 2 3', '2 1 3', '4 1 2']\n\n## Note\nIn first sample test vertices of regular triangle can create only angle of 60 degrees, that's why every possible angle is correct.Vertices of square can create 45 or 90 degrees angles only. That's why in second sample test the angle of 45 degrees was chosen, since |45 - 67| < |90 - 67|. Other correct answers are: \"3 1 2\", \"3 2 4\", \"4 2 3\", \"4 3 1\", \"1 3 4\", \"1 4 2\", \"2 4 1\", \"4 1 3\", \"3 1 4\", \"3 4 2\", \"2 4 3\", \"2 3 1\", \"1 3 2\", \"1 2 4\", \"4 2 1\".In third sample test, on the contrary, the angle of 90 degrees was chosen, since |90 - 68| < |45 - 68|. Other correct answers are: \"2 1 4\", \"3 2 1\", \"1 2 3\", \"4 3 2\", \"2 3 4\", \"1 4 3\", \"3 4 1\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem. So the problem is about finding three distinct vertices in a regular n-gon such that the angle at v2 is as close as possible to a given angle a. And then output those three vertices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand how the angles in a regular polygon work. Let me recall that in a regular n-gon, each interior angle is given by ((n-2)*180)/n degrees. But wait, that's the measure of each internal angle when you take two adjacent sides. However, the problem here isn't directly about those angles. Instead, we're looking at angles formed by three vertices where the middle vertex is the angle's vertex, and the other two are on the sides.\n\nSo, for example, in a square (n=4), if we pick vertices 1, 2, 3, the angle at 2 is 90 degrees. But if we pick vertices 1, 2, 4, then the angle at 2 would be 45 degrees. Wait, how does that happen?\n\nLet me think. In a regular polygon, the central angles (angles from the center to two adjacent vertices) are 360/n degrees. For any three vertices v1, v2, v3, the angle at v2 depends on how many steps apart v1 and v3 are from v2. For example, if v1 is k steps clockwise from v2, and v3 is m steps counterclockwise from v2, then the angle at v2 would be determined by the arc between v1 and v3. \n\nWait, maybe there's a formula for the angle formed at a vertex. Let me think. Suppose we have a regular n-gon. Let's consider the angle formed by three vertices v1, v2, v3 where v2 is the middle vertex. The angle at v2 depends on the number of sides between v1 and v3 when moving around the polygon. \n\nFor example, in a regular polygon, if we fix v2, then the angle between two adjacent vertices (like v2-1, v2, v2+1) would be the internal angle. But if we take vertices that are further apart, like skipping some vertices, the angle changes.\n\nI remember that in a regular polygon, the measure of an angle formed by three vertices with v2 as the middle vertex can be calculated based on the number of edges between v1 and v3. Let me think of it this way: the angle at v2 depends on how many vertices are between v1 and v3 along the perimeter. \n\nSuppose that between v1 and v3, there are k steps in one direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise). Then the angle at v2 is determined by k. For example, in a regular polygon, the angle formed by choosing two vertices that are k steps apart from v2 (in terms of the arc they span) would be something like (k-1)*central_angle? Or perhaps another formula.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in a regular polygon, the angle subtended at a vertex by two other vertices depends on the number of sides between them. For example, for a regular n-gon, if you have two vertices that are m steps apart (along the perimeter), then the angle at the vertex v2 would be (m * 180)/(n) ?\n\nWait, maybe I should look for a formula. Let me think of the regular polygon inscribed in a circle. All the vertices lie on a circle. Then, the angle at v2 would be an inscribed angle. \n\nThe central angle between v1 and v3 is (number of edges between them) multiplied by (360/n). Let's say that between v1 and v3, there are k steps in the arc that doesn't contain v2. Then the central angle is (k * 360)/n degrees. The inscribed angle subtended by that arc would be half of that, which is (k * 180)/n degrees. But wait, this is the angle if we have a triangle formed by v1, v2, v3, but with v2 not on the arc. Wait, no. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the arc between v1 and v3 (not passing through v2) is k steps, then the central angle is (k * 360)/n. The inscribed angle would be half of that. However, the angle at v2 is actually an inscribed angle that subtends the arc between v1 and v3. Wait, but if v2 is on the circumference, then the angle depends on which arc we take. \n\nWait, suppose that v1 and v3 are such that there are k edges between them along the arc that does not include v2. Then the angle at v2 would be equal to half the measure",
    "response": "To solve the problem of finding three vertices in a regular convex polygon such that the angle formed at one of them is as close as possible to a given value, we can approach it by understanding how angles are formed between vertices of a regular polygon.\n\n---\n\n### **Key Observations**\n\n1. **Regular Polygon and Inscribed Angles**:\n   - A regular polygon with `n` sides can be inscribed in a circle.\n   - The central angle between two adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{360^\\circ}{n} $.\n   - For any three distinct vertices $ v_1, v_2, v_3 $, the angle at $ v_2 $ depends on how many edges (steps) there are between $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $ along the arc that does **not** include $ v_2 $. Let this number be $ k $.\n   - The angle formed at $ v_2 $ is then:  \n     $$\n     \\theta = \\frac{(k-1) \\cdot 180^\\circ}{n}\n     $$\n     This formula gives the measure of the angle $ \\angle v_1v_2v_3 $, where $ k $ is the number of steps between $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $ **excluding** $ v_2 $.\n\n2. **Angle Range**:\n   - The minimum value of $ k $ is 2 (since $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $ must be distinct and not equal to $ v_2 $).\n   - The maximum value of $ k $ is $ n-2 $, since the arc between $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $ cannot contain all the other vertices.\n\n---\n\n### **Approach**\n\nWe aim to find the value of $ k $ such that the angle $ \\theta = \\frac{(k-1) \\cdot 180}{n} $ is closest to the given angle $ a $. Then, we can construct a valid triplet of vertices using this $ k $.\n\n- For each possible $ k $ from 2 to $ n-1 $, compute the angle $ \\theta $.\n- Find the $ k $ for which $ |a - \\theta| $ is minimized.\n- Once the best $ k $ is found, choose a vertex $ v_2 $, and then select $ v_1 $ and $ v_3 $ such that they are $ k $ steps apart in the clockwise direction.\n\n---\n\n### **Implementation Steps**\n\n1. Read the input values $ n $ and $ a $.\n2. Iterate over possible values of $ k $ from 2 to $ n-1 $.\n3. For each $ k $, calculate the corresponding angle $ \\theta $.\n4. Track the $ k $ that gives the angle closest to $ a $.\n5. Choose a vertex $ v_2 = 1 $ (arbitrary choice), and compute:\n   - $ v_1 = v_2 + 1 $\n   - $ v_3 = v_1 + k - 1 $ (mod $ n $ if needed)\n6. Print the resulting triplet $ v_1, v_2, v_3 $.\n\n---\n\n### **Python Code**\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, a = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    best_k = 2\n    min_diff = abs(a - ((best_k - 1) * 180 / n))\n    \n    for k in range(2, n):\n        current_angle = ((k - 1) * 180) / n\n        diff = abs(a - current_angle)\n        if diff < min_diff:\n            min_diff = diff\n            best_k = k\n    \n    v2 = 1\n    v1 = v2 + 1\n    v3 = v1 + best_k - 1\n    if v3 > n:\n        v3 -= n\n    \n    print(f\"{v1} {v2} {v3}\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### **Example Execution**\n\nFor input:\n```\n4 67\n```\n\nThe code will:\n- Try all values of $ k $ from 2 to 3.\n- For $ k = 2 $, angle is $ 45^\\circ $, difference is $ 22 $.\n- For $ k = 3 $, angle is $ 90^\\circ $, difference is $ 23 $.\n- So the best $ k = 2 $, and output is `2 1 3`.\n\nWhich matches the expected output: `2 1 3`.\n\n---\n\nThis solution runs in $ O(n) $ time, which is efficient for the given constraints ($ n \\leq 10^5 $).",
