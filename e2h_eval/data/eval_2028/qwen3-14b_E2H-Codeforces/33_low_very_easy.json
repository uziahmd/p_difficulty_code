You are also given a sequence of digits s of length m. The digit in position j (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of sequence s means that you can choose an arbitrary position i (1 ≤ i ≤ n) in a and replace the digit in the chosen position i with sj. Each element in the sequence s can participate in no more than one replacing operation.Your task is to perform such sequence of replacements, that the given number a gets maximum value. You are allowed to use not all elements from s.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains positive integer a. Its length n is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The second line contains sequence of digits s. Its length m is positive and doesn't exceed 105. The digits in the sequence s are written consecutively without any separators.The given number a doesn't contain leading zeroes. \n\n## Output\nPrint the maximum value that can be obtained from a after a series of replacements. You are allowed to use not all elements from s. The printed number shouldn't contain any leading zeroes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1024\\n010', '987\\n1234567']\n\n### Output\n['1124', '987']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to replace digits in a number with some given digits from a sequence to make the maximum possible number. Hmm. So the problem says that each element in the sequence s can be used at most once. And I can choose to use any number of them, not necessarily all. The goal is to maximize the number a after replacements.\n\nFirst, let me think about the approach. The key here is to replace the digits in a in such a way that the leftmost digits are as large as possible. Because the leftmost digits have higher weight. For example, if I have a number like 1024 and the sequence is 010, then the best is to replace the first 1 with 1 (but wait, the sequence has 0,1,0. Wait the example input was '1024' and s is '010', but the output is '1124'. Oh right, because the first digit is 1, and the s has digits 0,1,0. So the best is to replace the second digit (0) with 1, making it 1124. Oh right, because the first digit is 1, and the next digits can be replaced with higher digits.\n\nSo the strategy is: sort the sequence s in descending order. Then, for each digit in a from left to right, if the current digit is less than the next available digit in the sorted s, replace it. Otherwise, leave it. But wait, we need to process the digits in a in order, and for each position, choose the largest possible digit from s that hasn't been used yet.\n\nWait, but how to do that efficiently? Let's think. Let's sort the s in descending order. Then, for each digit in a, starting from the left, we check if the current digit is smaller than the next available digit in the sorted s. If yes, replace it, and move to the next digit in s. Otherwise, skip. Because replacing a digit in a more significant position (left) gives a higher gain.\n\nFor example, let's take the first sample input:\n\na is 1024, s is 010. So sorted s in descending order is 1,0,0. Now, iterate through a's digits:\n\nFirst digit is 1. Compare with the first element of s (1). Since 1 is not less than 1, we don't replace. Then move to the next digit in a.\n\nSecond digit is 0. Compare with the next s element (1). 0 < 1, so replace. Now, the s list is now [0,0]. Then proceed to third digit of a, which is 2. Compare with next s element (0). 2 is larger, so no replacement. Fourth digit is 4, same as before. So the result is 1124.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nAnother example: if a is 987 and s is 1234567. Then sorted s is 7654321. Now, check each digit of a:\n\nFirst digit is 9. Compare with 7. 9 is larger, so no replacement. Second digit is 8. Compare with 6. 8 is larger. Third digit is 7. Compare with 5. 7 is larger. So no replacements. So the output is 987. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the approach is:\n\n- Sort the s digits in descending order.\n\n- For each digit in a, from left to right:\n\n   - if the current digit is less than the next available digit in the sorted s, replace it and move to the next s digit.\n\n   - else, leave it.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line is a as a string. The second line is s as a string.\n\nThen, process s into a list of characters (digits), sort them in descending order.\n\nThen, iterate through each character in a. For each position, check if the current digit is less than the next available digit in the sorted s. If yes, replace it, and consume that s digit. Else, leave it.\n\nBut how to track which s digits are available. Since we sorted s in descending order, we can process them greedily. For example, we can have a pointer starting at 0. For each digit in a, if the current digit is less than s[pointer], then replace it and increment the pointer. Otherwise, leave it. But we can't go back. So the pointer starts at 0, and for each digit in a, if we can replace it, we do so, and move the pointer forward.\n\nWait, but this would require that we process the digits of a in order, and for",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we aim to maximize the value of a given integer `a` by replacing its digits using a sequence of digits `s`. The key is to replace digits in such a way that the leftmost (most significant) digits are as large as possible.\n\n---\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Sort the Sequence**: \n   - First, we sort the sequence `s` in descending order. This allows us to always try the largest available digit first when making replacements.\n\n2. **Greedy Replacement**:\n   - Traverse the digits of `a` from left to right.\n   - For each digit, if it is smaller than the next available digit in the sorted `s`, we replace it with that digit and move to the next digit in `s`.\n   - If not, we skip the replacement for that digit and proceed to the next one.\n\nThis greedy strategy ensures that we maximize the value of the number by improving the most significant digits first.\n\n---\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    a = input[0]\n    s = input[1]\n    \n    # Sort s in descending order\n    sorted_s = sorted(s, reverse=True)\n    \n    # Convert a to a list for easy manipulation\n    a_list = list(a)\n    s_ptr = 0  # Pointer to track the current position in sorted_s\n    \n    for i in range(len(a_list)):\n        if s_ptr < len(sorted_s) and a_list[i] < sorted_s[s_ptr]:\n            a_list[i] = sorted_s[s_ptr]\n            s_ptr += 1\n    \n    print(''.join(a_list))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, where the first line is the number `a` and the second line is the digit sequence `s`.\n- **Sorting**: The `s` string is sorted in descending order so that we can always try to use the largest available digit.\n- **Greedy Replacement**: We iterate through the digits of `a` and attempt to replace each digit with the largest possible digit from `s` (starting from the left), ensuring we maximize the number's value.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the constraints and guarantees the maximum possible number after allowed replacements.",
