Yesterday he got a huge Math hometask at school, so Valera didn't have enough time to properly learn the English alphabet for his English lesson. Unfortunately, the English teacher decided to have a test on alphabet today. At the test Valera got a square piece of squared paper. The length of the side equals n squares (n is an odd number) and each unit square contains some small letter of the English alphabet.Valera needs to know if the letters written on the square piece of paper form letter \"X\". Valera's teacher thinks that the letters on the piece of paper form an \"X\", if:  on both diagonals of the square paper all letters are the same;  all other squares of the paper (they are not on the diagonals) contain the same letter that is different from the letters on the diagonals. Help Valera, write the program that completes the described task for him.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (3 ≤ n < 300; n is odd). Each of the next n lines contains n small English letters — the description of Valera's paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint string \"YES\", if the letters on the paper form letter \"X\". Otherwise, print string \"NO\". Print the strings without quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['5\\nxooox\\noxoxo\\nsoxoo\\noxoxo\\nxooox', '3\\nwsw\\nsws\\nwsw', '3\\nxpx\\npxp\\nxpe']\n\n### Output\n['NO', 'YES', 'NO']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine if a given square grid forms the letter 'X' according to specific rules. The conditions are:\n\n1. Both diagonals of the square have the same letter.\n2. All other squares (not on the diagonals) have the same letter, which is different from the diagonal letters.\n\nSo, first, I need to check two main things: the diagonals and the non-diagonal elements.\n\nLet me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the diagonals. For a square of size n x n (n is odd), the main diagonal is from top-left to bottom-right. The other diagonal is top-right to bottom-left. All cells in these two diagonals must be the same. Also, all other cells must be the same and different from the diagonal's letter.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. Let's call this character 'd'.\n2. Check that all elements not on the diagonals are the same. Let's call this 'o'.\n3. Ensure that 'd' != 'o'.\n\nBut how do I check the diagonals and the non-diagonals?\n\nLet me think about how to iterate through the grid.\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\n- It's on the main diagonal if i == j.\n- It's on the anti-diagonal if i + j == n - 1.\n\nSo for each cell, check if it's on either of these diagonals.\n\nSo first, collect all the characters on the diagonals. Then check that they are all the same. Then collect all the other characters and check they are the same and different from the diagonal's character.\n\nBut wait, there's a possibility that the two diagonals have different characters. For example, if the main diagonal is 'x' and the anti-diagonal is 'y', then that's invalid. So the first step is to check that all elements on both diagonals are the same. So, collect all the elements from both diagonals and check that they are all the same.\n\nWait, but how to collect them? For example, for a 5x5 grid, the main diagonal has 5 elements, the anti-diagonal also has 5 elements. However, the center cell (i = n//2, j = n//2) is part of both diagonals. So when collecting, we need to make sure that we don't count duplicates. But since the problem says that both diagonals must have the same letters, even if they overlap (like the center cell), the check is that all elements in both diagonals are same. So, for example, if the main diagonal is all 'x' and the anti-diagonal is all 'x', then that's okay. But if the main diagonal is 'x' and anti is 'y', then no.\n\nSo the first step is to collect all the elements on the two diagonals. Then check that all of them are the same. Let's call this value d_char.\n\nThen, collect all the elements not on the diagonals. Check that all of them are the same, and that they are different from d_char.\n\nSo how to implement this?\n\nFirst, iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, check if it's on either diagonal. If yes, add to diagonal_chars. Else, add to other_chars.\n\nOnce all cells are processed, check:\n\n- All elements in diagonal_chars are same.\n- All elements in other_chars are same.\n- The two characters are different.\n\nBut wait, what if there are no other_chars? Like when n=1? But according to input constraints, n is at least 3. So for n=3, the diagonals have 3 elements each, but overlapping in the center. So the other_chars would be the elements not on diagonals. For example, in 3x3 grid, the diagonals have 3 elements each, but the center is counted once. So total diagonal elements are 3 + 3 - 1 = 5. The other elements are 9-5=4 elements.\n\nSo for the code:\n\nRead n, then read n lines, each line being a string of length n.\n\nThen, for each cell (i, j):\n\nCheck if i == j or i + j == n-1. If yes, it's part of the diagonals.\n\nElse, it's part of the others.\n\nSo collect all the diagonal characters and others.\n\nNow, check:\n\nIf the diagonal characters are all same, others are all same, and the two are different.\n\nBut how to check that?\n\nFor the diagonal characters: take the first element in diagonal_chars as d_char. Then check that all other elements in diagonal_chars are equal to d_char.\n\nSame for other_chars: take first element as o_char, check all others are same as o_char.\n\nThen check d_char !=",
