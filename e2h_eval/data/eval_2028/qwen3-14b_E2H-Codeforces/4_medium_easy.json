The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where two players play rock-paper-scissors for n rounds. Each has a sequence that they cycle through. I need to find out how many times each gets pinched (i.e., loses a round).\n\nFirst, let's understand the input. The first line is n, the number of rounds. Then the next two lines are the sequences A and B for Nikephoros and Polycarpus respectively. The sequences are strings of R, P, S.\n\nThe challenge is that n can be up to 2e9, which is way too big to simulate each round step by step. So we need an efficient approach here.\n\nSo the straightforward way would be to simulate each round, but with n up to 2e9, that's impossible. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats so that we can compute the number of wins in each cycle and multiply by the number of cycles, then add the remaining rounds.\n\nLet me think about the approach:\n\nEach player's move is cyclic. For example, Nikephoros's moves are A[0], A[1], ..., A[m-1], A[0], A[1], etc. Similarly for Polycarpus with B's sequence.\n\nSo for each round i (from 0 to n-1), the move of Nikephoros is A[i % m], and Polycarpus is B[i % k]. Then we determine who wins each round.\n\nBut for n up to 2e9, we can't iterate through each of the n rounds. So we need to find the number of rounds where Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses.\n\nSo the key idea is to find the number of rounds in the combined cycle of m and k. Let's think about the least common multiple (LCM) of m and k. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, the pattern of moves for both players will repeat. So if we can compute the number of wins in one LCM cycle, then multiply by the number of full cycles, and then add the remaining rounds.\n\nBut how do I compute the number of wins in each cycle?\n\nLet me think. Let's compute the total number of rounds in a full cycle, which is LCM(m, k). Let's call this cycle_length.\n\nThen, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_length. And the remaining_rounds = n % cycle_length.\n\nSo for each full cycle, we can precompute how many times Nikephoros loses (so that's the number of red spots for him) and same for Polycarpus. Then multiply by total_cycles. Then for the remaining_rounds, we simulate each of those rounds and add the counts.\n\nBut how to compute the number of losses in one cycle?\n\nSo for each round in the cycle (from 0 to cycle_length - 1), we can compute the moves of Nikephoros and Polycarpus. Then determine who wins. Then accumulate the counts.\n\nBut what is cycle_length? It's LCM(m, k). But m and k can be up to 1000, so LCM(m, k) could be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000 is 1e6). So for each cycle, we have to process up to 1e6 rounds, which is manageable.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute m and k as the lengths of A and B.\n\n2. Compute LCM of m and k. Let's call it cycle_length.\n\n3. For each round in 0 to cycle_length - 1:\n\n   a. Get Nikephoros's move: A[i % m]\n\n   b. Get Polycarpus's move: B[i % k]\n\n   c. Determine the outcome. If Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus gets a spot. If Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot. Else, nothing.\n\n   d. Keep track of the total number of spots for each in a full cycle.\n\n4. Then, the total number of full cycles is total_cycles = n // cycle_length.\n\n   The remaining rounds is rem = n % cycle_length.\n\n   So, the total spots for each is (full_cycle_count * total_cycles) + the count from the rem rounds.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n- Compute the number of spots in a single cycle (cycle_length rounds).\n\n- Multiply by total_cycles.\n\n- Then compute the spots for the remaining rem rounds.\n\nBut how to compute the spots in the cycle?\n\nYes. Now, the question is, how to compute for each round in the cycle.\n\nBut for each i in 0 to cycle_length - 1:\n\nNikephoros's move is A[i % m], and Polycarpus's move is B[i % k].\n\nSo, for each i in 0 to cycle_length - 1, we can compute the moves and check who wins.\n\nBut since m and k can be up to 1000, the cycle_length can be up to 1e6. Which is acceptable for processing.\n\nSo, for example, if m=3, k=4, then cycle_length is 12. So for each of the 12 rounds, we compute the moves and the outcome.\n\nOnce we have the counts for a full cycle, then we can compute the total.\n\nNow, the problem is to compute the number of times Nikephoros loses and Polycarpus loses in the cycle.\n\nSo, for each round in the cycle, we can check:\n\nif a beats b: then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's loss count increases by 1? Wait no: the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser, so he gets a spot. So Nikephoros's red spots are the number of times he loses.\n\nSo for each round, we need to determine whether Nikephoros loses (so his count increases by 1) or Polycarpus loses (his count increases by 1).\n\nSo for each pair of moves (a, b):\n\nif a == b: nothing.\n\nelse:\n\n   if a beats b: Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot (so Nikephoros's count is not increased, but Polycarpus's count increases by 1?)\n\nWait, the problem says: the loser gets pinched. So in each round, the loser is the one who gets a spot. So:\n\nIf Nikephoros wins, then Polycarpus is the loser. So Polycarpus's spot count increases by 1.\n\nIf Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros is the loser. So Nikephoros's spot count increases by 1.\n\nIf it's a draw, nothing.\n\nSo for each round, we need to determine whether Nikephoros loses (add to his count) or Polycarpus loses (add to his count).\n\nSo for each pair (a, b):\n\ndetermine the outcome.\n\nSo, how to check if a beats b?\n\nWe can create a helper function. For example:\n\ndef beats(a, b):\n\n    return (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R')\n\nIf beats(a, b) is True, then a beats b. So if a is Nikephoros's move and b is Polycarpus's move, then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\nSo for each round:\n\nif a == b: nothing.\n\nelse:\n\n   if beats(a, b): then Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus's count +=1.\n\n   else: Polycarpus wins. Nikephoros's count +=1.\n\nSo that's the way to compute the counts.\n\nNow, the plan is:\n\nCompute the full cycle counts (for a full cycle_length rounds), then multiply by the number of full cycles, then add the counts for the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM of m and k.\n\nCompute cycle_length = LCM(m, k).\n\nCompute for each round in 0..cycle_length-1:\n\n   a = A[i % m]\n\n   b = B[i % k]\n\n   determine outcome, and accumulate the counts for the cycle.\n\nThen, total_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nrem = n % cycle_length\n\ntotal_nik = 0\n\ntotal_poly = 0\n\ntotal_nik += (nik_cycle_count * total_cycles)\n\ntotal_poly += (poly_cycle_count * total_cycles)\n\nThen, process the rem rounds (from 0 to rem-1) similarly, adding to the totals.\n\nSo the problem is to compute for the cycle_length rounds, and then for the rem rounds.\n\nBut how to compute LCM?\n\nWell, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So we need to compute the GCD.\n\nIn Python, we can compute GCD using math.gcd, but note that math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for Python 3.5 and above, it's available.\n\nBut since m and k are positive integers, we can compute GCD(m, k), then LCM is m*k // gcd.\n\nSo, code steps for that.\n\nNow, for the example given:\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo A is \"RPS\", m=3.\n\nB is \"RSPP\", k=4.\n\nLCM(3,4) is 12.\n\nSo for 12 rounds, we compute the counts.\n\nBut n is 7, which is less than 12. So total_cycles is 0, rem is 7.\n\nSo we process the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut in the sample explanation, the output is 3 and 2.\n\nSo let's check that.\n\nBut let's think about the code.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle large n. So the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nImplementing the helper function to check if a beats b.\n\nBut perhaps we can precompute for all possible pairs.\n\nAlternatively, for each a and b, check the conditions.\n\nNow, for each i in 0 to cycle_length - 1:\n\nCompute a = A[i % m], b = B[i % k]\n\nCheck if a and b are same. If not, check who wins.\n\nNow, the code can be written as follows.\n\nBut for the code, in Python, the problem is that for very large n, but since cycle_length is up to 1e6 (as m and k are up to 1e3), then even 1e6 operations are manageable.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m and k.\n\nCompute GCD(m, k), then LCM.\n\nThen compute the counts for the cycle.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for the code:\n\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\ndef compute_gcd(a, b):\n\n    return math.gcd(a, b)\n\ngcd_val = compute_gcd(m, k)\n\ncycle_length = m * k // gcd_val\n\n# Now compute for each of the cycle_length rounds.\n\nnik_cycle = 0\n\npoly_cycle = 0\n\nfor i in range(cycle_length):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    # else determine who wins\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot.\n\n        poly_cycle +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\n        nik_cycle +=1\n\ntotal_cycles = n // cycle_length\n\nrem = n % cycle_length\n\n# Now compute the total for the full cycles.\n\ntotal_nik = nik_cycle * total_cycles\n\ntotal_poly = poly_cycle * total_cycles\n\n# Now process the rem rounds.\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        total_poly +=1\n\n    else:\n\n        total_nik +=1\n\nprint(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, let's test this code.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=7\n\nA is RPS (m=3)\n\nB is RSPP (k=4)\n\ncycle_length is 3*4 / gcd(3,4) = 12 / 1 = 12.\n\nSo for the cycle_length of 12 rounds, let's compute nik_cycle and poly_cycle.\n\nLet's simulate each of the 12 rounds:\n\nRound 0:\n\ni=0: a = A[0%3] = A[0] = 'R'; b = B[0%4] = B[0] = 'R'. Same, nothing.\n\nRound 1: i=1: a=A[1%3]=A[1] = 'P'; b=B[1%4]=B[1]='S'. P vs S. S beats P? Wait:\n\nWait, the condition for Nikephoros winning is (a beats b). So for a='P', b='S': S beats P? Wait, no. The rules are:\n\nRock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, paper beats rock.\n\nSo, 'P' (paper) beats 'R' (rock). 'S' (scissors) beats 'P' (paper). 'R' beats 'S'.\n\nSo for a='P' and b='S': S beats P. So Nikephoros's move is P, which is beaten by S. So Polycarpus wins. So Nikephoros gets a spot. So in this case, the code would check if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'). For a=P, b=S: none of these conditions are true. So the else clause is executed. So Nikephoros's count is increased.\n\nSo in this case, the code adds 1 to total_nik.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, the first round was R vs R (draw), then P vs S (Nikephoros loses?), but according to the sample explanation:\n\nIn the first sample, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R (draw).\n\nRound 2: P vs S (Nikephoros loses? Or wins?)\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\nIn the first sample, the game went like this:\n\nRound 1: R - R. Draw.\n\nRound 2: P - S. Nikephoros loses? Or wins?\n\nWait, in the sample explanation, the second round is P vs S. According to the rules, scissors beats paper. So if Nikephoros plays P (paper) and Polycarpus plays S (scissors), then Polycarpus wins. So Nikephoros loses. So his count increases by 1. Which is what the code would do here.\n\nBut according to the sample explanation, in the first sample, Nikephoros has 3 losses and Polycarpus has 2. Let's see.\n\nBut let's proceed with the code simulation.\n\nSo let's go through each of the 12 rounds.\n\nBut perhaps I can check for the first 7 rounds (since n=7) and see.\n\nBut maybe the code is correct. Let's check the sample input.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=7.\n\nIn the code, the cycle_length is 12. So total_cycles is 7//12 = 0, rem=7.\n\nSo the code processes the first 7 rounds.\n\nLet's simulate each of the 7 rounds:\n\nFor i from 0 to 6 (since rem is 7, the loop runs for i in 0..6):\n\nRound 0: i=0:\n\na = A[0%3] = A[0] = R.\n\nb = B[0%4] = B[0] = R. Same. No change.\n\nRound 1: i=1:\n\na = A[1%3] = A[1] = P.\n\nb = B[1%4] = B[1] = S.\n\nP vs S: S beats P. So Nikephoros loses. So total_nik +=1.\n\nRound 2: i=2:\n\na = A[2%3] = A[2] = S.\n\nb = B[2%4] = B[2] = P.\n\nS vs P: S beats P. Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot (total_poly +=1).\n\nRound 3: i=3:\n\na = A[3%3] = A[0] = R.\n\nb = B[3%4] = B[3] = P.\n\nR vs P: P beats R. So Nikephoros loses. total_nik +=1.\n\nRound 4: i=4:\n\na = A[4%3] = A[1] = P.\n\nb = B[4%4] = B[0] = R.\n\nP vs R: P beats R. Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot (total_poly +=1).\n\nRound 5: i=5:\n\na = A[5%3] = A[2] = S.\n\nb = B[5%4] = B[1] = S.\n\nSame. No change.\n\nRound 6: i=6:\n\na = A[6%3] = A[0] = R.\n\nb = B[6%4] = B[2] = P.\n\nR vs P: P beats R. Nikephoros loses. total_nik +=1.\n\nSo after processing the 7 rounds, total_nik is 3 (from rounds 1, 3, 6?), let's see:\n\nLet me recount:\n\nRound 1: total_nik +=1 → 1.\n\nRound 2: total_poly +=1 → 1.\n\nRound 3: total_nik +=1 → 2.\n\nRound 4: total_poly +=1 → 2.\n\nRound 5: nothing.\n\nRound 6: total_nik +=1 → 3.\n\nSo total_nik is 3, total_poly is 2. Which matches the sample output. So the code seems to work for this case.\n\nAnother sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). So m=8, k=1.\n\nLCM(8,1) is 8.\n\nFor each of the 8 rounds:\n\neach round, a is R, b is R. All draws. So in the cycle, nik_cycle and poly_cycle are 0.\n\nn=5, which is 5//8=0 cycles, rem=5. So for 5 rounds, all draws. So output is 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nThus, the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when the cycle_length is larger than n?\n\nYes, the code handles that.\n\nNow, the code's time complexity is O(cycle_length) which is O(1e6) in worst case. Which is acceptable.\n\nBut for m and k up to 1000, their LCM can be up to 1e6 (since 1000*1000 = 1e6). So for each test case, the code will run in O(1e6) time, which is acceptable for Python.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n\nNow, let's code this in Python.\n\nBut note that in Python, the input is read from stdin. The first line is n, then the next line is A, then the next line is B.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem statement, the input is given as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nWait, but that's probably a representation of the input. So in reality, the input is:\n\nThe first line is n, then the second line is A, then third line is B.\n\nSo the code should read:\n\nn = int(input())\n\nA = input().strip()\n\nB = input().strip()\n\nBut need to make sure that the input is read correctly. For example, if there are leading/trailing spaces, but the problem says that the input is given as per the problem statement, so the code can assume that the input is correct.\n\nSo the code is as written before.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\ndef compute_gcd(a, b):\n    return math.gcd(a, b)\n\ngcd_val = compute_gcd(m, k)\ncycle_length = m * k // gcd_val\n\nnik_cycle = 0\npoly_cycle = 0\n\nfor i in range(cycle_length):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        poly_cycle += 1\n    else:\n        nik_cycle += 1\n\ntotal_cycles = n // cycle_length\nrem = n % cycle_length\n\ntotal_nik = nik_cycle * total_cycles\ntotal_poly = poly_cycle * total_cycles\n\nfor i in range(rem):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        total_poly += 1\n    else:\n        total_nik += 1\n\nprint(total_nik, total_poly)\n\nThis should be the code.\n\nTesting the first sample input:\n\nSample Input:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nOutput: 3 2.\n\nWhich matches.\n\nAnother sample input:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nOutput: 0 0.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother test case: when n is exactly the cycle_length.\n\nBut I think the code is correct.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase where m=1, k=1. So cycle_length is 1. For each round, check if the two elements are same. If not, determine who wins.\n\nAnother edge case: when n is zero? But according to the problem statement, n is at least 1.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nYes.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors using their respective cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently handle up to 2 billion rounds by leveraging the cyclic nature of the players' strategies.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences to choose their moves.

This allows us to efficiently compute the results for multiple cycles.\n4. **Handling Full Cycles and Remainder**: After determining the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds, we multiply the losses per cycle by the number of full cycles and add the results from the remaining rounds.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently handle very large numbers of rounds without explicitly simulating each round, leveraging mathematical properties of cycles and LCM to minimize computations.",
