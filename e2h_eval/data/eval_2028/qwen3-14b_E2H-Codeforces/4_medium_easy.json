The loser gets pinched (not too severely!).Let us remind you the rules of this game. Rock-paper-scissors is played by two players. In each round the players choose one of three items independently from each other. They show the items with their hands: a rock, scissors or paper. The winner is determined by the following rules: the rock beats the scissors, the scissors beat the paper and the paper beats the rock. If the players choose the same item, the round finishes with a draw.Nikephoros and Polycarpus have played n rounds. In each round the winner gave the loser a friendly pinch and the loser ended up with a fresh and new red spot on his body. If the round finished in a draw, the players did nothing and just played on.Nikephoros turned out to have worked out the following strategy: before the game began, he chose some sequence of items A = (a1, a2, ..., am), and then he cyclically showed the items from this sequence, starting from the first one. Cyclically means that Nikephoros shows signs in the following order: a1, a2, ..., am, a1, a2, ..., am, a1, ... and so on. Polycarpus had a similar strategy, only he had his own sequence of items B = (b1, b2, ..., bk).Determine the number of red spots on both players after they've played n rounds of the game. You can consider that when the game began, the boys had no red spots on them.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·109) — the number of the game's rounds.The second line contains sequence A as a string of m characters and the third line contains sequence B as a string of k characters (1 ≤ m, k ≤ 1000). The given lines only contain characters \"R\", \"S\" and \"P\". Character \"R\" stands for the rock, character \"S\" represents the scissors and \"P\" represents the paper.\n\n## Output\nPrint two space-separated integers: the numbers of red spots Nikephoros and Polycarpus have.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\n### Output\n['3 2', '0 0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the game went like this:  R - R. Draw.  P - S. Nikephoros loses.  S - P. Polycarpus loses.  R - P. Nikephoros loses.  P - R. Polycarpus loses.  S - S. Draw.  R - P. Nikephoros loses. Thus, in total Nikephoros has 3 losses (and 3 red spots), and Polycarpus only has 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about simulating a Rock-Paper-Scissors game between two players who have cyclic strategies. We need to find out how many times each loses in n rounds. But since n can be up to 2e9, simulating each round step by step is impossible. So we need an efficient way to calculate this without iterating through all n rounds.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Each player uses their own sequence, which repeats cyclically. For example, if Nikephoros's sequence is \"RPS\", then his moves are R, P, S, R, P, S, etc. Similarly for Polycarpus's sequence.\n\nFor each round i (from 0 to n-1?), we need to determine what move each player makes. Then determine who wins, and increment the respective counts.\n\nBut with n up to 2e9, we can't check each round individually. So we need to find a pattern or cycle that repeats, compute the number of wins in one cycle, then multiply by the number of full cycles and add the remaining rounds.\n\nThe key idea here is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of the two sequences. Because after LCM(m, k) rounds, both sequences will have completed an integer number of cycles, and the pattern of moves will repeat. So, the total number of rounds can be divided into full cycles of LCM(m, k) and a remainder.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Find the LCM of m and k. Let's call it lcm_length.\n2. Compute how many full cycles of lcm_length there are in n rounds, and the remaining rounds after that.\n3. For each full cycle, compute how many times Nikephoros and Polycarpus lose. Multiply by the number of full cycles.\n4. For the remaining rounds, simulate them normally.\n\nBut first, how do we compute the number of losses in one lcm_length rounds?\n\nTo compute that, we need to simulate each round in the lcm_length period. For each round in this period, determine the moves of both players, check who wins, and accumulate the counts.\n\nBut since m and k can be up to 1000, the LCM could be up to 1e6 (since 1000 and 1000 have LCM 1e6). So for each lcm_length, which is up to 1e6, we can simulate each round once, and compute the number of losses per cycle.\n\nOnce we have that, the total number of losses would be:\n\nfull_cycles = n // lcm_length\nremainder = n % lcm_length\n\ntotal_nik_losses = full_cycles * nik_per_cycle + nik_in_remainder\nsame for polycarpus.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n- Compute the LCM of m and k.\n- Simulate for lcm_length rounds, compute how many times each loses in that period.\n- Then compute how many full cycles there are, and multiply by the per-cycle counts.\n- Then simulate the remaining rounds (up to lcm_length - 1) and add those counts.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute the moves for each round. For round i (starting from 0?), the move for Nikephoros is A[i % m], and for Polycarpus is B[i % k].\n\nSo for each round in 0 to lcm_length-1, we can compute the moves, check the outcome, and accumulate the counts.\n\nSo the first thing is to compute LCM of m and k.\n\nHow to compute LCM? Well, LCM(a,b) = a*b / GCD(a,b). So we need to compute GCD.\n\nIn Python, we can use math.gcd, but note that in Python 3, math.gcd returns the absolute value, and for positive integers, it's okay. So for m and k, compute GCD, then LCM.\n\nOnce we have the LCM, let's proceed.\n\nNow, for the simulation part. Let's say for each round in 0 to lcm_length-1, we compute the moves, compare, and count how many times each loses.\n\nBut for each round, how to determine who wins?\n\nThe rules are:\n\n- Rock beats scissors (R beats S)\n- Scissors beat paper (S beats P)\n- Paper beats rock (P beats R)\n- Same: draw.\n\nSo for each pair (a, b), where a is Nikephoros's move, and b is Polycarpus's move, determine the outcome.\n\nIf a == b: nothing.\n\nElse:\n\nCheck if a beats b. If yes, then Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus gets a spot. Else, Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot.\n\nSo for each (a, b) pair, we can write a helper function to determine who wins.\n\nLet me think about how to code that. For example, if a is 'R' and b is 'S', Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. So for each round, we can check:\n\nif a == b: no loss.\n\nelse:\n\nif (a, b) is in the winning combinations for Nikephoros, then Polycarpus's loss count increases by 1. Otherwise, Nikephoros's loss count increases by 1.\n\nWhat are the winning combinations for Nikephoros?\n\nNikephoros wins when:\n\na is R and b is S\n\na is S and b is P\n\na is P and b is R\n\nSo for each (a, b), if it's one of these three cases, Nikephoros wins. Else, if it's not a draw, then Polycarpus wins.\n\nSo, perhaps a helper function:\n\ndef get_winner(a, b):\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        return 0  # draw\n\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        return 1  # Nikephoros wins, so Polycarpus loses\n\n    else:\n\n        return -1  # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros loses\n\nSo for each round, based on the moves, we can determine who loses.\n\nSo for the simulation of the lcm_length rounds, we can loop from 0 to lcm_length - 1, compute a and b for each round, check the outcome, and accumulate the counts.\n\nOnce we have the counts per cycle, then multiply by full_cycles, and then process the remaining rounds.\n\nNow, the problem is that for n up to 2e9, and lcm_length up to 1e6, the total steps for the simulation are O(1e6), which is acceptable.\n\nSo the steps for code:\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM(m, k) as lcm_length.\n\nCompute the number of full cycles: full_cycles = n // lcm_length\n\nremainder_rounds = n % lcm_length\n\nNow, compute for one lcm_length cycle:\n\nnik_losses_cycle = 0\n\npol_losses_cycle = 0\n\nfor i in 0 ... lcm_length - 1:\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    determine outcome, add to nik_losses_cycle and pol_losses_cycle.\n\nThen, total_nik = full_cycles * nik_losses_cycle + ... for the remainder.\n\nBut then, for the remainder_rounds, we need to simulate the first remainder_rounds rounds of the cycle.\n\nWait, but for remainder_rounds, it's the first remainder_rounds rounds in the cycle. So for i from 0 to remainder_rounds - 1, compute the same as before.\n\nSo, the code can be structured as follows.\n\nBut how to handle the remainder_rounds? Let's say that for the remainder, we loop from 0 to remainder_rounds - 1, and compute the same way.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ntotal_nik = 0\n\ntotal_pol = 0\n\nfor each full cycle:\n\n    add nik_losses_cycle and pol_losses_cycle\n\nthen for the remainder:\n\nfor i in 0 to remainder_rounds - 1:\n\n    compute a and b, check outcome, add to total_nik and total_pol.\n\nBut how to compute the remainder_rounds?\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code steps.\n\nBut first, how to compute LCM.\n\nImplementing LCM in Python:\n\nimport math\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nBut note that for Python 3.9+, math.lcm exists, but perhaps in coding competition environments, it's better to compute it ourselves. However, given that the code is for a programming competition, and the problem says that m and k are up to 1000, the code can compute LCM as a * b // gcd(a, b).\n\nSo, in code:\n\nm = len(A)\n\nk = len(B)\n\ng = math.gcd(m, k)\n\nlcm_length = m * k // g\n\nOnce that's computed, proceed.\n\nNow, for the simulation part.\n\nBut for large lcm_length (like 1e6), looping through 1e6 steps is manageable. Since 1e6 is acceptable for Python.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nCompute for the full cycle:\n\nnik_cycle = 0\n\npol_cycle = 0\n\nfor i in range(lcm_length):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    # determine outcome\n\n    if a == b:\n\n        continue\n\n    elif (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n\n        # Nikephoros wins, Polycarpus gets a spot\n\n        pol_cycle += 1\n\n    else:\n\n        # Polycarpus wins, Nikephoros gets a spot\n\n        nik_cycle += 1\n\nThen, total_nik = full_cycles * nik_cycle + ... the remainder.\n\nSimilarly for the remainder_rounds.\n\nThen, for the remainder, we need to loop through the first remainder_rounds rounds, and compute the same.\n\nBut how to compute that? Well, for the remainder_rounds, we can loop from 0 to remainder_rounds - 1, and for each i, compute a and b, and check the outcome.\n\nSo:\n\nremainder = n % lcm_length\n\nnik_remain = 0\n\npol_remain = 0\n\nfor i in range(remainder):\n\n    a = A[i % m]\n\n    b = B[i % k]\n\n    ... same as before, adding to nik_remain and pol_remain.\n\nThen, total_nik = full_cycles * nik_cycle + nik_remain\n\ntotal_pol = full_cycles * pol_cycle + pol_remain\n\nSo, the final answer is total_nik and total_pol.\n\nBut wait, the variables are:\n\nWait, in the full_cycles, each cycle contributes nik_cycle (number of times Nikephoros lost in that cycle) and pol_cycle (number of times Polycarpus lost in that cycle). So, the total for Nikephoros is full_cycles * nik_cycle + nik_remain, and same for Polycarpus.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, let's test this approach against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo, A is \"RPS\" (m=3), B is \"RSPP\" (k=4).\n\nCompute LCM(3,4) = 12.\n\nSo, for lcm_length=12, simulate 12 rounds.\n\nLet's compute for each round i in 0..11:\n\ni: 0 to 11.\n\nFor each i, compute a = A[i%3], b = B[i%4].\n\nLet's list them:\n\ni | i%3 | A | i%4 | B | outcome\n0 | 0 | R | 0 | R → draw. No loss.\n1 | 1 | P | 1 | S → P vs S. S beats P? Wait, no. Wait, Nikephoros's move is P, Polycarpus's is S. S beats P? No, according to the rules: S beats P, so if a is P and b is S, then the winner is Polycarpus. Because S beats P. So in this case, Nikephoros's move is P, which is beaten by S (Polycarpus's move). So Nikephoros loses. So Nikephoros's loss count increases by 1.\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nIf a is P (paper) and b is S (scissors). Scissors beats paper. So the winner is Polycarpus. So Nikephoros loses. So in this case, the code would add to nik_cycle (Nikephoros's loss count) by 1.\n\nLet me go through the sample's example.\n\nSample Input:\n\nn=7 rounds.\n\nIn the sample explanation, the rounds are:\n\nRound 1: R vs R → draw.\n\nRound 2: P vs S → Nikephoros loses (because S beats P). So Polycarpus's loss count? No. Wait, the problem says that the loser gets pinched. So if Nikephoros loses, he gets a spot. So for the first sample, the output is 3 for Nikephoros and 2 for Polycarpus.\n\nSo in the sample's first round, it's a draw. Then, in the second round, Nikephoros's move is P, Polycarpus's is S. So S beats P. So Nikephoros loses, so his count increases by 1.\n\nBut according to the code's logic, in the case where a is P and b is S, the code checks:\n\nIs a == b? No.\n\nIs (a, b) in the winning conditions for Nikephoros? The winning conditions are:\n\na is R and b is S → Nikephoros wins.\n\na is S and b is P → Nikephoros wins.\n\na is P and b is R → Nikephoros wins.\n\nIn this case, a is P, b is S. None of those conditions. So the code would return that Polycarpus wins, so Nikephoros's loss count increases by 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo for the sample's first example, let's simulate the 12 rounds.\n\nBut maybe it's easier to check for the first sample's case.\n\nBut perhaps the code would handle that correctly.\n\nNow, the code for the sample:\n\nn=7, lcm_length is 12. So full_cycles is 7//12 = 0, remainder is 7.\n\nSo the code would simulate the first 7 rounds.\n\nBut let's compute for the first 7 rounds.\n\nLet me list the rounds:\n\nRound 0 (i=0):\n\nA[0%3] = A[0] = R\n\nB[0%4] = B[0] = R → draw. No loss.\n\nRound 1 (i=1):\n\nA[1%3] = A[1] = P\n\nB[1%4] = B[1] = S → P vs S. S beats P → Nikephoros loses. So nik_cycle +=1.\n\nRound 2 (i=2):\n\nA[2%3] = A[2] = S\n\nB[2%4] = B[2] = P → S vs P. S beats P → Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus loses. So pol_cycle +=1.\n\nRound 3 (i=3):\n\nA[3%3=0] = R\n\nB[3%4=3] = B[3] = P → R vs P. P beats R → Polycarpus wins. Nikephoros loses. So nik_cycle +=1.\n\nRound 4 (i=4):\n\nA[4%3=1] = P\n\nB[4%4=0] = R → P vs R. P beats R → Nikephoros wins. Polycarpus loses. pol_cycle +=1.\n\nRound 5 (i=5):\n\nA[5%3=2] = S\n\nB[5%4=1] = S → S vs S → draw.\n\nRound 6 (i=6):\n\nA[6%3=0] = R\n\nB[6%4=2] = P → R vs P → P beats R. Nikephoros loses. nik_cycle +=1.\n\nSo for the first 7 rounds, the nik_cycle is 3 (rounds 1, 3, 6?), and pol_cycle is 2 (rounds 2 and 4).\n\nWhich matches the sample's output of 3 and 2.\n\nSo the code would compute for remainder_rounds =7, and in that case, the nik_remain is 3 and pol_remain is 2. So the total is 3 and 2, which is correct.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nAnother sample input is given as:\n\nInput:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nWhich outputs 0 0.\n\nBecause all rounds are draws. So for each round, both play R. So no losses.\n\nSo the code would compute that.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input correctly. The input is given as:\n\nThe first line is n.\n\nSecond line is sequence A.\n\nThird line is sequence B.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the input is written as:\n\n['7\\nRPS\\nRSPP', '5\\nRRRRRRRR\\nR']\n\nBut in reality, the input is read as three lines: first line is n, second is A, third is B. So in the first example, the input is:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nSo the code should read n as int(input()), then A as input().strip(), then B as input().strip().\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nImport math.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead A and B.\n\nCompute m = len(A), k = len(B).\n\nCompute LCM.\n\nCompute full_cycles = n // lcm_length.\n\nremainder = n % lcm_length.\n\nCompute per cycle counts.\n\nCompute remainder counts.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut for very large n, like 2e9, and lcm_length up to 1e6, this approach is feasible.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut for the code, need to handle the case when lcm_length is zero? No, since m and k are >=1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport math\n\nn = int(input())\nA = input().strip()\nB = input().strip()\n\nm = len(A)\nk = len(B)\n\ndef compute_lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n\nlcm_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n\n# Compute per cycle counts\nnik_cycle = 0\npol_cycle = 0\n\nfor i in range(lcm_length):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    # Check if Nikephoros wins\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        pol_cycle += 1  # Polycarpus loses\n    else:\n        nik_cycle += 1  # Nikephoros loses\n\nfull_cycles = n // lcm_length\nremainder = n % lcm_length\n\n# Compute remainder counts\nnik_remain = 0\npol_remain = 0\n\nfor i in range(remainder):\n    a = A[i % m]\n    b = B[i % k]\n    if a == b:\n        continue\n    if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n        pol_remain += 1\n    else:\n        nik_remain += 1\n\ntotal_nik = full_cycles * nik_cycle + nik_remain\ntotal_pol = full_cycles * pol_cycle + pol_remain\n\nprint(total_nik, total_pol)\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first example's output is 3 2. Let's check:\n\nIn the code, for the first sample, full_cycles is 7//12=0. So total_nik is 0 * nik_cycle (which is 3?) plus nik_remain (3). Similarly for pol_cycle: 0 * ... + 2. So output is 3 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut what is the value of nik_cycle and pol_cycle in the first sample?\n\nWell, in the first sample, the code for the lcm_length=12 rounds would compute the number of losses in each cycle. But since the sample has n=7, which is less than 12, the full_cycles is zero, and the remainder is 7. So the code for the remainder runs 7 rounds, which gives the correct counts.\n\nBut what if the full_cycles is non-zero?\n\nLet me think of another example. Suppose n is 12 + 7 = 19. Then full_cycles is 1, remainder is 7. So the code would compute the per cycle counts (for 12 rounds) and multiply by 1, then add the 7 rounds.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut let's think about the case where the LCM is larger than n. Like when n is smaller than the LCM. Then, the code correctly processes the remainder.\n\nAnother test case: when n is 0? But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nNow, what about when m or k is 1?\n\nLike, for example, A is \"R\", B is \"R\". Then all rounds are draws. So output is 0 0.\n\nAnother case: A is \"R\", B is \"S\". Then, for each round, Nikephoros's move is R, B's is S. So Nikephoros wins. So Polycarpus gets a spot. So for n=5, output is 0 5.\n\nBut according to the code:\n\nlcm_length is LCM(1,1) = 1. So per cycle, for i=0:\n\na is R, b is S. Nikephoros wins. So pol_cycle is 1.\n\nfull_cycles = 5 // 1 =5. remainder is 0.\n\nSo total_pol = 5*1 + 0 =5. total_nik is 0. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, let's check the second sample input:\n\nSample input:\n\n5\n\nRRRRRRRR\n\nR\n\nSo A is \"RRRRRRRR\" (length 8), B is \"R\" (length 1). LCM(8, 1) is 8.\n\nFor each of the 8 rounds:\n\neach round, a is R, b is R. So all draws. So per cycle, nik_cycle and pol_cycle are 0. So for n=5, full_cycles =5//8=0, remainder=5. So simulate 5 rounds, which are all draws. So output 0 0. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written, handling all the steps. Also, note that for very large values of n, like 2e9, but the code runs in O(1e6) steps, which is acceptable.\n\nNow, implement this in Python. Also, note that for the input, the second line is the sequence A, and the third line is sequence B. The code reads them correctly.\n\nSo the code is as written above.\n\nNow, test it with the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\n7\n\nRPS\n\nRSPP\n\nThe code would read n=7, A is \"RPS\", B is \"RSPP\".\n\nm=3, k=4. LCM(3,4)=12.\n\nThen, for the 12 rounds:\n\nLet me compute the nik_cycle and pol_cycle.\n\nBut for the code, during the loop for i in 0 to 11:\n\nLet me compute each round:\n\ni=0:\n\na=R, b=R → draw. No change.\n\ni=1:\n\na=P, b=S → P vs S. S beats P. So Nikephoros loses → nik_cycle +=1.\n\ni=2:\n\na=S, b=P → S beats P.

So the code processes 7 rounds (i from 0 to 6):\n\nWhich are:\n\ni=0 → no change.\n\ni=1 → nik +=1 (total 1)\n\ni=2 → pol +=1 (total 1)\n\ni=3 → nik +=1 (total 2)\n\ni=4 → pol +=1 (total 2)\n\ni=5 → no change.\n\ni=6 → nik +=1 (total 3)\n\nSo nik_remain is 3, pol_remain is 2. Which matches the sample. Thus, the code would output 3 2.\n\nBut according to the code's calculation for the full cycle, the per cycle counts are 4 and 4. But since full_cycles is 0, the code adds only the remainder counts. Which is correct.\n\nThus, the code works.\n\nAnother example: if n is 12, then full_cycles is 1, remainder is 0. So total_nik = 4, total_pol =4. Which would be the case for 12 rounds.\n\nBut in that case, the total number of losses for each would be 4 and 4. But in the 12 rounds, how many times each lost?\n\nWell, for each of the 12 rounds, there are 4 losses for Nikephoros and 4 for Polycarpus. So the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of red spots (losses) each player accumulates after playing a specified number of rounds of rock-paper-scissors using cyclic strategies. The challenge is to efficiently compute the results even when the number of rounds is very large (up to 2 billion).\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding Cyclic Strategies**: Both players use cyclic sequences of moves. Nikephoros's sequence repeats every `m` rounds, and Polycarpus's sequence repeats every `k` rounds.\n2. **Cycle Detection**: The key insight is that the combined sequence of moves from both players will repeat every least common multiple (LCM) of `m` and `k` rounds. This allows us to compute the number of losses for one full cycle and then use this to calculate the total losses for all rounds.\n3. **Efficient Simulation**: By simulating the game for one LCM cycle, we can determine how many times each player loses in that cycle. For large numbers of rounds, we compute the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds separately.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef main():\n    n = int(input())\n    A = input().strip()\n    B = input().strip()\n    \n    m = len(A)\n    k = len(B)\n    \n    def compute_lcm(a, b):\n        return a * b // math.gcd(a, b)\n    \n    lcm_length = compute_lcm(m, k)\n    \n    nik_cycle = 0\n    pol_cycle = 0\n    \n    for i in range(lcm_length):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            pol_cycle += 1\n        else:\n            nik_cycle += 1\n    \n    full_cycles = n // lcm_length\n    remainder = n % lcm_length\n    \n    nik_remain = 0\n    pol_remain = 0\n    \n    for i in range(remainder):\n        a = A[i % m]\n        b = B[i % k]\n        if a == b:\n            continue\n        if (a == 'R' and b == 'S') or (a == 'S' and b == 'P') or (a == 'P' and b == 'R'):\n            pol_remain += 1\n        else:\n            nik_remain += 1\n    \n    total_nik = full_cycles * nik_cycle + nik_remain\n    total_pol = full_cycles * pol_cycle + pol_remain\n    \n    print(total_nik, total_pol)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input consists of the number of rounds `n`, followed by the move sequences for Nikephoros and Polycarpus.\n2. **LCM Calculation**: The LCM of the lengths of the two sequences determines the length of the repeating cycle of moves.\n3. **Cycle Simulation**: We simulate the game for one full LCM cycle to count how many times each player loses in that cycle.\n4. **Full Cycles and Remainder**: Using the number of full cycles and the remaining rounds, we compute the total number of losses by multiplying the cycle counts by the number of full cycles and adding the losses from the remaining rounds.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the large number of rounds by leveraging the repeating nature of the cyclic strategies, ensuring the solution is computed in linear time relative to the LCM of the sequence lengths, which is feasible given the constraints.",
