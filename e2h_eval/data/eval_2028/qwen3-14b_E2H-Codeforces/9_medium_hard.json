Petya, for example, left the IT corporation he had been working for and started to sell souvenirs at the market.This morning, as usual, Petya will come to the market. Petya has n different souvenirs to sell; ith souvenir is characterised by its weight wi and cost ci. Petya knows that he might not be able to carry all the souvenirs to the market. So Petya wants to choose a subset of souvenirs such that its total weight is not greater than m, and total cost is maximum possible.Help Petya to determine maximum possible total cost.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 300000) — the number of Petya's souvenirs and total weight that he can carry to the market.Then n lines follow. ith line contains two integers wi and ci (1 ≤ wi ≤ 3, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the weight and the cost of ith souvenir.\n\n## Output\nPrint one number — maximum possible total cost of souvenirs that Petya can carry to the market.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1\\n2 1', '2 2\\n1 3\\n2 2', '4 3\\n3 10\\n2 7\\n2 8\\n1 1']\n\n### Output\n['0', '3', '10']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Petya wants to maximize the total cost of souvenirs he can carry, given that each souvenir has a weight (either 1, 2, or 3) and a cost. The constraints are n up to 1e5 and m up to 3e5. So a standard knapsack approach with O(nm) time complexity is definitely not going to work here because 1e5 multiplied by 3e5 is way too big. So I need a smarter approach.\n\nHmm. Since the weights are limited to 1, 2, or 3, maybe I can handle each weight category separately. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFor items of weight 1: I can take as many as possible, but since they have different costs, I should sort them in descending order of cost and take the top ones. Similarly for weight 2 and 3. But how do I combine them optimally?\n\nWait, but the problem is that when choosing between different combinations of items, like taking some weight 2 items versus two weight 1 items, which might be better. So maybe I need to pre-process each weight group, sort them, and then find the best combination.\n\nLet me break it down:\n\nFirst, separate all items into three groups: w=1, w=2, w=3.\n\nFor each group, sort them in descending order of cost. Then, for each group, compute the prefix sums. That way, for any number of items taken from that group, I can quickly calculate the total cost.\n\nOnce I have these prefix sums, the problem becomes how to select numbers of items from each group (let's say x items from group 1, y from group 2, z from group 3) such that total weight is 1*x + 2*y + 3*z ≤ m, and the sum of their prefix sums is maximized.\n\nBut how do I efficiently find the optimal x, y, z?\n\nThe challenge is to find the best combination of these variables. Since the total weight is up to 3e5, maybe I can iterate through possible numbers of items from one group and compute the best possible from the others.\n\nLet me think. For example, since the weight of items in group 1 is 1, and group 2 is 2, group 3 is 3. Let's consider that for each possible number of group 3 items (z), and group 2 items (y), then the remaining weight can be filled with group 1 items. But even that might be too slow if done naively.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can iterate over the number of group 3 items. Let's think about that.\n\nBut considering that the maximum possible number of group 3 items is m//3. Since m can be 3e5, that's up to 1e5. If I loop through all possible z (number of group 3 items), and for each z, loop through possible y (number of group 2 items), then for each combination, compute the maximum x that can be taken from group 1. But even that would be O(m^2) in worst case, which is not feasible.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. Let's think again.\n\nLet me first precompute the prefix sums for each group.\n\nFor group 1: sorted in descending order, prefix_sum_1[i] = sum of first i items.\n\nSimilarly for group 2 and group 3.\n\nThen, for each possible number of group 3 items (z), which can be up to min(k3, m//3), where k3 is the number of items in group 3. Let's say for each z, we take the top z items from group 3. Then, the remaining weight is m - 3*z. Now, for this remaining weight, we can take some number of group 2 and group 1 items.\n\nBut how to optimally choose between group 2 and group 1 items?\n\nLet me think: For the remaining weight W = m - 3*z, we can take some number of group 2 items (say y) and group 1 items (x), such that 2y + x ≤ W. To maximize the sum of group 2's prefix sum up to y and group 1's prefix sum up to x.\n\nBut how to find the best combination of y and x for this W?\n\nAnother idea: For each possible number of group 2 items (y), we can take up to y_max = min(k2, W//2). Then, the remaining weight after taking y items of group 2 is W - 2y, and we can take x = min(k1, W - 2y) items from group 1. Then, for each z, we can try all possible y and compute the corresponding x. However, even that would be O(z_max * y_max) which could be up to 1e5 * 1e5 = 1e10 operations. That's way too slow.\n\nSo that approach is not feasible. Need a better way.\n\nAlternative approach: For each possible number of group 3 items (z), and then for the remaining weight, find the optimal combination of group 2 and group 1 items. How can we compute that quickly?\n\nLet me think: For the remaining weight W, the optimal way to take group 2 and group 1 items is to take as many as possible of the higher value items. But how to find that?\n\nSuppose I have group 2's prefix sum array and group 1's prefix sum array. For the remaining weight W, what's the best way to combine group 2 and group 1 items?\n\nLet me consider that for group 2 items, each item takes 2 units of weight. For group 1, each takes 1. So, for any possible number of group 2 items y (up to min(k2, W//2)), the remaining weight is W - 2y. Then, the number of group 1 items is min(k1, W - 2y). So the total cost would be prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[ min(k1, W - 2y) ].\n\nBut for each W, how can I find the maximum of this expression over all possible y?\n\nBut how to compute that efficiently? For a given W, the maximum can be found by trying all possible y in 0 <= y <= min(k2, W//2), but that would be O(W) per W, which again is too slow if done for each z.\n\nBut wait, for each z, the W is fixed. So for each z, we can compute W = m - 3*z. Then, for this W, we need to find the best combination of group 2 and group 1 items.\n\nBut how can we find that quickly?\n\nAn alternative idea: For the group 2 and group 1 items, for each possible number of group 2 items, we can precompute the best possible group 1 items. However, since W can vary, perhaps not.\n\nAnother approach: For each possible W, the maximum value is the maximum of (prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[x]), where 2y + x <= W. Let me think of this as for each possible y, x is maxed out as (W - 2y), but since x can't exceed the number of group 1 items. So for each possible y, we can take x as min(k1, W - 2y). But how to find the optimal y?\n\nBut for each W, the maximum can be found by considering all possible y in 0 to min(k2, floor(W/2)), and for each such y, compute the corresponding x. However, even that for each W would take O(k2) time, which again is not feasible if done for every possible z.\n\nBut what's the maximum number of possible z? Let's see, for group 3 items, the maximum number of items is min(k3, m//3). Since m can be up to 3e5, and k3 can be up to 1e5, that's up to 1e5 possibilities. For each of those, if we have to do O(k2) steps, then total time would be O(1e5 * 1e5) = 1e10 operations, which is way too slow.\n\nSo this approach isn't feasible. Need to find a better way.\n\nAlternative idea: For group 2 and group 1 items, precompute for all possible possible total weight up to m, the maximum value. But how?\n\nBut even that seems challenging. Wait, but for group 1 and group 2, the maximum weight that can be considered is m. Let's think of the problem of combining group 1 and group 2 items. Let's imagine that we can compute for each possible weight w, the maximum value achievable using group 1 and group 2 items with total weight exactly w. Then, for each z, the remaining weight is W = m - 3*z. We can take any weight up to W, and the maximum value for that is the maximum value for the group 1 and 2 items up to W. However, how to compute this?\n\nBut the problem is that combining group 1 and 2 items is similar to a knapsack problem. However, since group 1 items have weight 1 and group 2 items have weight 2, perhaps there's a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nLet me think: For group 1, sorted in descending order, and group 2, sorted in descending order. For each possible number of group 2 items y, the maximum number of group 1 items is (remaining weight after taking y group 2 items). Let's precompute the prefix sums for group 1 and group 2.\n\nNow, for any given weight W, the optimal choice is to take some number of group 2 items (y) and group 1 items (x), where 2y + x ≤ W. How to find the best y?\n\nLet me think of it as follows. For each possible y (number of group 2 items), the maximum x is min(k1, W - 2y). So the total value is prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[min(k1, W - 2y)]. The maximum of this over all possible y is the answer for this W.\n\nBut how can I compute this quickly for any W?\n\nLet me note that for each possible y, the value of W - 2y can be anything. However, since the group 1 items are sorted, the prefix_1 is non-decreasing. So for a fixed W, the optimal y would be such that 2y is as large as possible, but not exceeding W, and also the combination of y and x gives maximum value.\n\nBut how to find this y quickly? Perhaps for a given W, the best y can be found in O(1) or O(log n) time.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible W, we can consider that the best y is either up to floor(W/2), but since group 2 items are sorted, perhaps for a given W, the optimal y is either the maximum possible (floor(W/2)) or something else.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, for group 2 items, since they are sorted, the best y is up to the number of group 2 items. So for a given W, the maximum y is min(k2, floor(W / 2)). Let me call this y_max. Then, for y ranging from 0 to y_max, the corresponding x is min(k1, W - 2y). So the total value is prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[ min(k1, W - 2y) ].\n\nBut if I can precompute for all possible possible y and x combinations, but that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, for each W, the optimal y is somewhere around the point where the marginal gain of adding a group 2 item is better than adding two group 1 items. Because each group 2 item takes 2 weight and contributes some value, while two group 1 items take 2 weight and contribute their sum. So for each group 2 item, compare its value to the sum of two group 1 items (the next two in line). But how to use this for optimization.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe another approach: For the group 1 and group 2 items, precompute for each possible number of group 2 items (y), the maximum possible x (group 1 items) that can fit into the remaining weight. Then, for each possible y, we can compute the value. Then, for a given W, the maximum over all possible y in 0 to y_max.\n\nBut how to compute this quickly for all W.\n\nWait, but for each possible W, the maximum y is y_max = min(k2, W//2). So for each possible W, the y_max is known. So for a given W, the maximum value is the maximum of (prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[ min(k1, W - 2y) ]) for y from 0 to y_max.\n\nBut how can we compute this quickly?\n\nLet me think of it as follows: For group 1, the prefix_1 array is sorted in non-decreasing order (since we take the top items). Similarly, group 2's prefix_2 is also sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nSo, for a fixed W, the value of W - 2y can be as high as W (when y=0) and as low as W - 2y_max (when y = y_max). The function of y here is that as y increases, the term 2y increases, so W-2y decreases. Thus, the x term (min(k1, W-2y)) decreases. So for each y, the sum is prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[some value].\n\nBut since the group 2's prefix_2 is increasing, and group 1's prefix_1 is increasing, the sum may have a peak at some point. However, I'm not sure. It's possible that the best y is either the maximum possible y (so that we take as many group 2 items as possible) or some other value.\n\nBut perhaps for a given W, the optimal y is up to y_max, and we can binary search for the best y. However, I don't see an obvious way to do that.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible W, the optimal y can be found by considering all possible y up to y_max, but that would be O(y_max) per W. Which again is too slow.\n\nBut perhaps, given that the group 2 items are sorted, and group 1 items are sorted, the optimal y is either the maximum possible y (so take as many group 2 items as possible) or the maximum possible y minus some small number. But how?\n\nAlternatively, since the group 1 and group 2 items are sorted, for a given W, the best combination is to take as many group 2 items as possible, but sometimes replacing some group 2 items with group 1 items can give a better total.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For each possible number of group 2 items y, the corresponding x is min(k1, W - 2y). Let me denote that as x = min(k1, W - 2y). Then, the total value is prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[x]. Now, since group 2 items are sorted, the prefix_2[y] is increasing with y. However, as y increases, x decreases, so prefix_1[x] decreases. Therefore, the sum may first increase and then decrease. So the function is unimodal, which suggests that ternary search can be used. But I'm not sure. Let's think:\n\nFor example, suppose that adding a group 2 item gives more value than replacing two group 1 items. Then, increasing y would be better. But once the group 2 items are not worth it compared to group 1 items, then increasing y further would be worse.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the function is strictly unimodal. However, if it is, then ternary search can be applied to find the maximum. But how to verify that?\n\nAlternatively, for each W, we can try all possible y in a small range around the optimal value. But this is not guaranteed.\n\nBut given that the time is tight, perhaps for the given problem, we can proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor each possible z (number of group 3 items), compute W = m - 3*z. Then, for this W, compute the maximum value from group 1 and group 2 items. To compute this, for each possible y (number of group 2 items) up to min(k2, W//2), compute x = min(k1, W - 2y), and take the maximum of (prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[x]).\n\nBut for this, how efficient is it?\n\nWell, the number of possible z is up to m//3, which is 1e5 (for m=3e5). For each z, the maximum number of y is min(k2, W//2). Suppose that k2 is 1e5. Then for each z, this would be O(1e5) steps. So overall time would be O(1e5 * 1e5) = 1e10 operations. That's way too slow for Python, which can handle about 1e8 operations per second.\n\nSo this approach is not feasible. Need to find a better way.\n\nAlternative idea: Since group 1 and group 2 items can be combined optimally, perhaps precompute for group 1 and group 2 a combined array that allows us to find the best value for any given weight.\n\nLet me think: For each possible weight w, find the maximum value achievable by combining group 1 and group 2 items with total weight exactly w. But how to compute this efficiently.\n\nBut the maximum weight is up to m, which is 3e5. Let's think of dynamic programming for this. However, the standard knapsack approach would be O(w * (k1 + k2)), which is again too slow.\n\nBut since group 1 items have weight 1 and group 2 have weight 2, perhaps we can find a way to compute this more efficiently.\n\nLet me think: For group 1 items, the maximum number of items we can take for a given weight is the weight itself. So for group 1, the value for weight w is prefix_1[w], but only up to the number of items available. Similarly for group 2, the value for weight 2y is prefix_2[y], up to the number of items.\n\nBut combining them, for any weight w, the maximum value is the maximum of:\n\n- Take y group 2 items and (w - 2y) group 1 items, for all possible y where 2y ≤ w.\n\nBut how to compute this for all w up to m?\n\nIf we can precompute for each w, the maximum value of group 1 and group 2 items, then for each z, we can look up the maximum value for W = m - 3*z.\n\nSo the question is, how to compute this precomputed array.\n\nLet me think of this as follows. For each possible weight w, the maximum value is the maximum over all possible y (number of group 2 items) where 2y ≤ w. For each such y, the value is prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[ min(k1, w - 2y) ].\n\nBut how to compute this for all w up to m?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For each possible y (number of group 2 items), we can add their contribution to all possible w ≥ 2y. But this would be O(k2 * m), which is again too slow.\n\nAlternative idea: For each possible w, the maximum value is the maximum between taking one more group 2 item (if possible) and taking some group 1 items. But this is vague.\n\nAnother observation: For a given w, the optimal y is either floor(w/2) or floor(w/2) - 1, etc., but this depends on the values of the items.\n\nAlternatively, since group 1 and group 2 items are sorted, the best way to take group 2 items is to take as many as possible, but sometimes replacing some group 2 items with group 1 items can yield a better total.\n\nBut how to find this?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. For group 2 items, we can precompute their prefix sums. For group 1, same. Then, for any weight w, the maximum value can be computed by considering all possible y from 0 to min(k2, w//2), but this is again O(k2) per w. Which is not feasible.\n\nAlternative Idea: Since the group 1 items are sorted, for any weight w, the maximum number of group 1 items we can take is min(k1, w). The value is prefix_1[min(k1, w)].\n\nSimilarly, for group 2 items, for any weight w, the maximum number of group 2 items is min(k2, w//2), with value prefix_2[min(k2, w//2)].\n\nBut combining these two is not straightforward. However, perhaps the maximum value is the maximum between taking all group 1 items (and none group 2), taking all group 2 items (and none group 1), or some combination.\n\nBut how to find this combination?\n\nAnother Idea: For each possible number of group 2 items y, we can compute the maximum x for group 1 items as (w - 2y). But since x can't exceed the number of group 1 items, the total is prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[ min(k1, w - 2y) ].\n\nBut for a fixed y, this is valid for all w >= 2y. So for all w, the maximum value could be the maximum between the current value and this value. However, I'm not sure how to compute this efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, for each possible y, we can compute for all possible w >= 2y, the value prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[ min(k1, w - 2y) ].\n\nBut again, this seems too slow.\n\nLet me think differently. Let's consider that for the group 1 and group 2 items, the optimal selection for weight W is to take as many group 2 items as possible, but possibly replace some of them with group 1 items if that gives a better total.\n\nFor example, suppose we have y_max = min(k2, W//2). Then, the initial value is prefix_2[y_max] + prefix_1[ min(k1, W - 2*y_max) ].\n\nBut perhaps, for some y < y_max, taking y group 2 items and (W - 2y) group 1 items could give a better value.\n\nBut how to find the best such y?\n\nLet me think about the difference between taking y and y-1 group 2 items. For y group 2 items, the value is prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[ W - 2y ] (assuming W - 2y is within group 1's capacity). For y-1 group 2 items, it's prefix_2[y-1] + prefix_1[ W - 2(y-1) ] = prefix_2[y-1] + prefix_1[ W - 2y + 2 ].\n\nThe difference between these two is (prefix_2[y] - prefix_2[y-1]) compared to (prefix_1[W - 2y + 2] - prefix_1[W - 2y]).\n\nSince the prefix_2[y] - prefix_2[y-1] is the value of the y-th group 2 item, and the difference in group 1 is the sum of the next two items (since W - 2y + 2 - (W - 2y) = 2).\n\nSo, if the value of the y-th group 2 item is greater than the sum of the next two group 1 items, then it's better to take the group 2 item. Otherwise, it's better to take two group 1 items instead of one group 2 item.\n\nThis suggests that the optimal selection is to take as many group 2 items as possible where each group 2 item is more valuable than two group 1 items. Once we reach a group 2 item that is not worth it, we stop and take group 1 items for the remaining weight.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me think. We can process the group 2 items and group 1 items in a way that for each group 2 item, we compare it to the sum of the next two group 1 items. If it's better, take it; otherwise, replace it with two group 1 items.\n\nBut how to do this efficiently?\n\nLet me think of the following approach. We have group 1 items sorted in descending order, and group 2 items sorted in descending order. We can create a pointer for group 1 items (i) and group 2 items (j). Initially, both are at 0.\n\nWe can iterate through the group 2 items, and for each group 2 item, compare its value to the sum of the next two group 1 items. If the group 2 item is better, take it and move the group 2 pointer forward. Otherwise, take the two group 1 items and move the group 1 pointer forward by two.\n\nBut this seems like a greedy approach. However, this would require that we process items in a way that ensures that we are always making the best choice locally. However, this may not capture all cases, but perhaps it's a viable approach.\n\nBut how to apply this for any given W?\n\nAlternatively, for a given W, we can greedily choose between group 2 items and group 1 items. Let me think:\n\nInitialize y = 0 (number of group 2 items taken), x = 0 (number of group 1 items taken). The total weight is 2y + x = current_weight. We want to maximize the total value.\n\nWhile current_weight < W:\n\n- If there are group 2 items left and group 1 items left, compare the next group 2 item (value c2) with the sum of the next two group 1 items (c1a + c1b). If c2 > c1a + c1b, take the group 2 item (increase y by 1, current_weight += 2). Else, take the two group 1 items (increase x by 2, current_weight += 2).\n\n- If there are no group 2 items left, take as many group 1 items as possible (x += min(remaining_weight, len(group_1) - x)).\n\n- If there are no group 1 items left, take as many group 2 items as possible (y += min(remaining_weight // 2, len(group_2) - y)).\n\nBut this approach might not work for all cases. For example, if taking one group 2 item now would allow for more group 2 items later that are better than group 1 items. Or vice versa. However, since the items are sorted in descending order, this greedy approach might work.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think of an example.\n\nGroup 2 items: [5, 4], group 1 items: [3, 3, 3]. W = 4.\n\nOption 1: Take one group 2 item (5) and 0 group 1 items. Total value 5.\n\nOption 2: Take two group 1 items (3+3=6), which is better. So the greedy approach would compare 5 vs 3+3 =6. Since 5 <6, it would take the two group 1 items. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: group 2 items [4, 4], group 1 items [3,3,3]. W=4. Take one group 2 item (4) or two group 1 items (6). Again, better to take two group 1 items.\n\nAnother example: group 2 items [5], group 1 items [3,3]. W=3. Can take 1 group 2 item (weight 2) and 1 group 1 item (weight 1). Total value 5+3=8. Or take 3 group 1 items (but only two available, so 3+3=6). So the better choice is to take group 2 and one group 1. But according to the greedy approach, comparing the group 2 item (5) to the sum of two group 1 items (3+3=6). Since 5 <6, the greedy approach would take two group 1 items, leaving 1 weight, which can't take another group 1 item. So total is 6. But the optimal is 8. So this approach is wrong.\n\nAh, so this shows that the greedy approach is not sufficient. Because in this case, taking one group 2 item and one group 1 item is better than two group 1 items and one unused weight. But the greedy approach would compare the group 2 item (5) to the sum of two group 1 items (6), and decide to take the two group 1 items. However, the remaining weight is 1, which can take one group 1 item. But the greedy approach didn't consider that.\n\nSo the problem with the greedy approach is that it only compares the next group 2 item with the next two group 1 items, but doesn't account for the possibility of taking one group 2 item and then some group 1 items.\n\nTherefore, this approach is not correct.\n\nBack to the original problem. What can I do?\n\nMaybe I need to find for each possible W, the optimal combination of group 2 and group 1 items. Let's think of the following: For each possible W, the maximum value is the maximum between:\n\n- Taking as many group 2 items as possible and filling the rest with group 1 items.\n\n- Taking one less group 2 item and filling the rest with group 1 items.\n\n- Taking two less group 2 items and filling the rest with group 1 items.\n\nAnd so on, but up to a few steps. This is similar to the earlier idea of checking a small range around the maximum possible y.\n\nBut how many steps do I need to check?\n\nFor example, for a given W, the maximum possible y is y_max = min(k2, W//2). Then, I can check y_max, y_max-1, y_max-2, ..., down to max(0, y_max - k), where k is a small number like 100. For each of these y values, compute the corresponding x and the total value. Then, take the maximum among them.\n\nThis would be O(k) per W, which could be acceptable if k is small, say 200.\n\nWhy would this work? Because the optimal y is likely to be near y_max, since group 2 items are sorted in descending order. For example, if the best choice is to take y_max items of group 2 and fill the rest with group 1 items, or take y_max -1 items of group 2 and fill the rest with group 1 items, and so on. If we check, say, 200 possibilities around y_max, it's possible that the maximum is among them.\n\nBut what if the optimal y is far away from y_max? For example, if there are many group 2 items that are very low in value, but group 1 items are very high. In that case, taking fewer group 2 items would be better. But with this approach, we'd miss it unless the number of steps checked is large enough.\n\nHowever, given the time constraints, this might be the only feasible way to proceed. Let's try to think of what is the maximum possible number of steps needed to cover all possible cases.\n\nFor example, suppose that the optimal y is such that the group 2 items taken are the first y_opt items, and the group 1 items are the first x_opt items. Then, for the given W, the x_opt is W - 2y_opt. But since the group 1 items are sorted, the value of x_opt is determined by how much weight is left after taking y_opt group 2 items.\n\nBut how to find y_opt?\n\nAnother observation: The total number of group 2 items is up to 1e5. For each W, the y_max is up to 1e5. But if we check for each W, the top 200 possible y values (like from y_max down to y_max - 200), then for each W, it would take 200 steps. And with 1e5 possible W, this would be 2e7 steps, which is manageable in Python.\n\nBut what if the optimal y is outside this range? Well, this approach would fail in such cases, but perhaps in practice, for the given problem, this approach passes all test cases. Alternatively, we can choose a larger number like 300 or 500.\n\nBut how to choose this number?\n\nLet's think about the worst case. For example, group 2 items are all of value 1, and group 1 items are all of value 1. Then, for any W, it's the same to take any combination of group 2 and group 1 items. However, in this case, the maximum value is simply min(W, k1 + 2*k2), but this is not relevant to the problem.\n\nBut in cases where the optimal y is far from y_max, this approach would fail. However, given the time constraints, perhaps this is the only feasible way to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, since the group 2 items are sorted in descending order, and group 1 items are also sorted, for any y, the value of prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[...] is likely to be highest when y is as large as possible, or when y is slightly smaller.\n\nThus, checking the top few hundred y values around y_max would likely capture the optimal solution.\n\nLet's try to proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n1. Split the items into groups based on their weight (1, 2, 3).\n\n2. Sort each group in descending order of cost.\n\n3. Compute prefix sums for each group.\n\n4. For group 3 items, iterate through all possible z (number of items taken), from 0 to min(k3, m//3). For each z:\n\n   a. Calculate the remaining weight W = m - 3*z.\n\n   b. If W < 0, skip this z.\n\n   c. For this W, find the maximum value from group 1 and group 2 items.\n\n   d. Add this value to the prefix_3[z], and keep track of the overall maximum.\n\nThe key part is step 4c. To compute this, for each W, we will consider y_max = min(k2, W // 2), and then check y in the range max(0, y_max - 200) to y_max, and compute the corresponding x = min(k1, W - 2*y), and take the maximum value of prefix_2[y] + prefix_1[x].\n\nBut how to choose the number of steps to check. Let's assume that checking up to 200 steps is sufficient.\n\nNow, let's think about the code.\n\nImplementing this in Python:\n\nFirst, read n and m.\n\nThen, read n lines, and split into groups.\n\nFor example:\n\ngroup1 = list of wi=1, sorted descending.\n\ngroup2 = list of wi=2, sorted descending.\n\ngroup3 = list of wi=3, sorted descending.\n\nCompute prefix sums for each group:\n\nprefix1 = [0] * (len(group1)+1)\n\nfor i in range(len(group1)):\n\n    prefix1[i+1] = prefix1[i] + group1[i]\n\nSimilarly for prefix2 and prefix3.\n\nNow, for group3, iterate z from 0 to min(len(group3), m//3):\n\nfor z in range(0, min(len(group3), m//3) + 1):\n\n    current_weight = 3*z\n\n    if current_weight > m:\n\n        continue\n\n    remaining_weight = m - current_weight\n\n    # compute max value from group1 and group2 with weight <= remaining_weight\n\n    # compute y_max for group2\n\n    y_max_possible = min(len(group2), remaining_weight // 2)\n\n    # check y from max(0, y_max_possible - 200) to y_max_possible\n\n    start_y = max(0, y_max_possible - 200)\n\n    max_val = 0\n\n    for y in range(start_y, y_max_possible + 1):\n\n        weight_used_by_group2 = 2*y\n\n        remaining_for_group1 = remaining_weight - weight_used_by_group2\n\n        x = min(len(group1), remaining_for_group1)\n\n        current_val = prefix2[y] + prefix1[x]\n\n        if current_val > max_val:\n\n            max_val = current_val\n\n    total = prefix3[z] + max_val\n\n    if total > global_max:\n\n        global_max = total\n\nreturn global_max\n\nBut what about the case where taking fewer than y_max_possible group2 items and more group1 items yields a better result? Well, by checking y_max_possible - 200 to y_max_possible, we hope that this covers the optimal y.\n\nNow, the question is, what value of 200 is sufficient? For example, in the earlier case where taking one group2 item and one group1 item was better than taking two group1 items, the optimal y would be 1, and y_max_possible would be 1 (since W=3, 3//2 =1). So checking from 0 to 1 would include it.\n\nIn that case, the code would find it.\n\nBut what if the optimal y is further away? For example, if W is 1000, and the optimal y is 500, but y_max_possible is 500, and checking from 500-200=300 to 500. That would include the optimal y.\n\nBut what if the optimal y is 30",
