Now he has completed his most ingenious program yet — it calculates the maximum flow in an undirected graph. The graph consists of n vertices and m edges. Vertices are numbered from 1 to n. Vertices 1 and n being the source and the sink respectively.However, his max-flow algorithm seems to have a little flaw — it only finds the flow volume for each edge, but not its direction. Help him find for each edge the direction of the flow through this edges. Note, that the resulting flow should be correct maximum flow.More formally. You are given an undirected graph. For each it's undirected edge (ai, bi) you are given the flow volume ci. You should direct all edges in such way that the following conditions hold:  for each vertex v (1 < v < n), sum of ci of incoming edges is equal to the sum of ci of outcoming edges;  vertex with number 1 has no incoming edges;  the obtained directed graph does not have cycles. \n\n## Input\nThe first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, n - 1 ≤ m ≤ 2·105), the number of vertices and edges in the graph. The following m lines contain three space-separated integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 104), which means that there is an undirected edge from ai to bi with flow volume ci.It is guaranteed that there are no two edges connecting the same vertices; the given graph is connected; a solution always exists.\n\n## Output\nOutput m lines, each containing one integer di, which should be 0 if the direction of the i-th edge is ai → bi (the flow goes from vertex ai to vertex bi) and should be 1 otherwise. The edges are numbered from 1 to m in the order they are given in the input.If there are several solutions you can print any of them.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3\\n3 2 10\\n1 2 10\\n3 1 5', '4 5\\n1 2 10\\n1 3 10\\n2 3 5\\n4 2 15\\n3 4 5']\n\n### Output\n['1\\n0\\n1', '0\\n0\\n1\\n1\\n0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test case, 10 flow units pass through path , and 5 flow units pass directly from source to sink: .\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the task is to assign directions to the edges of an undirected graph such that the resulting directed graph satisfies certain flow conditions. The main points are:\n\n1. For each vertex except source (1) and sink (n), the sum of incoming flows equals the sum of outgoing flows. That's the conservation of flow.\n2. The source (vertex 1) has no incoming edges. All edges connected to it must be directed away from it.\n3. The directed graph should not have any cycles.\n\nHmm. Also, the given flows are already determined as the maximum flow. Our job is to assign directions to these edges so that the flow is valid and the directed graph is acyclic.\n\nFirst, I need to think about how to model this. Since the flow is already fixed, the direction of each edge must be chosen such that for each node (except source and sink), inflow equals outflow. But how?\n\nLet me think about the flow conservation. For each node v (not source or sink), the total flow going into it must equal the total flow going out. So for each such node, the sum of flows on edges directed towards it must equal the sum of flows on edges directed away from it. \n\nBut how can we assign directions to edges to satisfy this condition?\n\nAnother thought: since the graph is connected and the solution exists, maybe we can model this as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with certain properties. Also, the DAG must have the source as the only node with no incoming edges, and the sink as the only node with no outgoing edges? Or maybe not. But the problem says that the directed graph must not have cycles.\n\nWait, but the problem allows other nodes to have incoming and outgoing edges as long as their flow is conserved. So the key is to assign directions so that the flow is conserved and the graph is acyclic.\n\nSo perhaps the way to approach this is to build a DAG where the edges are directed in a way that ensures flow conservation.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the flow values. For each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges incident to it must be even? Because the sum of inflow and outflow must be equal. Wait, no. Let me think again. For each node v (not source or sink), the sum of all flows on edges adjacent to v must be equal to twice the outflow (since inflow = outflow). So for each such node, the sum of all flows on edges adjacent to it must be even. Wait, but the problem says that the input is such that the given flows form a maximum flow. So maybe the initial data is such that for all nodes except 1 and n, the sum of the flows on their edges is even? Or maybe not. Because the flow is already computed as maximum, but the directions are missing.\n\nWait, the problem says that the given ci's are the flow volumes. So for each edge, the flow is ci. But the direction is not given. So the flow is already fixed, but we need to assign directions such that the flow is valid.\n\nSo for each node v (not 1 or n), the sum of flows on edges directed into v must equal the sum of flows on edges directed out of v. Let's denote for each node v, the net outflow (outflow - inflow) must be zero. Which implies that the sum of flows on edges adjacent to v must be even? No, because if the sum of flows on edges adjacent to v is S, then inflow + outflow = S. But since inflow = outflow, each is S/2. Therefore, S must be even. However, the problem says that the input is guaranteed to have a solution, so this must hold. So for each node v (other than 1 and n), the sum of the flows on its adjacent edges must be even. \n\nBut how does that help us? Well, perhaps we need to find a way to direct the edges such that for each node, the sum of the flows on edges directed out of it is equal to half of the total sum of flows on its edges. \n\nBut how to compute that? This seems like a problem of finding an orientation of the edges so that for each node (except 1 and n), the sum of the flows on edges directed out of it is equal to (sum of all flows on edges adjacent to it)/2. \n\nBut how can we model this? It feels like a system of equations, but solving that for large n and m would be computationally expensive. \n\nAlternative approach: think of the problem as building a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node except the source and sink has in-degree and out-degree such that the sum of flows on outgoing edges equals the sum on incoming edges. \n\nBut how to construct such a DAG? Maybe we can model this as a directed tree",
