She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?\n\n## Input\nThe only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['6 3 2 4', '6 3 1 3', '5 2 1 5']\n\n### Output\n['5', '1', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend to close all tabs outside the [l, r] segment. Let's think about how she can do this optimally.\n\nFirst, the initial setup: there are n tabs, and the mouse is at position pos. She needs to leave only tabs from l to r. So any tabs outside that range must be closed. The challenge is figuring out the fastest way to do that.\n\nLet me think about the possible scenarios. The key here is that closing tabs can be done by moving the cursor to a certain position and then closing left or right. But each move takes a second, and each close operation also takes a second. So, the strategy would involve moving the cursor to positions where closing operations can be done efficiently.\n\nLet me consider the cases where the current tabs are already in the desired state. For example, if l=1 and r=n, then no action is needed. So the answer is 0. Also, if the current pos is already in [l, r], maybe some steps can be saved.\n\nBut the main thing is to close all tabs to the left of l and to the right of r. How can she do that?\n\nLet me think about the steps required. Suppose she needs to close tabs to the left of l. To do that, she must move the cursor to l (since closing to the left of the cursor would close everything up to that point). Then, she can close all tabs to the left. Similarly for the right side: she needs to move to r, then close all tabs to the right.\n\nWait, but maybe there's a smarter way. For example, if she can close both sides with fewer steps. But perhaps the optimal approach is to first handle the left side and then the right, or vice versa. Or maybe she can do them in a way that minimizes movement.\n\nLet me think about the steps required for each scenario.\n\nFirst, determine whether the current position is within the target range [l, r]. If it is, then maybe she can close the left and right parts with minimal movement. Otherwise, she needs to get into the correct positions.\n\nBut let's break it down:\n\nCase 1: The target range is the entire set of tabs. So l=1 and r=n. Then nothing to do. Answer is 0.\n\nCase 2: The target range is such that l is 1, but r is less than n. Then she needs to close all tabs to the right of r. So she needs to move to r, then close right. How long does that take?\n\nSimilarly, if r is n, but l is greater than 1, then she needs to close tabs to the left of l. So move to l, close left.\n\nBut what if she needs to close both left and right?\n\nFor example, suppose l is 2 and r is 4, and n is 6. Then she needs to close tabs 1 and 5-6. So she needs to close left of 2 (tabs 1) and right of 4 (tabs 5-6).\n\nHow can she do that?\n\nOption 1: Move to l (2), close left (tabs 1). Then move to r (4), close right (tabs 5-6). How many steps?\n\nThe time to move from pos to l (if not already there), then 1 second to close left. Then move from l to r (which is 4-2 = 2 steps?), then 1 second to close right. So total steps would be (distance from pos to l) + 1 + (distance from l to r) + 1.\n\nBut wait, when you close left, the a and b values change. For example, after closing tabs to the left of l, the new a becomes l. Then when moving to r, the movement is constrained between a and b. But since after closing left, the a is l, and the b is n (since we haven't closed anything on the right yet). So moving from l to r would be possible directly. So the movement steps would be |pos - l| steps to get to l. Then 1 second to close left. Then moving from l to r: |r - l| steps. Then 1 second to close right. Total steps: |pos - l| + 1 + |r - l| + 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she can do it in another order. For example, close the right first, then the left. Let's see. Suppose she moves to r, closes right (tabs to the right of r). Then moves to l, closes left. The steps would be |pos - r| + 1 + |r - l| + 1. Which one is better depends on which of |pos - l| + |r - l| or |pos - r| + |r - l",

Closing tabs to the left first and then to the right.\n  2. Closing tabs to the right first and then to the left.\n- **Minimum Steps**: The minimum number of steps from both scenarios is computed and printed as the result.\n\nThis approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimal steps required by considering both possible orders of operations, ensuring optimal performance.",
