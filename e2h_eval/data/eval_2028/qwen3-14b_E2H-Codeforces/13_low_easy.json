For example, he knows that there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. He also knows that the notes are repeated cyclically: after H goes C again, and before C stands H. We will consider the C note in the row's beginning and the C note after the H similar and we will identify them with each other. The distance between the notes along the musical scale is measured in tones: between two consecutive notes there's exactly one semitone, that is, 0.5 tone. The distance is taken from the lowest tone to the uppest one, that is, the distance between C and E is 4 semitones and between E and C is 8 semitonesVasya also knows what a chord is. A chord is an unordered set of no less than three notes. However, for now Vasya only works with triads, that is with the chords that consist of exactly three notes. He can already distinguish between two types of triads — major and minor.Let's define a major triad. Let the triad consist of notes X, Y and Z. If we can order the notes so as the distance along the musical scale between X and Y equals 4 semitones and the distance between Y and Z is 3 semitones, then the triad is major. The distance between X and Z, accordingly, equals 7 semitones.A minor triad is different in that the distance between X and Y should be 3 semitones and between Y and Z — 4 semitones.For example, the triad \"C E G\" is major: between C and E are 4 semitones, and between E and G are 3 semitones. And the triplet \"C# B F\" is minor, because if we order the notes as \"B C# F\", than between B and C# will be 3 semitones, and between C# and F — 4 semitones.Help Vasya classify the triad the teacher has given to him.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains 3 space-separated notes in the above-given notation.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"major\" if the chord is major, \"minor\" if it is minor, and \"strange\" if the teacher gave Vasya some weird chord which is neither major nor minor. Vasya promises you that the answer will always be unambiguous. That is, there are no chords that are both major and minor simultaneously.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['C E G', 'C# B F', 'A B H']\n\n### Output\n['major', 'minor', 'strange']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe task is to determine whether a given triad of notes forms a major chord, minor chord, or is strange. The input is three notes, and I have to check all possible orderings to see if any of them fit the major or minor definitions.\n\nFirst, let me understand the definitions again. \n\nA major triad has X, Y, Z such that the distance from X to Y is 4 semitones, and Y to Z is 3. So total X to Z is 7. But since the notes are cyclic, I need to calculate the distances properly.\n\nSimilarly, a minor triad requires X to Y is 3 semitones, Y to Z is 4. So total X to Z is 7 as well. Wait, but the order matters here. \n\nBut the problem says that the triad is unordered. So the three notes can be arranged in any order, but we need to check if there exists some permutation of them that satisfies either the major or minor conditions.\n\nSo for the three notes, I need to generate all permutations and check for each permutation if it meets the criteria.\n\nBut how do I compute the distance between two notes?\n\nFirst, I need to map each note to its position in the sequence. Let's see: the order is C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, B, H. Then it repeats. So each note can be assigned an index from 0 to 11. For example, C is 0, C# is 1, D is 2, etc. Then H is 11. \n\nThe distance between two notes is calculated as (target - start) mod 12, but since the problem says that the distance is measured from lower to higher, but when considering the order, perhaps the way to compute the distance between X and Y is (Y's index - X's index) mod 12? Wait, no. Because the problem says that the distance between X and Y is the number of semitones when moving upwards. For example, between C and E is 4 semitones. Let's check:\n\nC is 0, E is 4. So 4 - 0 = 4. That's correct. Between E and C, the distance is 8 semitones. Because if you go up from E to C, you have to loop around. So (C's index - E's index + 12) mod 12? Wait, no. The problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So if X is lower than Y, then the distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then the distance is (Y + 12 - X). But since the notes are cyclic, maybe the distance between X and Y is (y - x) mod 12? No, because for example, if X is C (0) and Y is E (4), the distance is 4. If X is E (4) and Y is C (0), then the distance is 8 semitones. So how do I compute this?\n\nWait, the problem says that the distance is taken from the lower to upper. So, for two notes, the distance is the number of semitones you need to move upwards from the lower note to reach the upper note. So if X is lower than Y, then distance is Y - X. If X is higher than Y, then it's (Y + 12 - X). So for example, between E and C, the distance is (0 + 12 - 4) = 8.\n\nSo, given two notes, how do I compute the distance between them? Let's say we have note1 and note2. The distance from note1 to note2 is (note2_index - note1_index) if note2 is higher than note1. Otherwise, it's (note2_index + 12 - note1_index). But how do I compute this in code?\n\nAlternatively, since the distance is the minimal number of semitones when moving upwards, which is (note2 - note1) mod 12? No, wait. Because if note1 is C (0), note2 is E (4): 4-0=4 mod 12 is 4. Correct. If note1 is E (4), note2 is C (0), then 0-4 = -4 mod 12 is 8. Which is correct. So the distance from X to Y is (y - x) mod 12. But wait, the problem says that the distance is measured from the lower to upper. So perhaps the distance between X and Y is (y - x) if y > x, else (y + 12 - x). Which is",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given set of three musical notes forms a major chord, a minor chord, or neither. The solution involves checking all permutations of the given notes to see if they fit the definitions of major or minor triads.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Mapping Notes to Indices**: Each note is mapped to an index based on its position in the sequence of 12 musical notes. This helps in calculating distances between notes efficiently.\n2. **Distance Calculation**: The distance between two notes is calculated using their indices. The distance from note X to note Y is computed as `(y_index - x_index) % 12` if moving upwards, otherwise adjusted to account for the cyclic nature of the musical scale.\n3. **Permutations Check**: For each permutation of the three given notes, check if it forms a major or minor triad based on the defined semitone distances (4 and 3 semitones for major, 3 and 4 semitones for minor).\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef note_to_index(note):\n    notes = ['C', 'C#', 'D', 'D#', 'E', 'F', 'F#', 'G', 'G#', 'A', 'B', 'H']\n    return notes.index(note)\n\ndef is_major(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X to Y is 4, Y to Z is 3\n    dist_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 4 and dist_yz == 3\n\ndef is_minor(x, y, z):\n    # Check if X to Y is 3, Y to Z is 4\n    dist_xy = (y - x) % 12\n    dist_yz = (z - y) % 12\n    return dist_xy == 3 and dist_yz == 4\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    notes = input.split()\n    # Generate all permutations of the three notes\n    from itertools import permutations\n    indices = [note_to_index(n) for n in notes]\n    for perm in permutations(indices):\n        x, y, z = perm\n        if is_major(x, y, z):\n            print(\"major\")\n            return\n        if is_minor(x, y, z):\n            print(\"minor\")\n            return\n    print(\"strange\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Mapping Notes**: The `note_to_index` function converts each note into an integer index based on its position in the list of 12 notes.\n2. **Distance Checks**: The `is_major` and `is_minor` functions check if the distances between consecutive notes in a permutation match the criteria for major or minor triads.\n3. **Permutations**: Using permutations from the `itertools` module, all possible orderings of the three notes are checked. If any permutation matches the criteria for a major or minor triad, the corresponding result is printed immediately. If none match, \"strange\" is printed.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible configurations of the given notes are checked efficiently, leveraging permutations and modular arithmetic to handle the cyclic nature of musical scales.",
