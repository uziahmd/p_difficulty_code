Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    ],
    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, and each can light up a segment from (ai - d) to (ai + d). But since the street is from 0 to l, I need to make sure that every point in [0, l] is covered by at least one of these intervals.\n\nFirst, I think I should sort the lantern positions. Because if they are sorted, I can process them in order and check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. The maximum gap between two adjacent lanterns would determine the required d. But wait, there's also the start and end of the street to consider. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position minus d must be covered. Similarly for the end.\n\nLet me think through an example. Let's take the second sample input: 2 5 with lanterns at 2 and 5. The first lantern covers [0, 4], the second covers [3,5]. So the maximum gap between the lanterns is 5-2=3. But the required d here is 2. Because the gap between the two lanterns is 3, but the maximum distance from the middle of that gap to either lantern is 1.5. Wait, no. Wait, the first lantern is at 2, the next at 5. The gap between them is 3 units. The maximum distance between the two lanterns is 3. But the coverage for this gap would require that the middle point between them is covered. For example, the midpoint is at (2+5)/2 = 3.5. The distance from this point to the nearest lantern is 1.5. So d needs to be at least 1.5. However, in the sample, the answer is 2. Oh wait, because the first lantern is at 2, which covers up to 4. The second is at 5, which covers down to 3. So the overlapping region is between 3 and 4. But what about the point 0? The first lantern is at 2, so the distance from 0 to 2 is 2. So d must be at least 2. That's why the answer is 2. So the maximum of the initial gap (from 0 to first lantern), the gaps between consecutive lanterns (divided by 2?), and the gap from last lantern to l.\n\nAh right. So the steps are:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from 0 to the first lantern. The required d for this part is (a[0] - 0) / 1? No, wait. The first lantern's coverage starts at a[0] - d. To cover 0, we need a[0] - d <= 0 => d >= a[0]. But wait, no. If the first lantern is at a[0], then the leftmost point it can cover is a[0] - d. To cover 0, this must be <= 0. So d must be at least a[0] - 0? No, wait. Suppose the lantern is at position x. The left end of its coverage is x - d. To cover 0, x - d <= 0. So d >= x. But if x is 2, then d must be at least 2. Because then the coverage starts at 2 - 2 = 0. So yes. So the first part is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. Similarly, the last part is the distance from the last lantern to l. For example, if the last lantern is at position y, then the coverage ends at y + d. To cover l, y + d >= l => d >= l - y.\n\nThen for the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, say a[i] and a[i+1], the distance between them is delta = a[i+1] - a[i]. The maximum distance from the middle of this gap to either lantern is delta / 2. Because if you have two lanterns spaced delta apart, the point in the middle is delta/2 away from each. So to cover that point, d must be at least delta/2. Because the coverage of the first lantern extends up to a[i] + d, and the second's coverage starts at a[i+1] - d. So for the entire gap between them to be covered, the maximum distance between the two lanterns divided by 2 is the required d for that gap.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\n- Sort the array of lantern positions.\n- Compute the initial gap (a[0] - 0) and the final gap (l - a[-1]).\n- For each consecutive pair, compute the gap between them, divide by 2, and take the maximum of all these values.\n- The answer is the maximum among all these three types of gaps.\n\nWait, but for the initial and final gaps, the required d is the distance from the start to the first lantern, and from the last lantern to the end. Because, for example, if the first lantern is at position a[0], then the distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. So d must be at least a[0] to cover 0. Similarly, for the last lantern, the distance from a[-1] to l is l - a[-1], so d must be at least that.\n\nBut then, the maximum between these three values (initial, final, and max between consecutive lanterns) is the required d.\n\nWait, let's take the second sample input. The lanterns are at 2 and 5. The sorted array is [2,5]. The initial gap is 2 - 0 = 2. The final gap is 5 - 5 = 0. The consecutive gap is 5-2=3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum is 2, which matches the sample output.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input is 7 15 with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, it's [0, 3,5,7,9,14,15]. Then:\n\nInitial gap is 0 - 0 = 0. Final gap is 15 - 15 = 0. The consecutive gaps are 3-0=3 (divided by 2 is 1.5), 5-3=2 (1), 7-5=2 (1), 9-7=2 (1), 14-9=5 (2.5), 15-14=1 (0.5). The maximum of these is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5.\n\nSo this logic seems to work.\n\nSo the algorithm steps are:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the initial distance (a[0] - 0) and the final distance (l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for each i from 1 to n-1, compute a[i] - a[i-1], divide by 2. Take the maximum of all these.\n\nThe answer is the maximum between the initial, final, and the max of the consecutive gaps divided by 2.\n\nWait, but for the initial and final, the required d is the distance, not divided by 2. Because for the initial, the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0]. So d must be at least that. Similarly for the final.\n\nSo the maximum between all those values is the answer.\n\nSo the code steps would be:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial = a[0] - 0.0 (but wait, if a[0] is 0, then initial is zero. So no problem.)\n\nCompute final = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0.0\n\nfor i in 1 to len(a)-1:\n\n   gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n   current = gap / 2.0\n\n   if current > max_gap:\n\n       max_gap = current\n\nthen the answer is the maximum between initial, final, max_gap.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what if the lanterns are not sorted? For example, if the first lantern is at 5, and the next at 3. Then after sorting, the consecutive gaps are properly handled.\n\nSo the code needs to sort the array first.\n\nEdge cases:\n\nCase 1: n=1. Then the lantern is at a[0]. So initial is a[0], final is l - a[0]. The max between these two.\n\nFor example, n=1, l=10, a[0] is 5. Then initial is 5, final is 5. So d is 5.0.\n\nAnother example: n=1, l=10, a[0] is 0. Then initial is 0, final is 10. So d is 10.\n\nAnother case: when the lanterns are already covering the entire street. Like n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Then initial is 0, final is 0. The consecutive gap is 5-0=5, divided by 2 is 2.5. So d is 2.5. Which makes sense. Because the middle of the street is 2.5 away from each lantern.\n\nSo code-wise, that's the plan.\n\nNow, handling the input. The input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement.\n\nThe input is given as follows: the first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai. Then, perhaps there are multiple test cases? Wait, the sample input shows two examples. But in the problem statement, the input is given as per one test case. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5'] — but perhaps this is a way to represent two test cases. However, the problem says that the input is read from standard input, which for competitive programming is usually a single test case. Wait, the original problem says that the input is the first line with n and l, then the next line with the a_i. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases. However, the user's code must read from stdin, which for the problem is likely one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, perhaps the original problem has multiple test cases? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nNo, the problem says: the input is two lines. The first line has n and l. The second line has n integers. So the sample input shows two test cases, but perhaps the actual code is supposed to handle one test case. Wait, looking at the problem statement's input description:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. But the sample input shows two examples. So perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. Wait, perhaps the user provided the sample input as two separate test cases. But in the problem statement's input, it's one test case. So perhaps the code should read one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. Hmm, perhaps the user made a mistake in the input format. Wait, looking at the sample input:\n\nThe first input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen the second input is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nWhich is two separate test cases. But the problem's input says that the first line is n and l, then the next line is the a_i. So perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases? Or maybe the sample input is presented as two separate test cases, but the actual code should read one test case.\n\nBut looking at the problem's output, the sample outputs are two lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the original problem's input description does not mention that. Wait, the original problem's input says that the first line contains n and l. The next line contains n integers. So perhaps the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. This is confusing.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe sample input shows:\n\nInput:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nOutput:\n\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\nWhich suggests that the code should process multiple test cases. But the original problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the original problem's input may not have that. Wait, perhaps the problem is from Codeforces, and the user is trying to present the sample input as two test cases. But in reality, the problem may have only one test case. But the sample input shows two.\n\nWait, looking at the problem's original statement:\n\nThe problem is called \"Vanya and Lanterns\" and the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the sample input is two separate test cases. But the code should read multiple test cases. However, in the problem statement, the input is described as a single test case. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut looking at the original problem's input and output, perhaps the code is supposed to read a single test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. Therefore, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. Alternatively, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. How to resolve this?\n\nLooking at the problem's sample input and output:\n\nIn the sample input, the first line is \"7 15\" followed by \"15 5 3 7 9 14 0\", then another line \"2 5\" followed by \"2 5\". So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l. So perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines.\n\nBut how to know? Well, the original problem's input is probably one test case, but the sample shows two. However, in the problem's note, the second sample input is given as two lines. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one test case. But the sample shows two. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem description. However, the user's task is to write a Python script that reads from stdin and outputs the correct answer.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So perhaps the code should read one test case, and the sample input shows two test cases. But that's unclear.\n\nBut looking at the sample input and output, the first sample input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWhich outputs 2.5. The second input is 2 5 and 2 5, output 2.0.\n\nSo perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. However, the problem's input description doesn't mention that. But given that the sample input has two test cases, perhaps the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. But how to know?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description, and the code should read a single test case.\n\nBut given that the sample input has two test cases, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. But how many? For example, how to read until EOF?\n\nIn competitive programming, sometimes the code is supposed to read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement may not mention that. However, in the original problem (if this is from Codeforces or similar), perhaps the code is supposed to handle multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the sample input shows two test cases, and the output shows two answers, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. But how to read them?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process accordingly.\n\nBut given that the problem's input is ambiguous, perhaps the user intended that the code reads a single test case. However, in the sample input, there are two test cases. So perhaps the code should process multiple test cases. Let's think about how to proceed.\n\nBut given that the user provided the sample input as two test cases, but the problem's input description says that the first line contains n and l, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. But how to read them?\n\nIn the problem's sample input, the input is given as two test cases. So for example, the code should read until EOF. So for each test case, read two lines: first line with n and l, then next line with n integers.\n\nSo the code would process all test cases in the input.\n\nBut how to handle that in Python?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all lines from stdin, split them into tokens, and process accordingly.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving the problem, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement may not specify that. However, given the sample input and output, that's the case.\n\nBut looking back at the problem statement's input and output:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ...\n\nOutput:\n\nPrint the minimum light radius d ...\n\nSo the code is supposed to process one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases. Which is confusing.\n\nBut perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description, and the code should read a single test case. For example, the sample input is given as two test cases, but the actual problem expects one. But the sample output has two answers. Therefore, the code must process multiple test cases.\n\nBut how to confirm? Well, perhaps the original problem is from Codeforces. Let me check the original problem. For example, the problem \"Vanya and Lanterns\" is Codeforces problem 573A. Let me check.\n\nYes, according to Codeforces, problem 573A is \"Vanya and Lanterns\". The input is one test case. The sample input shows two test cases. But in reality, the code should read one test case. However, in the sample input, the first line is for the first test case, then the second line is for the second test case. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description, and the code should read one test case. But in the sample input, there are two test cases. So perhaps the user intended that the code reads multiple test cases.\n\nBut given that the problem's input is not clear, but given that the sample input shows two test cases, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. However, the code should process each test case as per the problem's instructions.\n\nBut for the purpose of writing the code, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. How to do that in Python?\n\nWell, the code can read all input lines, split into tokens, and process each test case. For example, the code can read all lines, split into tokens, and then process each pair of lines as a test case.\n\nBut perhaps the input is given as multiple test cases. So the code can read from stdin until EOF.\n\nBut for the purposes of solving this problem, perhaps the code should process one test case. Let's look at the sample input again. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWhich produces output 2.5. The second test case is 2 5 and 2 5, output 2.0.\n\nBut in the problem statement, the input is given as two lines. So the code should read one test case. However, the sample input shows two test cases, which may be a formatting error.\n\nBut given that the user included the sample input as two test cases, but the problem's input description says one, it's ambiguous. However, given that the user's code is supposed to read from stdin and output to stdout, and the sample input has two test cases, perhaps the code should read multiple test cases. However, the code may not be able to know how many test cases there are. But perhaps the code should read until EOF.\n\nBut in practice, in competitive programming, sometimes the code is expected to read multiple test cases, but the problem statement may not mention it. However, in this case, the problem statement says that the first line contains n and l, so perhaps the code should read one test case.\n\nBut given that the sample input has two test cases, perhaps the user intended that the code reads multiple test cases. However, the code may have to read multiple test cases. How can I handle that?\n\nWell, perhaps the code can read all lines from stdin, split into tokens, and process each test case as follows: for each test case, read two lines: first line is n and l, second line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut how to read that in Python?\n\nIn Python, the code can read all input as a list of lines, then process them in pairs.\n\nBut perhaps the code can read the input as follows:\n\nimport sys\n\nlines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n\nThen process the lines in pairs: first line is n and l, next line is the a_i.\n\nBut for example, if there are two test cases, the lines list will have four elements: line 0 is first n and l, line 1 is a_i, line 2 is second n and l, line 3 is a_i.\n\nSo the code can loop over the lines in pairs.\n\nBut how to handle that in code? Let's think.\n\nBut for the purpose of solving this problem, perhaps the user intended that the code reads one test case. So perhaps the sample input is written as two test cases, but the actual code should read one. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description, and the code should read one test case. Let's proceed under that assumption.\n\nSo the code will read n and l from the first line, then read the next line as the list of a_i.\n\nBut then, the sample input shows two test cases. However, perhaps the code should read one test case. For example, in the sample input, the first test case is processed, and the output is printed.\n\nBut then, the sample input's second test case would be another input. However, the user's code must process the input as given.\n\nBut given the ambiguity, perhaps the code should read one test case. Because the problem's input description says that.\n\nThus, proceeding with that.\n\nNow, the code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial = a[0] - 0.0 ?\n\nWait, no. For the first lantern, the distance from the start of the street (0) to the lantern's position is a[0]. Because if the first lantern is at a[0], then the leftmost point it can cover is a[0] - d. To cover 0, d must be >= a[0] - 0. So d must be at least a[0].\n\nSimilarly, for the last lantern, the distance from the lantern to the end of the street (l) is l - a[-1]. So d must be at least that.\n\nBut what if the lanterns are already covering the entire street? For example, if the first lantern is at 0, and the last at l. Then the initial and final distances are 0. The gaps between consecutive lanterns are handled as before.\n\nSo, code steps:\n\nSort the list of a_i.\n\nCompute initial = a[0] (since 0 is the start of the street).\n\nCompute final = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0.0\n\nfor i in 1 to n-1:\n\n   gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n   current = gap / 2.0\n\n   if current > max_gap:\n\n       max_gap = current\n\nThen the answer is the maximum of initial, final, max_gap.\n\nBut wait, initial is a[0] - 0, which is a[0]. Because the first lantern is at a[0], and the distance from 0 to it is a[0]. So d must be at least that. Similarly for the final.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what if the lanterns are not sorted? For example, if the first lantern is at position 5, and then another at 3. After sorting, the list becomes [3,5], so initial is 3, which is correct.\n\nSo the code must sort the list.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nThen read the list of a_i as integers.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial = a[0]\n\nfinal = l - a[-1]\n\nmax_gap = 0.0\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_gap:\n\n        max_gap = current\n\nresult = max(initial, final, max_gap)\n\nThen print result with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if n is 0? But according to the problem statement, n >= 1.\n\nWait, the problem says 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000. So n is at least 1.\n\nSo in the case of n=1, the code computes initial and final, and the max_gap is 0 (since there are no consecutive pairs). So the result is max(initial, final).\n\nYes.\n\nTesting the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nn=7, l=15.\n\na = [15,5,3,7,9,14,0] → sorted is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\ninitial is 0 - 0 = 0.\n\nfinal is 15 - 15 = 0.\n\nmax_gap between consecutive:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5\n\n5-3=2 → 1\n\n7-5=2 →1\n\n9-7=2 →1\n\n14-9=5 →2.5\n\n15-14=1 →0.5\n\nso max_gap is 2.5. The result is max(0, 0, 2.5) → 2.5 → correct.\n\nSample 2:\n\nn=2, l=5.\n\na = [2,5]. sorted [2,5].\n\ninitial = 2.0.\n\nfinal = 5-5=0.\n\nmax_gap is (5-2)/2 = 1.5.\n\nmax(2, 0, 1.5) → 2.0. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. initial is 5, final is 5. max is 5.0.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. initial is 0, final is 0. max_gap is (5-0)/2 = 2.5 → answer is 2.5.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,3]. initial is 0, final is 5-3=2. max_gap is (3-0)/2 = 1.5. So answer is max(0,2,1.5) → 2.0.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, how to read the input?\n\nAssuming that the input is given as two lines, first line with n and l, second line with the list of a_i.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    import sys\n\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    a.sort()\n\n    initial = a[0]\n\n    final = l - a[-1]\n\n    max_gap = 0.0\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n        current = gap / 2.0\n\n        if current > max_gap:\n\n            max_gap = current\n\n    result = max(initial, final, max_gap)\n\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nBut wait, the sample outputs have 10 decimal digits. So the code should print with 10 decimal digits. For example, in the first sample, 2.5 is printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nBut in Python, when using the format string, the code can use .10f.\n\nBut what about when the result is integer? Like 2.0 → 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about when the result is something like 2.5, which is exactly representable? The code will output 2.5000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nBut in the sample input, the second test case returns 2.0, which is printed as 2.0000000000.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nBut what about when the initial or final is zero? For example, if the first lantern is at 0, then initial is zero. So the code will take that into account.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nAfter reading, a is [15,5,3,7,9,14,0]. After sorting, [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. initial is 0, final is 0. max_gap is 2.5. result is 2.5 → printed as 2.5000000000.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]. initial is 2.0, final 0. max_gap is 1.5. result is 2.0 → printed as 2.0000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. The code returns max(5, 5, 0) → 5.0. Printed as 5.0000000000.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. initial is 0, final is 0. max_gap is (5-0)/2 = 2.5. result is 2.5 → correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,3]. initial is 0, final is 5-3=2. max_gap is 3/2=1.5. result is 2.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works for these cases.\n\nNow, edge cases:\n\nCase where the lanterns are at 0 and l. So for example, n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. initial is 0, final is 0. max_gap is 10/2 = 5. So result is 5.0.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0, 1, 2, ..., l. Then the max_gap between consecutive is 1, so divided by 2 is 0.5. initial is 0, final is 0. So result is 0.5.\n\nBut if l is 10, and the lanterns are at 0, 10. Then the max_gap is 10/2=5.0.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother edge case: when the lanterns are not sorted. For example, n=3, l=10, a=[5, 0, 10]. sorted becomes [0,5,10]. initial is 0, final is 0. max_gap between 0 and 5 is 5/2=2.5, between 5 and 10 is 5/2=2.5. So result is 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nBut need to import sys and read from stdin.\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\n    a.sort()\n\n    initial = a[0]\n\n    final = l - a[-1]\n\n    max_gap = 0.0\n\n    for i in range(1, n):\n\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n        current = gap / 2.0\n\n        if current > max_gap:\n\n            max_gap = current\n\n    result = max(initial, final, max_gap)\n\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\n    main()\n\nBut what about when n=0? Well, according to the problem statement, n >=1.\n\nSo the code is safe.\n\nBut in the problem statement, n can be 1. Which is handled correctly.\n\nSo this should solve the problem.\n\nNow, let's check the sample input again.\n\nSample input 1: 7 15 and the list. Output is 2.5. The code returns that.\n\nSample input 2: 2 5 and list [2,5]. Output is 2.0. Correct.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l` given their positions. The solution involves analyzing the gaps between consecutive lanterns and considering the edges of the street.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort Lantern Positions**: First, sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the process of checking gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Initial and Final Gaps**: Calculate the distance from the start of the street (position 0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (position `l`). These distances are critical because they determine the minimum radius required to cover the start and end of the street.\n3. **Consecutive Lantern Gaps**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The maximum radius required to cover the gap between two consecutive lanterns is half of this gap, as the worst-case point in the middle of the gap would be equidistant from both lanterns.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The minimum radius required to illuminate the entire street is the maximum value among the initial gap, the final gap, and the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    \n    initial = a[0]\n    final = l - a[-1]\n    max_gap = 0.0\n    \n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_gap:\n            max_gap = current\n    \n    result = max(initial, final, max_gap)\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(result))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Sorting**: Sorting the lantern positions allows us to easily check the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n- **Initial and Final Gaps**: These are calculated to ensure that the edges of the street (positions 0 and `l`) are covered by the lanterns' light.\n- **Consecutive Gaps**: By iterating through the sorted list of lantern positions, we calculate the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns. The radius required to cover this gap is half the size of the gap, ensuring that the midpoint of the gap is illuminated.\n- **Result Calculation**: The result is determined by taking the maximum value among the initial gap, final gap, and the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns divided by two. This ensures all parts of the street are covered with the minimum possible radius.\n\nThis approach efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures that the solution is both optimal and accurate, adhering to the required precision.",
