Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum radius d for the lanterns so that the entire street is covered. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The street is from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up a segment from (ai - d) to (ai + d). We need to find the minimal d such that all points from 0 to l are covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. So the key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's imagine that the lanterns are sorted in order. Because if they are not sorted, the gaps between them might not be properly considered. For example, if we have lanterns at positions 3 and 5, but there's another one at 1, then the gaps between 1 and 3, and 3 and 5 are important. But if the lanterns are not sorted, we can't just look at consecutive elements. So the first step must be to sort the array of lantern positions.\n\nOnce sorted, the idea is that between two consecutive lanterns, the maximum distance between them would determine the required d. But wait, because each lantern's coverage can overlap. For example, if two lanterns are placed at positions a and b (a < b), then the distance between them is (b - a). The middle point between them is at (a + b)/2. The maximum distance from either lantern to this middle point is (b - a)/2. So for this segment between a and b, the required d must be at least (b - a)/2. Because otherwise, the middle point would not be covered.\n\nBut wait, that's only if the two lanterns are adjacent. However, if there's a gap between two consecutive lanterns, then the required d must be at least half of that gap. Because the worst case is the middle of the gap. So the maximum of these half gaps would be the required d.\n\nBut also, there's the edge cases. Like, what if the first lantern is not at 0? Then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position is important. Similarly, if the last lantern is not at l, then the distance from the last lantern to l is important. Because those areas would need to be covered by the nearest lantern.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from 0 to the first lantern. The required d must be at least this distance.\n3. Check the distance from the last lantern to l. The required d must be at least this distance.\n4. For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The required d must be at least half of that gap.\n5. The answer is the maximum value among all these values computed in steps 2,3,4.\n\nYes, that makes sense. Let's test this logic against the examples.\n\nTake the second sample input:\n\nInput is 2 5, with lanterns at 2 and 5.\n\nAfter sorting, the positions are [2,5].\n\nStep 2: distance from 0 to first lantern (2) is 2. So initial d is 2.\n\nStep 3: distance from last lantern (5) to l (5) is 0. So no contribution.\n\nStep 4: between 2 and 5, the gap is 3. Half of that is 1.5. So the max between 2 and 1.5 is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.0.\n\nAnother example: the first sample input is 7 15, with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. When sorted, they are [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]. Let's check the steps.\n\nStep 2: first lantern is at 0. Distance from 0 is 0. So no contribution.\n\nStep 3: last lantern is at 15. Distance to l (15) is 0. No contribution.\n\nNow the consecutive gaps:\n\nBetween 0 and 3: gap is 3. Half is 1.5.\n\nBetween 3 and 5: gap is 2 → 1.0.\n\nBetween 5 and 7: gap 2 → 1.0.\n\nBetween 7 and 9: gap 2 → 1.0.\n\nBetween 9 and 14: gap is 5 → 2.5.\n\nBetween 14 and 15: gap 1 → 0.5.\n\nSo the maximum among these is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5. So yes, this logic works.\n\nSo the algorithm is:\n\nSort the array of lantern positions.\n\nCompute the maximum of:\n\n- the first lantern's position (since 0 to a[0] is a[0] - 0 = a[0], so d needs to be at least a[0])\n\nWait no. Wait, the distance from 0 to the first lantern is a[0] - 0. But the lantern's coverage extends to a[0] - d. So to cover 0, the lantern's coverage must include 0. So the distance between 0 and a[0] must be <= d. So d must be >= a[0] - 0. Similarly, for the end, the distance between l and the last lantern is l - a[-1], so d must be >= l - a[-1].\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nmax_d = max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen for each consecutive pair, compute (a[i] - a[i-1])/2. Take the maximum of those. Then compare with max_d. The overall maximum is the answer.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen iterate from i=1 to n-1:\n\ncurrent_gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_half_gap = current_gap / 2.0\n\nif current_half_gap > max_d, update max_d.\n\nAt the end, output max_d.\n\nBut wait, what if there's only one lantern?\n\nLike n=1, l=5, and a is [3]. Then the initial max_d is max(3, 5-3=2) → 3. Then there are no consecutive pairs. So the answer is 3. Which is correct. Because the lantern is at 3, so the coverage must reach 0 (distance 3) and 5 (distance 2). So d must be 3.\n\nYes.\n\nAnother case: n=0? No, according to input constraints, n is at least 1.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max( a[0], l - a[-1] )\n\nThen for i from 1 to n-1:\n\ngap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent = gap / 2.0\n\nif current > max_d, then update.\n\nFinally, output max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, the code in Python.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you read the input, you need to read n and l. Then the next line is the list of a_i.\n\nBut the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement. The sample input shows two test cases, but the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. Wait, looking at the input description:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l. The next line contains n integers ai.\n\nWait, but the sample input shows two test cases. For example, the first sample input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThen another input line is 2 5\n\n2 5\n\nBut perhaps the problem is that the user is to read multiple test cases? Or is it that the sample input is given with two test cases, but the actual problem expects that the program reads one test case?\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nThe input is given as per the first line. So the input for the problem is one test case. But the sample input shows two test cases. Wait, looking at the problem's sample input:\n\nThe sample input shows two examples. But the way the problem is written, perhaps the user is to read a single test case. But perhaps the original problem is from Codeforces, and the sample input shows two test cases. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. So perhaps the code should read one test case.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as follows: first line has two integers n and l. Then next line has n integers. So the code should process one test case.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are two test cases. But perhaps that's part of the sample input, but the actual code is supposed to read one test case. For example, in programming competition problems, sometimes the sample input includes multiple test cases, but the code is supposed to handle one.\n\nBut looking at the problem's sample input:\n\nThe first sample input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nThe output is 2.5...\n\nThe second sample input is:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5\n\nOutput is 2.0.\n\nSo the code should read one test case. But perhaps the user is to read multiple test cases? Or maybe the sample input is presented in a way that shows two separate test cases, but the actual code is to read one.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is given as per the first line. So the code must read one test case. Therefore, in the code, we need to read two lines: the first line is n and l, the next line is the list of a_i.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead n and l from input.\n\nThen read the list of a_i.\n\nBut in Python, how to read them? For example, in the sample input, the first line is '7 15', then the next line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'.\n\nSo the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n\nBut then, what if there are multiple test cases? Well, according to the problem statement, the code is supposed to process one test case. So the code will process one test case.\n\nSo now, proceed with the code.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list a.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for each consecutive pair in a, compute the gap, divide by 2, compare to max_d.\n\nFinally, output the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut what about when n is 1? For example, n=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then the max_d is max(3, 5-3=2) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. Then the initial max_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max is 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then the initial max_d is max(0, 10-10=0) → 0. Then the gaps between 0 and 5 is 5 → 2.5, between 5 and 10 is 5 → 2.5. So the max is 2.5. So the answer is 2.5.\n\nBut if the street is 10, and the lanterns are at 0, 5, 10. Then each lantern's coverage must reach the ends. For example, the first lantern covers 0 to 5 (if d is 5). The second covers 0 to 10 (if d is 5). The third covers 5 to 10. So the maximum d is 5. Wait, but according to our code, the initial max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. Then the gaps between 0 and 5 is 5/2 = 2.5, between 5 and 10 is 5/2 = 2.5. So the code returns 2.5. But that's wrong.\n\nWait, why? Because in this case, the code's logic is incorrect. Wait, what's the problem here?\n\nWait, the street is from 0 to 10. The lanterns are at 0,5,10. So each lantern has coverage of d. What's the minimal d?\n\nThe first lantern covers from 0 -d to 0 +d. But since the street starts at 0, the left end is covered if d is >=0. But the right end of the first lantern's coverage is 0 +d. The next lantern is at 5. The coverage of the first lantern must reach up to 5 -d? Or wait, the coverage of the first lantern is [0 -d, 0 +d]. But the second lantern is at 5. So the coverage of the first lantern is up to 0 +d. The second lantern's coverage starts at 5 -d. To make sure that there's no gap between the two, we need that 0 +d >= 5 -d → 2d >=5 → d >= 2.5. Which is exactly the value calculated by the code. But the code's logic says that the maximum of (a[0], l -a[-1], and the gaps between consecutive lanterns divided by 2). In this case, the code returns 2.5, which is correct. Because with d=2.5, the first lantern covers up to 0+2.5=2.5. The second lantern covers from 5-2.5=2.5 to 5+2.5=7.5. So the coverage is continuous. The third lantern covers from 10-2.5=7.5 to 10+2.5=12.5. So the street up to 10 is covered. So the code's answer is correct.\n\nBut what about the end of the street? The third lantern is at 10. The distance from 10 to l (which is 10) is zero. So the code's initial max_d is 0. So the code returns 2.5. Which is correct. So the code is correct here.\n\nAnother example: suppose n=2, l=10. Lanterns at 0 and 10. Then the code computes initial max_d as max(0, 10 - 10=0) → 0. The gap between 0 and 10 is 10. Divided by 2 is 5. So the answer is 5. Which is correct. Because each lantern's coverage must reach the middle point (5). So d must be 5.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nSo, the code logic seems solid.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut note that the input may have multiple test cases? Wait, no. The problem says that the input is for one test case. The sample shows two test cases, but that's probably for the purpose of showing two examples. So the code should process one test case.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead a as list of integers.\n\nSort a.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for i in range(1, n):\n\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\n    current = gap / 2.0\n\n    if current > max_d:\n\n        max_d = current\n\nThen print the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut what about when n is 1? For example, n=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then the code computes max_d as max(3, 5-3=2) → 3. Which is correct.\n\nSo code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nBut wait, in the sample input, the first test case is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → after sorting, [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nSo the initial max_d is max(0, 15-15=0) → 0. Then the gaps between consecutive elements are 3-0=3 → 1.5, 5-3=2 → 1.0, etc. The maximum is 2.5 (from 9 to 14, gap is 5 → 2.5). So code returns 2.5, correct.\n\nAnother sample input is 2 5, [2,5]. After sorting [2,5]. max_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So max_d remains 2. So output is 2.0. Correct.\n\nSo code seems correct.\n\nBut wait, what about if the lanterns are not sorted. For example, if the input is [5, 0], then after sorting, it's [0,5], which is handled correctly.\n\nNow, what about if the first lantern is not at 0, but the second is. For example, n=2, l=5, a=[0, 3]. Then the initial max_d is max(0, 5-3=2). Then the gap between 0 and 3 is 3, divided by 2 → 1.5. So the max_d is 2. Which is correct. Because the last lantern is at 3, and the end of the street is 5. So the distance is 5-3=2. So d must be 2. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 2, 10]. Then the initial max_d is max(0, 10-10=0) → 0. The gaps between 0 and 2 is 2 → 1.0. Between 2 and 10 is 8 → 4.0. So the max_d is 4.0. But the distance from the last lantern (10) to l is 0. But what about the area between 2 and 10? The maximum gap is 8, so the required d is 4.0. Which would cover from 2-4= -2 (but the street starts at 0) to 2+4=6. The next lantern is at 10. The coverage of the second lantern (at 2) is up to 6. The third lantern is at 10. So the distance between 6 and 10 is 4. So the third lantern's coverage needs to reach 6. So d must be 10 -6 =4. Which is correct. So the code returns 4.0.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code formatting: the output must be printed with 10 decimal digits. So using Python's string formatting.\n\nBut in Python, for example, when the value is an integer, like 2.0, printing with 10 decimals would show 2.0000000000.\n\nSo the code uses print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d)).\n\nBut in Python, when you format a float with .10f, it will show 10 decimal digits. However, for example, if the value is 2.5, it will show 2.5000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase 1: n=1, l=0. But according to the input constraints, l is at least 1. So no.\n\nCase 2: n=1, l=1. a=[0]. Then the max_d is max(0, 1-0=1) → 1. So output is 1.0.\n\nCase 3: n=1, l=1. a=[1]. Then max_d is max(1, 0) → 1. So output is 1.0.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0,10]. Then the max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. Then the gap is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So output 5.0.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, the code must read from stdin. Also, note that in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing spaces, but the split() function handles that.\n\nThus, the code should be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but in the sample input, the first test case's output is 2.5000000000, which is exactly what the code would produce.\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you do division, it returns a float. So even if the numbers are integers, the division is done as float. So for example, 3/2.0 is 1.5.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nTesting the second sample input:\n\nn=2, l=5, a=[2,5]. After sorting, [2,5]. max_d is max(2, 0) → 2. Then the gap is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the max_d remains 2.0. Output is 2.0000000000. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then the code returns 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns such that the entire street is illuminated. The key insight is to consider the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns and ensure that the radius covers these gaps effectively.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to easily compute the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Edge Cases Handling**: Check the distance from the start of the street (0) to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street (l). These distances are critical as they determine the minimum radius required to cover the ends of the street.\n3. **Consecutive Gaps Calculation**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, calculate the gap between them. The radius must be at least half of this gap to ensure complete coverage of the area between them.\n4. **Determine Maximum Radius**: The required radius is the maximum value among the distances calculated in the edge cases and the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n        current = gap / 2.0\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input, which includes the number of lanterns `n`, the length of the street `l`, and the positions of the lanterns.\n2. **Sorting**: The positions of the lanterns are sorted to facilitate the calculation of consecutive gaps.\n3. **Initial Maximum Radius Calculation**: The initial maximum radius is determined by considering the distance from the start of the street to the first lantern and from the last lantern to the end of the street.\n4. **Gap Analysis**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap between them is calculated. The radius needed to cover this gap is half the gap, as the worst-case point to cover is the midpoint between two consecutive lanterns.\n5. **Output**: The result is printed with a precision of 10 decimal places to meet the problem's requirements.\n\nThis approach ensures that all parts of the street are covered by the lanterns' light, considering both edge cases and gaps between lanterns efficiently. The complexity of the solution is dominated by the sorting step, making it O(n log n), which is efficient given the constraints.",
