The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to calculate the number of cells that are gilded based on the given parameters w, h, and k. The problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says that the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away, etc. But the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom), so for each ring, the dimensions reduce by 4 each time. Like, for the first ring, the rectangle is w × h, and the ring is the perimeter. Then the next ring is on a rectangle that's (w-4) × (h-4), and so on.\n\nSo for each ring i (from 1 to k), we need to calculate the perimeter of that rectangle. But wait, how do you calculate the perimeter of a rectangle in terms of cells? For a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter in cells would be 2*(W + H - 2). Because the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(width + height) minus 4 (since the four corners are counted twice). Wait, let me think again. Let's take a simple example: a 3x3 rectangle. The perimeter cells are the outermost layer. How many cells? Well, the total cells in the perimeter would be 3*4 - 4 = 8 (since each side has 3 cells, but the corners are counted twice). Alternatively, 2*(3 + 3) - 4 = 8. Which matches the first example input where 3 3 1 gives 8. So yes, the formula for the perimeter is 2*(w + h) - 4. But wait, for a rectangle of size W x H, the perimeter (number of cells) is 2*(W + H - 2). Because for example, 3x3: 2*(3 + 3 - 2) = 2*4 = 8. Correct. So that's the formula.\n\nSo for each ring i (starting from 1 to k), the dimensions of the rectangle are (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)). But wait, for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1))? Wait, the problem says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). So that rectangle's perimeter is the ring. So for each i, we calculate the perimeter of that rectangle and sum all those perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nBut wait, we have to make sure that the rectangle is valid. For example, if the rectangle's width or height becomes less than 3, then maybe there's no perimeter? But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Let me think. For example, if min(w, h) is 3, then (3+1)/4 is 1, so k can be 1. Which makes sense, because for a 3x3, the first ring is possible. For a 7x7, min is 7. (7+1)/4 is 2, so floor is 2. So k can be up to 2. For each ring, the dimensions would be 7,7 for i=1, then 7-4=3, 3 for i=2. So that works.\n\nSo the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle with width w_i = w - 4*(i-1) and height h_i = h - 4*(i-1). Then sum all these perimeters.\n\nBut wait, how do we compute the perimeter for each rectangle? As mentioned before, the perimeter is 2*(w_i + h_i - 2). Let me check with the first example:\n\nSample Input 1: 3 3 1. So for i=1, w_i=3, h_i=3. Perimeter is 2*(3+3-2) = 2*4=8. Which matches the output.\n\nSample Input 2: 7 9 1. So i=1, w_i=7, h_i=9. Perimeter is 2",
