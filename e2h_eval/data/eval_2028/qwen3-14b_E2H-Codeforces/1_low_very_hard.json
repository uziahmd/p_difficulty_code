The plate is a rectangle that we split into $$$w\\times h$$$ cells. There should be $$$k$$$ gilded rings, the first one should go along the edge of the plate, the second one — $$$2$$$ cells away from the edge and so on. Each ring has a width of $$$1$$$ cell. Formally, the $$$i$$$-th of these rings should consist of all bordering cells on the inner rectangle of size $$$(w - 4(i - 1))\\times(h - 4(i - 1))$$$.  The picture corresponds to the third example. Your task is to compute the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Input\nThe only line contains three integers $$$w$$$, $$$h$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$3 \\le w, h \\le 100$$$, $$$1 \\le k \\le \\left\\lfloor \\frac{min(n, m) + 1}{4}\\right\\rfloor$$$, where $$$\\lfloor x \\rfloor$$$ denotes the number $$$x$$$ rounded down) — the number of rows, columns and the number of rings, respectively.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single positive integer — the number of cells to be gilded.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 3 1', '7 9 1', '7 9 2']\n\n### Output\n['8', '28', '40']\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where I have to calculate the number of gilded cells on a plate with certain dimensions and a number of rings. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nThe problem says that each ring is added in a way that the i-th ring is 2*(i-1) cells away from the edge. Wait, no, the description says the first ring is along the edge, the second is two cells away. Wait, the formal definition says that the i-th ring is the bordering cells of the inner rectangle of size (w - 4*(i-1)) × (h - 4*(i-1)). Oh right, because each ring takes away 2 cells from each side. Like, for example, the first ring is the outermost layer. Then the next ring would be inside, so the width and height would be reduced by 4*(i-1) for each step. Because each ring adds a layer of 1 cell, but when you go inward, you subtract 2 cells from each side (left and right, top and bottom). So for each ring i, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)). But wait, for the first ring, i=1, so it's w and h. Then the next ring would be w-4*1 and h-4*1? Wait, no. Because for the second ring, it's 2 cells away from the edge. So the original plate is w x h. The first ring is the perimeter of the entire plate. Then the second ring is the perimeter of a rectangle that is 2 cells in from each edge. Which would mean that the dimensions are (w - 2*2) by (h - 2*2) = w-4 and h-4. Wait, because for each side, you take away 2 cells. So for the i-th ring, the rectangle is (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1))? Because for i=1, it's the original. For i=2, it's subtracted by 4*(i-1) = 4*1=4. So yes.\n\nBut then, the perimeter of that rectangle is what we need to calculate for each ring. But wait, the problem says that each ring is the bordering cells of that inner rectangle. So the perimeter of that rectangle. But how do you compute the perimeter of a rectangle? Well, for a rectangle of width W and height H, the perimeter is 2*(W + H - 2). Because the perimeter in cells would be the sum of the top and bottom rows (each of length W) plus the left and right columns (each of length H-2, since the top and bottom are already counted). Wait, no. Wait, for a rectangle of W columns and H rows, the number of cells in the perimeter is 2*W + 2*(H-2) = 2*(W + H - 2). Because the top row has W cells, the bottom row has W cells, and the left and right columns have (H-2) each (since the top and bottom are already counted). So total is 2W + 2(H-2) = 2(W + H - 2). Alternatively, 2*(W + H) - 4. Which simplifies to 2(W + H - 2).\n\nSo for each ring i, we calculate the perimeter of the rectangle (w - 4*(i-1)) by (h - 4*(i-1)), and sum all those perimeters for i from 1 to k.\n\nWait, but there's a catch. Because if the rectangle becomes too small, maybe the perimeter calculation would not make sense. But according to the input constraints, k is chosen such that it's possible. The input constraints say that k is up to floor( (min(w, h) + 1)/4 ). Wait, let me check the input constraints again. The input says that k is between 1 and floor( (min(n, m) +1)/4 ), but wait, in the problem statement, the input is given as w, h, k. Oh, perhaps the original problem uses n and m as the dimensions. But in any case, the input ensures that k is valid. So for each i from 1 to k, the rectangle (w - 4*(i-1)) and (h - 4*(i-1)) must have at least 3 rows and columns? Or perhaps not, but the problem says that the input is valid.\n\nSo, the approach is: for each of the k rings, compute the perimeter of the rectangle of size (w', h') where w' = w - 4*(i-1) and h' =",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of cells that will be gilded on a rectangular plate with given dimensions and a specified number of gilded rings. Each ring is placed such that it forms a border around an inner rectangle, and the width and height of each subsequent ring decrease by 4 units (2 units from each side) compared to the previous one.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Perimeter Calculation**: Each ring forms a perimeter around an inner rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle with width `w` and height `h` can be calculated as `2 * (w + h - 2)`. This formula accounts for the top and bottom rows (each of length `w`) and the left and right columns (each of length `h - 2`).\n\n2. **Iterative Calculation**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, compute the dimensions of the corresponding inner rectangle. Adjust the width and height by subtracting `4 * (i - 1)` from the original dimensions for each ring `i`.\n\n3. **Summing Up Perimeters**: Sum the perimeters of all the rectangles formed by each ring to get the total number of gilded cells.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nw, h, k = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, k + 1):\n    current_w = w - 4 * (i - 1)\n    current_h = h - 4 * (i - 1)\n    perimeter = 2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)\n    total += perimeter\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Input Reading**: The dimensions of the plate (`w`, `h`) and the number of rings (`k`) are read from standard input.\n- **Loop Through Rings**: For each ring from 1 to `k`, calculate the adjusted width and height of the inner rectangle.\n- **Perimeter Calculation**: Compute the perimeter of each inner rectangle using the formula `2 * (current_w + current_h - 2)`.\n- **Summing Perimeters**: Accumulate the perimeters of all rings to get the total number of gilded cells, which is then printed as the result.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required number of gilded cells by iterating through each ring and applying the perimeter formula, ensuring correctness and adherence to the problem constraints.",
