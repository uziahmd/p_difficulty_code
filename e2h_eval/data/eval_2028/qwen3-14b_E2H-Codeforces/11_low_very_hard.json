A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends making toasts. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. The goal is to find out the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, given that all friends must make the same number of toasts. So, the answer is the minimum possible number determined by the available resources divided by the number of friends, right?\n\nLet me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the inputs are n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, each toast requires for each friend: nl milliliters of drink, a slice of lime, and np grams of salt. Wait, no. Wait the problem says: \"each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt.\" So for one toast, each friend needs those things. So for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl ml. Because each of the n friends needs nl ml. Similarly, each toast requires n slices of lime (since each friend needs one slice). And for salt, each toast requires n * np grams.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. Suppose they make t toasts. For each toast, each friend needs some amount. So for t toasts, each friend would have t * nl ml of drink, t slices of lime, and t * np grams of salt. But since there are n friends, the total required resources would be:\n\nDrink: n * t * nl ml. Because each of the n friends has t toasts, each needing nl ml. So total drink is n * t * nl.\n\nLime slices: n * t slices. Because each of the n friends needs one slice per toast. So total slices needed is n * t.\n\nSalt: n * t * np grams. Because each friend needs np grams per toast, so total is n * t * np.\n\nBut the available resources are:\n\nTotal drink available is k * l ml.\n\nTotal lime slices available is c * d.\n\nSalt available is p grams.\n\nSo the maximum number of toasts t that can be made is constrained by:\n\nk*l >= n * t * nl --> t <= (k*l) / (n * nl)\n\nc*d >= n * t --> t <= (c*d) / (n)\n\np >= n * t * np --> t <= p / (n * np)\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three values, and since t has to be an integer, we take the floor of each of these values and then take the minimum.\n\nWait, but the problem says that each friend must make the same number of toasts. So the maximum possible t is the minimum of the three possible values computed from each resource.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate for each resource how many toasts are possible, then take the minimum of those.\n\nBut how do we calculate each of them?\n\nFor the drink: total_drink = k * l. Each toast requires n * nl ml. So the maximum possible toasts from drink is total_drink // (n * nl). But wait, if it's not divisible, then it's the floor division. For example, if total_drink is 20, n is 3, nl is 3. Then 3*3=9 per toast. 20//9 is 2, which is correct.\n\nSimilarly for the lime slices: total_slices = c * d. Each toast requires n slices. So max_toasts_from_lime = total_slices // n.\n\nFor salt: total_salt = p. Each toast requires n * np grams. So max_toasts_from_salt = p // (n * np).\n\nThen the answer is the minimum of these three numbers.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead the input numbers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np.\n\nCalculate total_drink = k * l\n\ntotal_slices = c * d\n\ntotal_salt = p\n\nmax_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n\nmax_lime = total_slices // n\n\nmax_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n\nresult = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n\nThen output that result.\n\nWait, but let me check the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nSo n=3, k=4, l=5. So total_drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 * 3 =9 ml. So 20//9 = 2. Which matches the sample explanation",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires specific amounts of these resources for each friend, and all friends must make the same number of toasts.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understand Resource Requirements**: Each toast requires a certain amount of drink, a slice of lime, and salt per friend. Therefore, for `t` toasts, the total requirements are:\n   - Drink: `n * t * nl` milliliters (where `n` is the number of friends, `nl` is the drink per toast per friend)\n   - Lime Slices: `n * t` slices (each friend needs one slice per toast)\n   - Salt: `n * t * np` grams (where `np` is the salt per toast per friend)\n\n2. **Calculate Total Available Resources**:\n   - Total drink available: `k * l` milliliters (where `k` is the number of bottles and `l` is the volume per bottle)\n   - Total lime slices available: `c * d` (where `c` is the number of limes and `d` is the number of slices per lime)\n   - Total salt available: `p` grams\n\n3. **Determine Maximum Possible Toasts for Each Resource**:\n   - From drink: `total_drink // (n * nl)`\n   - From lime slices: `total_slices // n`\n   - From salt: `total_salt // (n * np)`\n\n4. **Result Calculation**: The maximum number of toasts each friend can make is the minimum value from the three calculated values above, as each resource limits the number of possible toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input from stdin\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    # Read the input line and split into integers\n    line = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    inputs = list(map(int, line.split()))\n    \n    # Extract the parameters\n    n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np = inputs\n    \n    # Calculate total available resources\n    total_drink = k * l\n    total_slices = c * d\n    total_salt = p\n    \n    # Calculate maximum toasts possible from each resource\n    max_drink = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    max_lime = total_slices // n\n    max_salt = total_salt // (n * np)\n    \n    # The answer is the minimum of the three\n    result = min(max_drink, max_lime, max_salt)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read as a single line and split into individual integers.\n- **Resource Calculation**: The total available drink, lime slices, and salt are computed based on the given inputs.\n- **Toast Constraints**: For each resource, the maximum number of toasts that can be made is determined by integer division of the total available resource by the required amount per toast.\n- **Result Determination**: The minimum value among the three constraints gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all constraints are satisfied. This approach efficiently handles all edge cases and ensures optimal performance.",
