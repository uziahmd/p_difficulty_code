A group of n friends decided to buy k bottles of a soft drink called \"Take-It-Light\" to warm up a bit. Each bottle has l milliliters of the drink. Also they bought c limes and cut each of them into d slices. After that they found p grams of salt.To make a toast, each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink, a slice of lime and np grams of salt. The friends want to make as many toasts as they can, provided they all drink the same amount. How many toasts can each friend make?\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line contains positive integers n, k, l, c, d, p, nl, np, not exceeding 1000 and no less than 1. The numbers are separated by exactly one space.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of toasts each friend can make.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1', '5 100 10 1 19 90 4 3', '10 1000 1000 25 23 1 50 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '3', '0']\n\n## Note\nA comment to the first sample: Overall the friends have 4 * 5 = 20 milliliters of the drink, it is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. The limes are enough for 10 * 8 = 80 toasts and the salt is enough for 100 / 1 = 100 toasts. However, there are 3 friends in the group, so the answer is min(6, 80, 100) / 3 = 2.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about a group of friends who want to make as many toasts as possible. Each toast requires certain amounts of drink, lime slices, and salt. All friends must make the same number of toasts. So I need to find the maximum number of toasts per friend possible given the resources.\n\nLet me break down the inputs. The input consists of n (number of friends), k (number of bottles), l (ml per bottle), c (number of limes), d (slices per lime), p (grams of salt), nl (ml of drink per toast per friend), np (grams of salt per toast per friend).\n\nWait, the problem says each friend needs nl milliliters of drink per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. So total drink per toast is n * nl. Similarly, each toast requires one slice per friend, so total slices per toast is n slices. And salt per toast is n * np grams.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nCalculate the total available drink: k * l ml. Then, how many toasts can be made based on drink? It's (total_drink) // (n * nl). Because each toast requires n * nl ml in total.\n\nThen, total lime slices available is c * d. Each toast needs n slices. So total possible toasts from limes is (c*d) // n.\n\nSalt: total is p grams. Each toast requires n * np grams. So possible toasts from salt is p // (n * np).\n\nThe answer is the minimum of these three values. Because all three constraints must be satisfied.\n\nWait, but let me check the first example:\n\nSample input 1: 3 4 5 10 8 100 3 1\n\nTotal drink is 4*5=20. Each toast requires 3 friends * 3 ml per toast per friend? Wait, no. Wait, the parameters are nl is 3. So per toast, each friend needs nl ml. So per toast, total drink needed is n * nl. For example, in the first case, 3 friends, each needs 3 ml per toast. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. So total toasts from drink is 20 / 9 = 2.222..., which is 2 when integer division. Which matches the sample explanation.\n\nYes. Then the sample says that the drink allows 6 toasts. Wait, wait, what's the sample explanation? Oh, the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. Wait, why?\n\nOh, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: each friend needs nl milliliters of the drink per toast. So for one toast, each of the n friends needs nl ml. Therefore, for one toast, total drink needed is n * nl. But in the sample explanation, they have 20 ml. For 3 friends, each toast requires 3 ml per friend. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. 20 /9 is 2.222... which would be 2. But the sample explanation says that the drink is enough for 20/3 = 6 toasts. Wait, that's conflicting. What's going on here?\n\nWait, the sample explanation says: \"the drink is enough to make 20 / 3 = 6 toasts.\" Wait, why divided by 3? Because perhaps I have the problem statement wrong.\n\nLet me recheck the problem statement. Oh! Oh right! Wait, the problem says that each friend needs nl milliliters per toast. So for each toast, each friend has nl ml. So for one toast, the total drink required is n * nl. But in the sample input, the first case is n=3, nl=3. So per toast, 3 * 3 =9 ml. But the sample explanation says that 20 / 3 = 6 toasts. That suggests that the total drink per toast is nl per friend. Wait, perhaps the problem says that for each toast, each friend needs nl ml. So for each toast, the total is n * nl. But the sample explanation says that 20 /3 is 6. So that would imply that the total per toast is nl, not multiplied by n. That's conflicting.\n\nWait the sample explanation says:\n\nOverall the friends have 4*5=20 ml. It is enough to make 20/3 = 6 toasts. But according to the problem statement, each toast requires each friend to have nl ml. So for one toast, each of the 3 friends needs 3 ml. So total per",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum number of toasts each friend can make given the constraints on the available resources: soft drink, lime slices, and salt. Each toast requires a specific amount of drink per friend, a slice of lime per friend, and a specific amount of salt per friend.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate Total Resources**: \n   - **Drink**: Calculate the total milliliters of drink available by multiplying the number of bottles by the milliliters per bottle.\n   - **Lime Slices**: Calculate the total number of lime slices available by multiplying the number of limes by the number of slices per lime.\n   - **Salt**: Use the given grams of salt directly.\n\n2. **Determine Resource Constraints**:\n   - **Drink per Toast**: Each toast requires `n * nl` milliliters of drink (since each of the `n` friends needs `nl` milliliters).\n   - **Lime Slices per Toast**: Each toast requires `n` slices (since each of the `n` friends needs one slice).\n   - **Salt per Toast**: Each toast requires `n * np` grams of salt (since each of the `n` friends needs `np` grams).\n\n3. **Compute Maximum Possible Toasts**:\n   - For each resource, compute how many toasts can be made based on the available quantity and the requirement per toast.\n   - The final answer is the minimum of these values, as all resources must be sufficient for the same number of toasts.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    n = int(input[0])\n    k = int(input[1])\n    l = int(input[2])\n    c = int(input[3])\n    d = int(input[4])\n    p = int(input[5])\n    nl = int(input[6])\n    np = int(input[7])\n    \n    total_drink = k * l\n    drink_toasts = total_drink // (n * nl)\n    \n    total_lime_slices = c * d\n    lime_toasts = total_lime_slices // n\n    \n    salt_toasts = p // (n * np)\n    \n    result = min(drink_toasts, lime_toasts, salt_toasts)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input values are read as integers from standard input.\n- **Total Drink Calculation**: The total amount of drink available is calculated by multiplying the number of bottles (`k`) by the milliliters per bottle (`l`).\n- **Toast Constraints**:\n  - **Drink**: The number of toasts possible based on drink is calculated by dividing the total drink by the required amount per toast (`n * nl`).\n  - **Lime Slices**: The number of toasts possible based on lime slices is calculated by dividing the total slices by the number of slices needed per toast (`n`).\n  - **Salt**: The number of toasts possible based on salt is calculated by dividing the total salt by the required amount per toast (`n * np`).\n- **Result Calculation**: The minimum of the three values computed above gives the maximum number of toasts each friend can make, ensuring all resources are sufficient. This result is then printed.",
