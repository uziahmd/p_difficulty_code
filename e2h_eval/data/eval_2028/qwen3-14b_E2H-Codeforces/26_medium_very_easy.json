    "thought": "\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The task is to count the number of non-degenerate triangles with sides x, y, z that satisfy certain constraints based on the given A, B, C, D. Let me think through the conditions and how to approach this efficiently.\n\nFirst, the constraints on the sides are A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. Also, since it's a triangle, the triangle inequality must hold. For a non-degenerate triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third. But since the sides are ordered, perhaps we can find a way to simplify this.\n\nWait, the problem says that x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z. So the order of the sides is x ≤ y ≤ z. Because x is up to B, y starts from B and goes up to C, and z starts from C up to D. Wait, no. Wait, the condition is A ≤ x ≤ B ≤ y ≤ C ≤ z ≤ D. So x can be between A and B, y is between B and C (since B ≤ y ≤ C), and z is between C and D. But the order of the sides: since x ≤ B ≤ y, so x ≤ y. And y ≤ C ≤ z, so y ≤ z. Therefore, the three sides are ordered as x ≤ y ≤ z. \n\nSo for a triangle with sides x, y, z (in order), the triangle inequality requires that x + y > z. Because since z is the largest side, the other inequalities (x + z > y and y + z > x) will automatically hold if x and y are positive. So the key condition here is x + y > z.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting all triples (x, y, z) where x is in [A, B], y is in [B, C], z is in [C, D], and x ≤ y ≤ z, and x + y > z.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently given the constraints on the input size (up to 5e5)?\n\nLet me think about how to approach this. The brute-force approach would be to iterate over all possible x, y, z and check the condition, but with ranges up to 5e5, this would be O(B * C * D) which is way too big. So we need a smarter approach.\n\nLet me break down the problem into parts. Since x ranges from A to B, y from B to C, and z from C to D, and x ≤ y ≤ z. So for each x and y, we can determine the valid z's that satisfy x + y > z and z ≥ C, z ≥ y (since z ≥ C and y ≤ C, so z ≥ y). Wait, since y ≤ C and z ≥ C, then z ≥ y. So for each x and y, the z's must be in [C, D], but also satisfy z < x + y. Because z has to be less than x + y. So for each x and y, the valid z's are those in the interval [C, min(D, x + y - 1)]. But since z must be ≥ C, the lower bound is C, and upper bound is min(D, x + y - 1). However, if x + y -1 < C, then there are no such z. So for each x and y, the number of valid z is max(0, min(D, x + y -1) - C + 1) if min(D, x + y -1) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the total number of triangles is the sum over all x in [A, B], y in [B, C], of the number of z's that satisfy C ≤ z ≤ min(D, x + y -1).\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me consider the variables x and y. For each x and y, we can compute the upper limit for z as U = x + y - 1. Then the valid z's are between C and min(U, D). So the count for z is max(0, min(U, D) - C + 1) if min(U, D) >= C. Otherwise zero.\n\nSo the problem becomes: compute sum_{x=A}^B sum_{y=B}^C [max(0, min(x + y - 1, D) - C + 1)].\n\nBut even this approach would take O(B * (C - B + 1)) time. Let's see: for example, if B and C are up to 5e5, then B*(C-B+1) could be O( (5e5)^2 ) which is 2.5e11 operations. That's way too slow. So we need to find a way to optimize this.\n\nSo we need to find a way to calculate this sum more efficiently. Let's think about the variables x and y. Since x ranges from A to B, and y ranges from B to C. Let's note that for a fixed x and y, the contribution is determined by the value of x + y. Let me think about the possible values of s = x + y. For each s, what is the number of (x, y) pairs that have that sum, and then compute for each s the contribution to the total.\n\nBut how to find the number of (x, y) pairs for each s?\n\nAlternatively, for each possible s, we can find the range of s where min(s - 1, D) >= C. Because for each s, the upper bound of z is min(s-1, D). Let me think:\n\nThe value of min(s-1, D) is equal to:\n\nif s - 1 >= D → D\n\nelse s - 1.\n\nBut the condition for the z's to exist is that min(s-1, D) >= C → which implies that s-1 >= C → s >= C + 1. Or, if D < C, then it's impossible. Wait, but since C ≤ D, because the input is A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D. So C is at most D. So for min(s-1, D) >= C, we need s - 1 >= C, because D >= C. So the condition is s - 1 >= C → s >= C + 1.\n\nSo for each (x, y) pair where x + y >= C + 1, the number of z is (min(D, x + y - 1) - C + 1) = (x + y - 1 - C + 1) if x + y - 1 <= D → x + y - C. Or if x + y - 1 > D, then D - C + 1.\n\nSo the contribution for a pair (x, y) is:\n\nif x + y <= C → 0.\n\nif x + y > C and x + y -1 <= D → (x + y - C)\n\nif x + y -1 > D → (D - C + 1)\n\nSo the problem can be split into two parts:\n\nFor all (x, y) pairs where x + y > C:\n\ncontribution is either (x + y - C) or (D - C + 1), depending on whether x + y -1 is <= D or not.\n\nSo the total sum is:\n\nsum_{x, y} [ if x + y > C then max(0, min(x + y - 1, D) - C + 1) else 0 ]\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\nsum_{x, y} [ max(0, min(x + y - 1, D) - C + 1) ] where x + y > C.\n\nBut how to compute this sum efficiently?\n\nLet me think about the possible ranges of x and y. Let's denote:\n\nx ranges from A to B.\n\ny ranges from B to C.\n\nLet me consider that for each x, y can be from B to C. Let me think of the sum over x and y as:\n\nTotal = sum_{x = A}^B [ sum_{y = B}^C [ ... ] ]\n\nSo for each x, I need to compute the sum over y in [B, C] of the value for that x and y.\n\nLet me fix x. Then for each x, we can compute the sum over y.\n\nLet me think about for a fixed x, the sum over y from B to C of:\n\nif x + y > C → then min(x + y - 1, D) - C + 1.\n\nBut since x is fixed, and y varies, perhaps we can find for which values of y this is the case.\n\nLet me think: x is fixed. For each y, the sum is:\n\nif x + y > C → which is equivalent to y > C - x. Since y >= B and C - x can be anything.\n\nBut since y ranges from B to C, and x is between A and B.\n\nLet me think about the possible cases. For a fixed x, the minimal y is B, and maximal is C.\n\nSo for y to satisfy x + y > C → y > C - x.\n\nSo for each x, the minimal y that contributes is max(B, floor(C - x) + 1). Let me compute the lower bound for y.\n\nLet me define for a fixed x, the lower bound of y as y_low = max(B, C - x + 1). Because y needs to be >= B, and also y > C - x → y >= C - x + 1.\n\nIf y_low > C, then there are no contributing y for this x. Otherwise, for y in [y_low, C], we have x + y > C.\n\nNow, for each such y, the contribution is min(x + y - 1, D) - C + 1.\n\nLet me split this into two cases:\n\nCase 1: x + y - 1 <= D → contribution is x + y - C.\n\nCase 2: x + y - 1 > D → contribution is D - C + 1.\n\nSo for a fixed x, the sum over y can be split into two parts: y's where x + y <= D + 1, and those where x + y > D + 1.\n\nWait, x + y - 1 <= D → x + y <= D + 1 → y <= D + 1 - x.\n\nSo for a fixed x, the threshold for y is y_max = D + 1 - x. If y_max >= y_low, then for y in [y_low, y_max], contribution is x + y - C. For y in [y_max + 1, C], contribution is D - C + 1.\n\nBut how to compute these ranges?\n\nSo for a fixed x, after determining y_low (the minimum y that satisfies x + y > C), we can find the upper bound for the first case (y_max_case1 = min(C, D + 1 - x)). Then:\n\nif y_low > C → no contribution.\n\nelse:\n\nnumber of y in [y_low, y_max_case1] is max(0, y_max_case1 - y_low + 1).\n\nand for those y, the sum is sum_{y = y_low}^{y_max_case1} (x + y - C) = sum (x - C + y) = (x - C) * (count) + sum(y).\n\nSimilarly, the number of y in [y_max_case1 + 1, C] is max(0, C - (y_max_case1 + 1) + 1) = max(0, C - y_max_case1).\n\nEach of those contributes (D - C + 1).\n\nSo for each x, we can compute this sum in O(1) time, provided we can compute the ranges and sums quickly.\n\nThis seems manageable. Now, the problem is to compute this for each x in A to B.\n\nBut how to compute the sum for each x?\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nFor a given x:\n\nCompute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\nif y_low > C → no contribution.\n\nElse:\n\ny_upper = min(C, D + 1 - x)\n\nif y_upper < y_low → then only the second part (but since y_upper >= y_low? No, if y_upper is min(...), then it can be less than y_low. Wait, no. Because y_low is the minimum y that makes x + y > C. So if y_upper is less than y_low, that means that for all y in [y_low, C], x + y > C but x + y <= D + 1 -x? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nWait, y_upper is min(C, D + 1 - x). So if D + 1 - x is less than y_low, then y_upper is D + 1 -x, which is less than y_low. Which implies that for all y in [y_low, C], x + y > C and x + y > D + 1 - x + 1? Wait, not sure. Let me think of an example. Suppose D is very large. Then y_upper would be C, and all y in [y_low, C] contribute to case 1. If D is small, then y_upper could be less than y_low, which would imply that there are no y in [y_low, ...], hence the entire contribution comes from case 2. But that's not possible, because if y_upper is less than y_low, then the first case's upper bound is less than the lower bound, meaning there are no elements in case 1. Hence, the entire contribution is from case 2, but only if y_low <= C.\n\nWait, perhaps I should proceed step by step.\n\nOnce y_low is determined, then:\n\nif y_low > C → no contribution.\n\nElse:\n\nCompute y_upper = min(C, D + 1 - x)\n\nif y_upper >= y_low:\n\nthen case1_y_count = y_upper - y_low + 1\n\nsum_case1 = sum_{y = y_low}^{y_upper} (x + y - C) \n\n= sum (x - C) + sum y \n\n= (x - C) * case1_y_count + sum(y from y_low to y_upper)\n\nsum(y from a to b) is (b - a + 1) * (a + b) / 2\n\nThen, case2_y_count = max(0, C - y_upper)\n\nsum_case2 = case2_y_count * (D - C + 1)\n\nTotal for this x is sum_case1 + sum_case2.\n\nElse (y_upper < y_low):\n\nthen case1_y_count = 0 → sum_case1 = 0\n\ncase2_y_count = max(0, C - y_low + 1) ?\n\nWait, no. Because in this case, for all y >= y_low, x + y -1 > D. Because y_upper is min(C, D + 1 -x) < y_low → D + 1 -x < y_low → x + y >= x + y_low > x + (D + 1 -x) → since y_low > D + 1 -x. Wait, no. Let me think:\n\ny_upper = min(C, D + 1 -x) < y_low → which implies that D + 1 -x < y_low (since C >= y_low, as y_low is <= C). So D + 1 -x < y_low → x + y_low > D + 1 → x + y_low -1 > D → which means that for all y >= y_low, x + y -1 >= x + y_low -1 > D → so their contribution is D - C + 1.\n\nThus, the case2_y_count is (C - y_low + 1) → since y ranges from y_low to C.\n\nSo sum_case2 = (C - y_low + 1) * (D - C + 1)\n\nTherefore, the code for each x would be:\n\ncompute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\nif y_low > C → add 0\n\nelse:\n\ny_upper = min(C, D + 1 - x)\n\nif y_upper >= y_low:\n\n   compute case1 and case2 as above\n\nelse:\n\n   case2 is (C - y_low + 1) * (D - C + 1)\n\nSo the key is to compute for each x these values.\n\nNow, the question is how to compute this efficiently for all x in [A, B].\n\nThe next step is to loop through all x from A to B, and for each x perform these calculations. Let's check the time complexity. For each x, the calculation is O(1), so overall O(B - A + 1) operations. Since B can be up to 5e5, this is acceptable.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\nLoop x from A to B:\n\n   compute y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   if y_low > C → continue (no contribution)\n\n   else:\n\n      compute y_upper = min(C, D + 1 - x)\n\n      if y_upper >= y_low:\n\n          case1_y_count = y_upper - y_low + 1\n\n          sum_case1 = (x - C) * case1_y_count + sum(y from y_low to y_upper)\n\n          case2_y_count = max(0, C - y_upper)\n\n          sum_case2 = case2_y_count * (D - C + 1)\n\n          total += sum_case1 + sum_case2\n\n      else:\n\n          case2_y_count = C - y_low + 1\n\n          sum_case2 = case2_y_count * (D - C + 1)\n\n          total += sum_case2\n\nBut how to compute sum(y from a to b)? Well, that's straightforward with the formula (a + b) * (b - a + 1) // 2.\n\nNow, let's test this logic against the sample input.\n\nSample Input 1: 1 2 3 4 → Output 4.\n\nLet's walk through the code.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=3, D=4.\n\nFor x in 1, 2.\n\nx=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3 - 1 +1) → max(2, 3) → 3. Since C is 3, y_low is 3. So y ranges from 3 to 3 (since C=3).\n\ny_upper = min(3, 4 + 1 -1) → min(3, 4) → 3. So y_upper >= y_low (3 >= 3).\n\ncase1_y_count = 1.\n\nsum_case1:\n\n(x - C) is 1 -3 = -2. Multiply by 1 → -2.\n\nsum(y from 3 to 3) is 3.\n\nTotal sum_case1 is -2 +3 = 1.\n\ncase2_y_count = C - y_upper = 3 -3 = 0 → sum_case2 = 0. So total for x=1 is 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 3 -2 +1) → max(2, 2) → 2. Since y ranges from B=2 to C=3.\n\ny_upper = min(3, 4 + 1 -2) → min(3, 3) → 3.\n\nso case1_y_count = 3 -2 +1 = 2.\n\nsum_case1:\n\nx - C is 2-3 = -1. Multiply by 2 → -2.\n\nsum(y from 2 to 3) is (2+3)*2/2 = 5.\n\nsum_case1 = -2 +5 = 3.\n\ncase2_y_count is 3 -3 = 0 → sum_case2 is 0. So total for x=2 is 3.\n\nTotal overall is 1 + 3 = 4, which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nAnother sample: input '1 2 2 5' → output 3.\n\nA=1, B=2, C=2, D=5.\n\nx ranges from 1 to 2.\n\nFor x=1:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2 -1 +1) = max(2, 2) = 2. C is 2, so y ranges from 2 to 2.\n\ny_upper = min(2, 5 +1 -1) = min(2,5) → 2. So case1.\n\nsum_case1:\n\nx - C = 1-2 = -1. case1_y_count is 1. sum(y) is 2. sum_case1 is -1*1 +2 = 1.\n\ncase2_y_count = 0. total for x=1 is 1.\n\nx=2:\n\ny_low = max(2, 2 - 2 +1) = max(2, 1) → 2. C is 2.\n\ny_upper = min(2, 5 +1 -2) = min(2,4) → 2.\n\ncase1_y_count is 1. sum_case1 is (2-2)*1 + 2 → 0 +2 = 2.\n\nsum_case2 is 0. total for x=2 is 2. So overall total 1 +2 =3. Which matches the sample. Correct.\n\nThird sample: 500000 500000 500000 500000. So A=B=C=D=500000.\n\nx can be 500000.\n\ny ranges from B=500000 to C=500000 → y=500000.\n\nz ranges from C=500000 to D=500000 → z=500000.\n\nCheck x + y > z → 500000 + 500000 > 500000 → yes. So the count is 1.\n\nSo the code would process x=500000:\n\ny_low = max(B=500000, C -x +1 = 500000 - 500000 +1 = 1) → 500000.\n\ny_upper = min(C=500000, D +1 -x = 500000 +1 -500000 = 1) → min(500000, 1) → 1. Which is less than y_low (500000). So case2_y_count is C - y_low +1 = 500000 -500000 +1 = 1. Multiply by D - C +1 = 500000 -500000 +1 =1. So sum_case2 =1 *1 =1. So total is 1. Correct.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut we need to handle very large numbers. However, since all calculations are O(1) per x, and the loop is O(B -A +1), which is up to 5e5 steps, it should be manageable.\n\nNow, code steps:\n\nRead A, B, C, D.\n\nInitialize total = 0.\n\nLoop x from A to B inclusive:\n\n   y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n\n   if y_low > C:\n\n       continue\n\n   else:\n\n       y_upper = min(C, D + 1 -x)\n\n       if y_upper >= y_low:\n\n           case1_count = y_upper - y_low + 1\n\n           sum_case1_part = (x - C) * case1_count\n\n           a = y_low\n\n           b = y_upper\n\n           sum_y = (a + b) * case1_count // 2\n\n           sum_case1 = sum_case1_part + sum_y\n\n           case2_count = max(0, C - y_upper)\n\n           sum_case2 = case2_count * (D - C + 1)\n\n           total += sum_case1 + sum_case2\n\n       else:\n\n           case2_count = C - y_low + 1\n\n           sum_case2 = case2_count * (D - C + 1)\n\n           total += sum_case2\n\nReturn total.\n\nBut wait, in the case where y_upper is less than y_low, then case2_count is C - y_low + 1?\n\nYes. Because y ranges from y_low to C, which is (C - y_low +1) terms.\n\nBut let's check:\n\nfor example, if y_low = 3, C=3, then case2_count is 3 -3 +1 =1.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in Python, for loops can be written as for x in range(A, B+1):\n\nBut when A and B are up to 5e5, this is acceptable.\n\nBut for Python, looping from A to B (inclusive) when B is 5e5 is manageable.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1: 1 2 3 4 → total is 4.\n\nSample 2: 1 2 2 5 → total is 3.\n\nSample 3: 500000 500000 500000 500000 → total is 1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead input lines. Wait, the problem says that the input is given as multiple test cases? Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as four integers on the first line. But in the example, the input is given as multiple lines, like ['1 2 3 4', '1 2 2 5', ...]. Wait, the original problem says that the input is four integers. But the example shows that there are multiple test cases. Wait, the user's note says that the input is given as four integers. But the example shows that the input may have multiple lines. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput:\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C, D.\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as three lines, each being a test case. So perhaps the actual problem is that the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. But the original problem statement may have been ambiguous. However, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe original problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nIn the example, the input is given as three lines, each representing a separate test case, and the output is three lines. So the code must read multiple test cases. However, the problem statement's input description says that the first line contains four integers. This seems conflicting.\n\nWait, looking back:\n\nThe problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains four integers: A, B, C and D (1 ≤ A ≤ B ≤ C ≤ D ≤ 5e5).\n\nBut in the example, the input is given as three lines. So perhaps the actual problem is that the code must read multiple test cases, each being a line of four integers. For example, the sample input is three lines, each being a separate test case. The output is three lines, each being the answer for the respective test case.\n\nBut the original problem statement's input says \"the first line contains four integers\", but the example shows multiple lines. So perhaps the problem is that the code must read multiple test cases, each on a separate line. Therefore, the code must read all lines from stdin, process each as a separate test case, and output the answers.\n\nBut the original problem's input description may have been incorrect. However, the example shows that the input is multiple lines. So the code must read multiple test cases, each being a line of four integers.\n\nThus, the code must read all lines from stdin, split each into A, B, C, D, and compute the answer for each.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nimport sys\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n\n    A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n\n    # compute answer and print\n\nBut in the sample input, the first example input is given as three lines, but the output is three lines. So the code must read each line as a test case.\n\nNow, implementing the code.\n\nBut let's think about possible edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: A=B=C=D=1 → answer is 1 (triangle 1,1,1).\n\nEdge case 2: A=1, B=1, C=2, D=2. So x can be 1, y can be 2, z can be 2. Check x + y > z → 1+2>2 → 3>2 → yes. So count 1.\n\nAnother edge case: when D is very small. For example, A=1, B=2, C=3, D=3. Then for x=1, y_low is max(2, 3 -1 +1)= max(2,3) =3. y ranges from 3 to 3. For x=1, y=3. Then x + y -1 = 1 +3 -1=3. So min(3, D=3) is 3. So contribution is 3 - C +1 = 3 -3 +1 =1. So for x=1, contribution is 1. For x=2, y_low is max(2, 3 -2 +1) = max(2, 2) =2. y_upper is min(3, 3+1 -2= 2). So y_upper is 2. So case1_count is 2-2+1=1. sum_case1: (2-3)*1 + sum(y=2) → -1 +2 =1. case2_count is 3-2=1 → 0? Wait, no. Because y_upper is 2, which is min(3, 3+1 -2= 2). So case2_count is max(0, 3 - 2) = 1. So sum_case2 is 1*(D - C +1) → D is 3, C is 3 → 3-3+1=1 → sum_case2 is 1*1=1. So total for x=2 is 1 + 1 = 2? Wait, no, because in the code, for case1 and case2:\n\nWait, when y_upper is 2, which is >= y_low (2). So case1_count is 1. sum_case1 is (x - C) * case1_count + sum(y). Then case2_count is C - y_upper = 3 - 2 = 1. So sum_case2 is 1 * (D - C +1) → 1 * 1 = 1. So total for x=2 is 1 + 1 = 2. So overall total is 1 + 2 =3. But what are the actual triangles?\n\nPossible triangles:\n\nx can be 1 or 2.\n\nFor x=1, y=3, z can be 3 → (1,3,3): valid.\n\nFor x=2, y=2, z can be min(2+2-1=3, D=3) → z can be 3. So (2,2,3). Also, for x=2, y=2, z can be 3. So that's one. Also, for case2_count, when y_upper is 2 (y=2), then for y_upper=2, the case2_count is 3-2 =1 (C - y_upper = 3-2=1?), but why? Because y_upper is 2, which is min(3, D+1 -x = 3+1 -2=2). So for y_upper=2, the case1 is for y in [y_low=2, 2], which is handled. Then case2_count is C - y_upper = 3-2 =1. But what does that mean? Because for y_upper=2, which is the upper bound of case1, then case2 is for y in [y_upper +1, C] → y_upper +1 =3. But C is 3. So y ranges from 3 to 3. So case2_count is 1. For each such y (y=3), the contribution is D - C +1 = 1. So for x=2, y=3. But wait, y ranges from B=2 to C=3. So for y=3, x=2. Then x + y = 5, which is greater than C=3. So z can be between C=3 and min(5-1=4, D=3) → 3. So contribution is 3-3 +1 =1. So for y=3, the contribution is 1. So for x=2, the code counts 1 (from case1) +1 (from case2) = 2. So for x=2, the total is 2. So the overall total is 1 (x=1) + 2 (x=2) =3. Which would correspond to the three triangles:\n\n(1,3,3), (2,2,3), (2,3,3). Are these all valid?\n\nYes. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, implement it in Python.\n\nBut note that for the case when D - C + 1 is negative? No, because D >= C. So D - C +1 >= 1.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead each line, process as A, B, C, D.\n\nThen compute the total as explained.\n\nNow, code:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        A, B, C, D = map(int, line.strip().split())\n        total = 0\n        for x in range(A, B + 1):\n            y_low = max(B, C - x + 1)\n            if y_low > C:\n                continue\n            y_upper = min(C, D + 1 - x)\n            if y_upper >= y_low:\n                case1_count = y_upper - y_low + 1\n                sum_case1_part = (x - C) * case1_count\n                a = y_low\n                b = y_upper\n                sum_y = (a + b) * case1_count // 2\n                sum_case1 = sum_case1_part + sum_y\n                case2_count = max(0, C - y_upper)\n                sum_case2 = case2_count * (D - C + 1)\n                total += sum_case1 + sum_case2\n            else:\n                case2_count = C - y_low + 1\n                sum_case2 = case2_count * (D - C + 1)\n                total += sum_case2\n        print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nBut wait, what if D + 1 -x is negative? For example, if x is very large. But since x is up to B, which is <= C <= D. So D +1 -x >= D +1 - B. Since B <= C <= D, D +1 - B >= D +1 - C >= 1 (since D >= C). Because D +1 - C >= 1 (since D >= C). So D +1 -x is at least D +1 - B >= D +1 - C >= 1. So y_upper is min(C, something >= 1). So no problem.\n\nBut let's think when x is large. For example, x = B, which is <= C. So D +1 -x could be larger than C, so y_upper is C.\n\nBut the code handles that.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput line '1 2 3 4' → output 4.\n\nSample 2: '1 2 2 5' → output 3.\n\nSample 3: '500000 500000 500000 500000' → output 1.\n\nNow, for the third sample, in code:\n\nx = 500000.\n\ny_low = max(B=500000, C -x +1 = 500000 -500000 +1 = 1) → 500000.\n\ny_upper = min(C=500000, D+1 -x = 500000 +1 -500000 = 1) → 1.\n\nSince 1 < y_low (500000), enter else clause:\n\ncase2_count = 500000 - 500000 +1 = 1.\n\nsum_case2 = 1 * (D - C +1) → 500000-500000 +1 =1 → 1*1=1. So total is 1. Correct.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nAnother test case: when A=B=1, C=D=1. Then x=1, y_low = max(1, 1 -1 +1) = max(1, 1) =1. C is 1. y_upper is min(1, 1+1 -1=1). So case1_count =1. sum_case1_part is (1-1)*1 =0. sum_y is (1+1)*1//2 =1. sum_case1 is 0 +1 =1. case2_count = 1 -1 =0. So total += 1. So output is 1. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: A=1, B=1, C=2, D=2. So x can be 1. y_low = max(1, 2 -1 +1",

A non-degenerate triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality, which in this context simplifies to $x + y > z$ because $z$ is the largest side.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Constraints Analysis**: Given the constraints $A \\leq x \\leq B \\leq y \\leq C \\leq z \\leq D$, we know $x \\leq y \\leq z$. The key condition for a valid triangle is $x + y > z$.\n2. **Iterate Over Possible Values**: For each possible value of $x$ from $A$ to $B$, determine valid ranges for $y$ and $z$ such that the triangle inequality holds.\n3. **Efficient Calculation**: For each $x$, compute the minimum value of $y$ (denoted as $y_{\\text{low}}$) that ensures $x + y > C$.
