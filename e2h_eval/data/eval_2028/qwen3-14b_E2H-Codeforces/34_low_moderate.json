And as you may already know, one week in Berland lasts k days!When Polycarp went to a doctor with his problem, the doctor asked him about his sleeping schedule (more specifically, the average amount of hours of sleep per week). Luckily, Polycarp kept records of sleep times for the last n days. So now he has a sequence a1, a2, ..., an, where ai is the sleep time on the i-th day.The number of records is so large that Polycarp is unable to calculate the average value by himself. Thus he is asking you to help him with the calculations. To get the average Polycarp is going to consider k consecutive days as a week. So there will be n - k + 1 weeks to take into consideration. For example, if k = 2, n = 3 and a = [3, 4, 7], then the result is .You should write a program which will calculate average sleep times of Polycarp over all weeks.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2·105).The second line contains n integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 105).\n\n## Output\nOutput average sleeping time over all weeks. The answer is considered to be correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10 - 6. In particular, it is enough to output real number with at least 6 digits after the decimal point.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n3 4 7', '1 1\\n10', '8 2\\n1 2 4 100000 123 456 789 1']\n\n### Output\n['9.0000000000', '10.0000000000', '28964.2857142857']\n\n## Note\nIn the third example there are n - k + 1 = 7 weeks, so the answer is sums of all weeks divided by 7.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nThe problem is about calculating the average sleep time over all possible weeks. Each week is defined as k consecutive days. For each of these weeks, we calculate the sum of the sleep times and then find the average of all those sums. The output needs to be precise with at least six decimal digits.\n\nSo the input gives n and k, followed by a list of n integers. The output is the average of all the possible consecutive k-day periods.\n\nLet me think about the approach. The straightforward way would be to compute the sum for each window of size k and then take the average of those sums. However, if n is up to 2e5, then a naive approach that checks each window by adding up k elements each time would be O(n*k), which would be 4e10 operations. That's way too slow. So we need a more efficient method.\n\nAh right, the sliding window technique. We can compute the sum of the first window in O(k) time, and then each subsequent window can be computed in O(1) time by subtracting the element that's left behind and adding the new element that comes in. This way, the total time complexity is O(n), which is acceptable for n up to 2e5.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Compute the initial sum of the first k elements.\n2. Add this sum to a total sum variable.\n3. Then, for each next window (from position 1 to n - k), subtract the element that's no longer in the window (a[i-1]) and add the new element (a[i + k - 1]). Add this to the total sum.\n4. Once all windows are processed, divide the total sum by the number of weeks (which is n - k + 1) to get the average.\n\nBut wait, what about the data types? Since the numbers can be up to 1e5 and there are up to 2e5 elements, the sum could be as big as 1e5 * 2e5 = 2e10. In Python, integers can handle that, so no problem with overflow.\n\nNow, let's think about the implementation.\n\nFirst, read the input. The first line has n and k. The second line has the list of a's.\n\nBut wait, looking at the example inputs given, like the first example input is '3 2\\n3 4 7'. So the input is read as two lines. The first line is n and k, the second is the list of numbers.\n\nSo in Python, I'll read the first line as n, k = map(int, input().split()), then the second line as list(map(int, input().split())).\n\nOnce we have the list, compute the initial sum of the first k elements. Then iterate from i=1 to (n -k) times, updating the current sum.\n\nWait, how many weeks are there? It's (n -k +1). So for example, when n=3, k=2, there are 2 weeks. The first is [3,4], the second is [4,7]. The sum is 7 and 11, average is (7+11)/2 = 9. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code steps:\n\nCompute the total_sum as the sum of all the window sums.\n\nThen, the average is total_sum / (number_of_weeks).\n\nNow, the number of weeks is (n -k +1). So for the first sample, 3-2+1=2 weeks.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n, k.\n\nRead the array a.\n\nIf k ==0? No, since constraints say 1<=k<=n.\n\nCompute the initial window sum.\n\nThen, for each next window, subtract a[i-1], add a[i + k -1], and accumulate.\n\nBut how to loop through the windows?\n\nLet me think: the first window is from index 0 to k-1. Then, for each next window, the start index increases by 1. So for the next window, start is 1, then 2, etc., until start is (n -k) (since start + k -1 = n -k +k -1 = n-1).\n\nSo the number of windows is (n -k +1). So the loop for the sliding window would run (n -k) times after the initial sum. Because the initial sum is the first window, then we have (n -k) more windows.\n\nWait, no. The initial sum is the first window. Then, for each of the remaining (n -k) windows, we do the sliding step. So total number of windows is 1 + (n -k) = n -k +1, which is correct.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\ncurrent_sum = sum(a[0",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average sleep time over all possible consecutive weeks of k days from a given list of n days. The solution must be efficient to handle large input sizes up to 200,000 days.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sliding Window Technique**: This technique allows us to efficiently compute the sum of each consecutive k-day window in linear time. By maintaining a running sum and adjusting it as we slide the window across the list, we avoid recalculating the sum from scratch for each window.\n2. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the first k elements to initialize the sliding window.\n3. **Iterate Through Windows**: For each subsequent window, adjust the sum by subtracting the element that exits the window and adding the new element that enters the window.\n4. **Compute Average**: Sum all the window sums and divide by the number of valid windows (n - k + 1) to get the average sleep time.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split('\\n')\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    if idx >= len(input):\n        return\n    n, k = map(int, input[idx].split())\n    idx += 1\n    while idx < len(input) and input[idx] == '':\n        idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx].split()))\n    \n    total_weeks = n - k + 1\n    if total_weeks == 0:\n        print(\"0.0000000000\")\n        return\n    \n    current_sum = sum(a[:k])\n    total_sum = current_sum\n    \n    for i in range(1, total_weeks):\n        current_sum = current_sum - a[i-1] + a[i + k - 1]\n        total_sum += current_sum\n    \n    average = total_sum / total_weeks\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(average))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read in one go for efficiency, especially given the potentially large size of the input.\n- **Initial Sum Calculation**: The sum of the first k elements is computed once to initialize the sliding window.\n- **Sliding Window Adjustment**: For each subsequent window, the sum is adjusted by subtracting the element that is no longer in the window and adding the new element that has entered the window. This adjustment ensures each window sum is computed in constant time.\n- **Precision Handling**: The result is printed with 10 decimal places to meet the required precision constraints, ensuring the absolute or relative error does not exceed 1e-6.\n\nThis approach ensures an efficient O(n) time complexity, making it suitable for large input sizes up to the given constraint of 200,000 days.",
