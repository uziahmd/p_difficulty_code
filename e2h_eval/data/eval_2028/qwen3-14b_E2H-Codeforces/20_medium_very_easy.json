For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. The problem is about counting the number of ways to choose values c_s for all binary strings s of length from 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. \n\nFirst, let's parse the definitions. A beautiful multiset is a collection of binary strings of length exactly n, where for every possible prefix s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix does not exceed c_s. Our goal is to count the number of assignments of c_s values such that the maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f.\n\nHmm. So the problem requires us to find all possible c_s configurations where the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. \n\nLet me think about how to model this. For each possible configuration of c_s, we need to determine what is the maximum size of a beautiful multiset. Then, we need to count those configurations where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this maximum? Let's think about the constraints. For a multiset to be beautiful, for every prefix s, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s. \n\nNow, the maximum size of such a multiset would be determined by some constraints on the c_s values. For example, if we think of the problem as building a trie of all possible prefixes and ensuring that each node's count (the number of strings passing through it) doesn't exceed its c_s value. But how?\n\nWait, here's an idea: The maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the minimum of certain values along the paths. For example, for each string in the multiset of length n, it contributes to all of its prefixes. So, the total number of strings in the multiset can't exceed the minimum of the c_s values for all prefixes of each string. But how do we maximize this total?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size is determined by the sum over all possible nodes (prefixes) of their capacities, but adjusted for overlaps. Wait, maybe not. Let's think differently.\n\nSuppose that for each node (prefix) s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. However, for a string of length n, all its prefixes (from length 1 to n) are involved. Therefore, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is constrained by the c_s values of all prefixes of all strings in the multiset. \n\nSo, the problem is similar to finding the maximum number of strings that can be placed in the multiset such that for every s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. And we want to find the maximum possible such number given the c_s values. Then, our task is to count the number of c_s configurations where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how to compute this maximum for given c_s values? \n\nLet me think of the problem as a flow or a constraint satisfaction problem. Each string in the multiset contributes 1 to all of its prefixes. So, the constraints are that for each s, the sum of all strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. \n\nThe maximum number of strings in the multiset is then equivalent to the maximum flow in a certain network, but perhaps there's a simpler way. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is equal to the minimum over all s of (c_s multiplied by the number of strings that have s as a prefix divided by something... No, that doesn't seem right.\n\nWait, here's another approach. For each string of length n, it has exactly n prefixes (each of length 1 to n). Let's imagine that for each node (prefix) s, the capacity is c_s. The problem of selecting as many strings as possible such that for each s, the number of selected strings that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled using the inclusion-exclusion principle, but perhaps there's a way to compute the maximum number of strings by considering the constraints on the prefixes. \n\nFor example, consider that for any two prefixes s and t where s is a prefix of t, the capacity c_s must be ≥ the capacity c_t. Because, suppose you have a string that has t as a prefix. Then, since t is longer than s, that string also has s as a prefix. Therefore, the number of strings with t as a prefix can't exceed c_t, but that number is also part of the count for s. Therefore, the capacity of s must be ≥ the capacity of t. Otherwise, if c_s < c_t, then even if all strings that have t as a prefix are allowed, the count for s would be higher than c_s. \n\nWait, no. Suppose s is a prefix of t. Then, any string that has t as a prefix also has s as a prefix. So, for the counts, the number of strings with t as a prefix is ≤ the number of strings with s as a prefix. Therefore, for the constraints to be compatible, it must be that c_s ≥ the number of strings with s as a prefix. But since the number of strings with s as a prefix is the sum over all extensions of s to longer prefixes. \n\nBut perhaps the maximum possible number of strings in the multiset is determined by the minimum of c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}, but I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For the root (the empty string?), but in our case, the prefixes start from length 1. Wait, the problem says that for all strings s of length from 1 to n. So, the root isn't considered here. \n\nBut here's an important observation: For the maximum possible size of the multiset, the constraints form a hierarchy. For example, if you have a prefix s of length l, then any string that has a longer prefix (like s followed by some bits) will contribute to the count of s. Therefore, the maximum number of strings that can be placed in the multiset is determined by the minimal values of c_s for all prefixes along the paths. \n\nThis reminds me of the problem where you have to assign capacities to nodes in a trie, and the maximum number of strings that can be placed is determined by the minimum capacity along each path. \n\nWait! For example, consider that each string in the multiset is a path from the root (but here, the root isn't considered) down to a leaf (length n). Each node (prefix) along the path must have its capacity c_s ≥ the number of times it is used. But since each string uses all the prefixes along its path, the maximum number of strings is the minimum over all nodes (prefixes) of c_s multiplied by something? Or perhaps the maximum number of strings is determined by the minimum of c_s for all nodes on each path, and then taking the sum over all paths? No, that seems unclear. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem of choosing for each node (prefix) s a value c_s, and then the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by the number of possible extensions of s to full strings of length n). But that seems incorrect. \n\nWait, for example, take the first sample input where n=1. All possible strings are of length 1, which are \"0\" and \"1\". For each of these, their c_s can be chosen between 0 and k (which is 42 in the sample). The maximum beautiful multiset size is the maximum number of strings we can select (each of length 1) such that for each string s (which is either \"0\" or \"1\"), the number of selected strings that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. Since each string is of length 1, their only prefix is themselves. So, the number of selected strings is the sum of counts for each string, but each count must be ≤ their respective c_s. So the maximum size is c_0 + c_1, but since the multiset is of strings of length 1, the maximum is min(c_0, c_1) * 1? No, wait. For example, if c_0 is 2 and c_1 is 0, then the maximum size is 0+0=0? No, because the multiset can contain 0 strings. Wait, but the maximum possible is the sum of the c_s for each string, but since each string is a prefix of itself. Wait, no. Because each string in the multiset contributes exactly 1 to its own prefix count. So, for the maximum size, you can take up to c_0 strings of \"0\" and up to c_1 strings of \"1\". So the maximum possible is c_0 + c_1. But in the first sample, the answer is 3. The input was n=1, k=42, f=2. The output is 3. Let's see. The possible ways to choose c_0 and c_1 such that the maximum size (c_0 + c_1) is exactly 2. \n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\nc_0 + c_1 = 2, with each c_0 and c_1 between 0 and k (which is 42). But also, the maximum possible size is exactly 2. But in this case, since the maximum is c_0 + c_1, we need that c_0 + c_1 = 2. But the sample says that the answer is 3. How?\n\nWait, looking at the note: the three ways are:\n\nc_0=0, c_1=2 → max size is 0+2=2.\n\nc_0=1, c_1=1 → sum is 2.\n\nc_0=2, c_1=0 → sum is 2.\n\nSo, there are 3 possibilities. Which matches the sample output. So in this case, the maximum size is simply the sum of the c_s values for all length-1 strings. But why? Because each string in the multiset is of length 1, so each contributes exactly 1 to its own prefix count. So the maximum number of strings is the sum of c_s for all length-1 strings. \n\nBut for larger n, this approach may not hold. For example, when n=2. Let's say we have a string of length 2, say \"00\". It contributes to the count of the prefixes \"0\" (length 1) and \"00\" (length 2). So, the number of strings in the multiset can't exceed c_\"0\" and c_\"00\". But since each string contributes to multiple prefixes, the maximum number of strings is constrained by the minimum of all the c_s along their paths. \n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of paths in a trie where each node has a capacity, and each path from root to leaf uses the nodes along the path, and each node can be used up to its capacity. \n\nIn such a scenario, the maximum number of paths is determined by the minimum capacity along each path. But how to compute this maximum? \n\nAn approach is to model this as a flow problem, but perhaps there's a way to compute it greedily. \n\nWait, here's a key insight: For the maximum number of strings in the multiset, the constraints are that for any two prefixes where one is a prefix of the other, the capacity of the longer prefix must be less than or equal to the capacity of the shorter one. Otherwise, the capacity of the longer prefix would allow more strings than the shorter one, which is impossible. \n\nWait, no. Suppose s is a prefix of t. Then, the number of strings in the multiset that have t as a prefix is ≤ c_t. But since each such string also has s as a prefix, the number of strings with s as a prefix is at least the number of strings with t as a prefix. Therefore, to satisfy the constraints, we must have c_s ≥ the number of strings with s as a prefix. But since the number of strings with s as a prefix includes all the strings that have longer prefixes (like t), the capacity of s must be at least the capacity of t. Otherwise, if c_s < c_t, then even if you have c_t strings that have t as a prefix, they would contribute c_t to the count of s, which exceeds c_s. \n\nTherefore, for the constraints to be feasible (i.e., there exists a multiset of size m), it must be that for any s and t where s is a prefix of t, c_s ≥ c_t. \n\nWait, this is a crucial point. Because, for example, if s is a prefix of t, then the number of strings in the multiset that have t as a prefix can't exceed c_t. But since all those strings also have s as a prefix, the count for s must be at least that number. Therefore, to ensure that the count for s is not exceeded, we must have that c_s ≥ the count for s. But the count for s is the sum of the counts of all its children. Therefore, for the maximum possible size, the constraints require that for all prefixes s, c_s is at least the sum of the capacities of its children. Wait, perhaps not. Maybe this is a condition that must be satisfied for the c_s values to be valid. \n\nBut in our problem, the c_s values are chosen arbitrarily (as long as they are between 0 and k). However, if for some s and t (s is a prefix of t) we have c_s < c_t, then the constraints are incompatible. Because any string that has t as a prefix would contribute to s's count. Therefore, the number of such strings can't exceed c_t, but that would make s's count exceed c_s if c_s < c_t. Therefore, in order for there to exist a beautiful multiset of size m, the c_s values must satisfy that for any s and t where s is a prefix of t, c_s ≥ c_t. \n\nWait, but that's not necessarily true. Suppose that c_s is greater than or equal to c_t. Then, for example, you could have a multiset where the number of strings with t as a prefix is c_t, and the number of strings with s as a prefix is c_s. But how can that happen? Because the number of strings with s as a prefix is the sum of the counts for all of its children. So, for example, if s has two children, t1 and t2, then the count for s is count(t1) + count(t2). Therefore, if c_s is at least the sum of the counts of its children, then the constraints are satisfied. \n\nSo, for the maximum possible size of the multiset, the c_s values must satisfy that for all s, c_s ≥ the sum of the capacities of its children. Wait, but that seems like a necessary condition for the existence of a multiset that uses all the capacities. \n\nBut how does this relate to the maximum possible size? \n\nAh, here's the key idea: The maximum possible size of the multiset is equal to the sum of the capacities of all leaves (strings of length n) minus the sum of the capacities of their parents, but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a tree. Each node represents a binary string (prefix). The root is the empty string (but not considered here). The children of a node s are s followed by 0 and s followed by 1. The leaves are the nodes of depth n. \n\nFor the maximum possible size of the multiset, the constraints are that for each node s, the number of strings that pass through s is at most c_s. But since each string passes through exactly one path from root to leaf (assuming that the root is considered), the maximum number of strings is determined by the minimum capacity along each path. \n\nBut how? \n\nWait, suppose that for each node s, we define the capacity as c_s. Then, the maximum number of strings that can be placed in the multiset is the minimum of all c_s along each path from the root to a leaf. However, since the root isn't considered here, perhaps the actual constraints are different. \n\nBut for the problem, the root isn't considered. However, the constraints for the prefixes are that for any node s, the number of strings that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. \n\nTo maximize the number of strings, we need to choose the counts such that for every node s, the number of strings that have s as a prefix is exactly min(c_s, ... something). \n\nBut this feels too vague. Let me think again about the example. For n=2, and the c values for all prefixes. Suppose we have c_0 = 3, c_00=1, c_01=2, c_1=1, c_10=2, c_11=3. Then, the maximum size of the multiset is 3 (as per the example). How is that computed?\n\nIn the example, the multiset {11, 01, 00, 01} has size 4. But according to the example explanation, the maximum is 3? Wait, no. Wait the example says that the multiset {11, 01, 00, 01} is beautiful. But in that case, for the string \"0\", the number of strings with \"0\" as a prefix is 3 (the strings 00, 01, 01). Which is <= c_0=3. For \"00\", there is 1 string (00). For \"01\", there are 2 strings (01 and 01). For \"1\", there is 1 string (11). For \"10\", zero. For \"11\", 1. So the maximum size of the multiset is 4. But according to the example, that's allowed. \n\nBut how is the maximum possible size determined for given c_s values? \n\nIt seems that the maximum size is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}). Wait, but that might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as follows: For each node s, the number of strings that can pass through it is limited by c_s. However, each string that passes through s must also pass through its parent, grandparent, etc. So, the maximum number of strings that can be placed in the multiset is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by the number of possible extensions of s to full strings of length n). \n\nWait, for example, consider a node s of length l. The number of possible extensions to full strings is 2^{n - l}. So, if we have c_s, then the maximum number of strings that can be placed in the multiset that pass through s is c_s * 2^{n - l}? No, that doesn't make sense. Because each string that passes through s contributes to the count of s. So, if you have c_s, then the number of strings that pass through s can't exceed c_s. But each such string can be extended in multiple ways. \n\nAlternatively, think recursively. For the root (if it existed), the maximum number of strings would be the minimum of the capacities of the nodes along the paths. \n\nBut perhaps the maximum number of strings in the multiset is equal to the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree rooted at s). \n\nWait, for example, for a node s of length l, the number of leaves in its subtree is 2^{n - l}. So, the maximum number of strings that can be placed in the multiset that pass through s is c_s multiplied by the number of leaves in the subtree. But that's not right. Because each string in the multiset can only be counted once. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum of all (c_s) for all nodes s, multiplied by 2^{n - len(s)}? No, that doesn't fit the sample. \n\nLet me think of the first sample. n=1, so for each node (of length 1), the number of leaves in its subtree is 1. So the maximum number of strings is min(c_0, c_1) * 1? No, in the first sample, the maximum is c_0 + c_1. \n\nThis suggests that my previous line of thinking is incorrect. \n\nLet me try to find another approach. \n\nLet’s think of the problem as follows: For a given set of c_s values, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by the minimal value of (c_s) for all prefixes along each path. \n\nWait, for example, if we have a path of prefixes s_1 (length 1), s_2 (length 2), ..., s_n (length n). For each string in the multiset, it corresponds to a path from the root (length 0) to a leaf (length n). However, since the root isn't considered in our problem, the prefixes start from length 1. \n\nBut the maximum number of strings is the minimum over all nodes s of (c_s) multiplied by the number of possible ways to extend s to a full string, but that seems unclear. \n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a tree where each node has two children. The root is the empty string, but we don't consider it. Each node represents a prefix of length l. The leaves are the prefixes of length n. \n\nThe maximum number of strings in the multiset is the sum over all leaves of the number of times they are chosen, but subject to the constraints that for each node s, the number of leaves in its subtree that are chosen is ≤ c_s. \n\nThis is equivalent to finding the maximum number of leaves that can be selected such that for every node s, the number of selected leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s. \n\nThis is known as the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves that can be selected under subtree constraints. \n\nHow is this solved? \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be solved with dynamic programming on the tree. For each node, the maximum number of leaves we can select in its subtree is the minimum between the capacity of the node and the sum of the maximum leaves from its children. \n\nWait, here's an idea: For a node s, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves that can be selected in its children's subtrees. \n\nBecause, for the node s, the number of leaves in its subtree is the sum of the leaves in the subtrees of its children. However, the capacity c_s limits the number of leaves in the subtree of s. Thus, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected under s's subtree is min(c_s, sum of the max leaves from children).\n\nBut this seems recursive. \n\nLet me think of this with an example. Suppose we have a node s with two children, left and right. The maximum number of leaves that can be selected under s's subtree is min(c_s, left_max + right_max). \n\nIf we apply this recursively, starting from the leaves (which have no children, so their max is min(c_leaf, 1) ?), then for each node, the maximum number of leaves is the min between its capacity and the sum of the maximum leaves of its children. \n\nBut for the leaves (nodes of length n), their children are none. So for a leaf node, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_leaf, 1). Because the subtree of a leaf node is just itself. So, we can select at most 1 leaf (the node itself) if c_leaf ≥ 1. \n\nWait, but the capacity for a leaf node is c_s. The number of leaves in its subtree is 1. So the maximum number of leaves that can be selected is min(c_s, 1). \n\nThen, for a node of length l < n, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, left_max + right_max), where left and right are its children. \n\nThis seems promising. Because this way, the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be selected is computed recursively, based on the capacities of the nodes. \n\nLet me test this idea with the first sample. \n\nSample 1: n=1. So each node is a leaf. For each node (say, \"0\" and \"1\"), their max is min(c_s, 1). The total maximum is the sum of these for all leaves? No, because the max for the root (which is not considered) would be the sum of the children's max. \n\nWait, but for n=1, the nodes are leaves. So their maximum number of leaves in their subtree is min(c_s, 1). The total number of leaves in the entire tree is the sum of the max values of the root's children. But the root isn't considered in our problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of strings in the multiset is equal to the value computed for the root node. But since the root isn't considered, how do we model it? \n\nAlternatively, for the entire tree (with root being the empty string), the maximum number of leaves that can be selected is the value computed for the root. However, in our problem, the root is not considered, but all prefixes from length 1 to n are. \n\nSo, in this case, the root's capacity is not considered. However, the capacities of the nodes are given for all prefixes from length 1 to n. \n\nBut the root's capacity would be something. However, since the root is not considered in the problem, but its children are. \n\nWait, perhaps the root's capacity is not constrained. So, for our problem, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected is the value computed for the root, assuming that the root's capacity is infinity. Because the root's capacity is not given, but for the constraints, the root's capacity would need to be ≥ the sum of the capacities of its children. \n\nBut since the root's capacity isn't part of the problem, perhaps the maximum number of leaves is computed by assuming that the root's capacity is infinite, and then applying the recursive formula. \n\nLet me try this with the first sample. \n\nSample 1: n=1. The root has two children, \"0\" and \"1\". The root's capacity is assumed to be infinity. The max for the root would be min(inf, max_0 + max_1). Where max_0 is min(c_0, 1), and max_1 is min(c_1, 1). \n\nThus, the maximum number of leaves is max_0 + max_1. Which is exactly what we saw in the first sample. \n\nAnother example: for the sample in the problem description. \n\nLet me take the example given in the problem statement. The example says that the multiset {11, 01, 00, 01} is beautiful. But according to the calculation using the recursive formula, what would be the maximum number of leaves? \n\nIn this case, n=2. The root has children \"0\" and \"1\". \n\nFor the node \"0\" (length 1), its children are \"00\" and \"01\". The capacities are c_0=3, c_00=1, c_01=2. \n\nFor node \"00\" (leaf), max_00 = min(1, 1) = 1. For node \"01\" (leaf), max_01 = min(2, 1) = 1. So the max for node \"0\" is min(3, 1 + 1) = 2. \n\nSimilarly, node \"1\" has children \"10\" (c=2) and \"11\" (c=3). For node \"10\", max is min(2, 1) = 1. For node \"11\", min(3, 1) = 1. So the max for node \"1\" is min(1, 1 + 1) = 1. \n\nThen, the root's max is min(inf, 2 + 1) = 3. So the maximum number of leaves is 3. However, the example's multiset has size 4. Wait, this contradicts. What's wrong here? \n\nAh, this suggests that my approach is incorrect. Because according to this calculation, the maximum number of leaves is 3, but the example has a multiset of size 4. \n\nWait, but the example says that the multiset {11, 01, 00, 01} is beautiful. Let's compute the constraints. \n\nFor each prefix:\n\n- \"0\": there are 3 strings (00, 01, 01) → count is 3 ≤ c_0=3 → okay.\n- \"00\": count is 1 ≤ c_00=1 → okay.\n- \"01\": count is 2 ≤ c_01=2 → okay.\n- \"1\": count is 1 (only 11) ≤ c_1=1 → okay.\n- \"10\": count is 0 ≤ c_10=2 → okay.\n- \"11\": count is 1 ≤ c_11=3 → okay.\n\nSo the multiset has size 4. But according to the recursive formula, the maximum should be 3. This indicates that my approach is wrong. \n\nWhat's the error in my reasoning?\n\nAh! Because the formula computes the maximum number of leaves that can be selected such that for every node s, the number of selected leaves in the subtree of s is ≤ c_s. But in this case, the formula gives 3, but the example has 4. \n\nSo clearly, my approach is incorrect. \n\nLet me re-calculate the example. \n\nThe root's max is min(inf, max_0 + max_1). \n\nmax_0 is min(c_0, max_00 + max_01). \n\nBut what are max_00 and max_01? They are the maximum number of leaves in their subtree. Since they are leaves, their max is min(c_s, 1). \n\nFor node 00: c_00 is 1 → min(1, 1) = 1. \n\nFor node 01: c_01 is 2 → min(2, 1) = 1. \n\nSo, max_0 is min(3, 1 + 1) = 2. \n\nFor node 1: its children are 10 and 11. \n\nmax_10 is min(2, 1) = 1. \n\nmax_11 is min(3, 1) = 1. \n\nSo, max_1 is min(1, 1 + 1) = 1. \n\nRoot's max is 2 + 1 = 3. \n\nBut the example has a multiset of size 4. How is that possible? \n\nAh! Because the formula is incorrect. \n\nWait, in the example, the multiset contains 4 strings. Let's count how many leaves are selected. The leaves are \"00\", \"01\", \"11\". \n\nWait, the multiset is {11, 01, 00, 01}. So the leaves are:\n\n- 00 → 1 occurrence.\n\n- 01 → 2 occurrences.\n\n- 11 → 1 occurrence.\n\nTotal of 4 leaves. But according to the formula, the maximum is 3. So why is this allowed? \n\nBecause the formula assumes that each leaf can be selected at most once. But in reality, the multiset allows multiple instances of the same string. So the formula is wrong. \n\nOh! Oh right! The problem allows multiple instances of the same string in the multiset. So, the previous approach is incorrect because it assumes that each leaf can be selected once, but in reality, the multiset can have multiple copies of the same string. \n\nSo this changes everything. \n\nSo, the problem is not about selecting distinct leaves, but about selecting any number of strings (possibly multiple copies) of length n, such that for each prefix s, the number of selected strings that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. \n\nThis makes the problem much more complex. \n\nSo, the constraints are that for each prefix s, the number of selected strings that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. \n\nLet me think of this as a flow problem. For example, each string in the multiset contributes 1 to all its prefixes. The question is to find the maximum number of strings that can be selected under these constraints. \n\nThis seems like a problem that can be modeled as a flow network, but since n is up to 15, the number of nodes is 2^15 - 1 (since prefixes of lengths 1 to n), which is manageable? Well, 2^15 is 32768, so 32767 nodes. But for each node, we have to model constraints. \n\nAlternatively, think of it as a problem of finding the maximum number of strings that can be placed, given that for each node s, the number of strings passing through s is ≤ c_s. \n\nThis looks like a problem of finding the maximum flow with constraints on the nodes. \n\nBut how can we model this? \n\nWe can model this as a flow network where each node has a capacity. For each node s, the number of strings passing through it cannot exceed c_s. \n\nThis is similar to the problem of edge capacities, but here it's node capacities. \n\nA standard approach to handle node capacities is to split each node into two: an incoming and outgoing part, connected by an edge with capacity equal to the node's capacity. \n\nBut in this case, the node's capacity is the number of strings that can pass through it. \n\nSo, for each node s, we split it into two parts: s_in and s_out. All incoming edges go to s_in, and all outgoing edges come from s_out. Between them, we add an edge with capacity c_s. \n\nBut what's the structure of the graph? \n\nEach string is a path from the root to a leaf. However, since the root isn't considered, we have to model the prefixes as a tree. \n\nEach node s has two children: s0 and s1. \n\nSo, the flow network would be structured as follows:\n\n- The source is connected to the root node (but not considered in our problem). However, since we're dealing with prefixes of length 1 to n, perhaps the source is connected to the nodes of length 1. \n\nAlternatively, think of the source as being connected to the root, and each node's out part connects to its children's in parts. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, since each string of length n contributes to all its prefixes, the problem can be viewed as finding the maximum number of paths from the root to the leaves, where each node can be passed through at most c_s times. \n\nBut since the root is not considered, but the nodes of length 1 are, perhaps we can model the flow as follows:\n\n- Create a source node and a sink node. \n\n- For each node s (prefix), create two nodes: in and out. \n\n- For the source, connect it to the in nodes of all length-1 prefixes. The capacity of these edges is unlimited (or set to a very large number, since the root is not considered, and the constraints are on the prefixes). \n\n- For each node s, connect its out node to the in nodes of its children (s0 and s1). The capacity of these edges is unlimited. \n\n- For each node s, connect its in node to its out node with an edge of capacity c_s. \n\n- Connect the out nodes of all leaves (nodes of length n) to the sink node, with unlimited capacity. \n\nThen, the maximum flow from source to sink would be the maximum number of strings in the multiset. \n\nBut this seems plausible. \n\nLet me test this with the sample example. \n\nSample example: n=2, c_0=3, c_00=1, c_01=2, c_1=1, c_10=2, c_11=3. \n\nThe nodes are:\n\nLength 1: 0, 1.\n\nLength 2: 00, 01, 10, 11. \n\nThe source is connected to in_0 and in_1 with unlimited capacity. \n\nFor each node:\n\n- in_0 connected to out_0 with capacity 3.\n\n- in_1 connected to out_1 with capacity 1.\n\n- in_00 connected to out_00 with capacity 1.\n\n- in_01 connected to out_01 with capacity 2.\n\n- in_10 connected to out_10 with capacity 2.\n\n- in_11 connected to out_11 with capacity 3.\n\nThen, out_0 is connected to in_00 and in_01 (capacity unlimited).\n\nout_1 is connected to in_10 and in_11.\n\nThe leaves (00, 01, 10, 11) have their out nodes connected to the sink. \n\nThe maximum flow would be the maximum number of paths from source to sink. \n\nIn this case, what is the maximum flow?\n\nLet's think: each path starts at the source, goes to in_0 or in_1, then to out_0 or out_1, then to the children's in nodes, then to their out nodes, and finally to the sink. \n\nThe capacity constraints are:\n\nFor node 0: 3.\n\nFor node 1: 1.\n\nFor node 00: 1.\n\nFor node 01: 2.\n\nFor node 10: 2.\n\nFor node 11: 3.\n\nThe maximum flow would be determined by the capacities. \n\nFor example, the path 0 → 00 →",
