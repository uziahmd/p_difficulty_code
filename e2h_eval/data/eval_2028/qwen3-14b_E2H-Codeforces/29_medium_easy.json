Eugene sends Andrew multiple queries of type \"di → ti\", that means \"replace all digits di in string s with substrings equal to ti\". For example, if s = 123123, then query \"2 → 00\" transforms s to 10031003, and query \"3 → \" (\"replace 3 by an empty string\") transforms it to s = 1212. After all the queries Eugene asks Andrew to find the remainder after division of number with decimal representation equal to s by 1000000007 (109 + 7). When you represent s as a decimal number, please ignore the leading zeroes; also if s is an empty string, then it's assumed that the number equals to zero.Andrew got tired of processing Eugene's requests manually and he asked you to write a program for that. Help him!\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105), consisting of digits — the string before processing all the requests.The second line contains a single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of queries.The next n lines contain the descriptions of the queries. The i-th query is described by string \"di->ti\", where di is exactly one digit (from 0 to 9), ti is a string consisting of digits (ti can be an empty string). The sum of lengths of ti for all queries doesn't exceed 105. The queries are written in the order in which they need to be performed.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — remainder of division of the resulting number by 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['123123\\n1\\n2->00', '123123\\n1\\n3->', '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7', '1000000008\\n0']\n\n### Output\n['10031003', '1212', '777', '1']\n\n## Note\nNote that the leading zeroes are not removed from string s after the replacement (you can see it in the third sample).\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where we have a string of digits and perform multiple substitution queries. Then compute the number modulo 1e9+7. Hmm.\n\nThe challenge is handling the substitutions efficiently, especially since the string can be up to 1e5 characters and there are up to 1e5 queries. If I naively process each query by replacing all occurrences of di in the string, that could be O(n * len(s)) which might be too slow for large cases. Because for each query, if the string is big, replacing each occurrence would take time. So for example, if there are 1e5 queries and each replacement takes O(1e5) time, that's 1e10 operations which is way too slow.\n\nSo I need a smarter approach. Let me think about how substitutions work. Each substitution replaces a digit with another string. But the order of substitutions matters. For example, if I first replace 2 with 00, then replace 0 with 7, then the original 2s would become 00, then each 0 becomes 7, so the original 2 becomes 77. But if the order were reversed, replacing 0 first, then 2 would be replaced with 00, but then 0s would be replaced again. So the order of processing queries is important.\n\nBut how can I model this? Maybe using some kind of mapping that keeps track of what each digit expands to. However, if a substitution is done for a digit, say, 2, then any subsequent substitution for digits that were in the expansion of 2 would affect it. Wait, but if I process the queries in order, maybe I can track for each digit, what its current expansion is. But when a substitution is applied, say, replacing d with t, then all future expansions of d will be t. But if t contains digits that have their own expansions, then when expanding d, those would be expanded as well. So perhaps I need to represent each digit's expansion as a function that can be evaluated recursively, but with memoization or something.\n\nWait, but for the problem, the substitutions are processed in order. So for example, if I have a query that replaces '2' with '00', and then later a query replaces '0' with '7', then when expanding '2', it would expand to '00', which then expand to '77'. So the expansion of '2' after both queries is '77'.\n\nSo, the idea is that for each digit, we can track what it expands to. However, when expanding, we need to recursively expand any digits in the expansion string. But if we do this naively, for each substitution, we might end up with a lot of recomputing.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this with a memoization approach. Let me think. For each digit, we can keep track of its expansion. When a substitution is made, say, replacing d with t, then we set the expansion of d to t. But when we need to expand a digit, we need to expand all the digits in the expansion string. However, if during substitution, the expansion of a digit is modified, then any previous expansions that included that digit would need to be updated. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since substitutions are processed in order, perhaps we can model each digit's expansion as a string, and when expanding, we recursively expand each character in the expansion string. However, this could lead to exponential time if not handled properly.\n\nWait, but the problem requires us to compute the final string after all substitutions, and then compute the number mod 1e9+7. However, directly building the final string may not be feasible because the substitutions can cause the length to explode. For example, if you substitute each digit with a longer string multiple times, the length could be enormous. For example, if you start with a single digit and substitute it with a string of length 1000, then substitute that with another string of length 1000, etc., the length becomes 1000^k, which is impossible to store directly for large k.\n\nSo, building the actual string is not feasible. Therefore, we need a way to compute the value mod 1e9+7 without building the entire string.\n\nAh, right! The key here is to compute the value mod MOD (1e9+7) as we process the substitutions. How can we do that?\n\nLet me think. Each substitution replaces a digit d with a string t. So, for each occurrence of d in the current string, we replace it with t. But instead of tracking the actual string, we can track the value of the entire string mod MOD. However, when we perform substitutions, we need to know how replacing a digit with a string affects the overall value.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's consider that each substitution operation is applied to the current state of the string. However, since the substitutions can be applied multiple times, and the order matters, we need to find a way to represent the current value of the string, and for each substitution, update it accordingly.\n\nBut that seems challenging. Let's think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming. Suppose that for each digit, we track what its contribution is to the overall value. However, when a substitution occurs, we need to update the contributions of all digits that are being replaced.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire string as a sequence of digits, each of which can be expanded into some other string. So, for example, if the original string is \"123\", and we have substitutions:\n\n- 1 → \"a\"\n- 2 → \"b\"\n- 3 → \"c\"\n\nThen the final string is \"abc\". But each of these letters (a, b, c) themselves might be substituted later.\n\nBut how to model the value of the entire string. Let's think of the value as a sum of each digit multiplied by 10^power, depending on their position. However, when substitutions happen, they change the positions of digits. For example, replacing a single digit with a longer string would insert more digits into the string, changing the positions of all digits that come after.\n\nThis seems really complex. So perhaps we need to model the value of the string as a number mod MOD, and find a way to compute the effect of each substitution on this value.\n\nLet me think again. Suppose we have a current value V. Then, when we perform a substitution that replaces all occurrences of digit d with string t. How does this affect V?\n\nBut the problem is that the substitution replaces each occurrence of d in the string with t. So, the original string is a sequence of digits. Each occurrence of d is replaced by t. However, the order in which substitutions are processed matters. For example, if the original string is \"d\", and we first replace d with \"t1\", then replace t1's digits with something else.\n\nBut how to compute the value of the string after substitution. Let's think recursively. Suppose that for each digit in the original string, we can compute its contribution to the final value. However, if that digit is replaced by a string, then each character in that string contributes to the value, but their positions depend on their placement in the string.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think of the value as a number. When we replace a digit d with a string t, each occurrence of d in the original string is replaced by the digits in t. However, inserting t into the string will affect the positions of the digits that come after. For example, if the original string is \"dX\" and we replace d with \"ab\", the new string is \"abX\", and the X is shifted right by two digits. So the value of X is multiplied by 10^len(ab).\n\nBut this suggests that when we replace a digit d with t, the contribution of each occurrence of d in the original string is replaced by the value of t, but multiplied by 10^k, where k is the number of digits that come after it in the original string. Wait, but how can we track that?\n\nThis seems complicated. However, perhaps we can model the problem using a trie-like structure, where each digit's expansion is represented in terms of its value and the length of the expansion. For example, for each digit d, we can track two things: the value of the expansion (mod MOD), and the length of the expansion (number of digits). Then, when we replace a digit d with a string t, we can compute for d's new value and length.\n\nBut how does this help? Let's think. Suppose that for each digit, we have a mapping from digit to (value, length), where value is the value of the expansion of the digit mod MOD, and length is the length of the expansion. Then, when processing the original string, each character in the original string is expanded into its current value and length, and the overall value can be computed by considering the concatenation of these expansions.\n\nBut how to compute the overall value when concatenating two parts. For example, suppose we have a part A with value v_A and length l_A, and a part B with value v_B and length l_B. When we concatenate A and B, the total value is (v_A * 10^{l_B} + v_B) mod MOD.\n\nSo, if we can compute for each digit, the value and length of its expansion, then we can process the original string as a sequence of digits, each of which is expanded into their (value, length), and compute the overall value by combining them step by step.\n\nThis seems promising. Let's formalize this.\n\nWe can maintain for each digit (0-9) a pair (val, len), where val is the value of the expansion of that digit, and len is the length of the expansion. Initially, each digit d has val = d (as a number mod MOD), and len = 1.\n\nWhen a substitution query comes in: \"d -> t\", we need to update the mapping for d. The new val for d is the value of the string t, and the new len for d is the length of t. But wait, the string t may contain digits that have their own expansions. So, to compute the val and len of t, we need to process each character in t, expanding them according to the current mappings.\n\nFor example, suppose the query is to replace d with t. To compute the new val and len for d, we need to calculate the value of t, where each character in t is expanded according to their current mappings. So, for each character in t, we look up its current (val, len), and compute the combined value and length of the entire t string.\n\nSo, for example, if t is \"abc\", then the value of t is (a_val * 10^{len_b + len_c} + b_val * 10^{len_c} + c_val) mod MOD. And the length is len_a + len_b + len_c. But how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nWait, but for the string t, when processing each character, we can compute the cumulative value and length as follows. Starting with value 0 and length 0. For each character c in t:\n\nnew_value = (current_value * 10^{len_c} + val_c) mod MOD\n\nnew_length = current_length + len_c\n\nSo, for example, for the first character, current_value is 0, current_length is 0. Then, new_value = 0 * 10^len_c + val_c = val_c, and new_length is len_c.\n\nFor the next character, we multiply the current_value by 10^len_c (the length of the new character's expansion) and add the value of the new character's expansion. Then add the lengths.\n\nYes. So, for the entire t string, we can compute the value and length by processing each character in order and applying this formula.\n\nSo, the idea is:\n\n- Maintain for each digit d, a value and length. Initially, value[d] = int(d), length[d] = 1.\n\n- For each substitution query \"d -> t\", we compute the new value and length for d as follows:\n\n   - Compute the value and length of the string t, considering that each character in t is expanded according to the current value and length of their respective digits.\n\n   - Then, set value[d] to this computed value, and length[d] to this computed length.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, we need to compute the value of the original string s. To do this, we process each character in s, and for each character c, we get its (value, length), and combine them as per the concatenation rule.\n\nFor example, if the original string is s = c1 c2 c3 ... cn, then the total value is computed as follows:\n\nInitialize total_value = 0, total_length = 0.\n\nFor each character c in s:\n\n   new_value = (total_value * 10^length_c + value_c) mod MOD\n\n   new_length = total_length + length_c\n\n   total_value = new_value\n\n   total_length = new_length\n\nAt the end, the total_value is the value of the entire string mod MOD.\n\nBut how to compute 10^length_c mod MOD quickly? Since for each step, we need to compute 10^length_c, but length_c can be up to ... well, for each substitution, the length can be arbitrary. However, during the processing of the substitutions, we can precompute the powers of 10 modulo MOD, but since the maximum possible length could be up to something like 1e5 * 1e5 (but that's impossible due to memory constraints). However, during the processing of the substitution, for each character in t, we can compute the power on the fly.\n\nWait, but for the computation of the value of t, when we process each character in t, we need to compute 10^len_c mod MOD. Similarly, when processing the original string s, for each character, we need to compute 10^length_c mod MOD.\n\nBut how can we compute 10^x mod MOD quickly? Well, for any x, we can compute it with pow(10, x, MOD). But if x is up to 1e5, that's manageable. However, for each step, during the substitution processing, we might need to compute 10^len_c, where len_c is the length of the expansion of a character c. But during substitution processing, when we compute the value of t, we need to process each character in t and compute the 10^len_c for each step.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. For example, when we are processing the string t, which is a sequence of characters. For each character in t, we need to compute the value of that character's expansion (val_c) and its length (len_c). Then, when we add this character to the current processed part of t, we need to compute:\n\ncurrent_value = current_value * 10^len_c + val_c\n\nSo, for each step, we need to compute 10^len_c mod MOD. How can we compute that quickly?\n\nWell, for each len_c, we can compute pow(10, len_c, MOD) on the fly. But for len_c up to 1e5, that's acceptable. However, if len_c is very large, say 1e5, then pow(10, len_c, MOD) would take O(log len_c) time with exponentiation by squaring. But since the sum of the lengths of all ti is up to 1e5, the total time for all these computations would be acceptable.\n\nBut maybe we can precompute the powers of 10 mod MOD. However, since the maximum possible length of a substitution string could be up to 1e5, but during substitution processing, the len_c for each digit can be up to ... well, it depends on the substitutions. For example, if each substitution replaces a digit with a string of length 1, then len_c remains 1. But if substitutions are done that increase the length, then len_c can grow. However, the maximum possible len_c for any digit is unbounded unless we have a way to limit it. However, since the problem requires us to compute the value mod MOD, perhaps there's a way to track the exponents efficiently.\n\nBut for now, let's proceed with the approach. For each substitution query, when we need to compute the value of the string t, we process each character in t, and for each character, we get its (val, len). Then, we compute the value of the entire t string as follows:\n\nInitialize t_val = 0, t_len = 0.\n\nFor each character c in t:\n\n   power = pow(10, len_c, MOD)\n\n   t_val = (t_val * power + val_c) % MOD\n\n   t_len += len_c\n\nSo, for example, for the first character, t_val is val_c, and t_len is len_c.\n\nThis seems correct. Then, after processing all characters in t, we set the new value and length for the digit d being substituted.\n\nOnce all substitutions are processed, we process the original string s. For each character in s, we get its (val, len), and compute the total value as:\n\nInitialize total_val = 0, total_len = 0.\n\nFor each character c in s:\n\n   power = pow(10, len_c, MOD)\n\n   total_val = (total_val * power + val_c) % MOD\n\n   total_len += len_c\n\nBut wait, the total_len is not needed except for the purpose of computing the power. However, in the code, we don't actually need to track the total_len, because when processing the next character, the power is 10^len_c, which is the length of the current character's expansion. So the code can proceed as described.\n\nBut then, the problem is that for each substitution, when we compute the value of t, we need to compute pow(10, len_c) for each character in t. However, len_c can be up to ... well, for each substitution, the len_c is the length of the expansion of the current character. Which can be large. But since we're using Python's built-in pow with three arguments, which is efficient, even for large exponents, this should be manageable.\n\nBut wait, pow(10, len_c, MOD) can be computed quickly, even for large len_c. So, for each substitution, when processing the string t, for each character in t, we compute the pow(10, len_c, MOD) once. So this seems feasible.\n\nNow, the question is, how to implement this.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Initialize for each digit (0-9) a value and a length. Initially, value[d] = d, length[d] = 1.\n\n2. For each query:\n\n   a. Parse the query into d and t.\n\n   b. Compute the value and length of the string t, using the current value and length of each digit in t.\n\n   c. Update the value and length for digit d to be the computed value and length of t.\n\n3. After processing all queries, compute the value of the original string s by processing each character in s, using the current value and length of each digit.\n\nBut how to process the string t in step 2b?\n\nLet's think of code structure.\n\nWe can have two arrays (or dictionaries) for value and length. For example, in Python:\n\nMOD = 10**9 +7\n\nvalue = [0]*10\nlength = [0]*10\n\nfor d in range(10):\n    value[d] = d\n    length[d] = 1\n\nThen, for each query:\n\nparse the query into d and t. For example, the query is like \"2->00\".\n\nThen, for the string t, compute the value and length of t as follows:\n\ndef compute_t_value(t_str, value, length, MOD):\n    current_val = 0\n    current_len = 0\n    for c in t_str:\n        digit = int(c)\n        # get the current value and length for this digit\n        v = value[digit]\n        l = length[digit]\n        power = pow(10, l, MOD)\n        current_val = (current_val * power + v) % MOD\n        current_len += l\n    return current_val, current_len\n\nThen, after getting current_val and current_len, we set value[d] = current_val and length[d] = current_len.\n\nBut wait, in the case where t is empty string? For example, if the query is \"3->\", then t_str is empty. In that case, the value of t is 0, and the length is 0. Because replacing 3 with empty string. So for the compute_t_value function, when t_str is empty, returns (0, 0).\n\nYes. So that function handles that.\n\nOnce all queries are processed, then process the original string s:\n\ndef compute_s_value(s_str, value, length, MOD):\n    total_val = 0\n    for c in s_str:\n        digit = int(c)\n        v = value[digit]\n        l = length[digit]\n        power = pow(10, l, MOD)\n        total_val = (total_val * power + v) % MOD\n    return total_val\n\nWait, but in this code, for the original string s, each character is processed in order, and for each, we compute the power based on the length of the expansion of that character. Then, multiply the current total_val by that power and add the value of the expansion.\n\nYes. That should give the correct total value.\n\nLet me test this logic with the examples.\n\nFirst example:\n\nSample Input:\n\nOriginal string: 123123\n\nn=1\n\nquery: 2->00.\n\nAfter substitution, the string becomes 10031003.\n\nLet's compute the value via our code.\n\nInitially, value and length for digits:\n\nvalue[1] = 1, length[1] = 1\n\nvalue[2] = 2, length[2] = 1\n\nvalue[3] = 3, length[3] = 1\n\nProcessing the query: replace 2 with \"00\".\n\nCompute the value of \"00\".\n\nFor each character in \"00\":\n\nFirst character is 0:\n\nv = 0, l = 1. current_val starts at 0. power is 10^1 = 10. current_val = 0*10 + 0 = 0. current_len is 1.\n\nSecond character is 0: same as before. power is 10^1 = 10. current_val = 0 * 10 + 0 = 0. current_len is 2.\n\nSo the new value for digit 2 is 0, length is 2.\n\nNow, processing the original string s = \"123123\".\n\nEach character is processed as follows:\n\nFirst character is 1: value is 1, length 1. power is 10^1 = 10. total_val = 0 * 10 + 1 = 1.\n\nSecond character is 2: value is 0, length 2. power is 10^2 = 100. total_val = 1 * 100 + 0 = 100.\n\nThird character is 3: value is 3, length 1. power is 10^1 = 10. total_val = 100 * 10 + 3 = 1003.\n\nFourth character is 1: same as first. power 10^1=10. total_val = 1003 * 10 + 1 = 10031.\n\nFifth character is 2: same as before. 10031 * 100 + 0 = 1003100.\n\nSixth character is 3: same as before. 1003100 * 10 + 3 = 10031003.\n\nWhich is 10031003 mod MOD. Which is 10031003. Which matches the sample output. So yes, the code works for this case.\n\nAnother sample input: third example input is '222\\n2\\n2->0\\n0->7'.\n\nOriginal string is '222'.\n\nQueries:\n\nFirst query: 2->0.\n\nSecond query: 0->7.\n\nLet's see:\n\nInitially, value[2] = 2, len 1. value[0] = 0, len 1.\n\nFirst query: replace 2 with '0'.\n\nProcessing '0':\n\ncurrent_val is 0, len 1. So new value for 2 is 0, len 1.\n\nNow, after first query, value[2] is 0, len 1.\n\nSecond query: replace 0 with '7'.\n\nProcessing '7' (the string t is '7').\n\ncurrent_val starts as 0. For the character 7, value is 7, len 1. So current_val = 0 * 10^1 + 7 = 7. len is 1. So new value for 0 is 7, len 1.\n\nNow, processing the original string '222':\n\nEach 2 is replaced with 0 (value 0, len 1). So processing each 2:\n\nFirst 2: total_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0.\n\nSecond 2: total_val = 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0.\n\nThird 2: same, total_val is 0.\n\nBut wait, according to the sample output, the result is 777. Oh, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, after the second query, which is 0->7. So after that, the value of 0 is 7, len 1. But the first query was replacing 2 with 0. So the value of 2 is 0, len 1. But when we process the original string, which is 222, each 2 is replaced with 0 (the expansion of 2 is 0). But then, that 0 is replaced with 7? Or no?\n\nAh! No. The substitution is processed in order. The first substitution is 2→0. Then, the second substitution is 0→7. So after the first substitution, the value of 2 is 0 (expansion is '0'), and the value of 0 is 0 (expansion is '0'). Then, when the second substitution is processed, which replaces 0 with '7', the value of 0 becomes 7 (expansion '7'), and len is 1.\n\nSo when processing the original string, each 2 is expanded to 0 (the expansion of 2 is 0, which is the string '0'). But when expanding the 0, it is now replaced with 7. However, in our code, the expansion of 2 is stored as a value and length. So when the substitution for 2 is done, the value of 2 is the value of the expansion of '0', which is 0 (since at that time, the expansion of 0 is 0). But after the substitution for 0 is done, the value of 0 is updated to 7, but the value of 2 remains as 0. Because the substitution for 2 was done earlier. So in the code, the value of 2 is not automatically updated when the substitution for 0 is done. So in this case, the code would compute the value of the original string as 000, which is 0. But the sample output is 777. So clearly, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, this indicates a flaw in the approach. Because the substitution for 2 is done first, which replaces 2 with 0. Then, substitution for 0 is done, which replaces 0 with 7. So, the original string is 222. After the first substitution, it becomes 000. Then, the second substitution replaces all 0s with 7s, leading to 777. But according to the code's logic, the value of 2 is 0 (which represents the expansion of '0'), but when the substitution for 0 is processed, the code updates the value of 0 to 7. However, the value of 2 is still 0, which is the value of the expansion of '0' at the time of substitution. But that expansion of '0' is now changed. So the code's approach is not capturing this.\n\nAh, here's the problem. The code's approach assumes that when a substitution is made for a digit d, the expansion of d is fixed as the value and length of the string t at that moment. However, if in future substitutions, digits in t are modified, the expansion of d is not automatically updated. So, in the example above, when we first replace 2 with '0', the value of 2 is set to the value of '0' at that time (which is 0). Then, when we replace 0 with '7', the value of 0 is updated to 7. But the value of 2 remains as 0, which is incorrect. Because the expansion of 2 is '0', which now expands to '7'.\n\nSo the approach is wrong. The code as described doesn't account for the fact that substitutions can affect the expansions of previously substituted digits.\n\nThis is a critical error. So how to handle this?\n\nThe problem is that the current approach stores for each digit d, the value and length of its expansion. However, when a substitution is made for another digit that appears in the expansion of d, the value of d's expansion is not automatically updated. So, the approach is incorrect.\n\nSo, what's the solution?\n\nThe key is that when we process a substitution query for a digit d, we need to compute the value and length of the string t, which may include digits that are themselves subject to substitutions. However, the current approach computes the value of t based on the current state of the value and length of the digits in t. Thus, if later substitutions change those digits, the previous substitutions for other digits are not affected. But that's not correct. Because when you substitute a digit d with a string that includes another digit e, and then later substitute e with something else, the expansion of d should be updated to reflect the new expansion of e.\n\nBut in the current approach, the expansion of d is fixed once the substitution is processed. Which is not correct.\n\nSo, the problem is that the approach is not dynamic. It assumes that once a substitution is processed, the expansion of d is fixed. But in reality, substitutions can be applied in any order, and the expansion of a digit may depend on the current state of other substitutions.\n\nThus, the approach needs to be revised. How can we model this correctly?\n\nAlternative idea: when processing a substitution query for digit d, we need to compute the value and length of the string t, taking into account the current expansions of all digits in t. This is correct, because when we process the substitution, the current expansions are what they are. However, if in the future, digits in t are changed, the expansion of d is not automatically updated. So, the code as described would not capture that. However, in the example above, the code gives an incorrect answer.\n\nBut why? Let's re-examine the example.\n\nOriginal example:\n\nOriginal string is 222.\n\nQueries:\n\nFirst query: 2 → 0.\n\nAt this point, the expansion of 2 is '0', which has value 0 (since the expansion of 0 is 0). So, the value of 2 is 0, length 1.\n\nSecond query: 0 → 7.\n\nNow, the expansion of 0 is '7', value 7, length 1.\n\nBut the expansion of 2 is still '0', which is now replaced by 7. However, the code's approach would not recompute the expansion of 2. Hence, when processing the original string, the code would compute 222 as 0 * 10^1 + 0 * 10^1 + 0 = 0, but the correct expansion is 777.\n\nThis indicates that the approach is incorrect. So what's wrong here?\n\nThe problem is that the substitution for 2 is processed before the substitution for 0. When we process the substitution for 2, we compute the value of '0' at that time, which is 0. But later, when 0 is replaced with '7', the expansion of 2 should now be '7', not '0'.\n\nSo, the approach of storing the value and length for each digit is insufficient because it doesn't account for changes to digits that are used in previous substitutions.\n\nThus, the initial approach is incorrect. How can we model this?\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of storing the value and length of each digit's expansion, we need to represent the expansion in a way that allows for dynamic updates. However, this seems challenging.\n\nAnother Idea: For each substitution, when we replace a digit d with a string t, we must ensure that the expansion of d is the current expansion of the string t. However, since the expansion of t may depend on other digits, which may be updated later, we can't precompute this. So, the only way to ensure correctness is to recompute the expansion of d whenever any of the digits in its expansion are updated. But this seems computationally expensive.\n\nBut how can we do that? It's impossible to track dependencies between substitutions.\n\nAlternative Idea: Perhaps the problem requires that substitutions are processed in such a way that when a substitution is applied to a digit d, the expansion of d is set to the current expansion of the string t. Any future substitutions to digits in t's expansion won't affect d's expansion. Thus, the initial approach is correct, but the example I thought of is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's re-examine the example. According to the initial approach, after the first substitution (2→0), the expansion of 2 is '0', which has value 0 and length 1. Then, the second substitution (0→7) changes the expansion of 0 to '7', value 7, length 1. However, the expansion of 2 is still '0', which is now replaced by '7'? No, because the expansion of 2 is fixed as '0' at the time of substitution. The substitution for 2 is done once, and the expansion of 2 is fixed to the string '0' (which at that time had expansion '0'). Even though later, the expansion of 0 changes, the expansion of 2 remains '0', which is now replaced by '7'? No, because the expansion of 2 is '0', which is a string. When processing the original string, the expansion of 2 is '0', which is now replaced by '7' because of the substitution for 0. But how does that happen?\n\nAh, no. The substitution for 0 is applied to all occurrences of 0 in the string. But in the original string, there are no 0s. However, after the substitution of 2 with 0, the string is 000. Then, the substitution of 0 with 7 is applied. But in the code's approach, the expansion of 2 is '0', and the expansion of 0 is '7'. So, when processing the original string, the code would expand each 2 to '0', and then the '0's would be expanded to '7's. But how does the code account for that?\n\nAh! The problem is that the code's approach does not recursively expand the expansions. It assumes that the expansion of each digit is already fully expanded. But in reality, when we expand a digit, we need to recursively expand the digits in its expansion. However, the code's approach is designed to handle that. Because, when we compute the value of the string t during substitution, we use the current value and length of the digits in t. So, for example, when we process the substitution for 2 with '0', we compute the value of '0' at that time, which is 0. But when we later process the substitution for 0 with '7', the expansion of 0 is updated to 7. However, the expansion of 2 is not updated, since it was already processed. So, when we process the original string, the expansion of 2 is '0', which is not further expanded. But in reality, the '0's in the expansion of 2 should be replaced with '7's.\n\nSo, the code's approach is not correct. Because it assumes that the expansion of each digit is fixed once processed, but in reality, substitutions can change the expansions of digits that appear in previous expansions.\n\nSo, how to model this?\n\nThe key insight is that the expansion of a digit d is not just a fixed string, but a function that depends on the current state of other substitutions. Therefore, when we want to compute the value of a digit d, we need to recursively expand it, considering the current value and length of its expansion. However, this would require that during the computation of the value of the original string, we recursively expand each digit, which could lead to infinite loops if there are cycles in substitutions (like substituting d with d).\n\nBut for the problem, the substitutions are processed in order, and the code must handle them. How can we model this?\n\nAlternative Idea: Instead of storing the value and length for each digit, we can represent the expansion of each digit as a function that can be evaluated recursively. However, this could lead to repeated calculations, but with memoization, it might be manageable.\n\nBut how to compute the value of the original string. For example, during the processing of the original string, for each character, we need to evaluate its expansion recursively. For example, if the current character is d, we evaluate the expansion of d, which may involve other digits, which in turn may involve others, etc.\n\nBut how to compute this efficiently.\n\nLet me think of it as a recursive function. For each digit d, its expansion's value is computed as follows:\n\nIf there is a substitution for d, then the value is the value of the expansion string t,",
