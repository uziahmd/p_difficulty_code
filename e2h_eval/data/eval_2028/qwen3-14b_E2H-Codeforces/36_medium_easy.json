The $$$i$$$-th town is located at the point $$$i$$$.You build a radio tower in each of the towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ with probability $$$\\frac{1}{2}$$$ (these events are independent). After that, you want to set the signal power on each tower to some integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ (signal powers are not necessarily the same, but also not necessarily different). The signal from a tower located in a town $$$i$$$ with signal power $$$p$$$ reaches every city $$$c$$$ such that $$$|c - i| < p$$$.After building the towers, you want to choose signal powers in such a way that:  towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get any signal from the radio towers;  towns $$$1, 2, \\dots, n$$$ get signal from exactly one radio tower each. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$, and you have built the towers in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$. That way, towns $$$0$$$ and $$$n + 1$$$ don't get the signal from any tower, towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ get the signal from the tower in town $$$2$$$, town $$$4$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$4$$$, and town $$$5$$$ gets the signal from the tower in town $$$5$$$.Calculate the probability that, after building the towers, you will have a way to set signal powers to meet all constraints.\n\n## Input\nThe first (and only) line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$).\n\n## Output\nPrint one integer — the probability that there will be a way to set signal powers so that all constraints are met, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.Formally, the probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction $$$\\frac{x}{y}$$$. You have to print the value of $$$x \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353$$$, where $$$y^{-1}$$$ is an integer such that $$$y \\cdot y^{-1} \\bmod 998244353 = 1$$$.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['2', '3', '5', '200000']\n\n### Output\n['748683265', '748683265', '842268673', '202370013']\n\n## Note\nThe real answer for the first example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$, the towers are built in both towns $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$. The real answer for the second example is $$$\\frac{1}{4}$$$:   with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, the towers are built in towns $$$1$$$, $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$, so we can set their signal powers to $$$1$$$;  with probability $$$\\frac{1}{8}$$$, only one tower in town $$$2$$$ is built, and we can set its signal power to $$$2$$$. The real answer for the third example is $$$\\frac{5}{32}$$$. Note that even though the previous explanations used equal signal powers for all towers, it is not necessarily so. For example, if $$$n = 5$$$ and the towers are built in towns $$$2$$$, $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$, you may set the signal power of the tower in town $$$2$$$ to $$$2$$$, and the signal power of the towers in towns $$$4$$$ and $$$5$$$ to $$$1$$$.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So the problem is about calculating the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with 1/2 probability), there's a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town 1..n gets exactly one signal.\n\nHmm. Let's think about what conditions the tower placements must satisfy for such a configuration to be possible. \n\nFirst, the signal from a tower with power p covers cities from i-p+1 to i+p-1, right? Because |c - i| < p means c is in (i - p, i + p). Wait, but since c has to be an integer, maybe the range is from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1? Or maybe it's better to think that for a tower at position i with power p, it covers all cities c where c is in [i - p + 1, i + p - 1]. Because if p is 1, then |c - i| < 1 implies c = i. So the coverage is exactly the city i. For p=2, it's cities i-1, i, i+1. So the coverage is from i - p + 1 to i + p - 1. So the length of coverage is 2p - 1 cities.\n\nBut the key thing here is that each city 1..n must be covered exactly once. Also, cities 0 and n+1 must not be covered by any tower.\n\nSo how can we model this? Well, perhaps the arrangement of towers must form some kind of structure where each tower's coverage area doesn't overlap with others except possibly at the edges, but in such a way that each city is covered once.\n\nWait, but the signal powers can be chosen. So maybe the problem reduces to certain configurations of towers where there's a way to assign ranges such that they partition the cities 1..n, and also don't reach 0 or n+1.\n\nLet me think of the example given. For n=2, the only valid case is when both towns 1 and 2 have towers. Then each can have power 1. So their coverage is exactly their own town. That way, town 0 is not covered by anyone (since town 1's power is 1, which covers up to 1, so 0 is not included. Similarly for town 2's power 1. So that works. The probability is 1/4, which matches the first example.\n\nAnother example: when n=3. The answer is 1/4. According to the note, there are two cases: either all three towns have towers (probability 1/8) and each has power 1, or only town 2 has a tower (probability 1/8) and sets power to 2. So total is 2/8 = 1/4.\n\nSo what's the pattern here? It seems that the valid tower configurations are those that form a structure where each tower is responsible for a certain interval of cities, and these intervals are non-overlapping and cover all cities 1..n. Also, each tower's coverage must not reach beyond the ends (so for a tower at position i, the maximum reach to the left is 0, and to the right is n+1).\n\nWait, but how do we model that? Maybe the tower positions must be such that they can be partitioned into intervals where each interval is covered by exactly one tower, and that tower's power is set to cover exactly that interval. For example, if there's a tower at position i, and it's covering cities from a to b, then the power must be such that a = i - p + 1 and b = i + p - 1. But since the coverage must not reach 0 or n+1, we need that for the leftmost tower, its coverage starts at 1 (so that it doesn't reach 0). Similarly for the rightmost tower.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the towers must form a structure where each tower is responsible for a contiguous segment of cities, and each such segment is covered by exactly one tower, and the segments are non-overlapping and cover all 1..n.\n\nThis sounds similar to tiling problems. For example, each tower could be responsible for a segment of length 2k-1, where k is the power. But how to model this?\n\nAnother thought: For a tower to cover a segment [a, b], it must be placed at the center of that segment. Because the coverage of a tower at i with power p is [i - p + 1, i + p - 1]. So the length of the segment is 2p-1. So for a segment of length L, the tower must be placed at the middle position. For example, if the segment is of length 1 (just one city), the tower is placed there with power 1. If the segment is of length 3, the tower is placed in the middle (position i) with power 2. So the idea is that each segment must be covered by exactly one tower, placed at the center of the segment. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding subsets of towers such that the positions of the towers form a partition of the cities 1..n into segments, each of which is covered by exactly one tower placed at the center. Moreover, the tower positions must be such that each segment is covered by exactly one tower. \n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem. Let's think recursively. Let dp[i] be the number of valid configurations for the first i cities. Then, for each i, we can consider adding a new segment ending at i. \n\nFor example, for the i-th city, the tower could be placed here, and it's responsible for a segment of length 1 (so power 1), which would require that the previous segment ends at i-1. Or, the tower could be placed at i-1, and the segment covers i-1 and i (so length 2, power 2?), but wait, for a segment of length 2, the tower would have to be placed in the middle. But since the length is even, that's impossible. Wait, no. Wait, for a segment of length L, the tower must be placed at position a + (L-1)/2. So L must be odd. Because otherwise, the center is not an integer. Therefore, each segment must have an odd length. \n\nAh! That's a key insight. Because the tower must be placed at an integer position, the length of the segment must be odd. So each segment is of length 2k-1, for some k ≥ 1. Therefore, the problem becomes similar to tiling the cities with tiles of odd lengths, where each tile is covered by a tower in the middle.\n\nSo, for example, for n=2, the only way to tile is two tiles of length 1. Which requires that both positions 1 and 2 have towers. \n\nFor n=3, the possibilities are:\n- three tiles of length 1 (towers at 1, 2, 3)\n- one tile of length 3 (tower at 2)\nSo the total number of valid configurations is 2. Each of these corresponds to certain tower placements. \n\nBut how does this relate to the actual tower placements? Because in the tiling approach, the tower must be present in the middle of each tile. So for each tile of length L, the tower must be placed at the center. Therefore, the tower positions are exactly the centers of the tiles. Thus, the valid tower configurations are those that correspond to some tiling of the cities 1..n into segments of odd lengths, and the towers are placed exactly at the centers of these segments. \n\nTherefore, the number of valid tower configurations is equal to the number of ways to tile the cities 1..n into segments of odd lengths. Each such tiling corresponds to exactly one set of tower positions (the centers of the segments). \n\nSo the problem reduces to counting the number of such tilings, and then multiplying by 1/(2^n) (since each tower is built with probability 1/2, and the valid configurations are exactly those that correspond to the tilings). However, each tiling corresponds to exactly one set of tower positions (the centers of the tiles). Therefore, the number of valid configurations is equal to the number of tilings. \n\nSo the answer is (number of tilings) / 2^n.\n\nSo now the problem becomes: compute the number of ways to tile the interval [1, n] into segments of odd lengths. Let's call this number f(n). Then the answer is f(n) / 2^n.\n\nNow, how to compute f(n)? Let's think recursively. For the first position, the first segment can be of length 1, 3, 5, etc., as long as it doesn't exceed n. So for f(n), the recurrence is:\n\nf(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... \n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because for the first segment being of length 1, the rest is f(n-1). If the first segment is of length 3, then the rest is f(n-3), etc. However, this leads to a recurrence where f(n) = sum_{k=1,3,5,...} f(n - k), with base cases f(0) = 1 (empty tiling), and f(n) = 0 for negative n.\n\nBut this seems like a standard recurrence. Let's check for small values:\n\nn=1: only one way (tile of length 1). f(1) = 1.\n\nn=2: can't tile. Because any segment must be of odd length. The total length is 2, which is even. So f(2) = 0.\n\nn=3: can be tiled as one segment of length 3, or three segments of length 1. Wait, no. Wait, for n=3, the tiling can be:\n\n- One segment of length 3 (so f(3) += f(0) = 1)\n\n- Or, first segment of length 1 (then f(2)), but f(2) is zero. So total is 1. Wait, but earlier example for n=3 had two valid configurations. Wait, what's wrong here?\n\nWait, earlier example for n=3 said that the answer was 1/4. Which comes from 2 valid configurations. But according to this, f(3) is 1. So something's wrong here. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait, earlier note said that for n=3, the answer is 1/4. The note says that there are two cases: towers in 1,2,3 (probability 1/8) and towers in 2 (probability 1/8). So total of 2 valid configurations. But according to our tiling approach, f(3) should be 2. Because:\n\nThe tiling can be:\n\n- One segment of length 3 (tower at position 2).\n\n- Three segments of length 1 (towers at 1,2,3).\n\nSo two possibilities. So why does the recurrence above give f(3) = f(2) + f(0) ?\n\nWait, the recurrence for f(n) is f(n) = sum_{k=1,3,5...} f(n -k). For n=3:\n\nk=1: f(3-1) = f(2) = 0.\n\nk=3: f(3-3) = f(0) = 1. So f(3) = 0 + 1 = 1. But according to the example, there are two possibilities. So clearly, the recurrence is missing something. \n\nWhat's wrong here? Oh wait, maybe the recurrence is not correct. Because for the first segment being of length 1, the rest of the tiling is for n-1. But for n=3, if the first segment is 1, then the remaining is 2 cities (positions 2 and 3). But for those two cities, can they be tiled? Well, the length is 2, which is even. So no. So that's why f(2)=0. But then how do we get the case where all three are tiled as 1+1+1?\n\nAh, because that would be when the first segment is 1, then the next segment is 1, then the next is 1. But according to the recurrence, for n=3, the first term is f(2) which is zero. But the tiling 1+1+1 would be considered as follows: the first segment is 1, then the next is 1 (for the second position), then the third is 1. So for the recurrence, f(3) would be f(2) + ... but f(2) is zero. So where is the mistake?\n\nAh! The problem is that the recurrence is not considering that the first segment can be of length 1, then the rest is f(2). However, f(2) is zero. But in reality, the tiling 1+1+1 would require that after the first segment of length 1 (covers position 1), the remaining is positions 2 and 3. How can we tile them? Well, that's two positions, which is even. So it's not possible. But that's a contradiction. So why in the example for n=3, there is a valid configuration with towers in 1,2,3?\n\nBecause in that case, each tower is covering exactly their own position. So the tiling is three segments of length 1. But how is that possible? Because the total length is 3, which is 1+1+1=3. So the recurrence must account for that. But according to the previous logic, for n=3, the first step is to take a segment of length 1 (leaving 2 cities), which cannot be tiled. But that's not the case. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, the length of the entire interval is n. So for the tiling, the sum of the lengths of the segments must be exactly n. So for the case of three segments of length 1, the total is 3. So the first segment is length 1 (positions 1), then the next is length 1 (position 2), then the next is length 1 (position 3). So for the recurrence, when considering the first segment of length 1, the rest is positions 2 to 3 (length 2). But that can't be tiled. But according to the example, this is a valid tiling. So there's a contradiction here. What's wrong?\n\nAh! Wait, the tiling is for the entire interval [1, n]. So if the first segment is of length 1 (covers position 1), then the remaining is positions 2 to n. For n=3, that's positions 2 and 3. But how can you tile that? Well, you can't with segments of odd length. So why is the example considering that case as valid?\n\nWait, the example says for n=3, when towers are built in 1, 2, 3, then each can be set to power 1. So each covers exactly their own city. So the coverage is [1], [2], [3]. So the segments are indeed of length 1. So how can that be? The sum of the lengths is 3, which is correct. But according to the recurrence, the way to get that is to take the first segment of length 1, then the next segment of length 1, then another of length 1. But how does that fit into the recurrence?\n\nAh, I think my recurrence is wrong. Because when I take the first segment of length 1, the remaining is positions 2 to 3 (length 2). But the recurrence for f(n) counts the number of tilings for the entire interval. So for the first segment of length 1, the remaining is n-1 = 2. But f(2) is 0, meaning there's no way to tile positions 2-3. But that's not true, because we can tile positions 2-3 as two segments of length 1. But according to the previous logic, that would require that the length of the remaining is 2, which is even. But how can that be tiled into segments of odd lengths?\n\nWait, 2 is even. So the sum of odd numbers must be even. Which is possible only if there are an even number of terms. For example, two segments of length 1 (sum 2). So yes, that's possible. So for the remaining length 2, the number of tilings is 1 (two segments of length 1). But according to the previous recurrence, f(2) is zero. So that's the mistake. The recurrence is not correctly accounting for this.\n\nSo my initial recurrence is wrong. So I need to find the correct recurrence for f(n). Let me think again. \n\nLet me define f(n) as the number of ways to tile the interval [1, n] into segments of odd lengths. Then, for each possible first segment length k (which is odd), we can add f(n -k) to the total. So the recurrence is:\n\nf(n) = sum_{k=1,3,5,...} f(n -k), with base case f(0) = 1 (empty tiling), and f(n) = 0 for n < 0.\n\nBut for n=2, the sum is for k=1 and k=3 (but k=3 is larger than 2). So only k=1. Then f(2) = f(2-1) = f(1) = 1. But earlier I thought that f(2) is zero. Wait, but according to this, f(2) = 1. Which would mean that there's one way to tile 2 positions. Which is two segments of length 1. That's correct. So earlier calculation was wrong. So f(2) is 1, not 0. So what's the correct value for f(2)?\n\nYes, for n=2, the tiling is two segments of length 1. So that's allowed. So f(2) = 1. Which would explain the example for n=3.\n\nLet me recalculate:\n\nn=1: f(1) = f(0) = 1.\n\nn=2: f(2) = f(1) = 1.\n\nn=3: f(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which matches the example. Because for n=3, there are two tilings: [1,1,1] and [3].\n\nSo the recurrence is correct. Then, for n=2, the answer is f(2)/2^2 = 1/4. Which matches the first example. For n=3, f(3)=2, so answer is 2/8 = 1/4. Which matches the note. For n=5, the example says the answer is 5/32. Let's see:\n\nWe need to compute f(5).\n\nLet's compute f(n) for n up to 5.\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1) = f(0) = 1\n\nf(2) = f(1) = 1\n\nf(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nf(4) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nf(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5. \n\nSo yes, for n=5, f(5)=5. Then the answer is 5/(2^5) = 5/32, which matches the note. Great!\n\nSo the recurrence is correct. Now, the problem reduces to computing f(n) for given n, then compute f(n) * inv(2^n) mod 998244353.\n\nNow, how to compute f(n) efficiently for n up to 2e5?\n\nThe recurrence is f(n) = sum_{k=1,3,...} f(n -k). But for each n, the sum is over all odd k such that k ≤ n. So for each n, the sum is f(n-1) + f(n-3) + f(n-5) + ... \n\nBut this can be rewritten as f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) - f(n-3) ? No, maybe not. Wait, perhaps there's a way to find a simpler recurrence. Let's see:\n\nLet's look for a pattern in the f(n) sequence:\n\nn | f(n)\n0 | 1\n1 | 1\n2 | 1\n3 | 2\n4 | 3\n5 | 5\n6 | ?\n\nLet's compute f(6):\n\nf(6) = f(5) + f(3) + f(1) = 5 + 2 + 1 = 8.\n\nSimilarly, f(4) = 3, f(5) = 5, f(6)=8. Hmm, looks like Fibonacci numbers. Let's check:\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\nn=0 → 1\n\nn=1 → 1\n\nn=2 → 1\n\nn=3 → 2\n\nn=4 → 3\n\nn=5 → 5\n\nn=6 → 8\n\nn=7 → f(6)+f(4)+f(2) = 8 +3 +1 = 12?\n\nWait, let's compute f(7) = sum of f(7 -k) for k odd up to 7.\n\nk can be 1,3,5,7.\n\nSo f(7) = f(6) + f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 8 +3 +1 +1 = 13.\n\nSo the sequence is 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13... which looks like the Fibonacci sequence shifted. For example, the Fibonacci numbers starting from F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1, F(3)=2, F(4)=3, F(5)=5, F(6)=8, F(7)=13. So f(n) = F(n) ?\n\nWait for n=0, f(0)=1, which is F(2) = 1. For n=1, f(1)=1=F(2). n=2, f(2)=1=F(3). n=3, f(3)=2=F(4). n=4, f(4)=3=F(5). Yes! So it seems that f(n) = F(n+1), where F is the Fibonacci sequence starting with F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, etc.\n\nSo for example, for n=5, f(5)=5 = F(6) = 5. Yes. For n=6, f(6) = 8 = F(7) = 13? No. Wait, no. Wait F(6) is 8. F(7) is 13. So for n=6, f(6) is 8 = F(6+1) ? No, 6+1 is 7, F(7)=13. So that doesn't fit. Wait, earlier calculations:\n\nn | f(n) | F(n+1)\n0 | 1 | F(1) = 1 → yes.\n1 | 1 | F(2) = 1 → yes.\n2 | 1 | F(3) = 2 → no. Wait, no. So this suggests that the initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, let's re-express:\n\nLooking at the values:\n\nn | f(n)\n0 | 1\n1 | 1\n2 | 1\n3 | 2\n4 | 3\n5 | 5\n6 | 8\n7 | 13\n\nSo the sequence is 1,1,1,2,3,5,8,13... which is the Fibonacci sequence starting from F(2) = 1, F(3) = 2, etc. So for n ≥ 0, f(n) = F(n+1) ?\n\nWait for n=0, F(1) is 1. Yes. n=1, F(2)=1. Yes. n=2, F(3)=2? No, because f(2) is 1. So that's not matching. So maybe another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the recurrence:\n\nLet's look for a recurrence relation for f(n). Let's think about the sum for f(n). \n\nFor each n, f(n) = sum_{k odd} f(n -k). \n\nBut note that for any m, sum_{k odd} f(m -k) = sum_{k odd} f(m -k) = sum_{j} f(j), where j = m -k, and k is odd. Since k is odd, j = m -k → k = m -j. So for j to be such that m -j is odd. Which means that j has parity opposite to m. So for example, if m is even, then j must be odd. \n\nBut this might not help directly. However, let's consider f(n) and f(n-1). Let's try to find a recurrence between f(n) and previous terms.\n\nLet me consider f(n) and f(n-1). \n\nFor example, f(n) = sum_{k odd} f(n -k) \n\nSimilarly, f(n-1) = sum_{k odd} f(n-1 -k) \n\nBut if we look at the terms of f(n), it's the sum of f(n-1) (when k=1) plus sum_{k >=3 odd} f(n-k). But the sum for k >=3 odd can be rewritten as sum_{k' odd} f(n-1 -k') where k' = k-2. Because for k=3, k'=1, etc. So:\n\nsum_{k odd >=3} f(n -k) = sum_{k' odd} f(n - (k'+2)) = sum_{k' odd} f( (n-2) -k' ) = f(n-2).\n\nSo f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2).\n\nYes! Because:\n\nsum_{k odd} f(n -k) = [k=1] f(n-1) + sum_{k odd >=3} f(n -k) \n\nWhich equals f(n-1) + sum_{k' odd} f(n - (k'+2)) = f(n-1) + sum_{k' odd} f( (n-2) -k' ) = f(n-1) + f(n-2).\n\nSo the recurrence is f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), with base cases f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1. \n\nWait, this is the Fibonacci recurrence! Let's check with previous values.\n\nFor n=2: f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2? But earlier calculation said f(2) was 1. Wait, that contradicts. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, earlier when we computed f(2) using the original approach, it was f(2) = f(1) = 1. But according to the new recurrence, it's f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. So there's a contradiction. Which indicates that the derivation is wrong.\n\nSo where's the mistake in the derivation?\n\nLet me re-derive the recurrence. \n\nOriginal sum for f(n) is sum_{k odd} f(n -k). \n\nBut when we split into k=1 and k≥3 odd, the sum for k≥3 odd is sum_{k≥3 odd} f(n -k) = sum_{k' odd} f(n - (k'+2)) where k' is odd and ≥1. \n\nBut n - (k'+2) = (n - 2) -k'. So that sum is f(n-2). \n\nThus, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nBut according to previous calculations, this gives f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2, but earlier calculations said that f(2) is 1. Which is a contradiction. So what's wrong here?\n\nLet me re-calculate f(2) using the original definition. For n=2, the number of tilings is the number of ways to split [1,2] into segments of odd lengths. The only way is two segments of length 1. So f(2) should be 1. But according to the recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), for n=2, f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which is wrong. \n\nSo the derivation must be wrong. Where is the error?\n\nLet me think again. Let me take n=2. According to the original sum, f(2) = sum_{k odd} f(2 -k). The possible k are 1 (since 2-1=1 ≥0) and 3 (2-3 = -1 <0). So only k=1. Hence f(2) = f(1) = 1. \n\nBut according to the derived recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), which would be f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. So where is the mistake in the derivation?\n\nAh! The mistake is in the assumption that the sum for k≥3 odd is f(n-2). Let me re-express that. \n\nLet me consider the sum for k≥3 odd. Let k = 2m + 1, where m ≥1. Then for each such k, the term is f(n -k). \n\nBut when I made the substitution k' = k-2, then k' = 2m + 1 - 2 = 2(m-1) + 1, which is odd. So the sum over k≥3 odd is equivalent to the sum over k' odd ≥1 of f(n - (k'+2)). Which is sum_{k' odd ≥1} f( (n-2) -k' ). \n\nWhich is exactly f(n-2), according to the original definition. So the sum for k≥3 odd is f(n-2). \n\nBut for n=2, the sum for k≥3 odd is zero (since k=3 is larger than n=2). So according to this, the sum for k≥3 odd is f(2-2) = f(0) = 1. Which is not correct. Because for n=2, the sum for k≥3 odd is zero. \n\nSo why is that? Because the substitution assumes that for any n, the sum over k≥3 odd is f(n-2). But that's only true if n-2 is ≥0. However, when n=2, n-2 = 0, and the sum over k≥3 odd would be sum_{k≥3} f(0 -k) which is zero. But according to the substitution, it's f(0) = 1. Which is incorrect. \n\nAh, I see the problem. The substitution assumes that for any k≥3 odd, n -k ≥ 0. But this is not always the case. So the derivation is only valid when n -k ≥0. \n\nSo the correct way is that the sum over k≥3 odd is equal to f(n-2) if n-2 ≥0. Otherwise, it's zero. But how does that fit into the recurrence?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct recurrence is f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n ≥ 2, with base cases f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1. But according to this, for n=2, f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 2, which contradicts the earlier correct value of 1. \n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Let's think again. What's the correct value of f(2)?\n\nFor n=2, the number of tilings is 1 (two segments of length 1). So f(2) = 1. But according to the recurrence derived from the sum, f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) gives f(2) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which is wrong. So the derivation must be wrong.\n\nLet me think of another way. Let's write down the values for f(n) and see what the recurrence is.\n\nWe have:\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1) = 1\n\nf(2) = 1\n\nf(3) = f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nf(4) = f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3\n\nf(5) = f(4) + f(2) = 3 + 1 = 4? No, earlier calculation said f(5) is 5. Wait, no. Earlier calculation for f(5) was f(5) = f(4) + f(2) + f(0) = 3 + 1 + 1 = 5. But according to the previous idea of f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), for n=5, it would be f(4) + f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5. Which matches. But for n=3, according to the recurrence f(3) = f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which matches. For n=2, according to this recurrence, it would be f(1) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2, but the correct value is 1. So why is there a discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because the recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) is only valid for n ≥ 3? Let's check for n=3. For n=3, the original sum is f(2) + f(0) = 1 + 1 = 2. Which equals f(2) + f(1) = 1 + 1 = 2. So for n=3, the recurrence holds. For n=2, the original sum is f(1) = 1. But according to the recurrence f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), it would be f(1) + f(0) = 2. Which is wrong. So why for n≥3, the recurrence holds?\n\nMaybe the general recurrence is f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) for n ≥ 2, but with different base cases?\n\nWait for n=2, according to the original sum, f(2) = f(1) = 1. According to the recurrence f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 2. Which is wrong. So the recurrence is not valid for n=2. But for n ≥ 3, it holds?\n\nLet me check for n=4:\n\nOriginal sum is f(3) + f(1) = 2 + 1 = 3. According to the recurrence f(4) = f(3) + f(2) = 2 + 1 = 3. Which is correct. \n\nFor n=2, the original sum is f(1) = 1. According to the recurrence f(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 2. So it's wrong. But for n ≥ 3, the recurrence holds. How can this be explained?\n\nLet me think again about the derivation. We said that f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). But for n=2, this would imply that the sum for k≥3 odd is f(n-2) = f(0) = 1. But in reality, for n=2, the sum for k≥3 is zero. So why the discrepancy?\n\nAh! Because when we split the sum into k=1 and k≥3, the sum for k≥3 is f(n-2) only if n-2 ≥ 0. But for n=2, n-2 = 0. And the sum for k≥3 is sum_{k≥3} f(0 -k) which is zero. However, according to the substitution, it's f(n-2) = f(0) = 1. So there's an error in the substitution.\n\nWait, why did we think that the sum for k≥3 odd is f(n-2)? Let me think again. The substitution is that for each k ≥3 odd, we can write k = k' + 2, where k' is odd ≥1. So the sum becomes sum_{k' odd ≥1} f(n - (k' + 2)) = sum_{k' odd ≥1} f((n-2) - k') = f(n-2). This is only valid if n-2 ≥ 0, and for all k' odd ≥1, (n-2) -k' ≥ 0. But that's not necessarily true. \n\nActually, the sum for k≥3 odd is equal",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that after randomly building towers in towns 1 to n (each with a 1/2 probability), there is a way to assign signal powers such that towns 0 and n+1 get no signal, and each town from 1 to n gets exactly one signal. \n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Constraints**: The key insight is recognizing that valid configurations of towers correspond to tiling the interval [1, n] into segments of odd lengths. Each segment must be covered by a tower placed at its center.\n2. **Dynamic Programming Insight**: The number of ways to tile the interval [1, n] into segments of odd lengths follows a Fibonacci-like sequence. This sequence can be derived using dynamic programming where `f(n)` represents the number of valid tilings for length `n`.\n3. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the result needs to be computed modulo 998244353, we use modular inverses to handle divisions efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    n = int(input())\n    \n    # Precompute f(n) using dp\n    max_n = n\n    dp = [0] * (max_n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    if max_n >= 1:\n        dp[1] = 1\n    if max_n >= 2:\n        dp[2] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(3, max_n + 1):\n        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % MOD\n    \n    # Compute 2^n mod MOD\n    power = pow(2, n, MOD)\n    inv_power = pow(power, MOD - 2, MOD)\n    \n    result = (dp[n] * inv_power) % MOD\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization**: We initialize a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` holds the number of valid tilings for the interval of length `i`. The base cases are `dp[0] = 1` (empty tiling) and `dp[1] = 1` (one segment of length 1).\n2. **Filling the DP Array**: Using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]) % MOD`, we fill the array up to `n`. This relation is derived from the observation that the number of valid tilings for length `i` is the sum of valid tilings for lengths `i-1` and `i-2`.\n3. **Modular Inverse Calculation**: To compute the probability, we need the modular inverse of `2^n` modulo 998244353. This is done using Fermat's Little Theorem, which allows us to compute the inverse as `pow(2, n, MOD)` raised to the power `MOD-2`.\n4. **Final Result**: The result is the product of `dp[n]` and the modular inverse of `2^n`, taken modulo 998244353.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient computation even for large values of `n` up to 200,000, leveraging dynamic programming and modular arithmetic for correctness and performance.",
