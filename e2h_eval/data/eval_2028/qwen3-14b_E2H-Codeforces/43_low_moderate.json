He gives it to his friend B who appends some number of letters 'b' to the end of this string. Since both A and B like the characters 'a' and 'b', they have made sure that at this point, at least one 'a' and one 'b' exist in the string.B now gives this string to C and he appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string. However, since C is a good friend of A and B, the number of letters 'c' he appends is equal to the number of 'a' or to the number of 'b' in the string. It is also possible that the number of letters 'c' equals both to the number of letters 'a' and to the number of letters 'b' at the same time.You have a string in your hands, and you want to check if it is possible to obtain the string in this way or not. If it is possible to obtain the string, print \"YES\", otherwise print \"NO\" (without the quotes).\n\n## Input\nThe first and only line consists of a string $$$S$$$ ($$$ 1 \\le |S| \\le 5\\,000 $$$). It is guaranteed that the string will only consist of the lowercase English letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" or \"NO\", according to the condition.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['aaabccc', 'bbacc', 'aabc']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'YES']\n\n## Note\nConsider first example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'a'. Consider second example: although the number of 'c' is equal to the number of the 'b', the order is not correct.Consider third example: the number of 'c' is equal to the number of 'b'.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to determine if a given string could have been formed by the process described. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nSo, the process is: A starts with some number of 'a's. Then B adds some 'b's, making sure there's at least one 'a' and 'b'. Then C adds 'c's equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's in the string at that point. And the final string is what we're checking.\n\nFirst, the string must consist of only a's, b's, and c's. But the input is guaranteed to have only those, so maybe I don't need to check that.\n\nLet me break down the conditions:\n\n1. The string must have at least one 'a' and one 'b' (since B made sure of that). Also, since C adds some 'c's, there must be at least one 'c' as well? Wait no. Wait, the problem says that C appends some number of 'c's. But the note says that the second example has 'bbacc' which is 'bbacc' â€” but the output is NO because the order is wrong. Let's think about that. Wait, in the second example, the string is 'bbacc'. Let's check the counts. The counts are: a: 1, b:2, c:2. So the number of c's is equal to the number of b's (2). But why is the answer NO?\n\nBecause the order is not correct. Because the process is: first A's string (only a's), then B adds b's. So the string must have all a's followed by all b's, then c's. Because when B appends the b's, they are added to the end. Then C appends c's to the end. So the entire string must be a sequence of a's, then b's, then c's. So the order of characters must be all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. Otherwise, it's invalid.\n\nSo for example, the second input is 'bbacc', which has 'b's followed by 'a's. Which would not be possible because after B adds the b's, the string is a's followed by b's. Then C adds c's. So the string must be a's, then b's, then c's. So any string that doesn't follow this order is invalid.\n\nSo first, I need to check that the string is composed of a block of a's, followed by a block of b's, followed by a block of c's. If that's not the case, then it's automatically a NO.\n\nSo step one: check the order of characters. For example, if there's a 'c' before some 'b's, that's invalid. Or if there's an 'a' after a 'b' or 'c', that's invalid.\n\nSo how to check this? Let's think. The string should have all a's first, then all b's, then all c's. So, the first occurrence of 'b' must be after all a's, and the first occurrence of 'c' must be after all b's. So, for example, the string can't have a 'b' followed by an 'a' later. Similarly, no 'c's before the b's.\n\nSo, the string must be of the form a* b* c*, where each * represents zero or more occurrences. However, since the problem says that there's at least one a and one b, and then the c's are added (so there must be at least one c? No. Wait, C appends some number of 'c's. So the number of 'c's could be zero? No, because the problem says that C appends some number of letters 'c' to the end. The problem says \"some number\", which I think implies that it's at least one. Wait, but the original problem says that the initial string (after B's appending) has at least one a and one b. Then C appends some number of c's. So the number of c's could be zero? Or does \"some number\" mean at least one?\n\nWait, the problem says: \"appends some number of letters 'c' to the end of the string.\" So \"some number\" could be zero? Or is it required to be at least one?\n\nLooking back at the problem statement. The note says that in the third example, 'aabc' is valid. Let's check that. The counts are a:2, b:1, c:1. So the number of c's equals the number of b's. So the string is aabc. Which is a's followed by b's followed by c's. So that's valid. So in this case, the c's count is 1. So",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a given string could have been formed by a specific sequence of operations involving appending 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's. The string must follow a strict order: all 'a's first, followed by all 'b's, and then all 'c's. Additionally, the number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or the number of 'b's in the string before the 'c's were appended.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Check Order**: The string must be composed of a block of 'a's, followed by a block of 'b's, and then a block of 'c's. Any deviation from this order makes the string invalid.\n2. **Count Characters**: Count the number of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the string.\n3. **Validate Conditions**: Ensure there is at least one 'a' and one 'b'. The number of 'c's must be equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef is_valid_string(s):\n    # Check the order of characters: all a's first, then b's, then c's\n    # Check if the string is in the form a*b*c*\n    # First, check if the string has any 'b' before 'a' or 'c' before 'b'\n    # Also, check if after the first 'b', there are any 'a's\n    # Similarly, after the first 'c', there are any 'a's or 'b's\n    \n    # Check for order\n    a_count = 0\n    b_count = 0\n    c_count = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char == 'a':\n            if b_count > 0 or c_count > 0:\n                return False\n            a_count += 1\n        elif char == 'b':\n            if c_count > 0:\n                return False\n            b_count += 1\n        elif char == 'c':\n            c_count += 1\n    # Now check the conditions\n    if a_count == 0 or b_count == 0:\n        return False\n    if c_count == 0:\n        return False\n    if c_count == a_count or c_count == b_count:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input_str = sys.stdin.read().strip()\n    if is_valid_string(input_str):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Order Check**: The function `is_valid_string` iterates through each character of the string to ensure that all 'a's appear before any 'b's, and all 'b's appear before any 'c's. If this order is violated at any point, the function returns `False`.\n2. **Character Counts**: After verifying the order, the function checks if there are at least one 'a' and one 'b'. It also ensures that there is at least one 'c'.\n3. **Validation of 'c' Count**: Finally, the function checks if the number of 'c's is equal to either the number of 'a's or 'b's. If so, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not.\n\nThis approach efficiently checks the required conditions in linear time, ensuring the solution is both optimal and easy to understand.",
