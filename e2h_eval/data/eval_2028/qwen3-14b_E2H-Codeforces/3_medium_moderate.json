Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to find the minimum radius d such that all points on the street of length l are covered by at least one lantern's light. The lanterns are placed at various positions along the street, which is from 0 to l. \n\nFirst, I should think about how the lanterns cover the street. Each lantern covers a segment from (ai - d) to (ai + d). But since the street is from 0 to l, the coverage can't go beyond those points. So, the problem is to find the minimal d where the union of all these intervals covers the entire [0, l] interval.\n\nHmm, how do I approach this? Well, maybe I should sort the lantern positions first. Because if they are sorted, I can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns and determine the maximum required d based on those gaps.\n\nWait, right. Let me think: after sorting the lanterns, the largest gap between consecutive lanterns will determine the required d. Because for each gap between two consecutive lanterns, the maximum distance that needs to be covered is half of that gap. Because if you have two lanterns at positions a and b (a < b), then the middle point between them is (a + b)/2. The distance from a to that point is (b - a)/2, so the radius needs to be at least that. But also, we have to consider the ends of the street. For example, if the first lantern is not at 0, then the distance from 0 to the first lantern's position minus d must be covered. Similarly for the end of the street.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n1. Sort the array of lantern positions.\n2. Check the distance from 0 to the first lantern. The required d for that part is (a[0] - 0), but since the lantern's coverage extends to a[0] - d. Wait, no. Wait, the first lantern's coverage starts at a[0] - d. But to cover the start of the street (position 0), we need that a[0] - d ≤ 0. So d must be at least a[0]. Because if a[0] is the first lantern, then the leftmost point it can cover is a[0] - d. To cover 0, this needs to be ≤ 0. So d ≥ a[0] - 0? No, wait: a[0] - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a[0]. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the lantern is at position a. The leftmost point covered is a - d. To cover 0, a - d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a. But if the lantern is at position a, then the distance from the lantern to 0 is a. So the radius must be at least a. Otherwise, 0 would not be covered. For example, if a is 5, then d must be at least 5 to cover 0. Because 5 - d ≤ 0 → d ≥5. So yes, the first part is the distance from 0 to the first lantern.\n\nSimilarly, for the end of the street. The last lantern is at position a[-1]. The rightmost point covered by that lantern is a[-1] + d. This needs to be ≥ l. So d ≥ l - a[-1].\n\nThen, between consecutive lanterns, the maximum gap between them is (a[i+1] - a[i]). For each such gap, the minimal d required is (gap)/2. Because the middle of the gap is at (a[i] + a[i+1])/2. The distance from a[i] to that point is (a[i+1] - a[i])/2. So the radius must be at least that value to cover that point.\n\nSo the overall minimal d is the maximum between:\n\n- the first lantern's position (distance from 0)\n- the last lantern's distance from l (l - a[-1])\n- the maximum (gap between consecutive lanterns)/2\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen for each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the difference between them, divide by 2, and compare with max_d. Take the maximum.\n\nSo the answer is the maximum of all those values.\n\nWait, but what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1. Then the max_d would be max(a[0], l - a[0]). Which makes sense. Because the lantern has to cover from 0 to l. So the required d is max(a[0], l - a[0]).\n\nYes. So that case is handled.\n\nLet me test the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n7 15\n\nThe lanterns are at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, they are 0,3,5,7,9,14,15.\n\nCheck the first lantern is 0. So the distance from 0 is 0. Then the last lantern is 15. l is 15, so l - a[-1] is 0. So the initial max_d is 0. Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns:\n\n3-0 = 3 → 3/2 = 1.5 → current max_d is 1.5.\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0.\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5 → now max_d is 2.5.\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5. So the maximum is 2.5. Which matches the sample output of 2.5. So that works.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=2, l=5. Lanterns at 2 and 5. After sorting, [2,5]. \n\nFirst lantern is at 2. So distance from 0 is 2. Last lantern is 5, l - a[-1] is 0. So initial max_d is 2. Then check the gap between 5-2=3 → 3/2=1.5. So max_d is 2. So the answer is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: if the lanterns are at 0 and l. Then the gaps between them is l - 0. So the max gap is l. Divided by 2 is l/2. But the initial max_d is max(0, 0) = 0. So the answer is l/2. Which makes sense.\n\nAnother case: lanterns are at 0 and 3, l=5. Then the first part is 0, last part is 5-3=2. The gap between 0 and 3 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So the maximum is 2. So the answer is 2. Which would mean that the lantern at 3 covers up to 3+2=5, which is correct. The first lantern covers from 0-2 to 0+2=2. But the second lantern covers from 3-2=1 to 5. So the coverage is from 0 to 5. So yes.\n\nSo the approach seems correct.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Then sort them.\n\nCompute initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]).\n\nThen iterate through the sorted list, for each i from 0 to n-2, compute a[i+1] - a[i], divide by 2. Compare with current max_d, take the maximum.\n\nFinally, output the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nBut wait, what if n is zero? Oh, no, the constraints say n >=1. Because input says 1<=n<=1000.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Sort them. Then compute the initial max_d as max(a[0], l - a[-1]). Then for each consecutive pair, compute the difference, divide by 2, and compare.\n\nBut in Python, how to handle the input? For example, the first input line is two integers, then the next line is n integers.\n\nBut in the sample input, the first input is given as ['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5'] — but that's probably for testing. But in reality, the input comes from stdin. So the code needs to read from stdin.\n\nSo code:\n\nRead the first line as n and l. Then read the next line as list of integers.\n\nBut in Python, the code can be written as:\n\nimport sys\n\nn, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\na = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n\nfor i in range(n-1):\n    gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n    current = gap / 2\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but what about when n is 1? Like, n=1, l=5, a=[3]. Then the initial max_d is max(3, 5-3) = max(3, 2) = 3. Which is correct. Because the lantern is at 3, so to cover 0, the radius must be 3. And to cover 5, the radius must be 2. So the max is 3. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=0. Wait, no, l is at least 1 according to input constraints. So no problem.\n\nBut what if the lanterns are already covering the entire street? For example, n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. Then the gaps between them is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. The initial max_d is max(0, 0) = 0. So the answer is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nTesting the sample input:\n\nFirst sample input:\n\nAfter sorting, a is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d is max(0, 15-15=0) → 0.\n\nThen check the gaps:\n\n3-0=3 → 1.5 → max_d becomes 1.5.\n\n5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\n7-5=2 → 1.0.\n\n9-7=2 → 1.0.\n\n14-9=5 → 2.5 → new max.\n\n15-14=1 → 0.5. So the final max is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nn=2, l=5, a is [2,5]. After sorting, [2,5]. max_d is max(2, 5-5=0) → 2. Then the gap is 5-2=3 → 1.5. So max remains 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=1, l=10, a=[5]. Then max_d is max(5, 10-5=5) → 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 5, 10]. Then gaps are 5 and 5. Each divided by 2 is 2.5. The initial max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. So the answer is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=10, a=[0, 10]. Then the max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. The gap is 10, divided by 2 is 5. So answer is 5. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a=[0, 2, 10]. Then the initial max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. The gaps are 2 and 8. The first gap is 2/2=1. The second is 8/2=4. So the max is 4. But what about the coverage? The first lantern covers 0 to 2. The second covers 2-4 to 2+4=6. The third covers 10-4=6 to 10. So the middle between 2 and 10 is 6. So the gap between 2 and 10 is 8. So the required d is 4. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, handling the output. The problem says that the answer must be printed with 10 decimal digits. So in Python, formatting with .10f should suffice. However, in cases where the number is an integer, like 2.0, it would print as 2.0000000000. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code should be:\n\nRead n and l, read the list, sort, compute the max_d as described, then print with 10 decimals.\n\nNow, possible edge cases:\n\nCase where the lanterns are all at 0. For example, n=3, l=5, a=[0,0,0]. Then the initial max_d is max(0, 5-0=5) → 5. Then the gaps between consecutive lanterns are 0, so their contribution is 0. So the answer is 5. Which is correct, because the lanterns can't cover beyond 0 + d. So d must be 5 to reach 5.\n\nAnother case: l=0? But according to input constraints, l is at least 1. So no.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=3, a=[0,3]. Then the max_d is max(0, 0) → 0. The gap is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So answer is 1.5. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, code in Python:\n\nNeed to import sys, read input, etc.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    n, l = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    a = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    a.sort()\n    max_d = max(a[0], l - a[-1])\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        gap = a[i+1] - a[i]\n        current = gap / 2\n        if current > max_d:\n            max_d = current\n    print(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nWait, but what if the input has multiple test cases? Like in the sample input given, which has two test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is for a single test case. Wait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers n, l ... Then the next line contains n integers ai.\n\nBut in the sample input, there are two examples given. However, in practice, the code is supposed to process one test case per run. So the sample input may be for multiple test cases, but the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the sample input is presented as two separate test cases, but the actual code is supposed to process one test case. But the problem says that the input is given as per the first line, then the next line.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn the input section, it says that the first line contains two integers n and l. The next line contains n integers. So the code is supposed to read one test case. The sample input shows two examples, but that's probably for the purpose of showing multiple test cases. However, the code should process one test case. So the code as written is correct.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the first input is:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWhich is two test cases. But in practice, the code is supposed to read from standard input. So perhaps the user is supposed to read multiple test cases. But according to the problem statement, the input is for one test case. So perhaps the sample input is presented in a way that shows two test cases, but the actual code is supposed to handle one.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).\n\nSo the code must read one test case. So the sample input is two test cases, but the code is supposed to handle one. So the code as written would handle that.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the code would read the first line as n and l, then the next line as the list. So for the first example, the input is:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0\n\nWhich is correct. The code would process that, then output 2.5... Then for the second test case, the code would read the next line as 2 5, then next line as 2 5. But the code as written would process only one test case. So in the sample input, the code would process the first test case, but not the second. However, the problem says that the code should read from stdin. So perhaps the sample input is presented as two test cases, but the actual code is supposed to read one. Therefore, the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius required for lanterns to illuminate an entire street of length `l` given their positions.
