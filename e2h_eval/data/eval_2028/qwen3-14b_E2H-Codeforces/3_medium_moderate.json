Consider the coordinate system with the beginning of the street corresponding to the point 0, and its end corresponding to the point l. Then the i-th lantern is at the point ai. The lantern lights all points of the street that are at the distance of at most d from it, where d is some positive number, common for all lanterns. Vanya wonders: what is the minimum light radius d should the lanterns have to light the whole street?\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers n, l (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ l ≤ 109) — the number of lanterns and the length of the street respectively. The next line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ l). Multiple lanterns can be located at the same point. The lanterns may be located at the ends of the street.\n\n## Output\nPrint the minimum light radius d, needed to light the whole street. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed 10 - 9.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\n### Output\n['2.5000000000', '2.0000000000']\n\n## Note\nConsider the second sample. At d = 2 the first lantern will light the segment [0, 4] of the street, and the second lantern will light segment [3, 5]. Thus, the whole street will be lit.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a moderately difficult question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum radius d for the lanterns so that the entire street is covered. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. The street is from 0 to l. There are n lanterns placed at various positions. Each lantern can light up a segment from (ai - d) to (ai + d). We need to find the minimal d such that all points from 0 to l are covered by at least one lantern's light.\n\nHmm. So the key is to find the maximum gap between consecutive lanterns, and then determine the required d based on that. But how?\n\nLet me think. Let's imagine that the lanterns are sorted in order. Because if they are not sorted, the gaps between them might not be properly considered. For example, if we have lanterns at positions 3 and 5, but there's another one at 1, then the gaps between 1 and 3, and 3 and 5 are important. But if they are not sorted, we can't just look at consecutive elements.\n\nSo first step: sort the array of lantern positions.\n\nOnce sorted, we can check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each gap between two consecutive lanterns, say between a and b, the maximum distance between them is (b - a). But since each lantern can cover up to d on either side, the required d for this gap would be (b - a)/2. Because if the gap is between a and b, then the middle point is (a + b)/2. The distance from a to that middle point is (b - a)/2, which would be the required d to cover that gap. Because if d is that value, then the two lanterns' coverage areas would meet exactly at the middle point.\n\nBut wait, what about the edges? Like the beginning of the street (0) and the end (l). For example, if the first lantern is at position a1, then the distance from 0 to a1 is a1. The required d must be at least a1, because otherwise the area from 0 to a1 -d would not be covered. Similarly, for the last lantern, if it's at a_n, then the distance from a_n to l is l - a_n. So the required d must be at least that.\n\nSo the overall approach is:\n\n- Sort the lantern positions.\n- Check the first lantern's position: the initial gap is a[0] - 0. The required d for that is a[0], because the lantern's coverage must reach 0. So the initial d is a[0].\n- Then check the gaps between consecutive lanterns. For each pair (current, next), the gap is next - current. The required d for this gap is (gap)/2. Because the middle point between them is (current + next)/2. The distance from current to that point is (next - current)/2. So that's the d needed to cover that gap.\n- Then check the last lantern's position: the gap is l - a[-1]. The required d is that value.\n- The answer is the maximum of all these values.\n\nWait, but why?\n\nLet me take an example. Suppose the first lantern is at position 3. Then the distance from 0 to 3 is 3. So the d must be at least 3, because otherwise the area from 0 to 3 -d would not be covered. For example, if d is 2, then the lantern covers from 1 to 5. But 0 is not covered. So the initial d must be a[0], because the first lantern's leftmost coverage is a[0] -d. To cover 0, we need a[0] -d ≤ 0 → d ≥ a[0]. Similarly for the end.\n\nSo yes, the steps are:\n\nSort the array.\n\nCompute the initial d as a[0], then compute the max between consecutive lanterns as (gap)/2, then compute the end d as l - a[-1]. The maximum of all these is the required d.\n\nBut wait, what if there's only one lantern? For example, n=1, l=5, and the lantern is at position 3. Then the initial d is 3 (to cover 0), and the end d is 5-3=2. So the maximum is 3. Which makes sense. The lantern's coverage would be from 3 -3 = 0 to 3+3=6. Since the street is up to 5, that's covered. So yes.\n\nAnother example: the sample input given.\n\nSample Input 2: 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. Wait, the input is ['2 5\\n2 5'].\n\nSo after sorting, the lanterns are at 2 and 5. The first gap is 2 - 0 = 2. So initial d is 2. The gap between 2 and 5 is 3. So (3)/2 = 1.5. Then the end is 5 -5 =0. So maximum is 2. Which matches the sample output. So that works.\n\nAnother sample input: first example input is 7 15 with lanterns at 15,5,3,7,9,14,0. After sorting, the positions are 0,3,5,7,9,14,15. Let's check the gaps:\n\nFirst, initial d is 0 - 0 = 0? Wait, no. The first lantern is at 0. So the initial gap is 0 - 0 =0. So the required d for that is 0. Then between 0 and 3, the gap is 3. So (3)/2=1.5. Then between 3 and 5: gap is 2 → 1. Between 5 and 7: gap 2 → 1. Between 7 and 9: 2 → 1. Between 9 and 14: gap 5 → 2.5. Between 14 and 15: gap 1 → 0.5. Then the end is 15-15=0. So the maximum is 2.5. Which is the sample output. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm seems to work.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\nSort the array.\n\nInitialize max_d as 0.\n\nCheck the first lantern's position. The distance from 0 to a[0] is a[0]. So current_d = a[0]. If this is larger than max_d, update max_d.\n\nThen for each consecutive pair in the sorted array, compute the gap between them. The required d is (gap)/2. Compare with max_d and update.\n\nThen check the last lantern's position. The distance from a[-1] to l is l - a[-1]. Compare with max_d.\n\nThe maximum of all these is the answer.\n\nSo now, the code steps.\n\nRead n and l. Then read the list of a_i. Sort them.\n\nHandle edge cases: when n=0? Well, according to input constraints, n is at least 1. So no problem.\n\nNow code:\n\nIn Python:\n\nRead input: first line is n and l. Second line is the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nCompute initial max_d as a[0].\n\nThen for i in 1 to n-1:\n\ngap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n\ncurrent_d = gap / 2.0\n\nif current_d > max_d: update.\n\nThen compute the end part: l - a[-1]. Compare with max_d.\n\nThe answer is the maximum of all these.\n\nBut wait, what if the first lantern is not at 0? For example, if the first lantern is at position 3, then the initial d is 3, which is the distance from 0 to the first lantern. Because the lantern's coverage needs to reach 0. So the required d must be at least that.\n\nSimilarly for the end. So yes.\n\nSo code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\n# first part\nmax_d = a[0]\n\n# between lanterns\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\n# last part\nend_part = l - a[-1]\nif end_part > max_d:\n    max_d = end_part\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but what if the lanterns are already covering the entire street? For example, if n=1, l=5, and the lantern is at 5. Then the initial part is a[0] =5, which is the distance from 0 to 5. The end_part is 5 -5 =0. So max_d is 5. Which is correct. Because the lantern's coverage is from 5 -5=0 to 5+5=10. So the street from 0 to 5 is covered.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, lanterns at 0 and 5. Then the initial part is 0, the gap between 0 and 5 is 5, divided by 2 is 2.5. The end part is 0. So max_d is 2.5. Which is correct. Because each lantern covers up to 2.5 from their positions. So 0's coverage is from 0-2.5 to 0+2.5, which is -2.5 to 2.5. But the street starts at 0. So the coverage from 0 to 2.5. The other lantern covers from 5-2.5=2.5 to 5+2.5=7.5. So together they cover the entire street.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code seems to handle that.\n\nWait, but in the first step, when the first lantern is at 0, the initial max_d is 0. Which is correct. Because the first lantern's coverage starts at 0 -d. If d is 0, then it covers 0. But if the first lantern is at 0, then the initial part is 0. But if there is a gap between 0 and the next lantern, then that would be handled by the between lanterns step.\n\nBut let's take the case where the first lantern is at 0, and the next is at 3. Then the initial max_d is 0. Then the gap between 0 and 3 is 3, so current is 1.5. So the max_d becomes 1.5. Then the end part is l - a[-1]. So if l is 5, then end_part is 5 -3=2. So the max_d would be 2. So the answer is 2. Which is correct. Because the first lantern covers from 0 -d to 0 +d. So if d is 2, then 0-2 is -2, but the street starts at 0. So the coverage is 0 to 2. The second lantern is at 3, and covers 3-2=1 to 3+2=5. So the entire street from 0 to 5 is covered. So yes, the code returns 2. Which is correct.\n\nBut in this case, the code's initial step is a[0] =0, but that's not the max_d. Because the code sets max_d to a[0], which is 0. Then in the between lanterns step, the code computes 1.5, which is higher. Then the end_part is 5 -3 =2, which is higher. So the max is 2.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nAnother case: if the first lantern is at 0, and the next is at 1, and l is 2. Then the initial max_d is 0. Between lanterns, gap is 1, so 0.5. Then end_part is 2 -1 =1. So the max is 1. So the answer is 1. Which is correct. The first lantern covers 0-1 to 0+1=1. The second covers 1-1=0 to 1+1=2. So the entire street is covered. So yes.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, what about when there are multiple lanterns at the same position? For example, n=3, l=5, and lanterns at 0, 0, 0. Then the sorted array is [0,0,0]. The initial max_d is 0. Between lanterns, the gaps are 0 and 0. So no change. End_part is 5 -0 =5. So the answer is 5. Which is correct. Because the lanterns are at 0, and the coverage must reach 5. So d must be 5. So the code returns that.\n\nAnother case: n=1, l=10. Lantern is at 5. Then the initial max_d is 5 (distance from 0 to 5). The end_part is 10 -5 =5. So the max is 5. Which is correct. Because the lantern's coverage must reach 0 and 10. So d must be 5. So the code returns 5.\n\nSo the code seems to handle all cases.\n\nNow, let's test the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input:\n\n7 15\n\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0 → sorted is [0,3,5,7,9,14,15]\n\nmax_d starts as 0.\n\nBetween lanterns:\n\n3-0 =3 → 1.5 → max_d is 1.5.\n\nThen 5-3=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 7-5=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 9-7=2 → 1.0 → no change.\n\nThen 14-9=5 → 2.5 → new max.\n\nThen 15-14=1 → 0.5 → no change.\n\nEnd_part is 15-15=0. So the max is 2.5. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n2 5\n\n2 5 → sorted [2,5]\n\ninitial max_d is 2.\n\nBetween lanterns: 5-2=3 → 1.5. So max_d remains 2.\n\nend_part is 5-5=0. So max_d is 2. Which matches the sample.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nNow, code-wise, the code should handle all cases. But wait, in Python, when you read the input, the second line is the list of a_i. So for example, in the first sample input, the second line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'.\n\nSo the code reads that as a list of integers, sorts them.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to print the answer with 10 decimal digits. So the format string is needed.\n\nBut in Python, when you print using format, it will round the number. For example, if the actual value is 2.5, it will print 2.5000000000. Which is correct.\n\nBut what about cases where the required d is something like 2.5, but due to floating point precision, it's stored as 2.499999999999999...? Well, since the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-9, using floating point calculations should be sufficient. However, in Python, when dealing with divisions, perhaps using floating points is okay.\n\nBut in the code, all the calculations are done with floating points. For example, the code uses a[0] as an integer, but in the initial step, max_d is set to a[0], which is an integer. But when comparing with other values, which are floats, it's okay.\n\nBut in Python, when you do division, it returns a float. So the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead the input, sort, compute the max_d as described.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut wait, in the first step, the code sets max_d to a[0], which is an integer. But when we compare with other values, which are floats, that's okay. For example, if a[0] is 0, then the initial max_d is 0.0? Well, in Python, if a[0] is 0 (integer), then max_d is 0.0 (float) after assignment. Because in Python, when you assign a float to a variable, it's a float. But in the code, the initial max_d is set as a[0], which is an integer. Then, when we do comparisons with other floats, it's okay.\n\nBut perhaps, to avoid issues, it's better to cast to float. For example, in the code, the initial max_d is set to a[0], but a[0] could be an integer. So, for example, in the first sample input, a[0] is 0, which is integer. Then, when we compute the between steps, we have floats. So the code would compare 0 (int) with 1.5 (float). But in Python, that's okay. However, when the code is written, the variables are of type float. But in Python, it's possible to have a mix of int and float. So the code should be okay.\n\nBut perhaps, to make sure, we can initialize max_d as a float. For example, in the code:\n\nmax_d = 0.0\n\nThen, the first step is:\n\nmax_d = a[0] (but a[0] is an integer). So, for example, if a[0] is 3, then max_d is 3.0. But in Python, when you assign an integer to a float variable, it's converted. So that's okay.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nTesting for the sample input.\n\nNow, code:\n\nBut in the first sample input, the first lantern is 0, so the initial max_d is 0. Then the between steps are processed. Then the end_part is 0. So the maximum is 2.5.\n\nSo the code outputs 2.5000000000.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, what about when the lanterns are at the ends?\n\nFor example, n=1, l=10, a=[0]. Then the initial max_d is 0. The end_part is 10-0 =10. So the answer is 10. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: n=1, l=10, a=[10]. Then the initial max_d is 10 (since a[0] is 10). The end_part is 0. So the answer is 10. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nAnother case: n=3, l=10, a = [0, 5, 10]. Then the initial max_d is 0. Between 0 and 5: gap 5, so 2.5. Between 5 and 10: gap 5, so 2.5. end_part is 0. So the max is 2.5. Which is correct.\n\nSo the code returns 2.5.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, the code needs to read the input correctly. Let's see.\n\nThe input is given as two lines. The first line contains n and l. The second line contains n integers.\n\nBut in the sample input given in the problem, the first input is:\n\n['7 15\\n15 5 3 7 9 14 0', '2 5\\n2 5']\n\nWait, the user provided two test cases. But the code is supposed to read from stdin. So for example, when the code is run, the input is read as two lines. But for the problem, the code must process one test case per run. So the code is written to read one test case.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, in the code, the input is read as:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\n\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nBut the code must read two lines. For example, for the first sample input, the first line is '7 15', then the second line is '15 5 3 7 9 14 0'.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, code:\n\nNow, write the code.\n\nBut in Python, the code may have to handle very large numbers, but since the code is using integers and floats, it's okay.\n\nSo the code:\n\nRead n and l.\n\nRead the list of a_i.\n\nSort the list.\n\nInitialize max_d as a[0].\n\nThen loop through the consecutive elements.\n\nThen check the end part.\n\nFinally, print the max_d with 10 decimal digits.\n\nSo the code:\n\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = a[0]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nend_part = l - a[-1]\nif end_part > max_d:\n    max_d = end_part\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n\nWait, but in Python, when you print a float, it may have trailing zeros. For example, 2.5 is printed as 2.5000000000. Which is correct.\n\nBut what if the maximum is an integer? For example, in the second sample input, the code returns 2.0, which is printed as 2.0000000000. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nBut what about cases where the max_d is something like 2.5, but due to floating point precision, it's stored as 2.499999999999999...? How to avoid that?\n\nBut in Python, when using floating points, the division is done with exactness for numbers that can be represented as binary fractions. However, for numbers like 2.5, which is 5/2, it's exactly representable. However, for numbers that cannot be represented exactly, there might be some error. However, the problem allows for absolute or relative error up to 1e-9, so using floating point calculations is acceptable.\n\nBut in the code, the calculation is done using floating points. So the code is correct.\n\nBut perhaps, in some cases, the maximum is computed as a float, but when printed, it's rounded correctly. For example, in the case of 2.5, the code would print 2.5000000000.\n\nThus, the code is correct.\n\nNow, testing the code with the sample input.\n\nSample input 2: 2 5, lanterns at 2 and 5. The code sorts them as [2,5]. The initial max_d is 2. Then the gap between 2 and 5 is 3, divided by 2 is 1.5. So max_d remains 2. The end_part is 5-5=0. So the output is 2.0000000000. Correct.\n\nAnother sample input: n=1, l=5, a=[3]. The code sets max_d to 3. Then the end_part is 5-3=2. So the max is 3. So output is 3.0000000000. Correct.\n\nAnother case: n=2, l=5, a=[0,5]. The initial max_d is 0. The gap between 0 and 5 is 5 → 2.5. The end_part is 5-5=0. So the max is 2.5. Output is 2.5000000000.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, the code should be correct.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum radius $ d $ that lanterns must have to ensure that the entire street is illuminated. The street is represented as a line segment from 0 to $ l $, and there are $ n $ lanterns placed at various positions along this segment.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Sort the Lantern Positions**: First, we sort the positions of the lanterns to simplify the calculation of gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Calculate Initial Coverage**: The first lantern's position determines the initial coverage from the start of the street (0) to its position. This gives us the initial candidate for the minimum radius $ d $.\n3. **Calculate Gaps Between Consecutive Lanterns**: For each pair of consecutive lanterns, compute the gap between them. The required radius to cover this gap is half the size of the gap, as the light from each lantern can extend halfway towards the other lantern.\n4. **Check Coverage at the End of the Street**: Finally, check the distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (position $ l $) to ensure this area is covered.\n\nThe minimum radius $ d $ needed is the maximum value obtained from the initial coverage, the gaps between consecutive lanterns, and the coverage at the end of the street.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nn, l = map(int, input().split())\na = list(map(int, input().split()))\na.sort()\n\nmax_d = a[0]\n\nfor i in range(1, n):\n    gap = a[i] - a[i-1]\n    current = gap / 2.0\n    if current > max_d:\n        max_d = current\n\nend_part = l - a[-1]\nif end_part > max_d:\n    max_d = end_part\n\nprint(\"{0:.10f}\".format(max_d))\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Sorting the Lantern Positions**: Sorting helps in easily determining the gaps between consecutive lanterns.\n2. **Initial Coverage Check**: The first lantern's position from the start of the street (0) is checked to ensure the beginning of the street is covered.\n3. **Gap Calculation**: For each consecutive pair of lanterns, the gap between them is calculated. The required radius to cover this gap is half the gap size, ensuring the light from both lanterns meets in the middle.\n4. **End Coverage Check**: The distance from the last lantern to the end of the street (position $ l $) is checked to ensure the end of the street is covered.\n\nBy considering all these factors, the solution efficiently computes the minimum radius $ d $ required to illuminate the entire street, ensuring the result meets the precision requirements.",
