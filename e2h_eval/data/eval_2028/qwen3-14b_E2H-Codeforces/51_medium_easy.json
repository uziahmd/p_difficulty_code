Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is an easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two names: the guest's name and the host's name. So, the idea is that when you combine the letters from the first two lines (guest and host), the total count of each letter should exactly match the count in the third line (the pile). If there are any extra letters in the pile or missing letters, the answer is NO.\n\nSo, the approach here is to count the frequency of each character in the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile. Then, check if the sum of the counts from the first two equals the counts in the pile.\n\nLet me think about how to implement this in Python.\n\nFirst, I need to read three lines of input. Then, for each of the three lines, I can count the characters. For the first two lines, I can combine them into one string and then compare their combined character counts with the third line's counts.\n\nWait, right. So, the combined count of guest + host should equal the count of the pile. So, for each character in the combined guest and host names, the count must be exactly the same as in the pile.\n\nHow to do this in Python?\n\nI can use the collections.Counter class. For example:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen, combine guest and host into one string, create a Counter for that, and create a Counter for the pile. Then, check if the two Counters are equal.\n\nWait, but Counter has a feature where if you add two Counters, it sums the counts. So, maybe:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest_counter = Counter(guest)\nhost_counter = Counter(host)\ncombined = guest_counter + host_counter\npile_counter = Counter(pile)\n\nif combined == pile_counter:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nYes, that seems right. Because adding two Counters in Python gives a new Counter where each element's count is the sum of the counts from the two original Counters. Then comparing to the pile's Counter would check if all counts match.\n\nBut wait, what about if there are letters in the pile that are not present in the combined guest and host? For example, if the pile has an extra letter, then the Counter would have that key with a count of 1, but the combined Counter would not have that key. So comparing the two Counters would catch that.\n\nYes. Because Counter objects compare element-wise. So if any element's count differs between the two, they are not equal.\n\nSo this approach should work.\n\nBut let me think about some test cases.\n\nTake the first example:\n\nInput lines:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined guest and host is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count letters.\n\nBut the pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Wait, perhaps the counts are same.\n\nBut the code would check that.\n\nAnother example: second input is PAPAINOEL and JOULUPUKKI. Combined letters should be PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. The pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's see: the combined count for 'P' would be 2 (from PAPAINOEL) plus 0 (from JOULUPUKKI?), wait let me check.\n\nWait guest is PAPAINOEL. Let's count letters:\n\nP: 2, A: 2, I: 1, N: 1, O: 1, E: 1, L: 1.\n\nHost is JOULUPUKKI: J:1, O:1, U:2, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts for P: 2+1=3?\n\nWait, the combined count for P would be 2 (from guest) + 1 (from host) = 3?\n\nBut the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the letters in the pile. Let's see:\n\nLetters in pile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count P's here. Let's see:\n\nLooking for P's: J O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nWait, there's two P's? Or maybe three?\n\nWait the pile is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\".\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nSo the letters:\n\nP appears in positions: 6th (P), then later at position 14 (P?), let me count:\n\nLet me write the string as:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I\n\nSo that's J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I. So two P's? Or maybe three?\n\nWait the original input for the second example is:\n\n['PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI']\n\nSo the third line is \"JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\".\n\nLet me count the letters in that third line:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nBreaking down:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I\n\nSo the letters:\n\nJ: 1\n\nO: 2 (positions 2 and 9?)\n\nWait:\n\nLet me count each character:\n\nJ: 1\n\nO: appears in position 2, then again in position 9 (assuming the string is as written). Let me count:\n\nOriginal string: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nLet me split into individual letters:\n\nJ, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nSo O occurs in position 2, then again at position 9. So that's two O's.\n\nP occurs at position 7 and 15. So two P's.\n\nBut the combined guest and host's P count is 2 (from guest) + 1 (from host) = 3. So in the pile, there's only two P's. Hence, the code would detect that and return NO. Which matches the example.\n\nSo the code would correctly output NO for that case.\n\nAnother example: third input is BABBONATALE, FATHERCHRISTMAS, and the pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me check the counts.\n\nThe guest is BABBONATALE: letters B: 2, A: 2, etc. Host is FATHERCHRISTMAS. Combined counts: let's see.\n\nBut the pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me check for letters. For example, the combined guest and host have certain counts, but the pile may have an extra L.\n\nSo the code would catch that.\n\nSo the approach of using Counter seems correct.\n\nNow, what about the edge cases?\n\nWhat if the guest and host have zero length? But according to the problem statement, all lines are non-empty. So no need to handle that.\n\nAnother case: when the pile is exactly the combination. So the code returns YES.\n\nAnother case: when the pile has more letters than the combination. For example, if the pile has an extra letter. Then the Counter would have that letter's count higher than the combined count. So the comparison would fail.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to read three lines from input. But in Python, input() reads lines from stdin. However, sometimes when reading from files, there might be trailing newlines, but in the problem statement, each line is given as per the input. So, for example, the input is three lines, each line being the guest, host, and pile.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nRead three lines, stripping any whitespace (like newlines). But the problem says that the input consists of three lines. So, perhaps:\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\nBut in some cases, the input may have leading or trailing whitespaces? No, the problem says that all lines consist of uppercase letters and are not empty. So the .strip() is safe. But perhaps, better to use input().strip() to avoid any leading/trailing whitespace, even though the problem says that they are not present.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = Counter(guest) + Counter(host)\npile_counter = Counter(pile)\n\nif combined == pile_counter:\n    print(\"YES\")\nelse:\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nWait, but in Python, when you add two Counter objects, it's equivalent to adding their counts. So yes.\n\nBut what about if a letter is present in both guest and host? For example, if guest has 'A' once and host has 'A' once, then combined would have 2, and pile must have 2.\n\nYes.\n\nThis code should handle all cases.\n\nLet me test the sample inputs.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nSANTACLAUS\nDEDMOROZ\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined guest and host: SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's count letters.\n\nThe pile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS.\n\nWait, but the code will check if the combined Counter equals the pile's Counter.\n\nAssuming that the combined counts are same as pile's counts, then it returns YES.\n\nSample Output is YES.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\nPAPAINOEL\nJOULUPUKKI\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined counts: guest is PAPAINOEL (letters: P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L → counts: P:2, A:2, I:1, N:1, O:1, E:1, L:1).\n\nHost is JOULUPUKKI → J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I → counts: J:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined counts: P: 2+1=3, A:2, I:1+1=2, N:1, O:1+1=2, E:1, L:1+1=2, J:1, U:3, K:2, etc.\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → let's count letters.\n\nBut according to the example, the pile is missing one P and has an extra L. Let's see:\n\nIn the pile, the letters are:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nCounting P's: there are two P's (positions 7 and 15?), but combined counts have 3. So the pile's P count is 2, which is less than 3. Hence, the code returns NO.\n\nSo the code would correctly output NO.\n\nThird sample input:\n\nBABBONATALE\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nCombined counts: guest is BABBONATALE → B:2, A:2, etc. Host is FATHERCHRISTMAS → F, A, T, H, E, R, C, H, R, I, S, T, M, A, S. Let me count letters.\n\nBut the pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let's check for the letters. For example, the combined guest and host have a certain number of L's. The pile may have an extra L.\n\nSo the code would compare the counts and find that the pile has more L's than the combined counts, thus returning NO.\n\nThus, the code should work.\n\nNow, what about when the pile is longer than the combined guest and host? For example, if the pile has more letters. For example, if guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"ABX\". Then the code would compare Counter({'A':1, 'B':1}) vs Counter({'A':1, 'B':1, 'X':1}), which are not equal. So returns NO.\n\nAnother case: pile is shorter. Same thing.\n\nSo the code handles that.\n\nTherefore, the code should be correct.\n\nNow, the problem says that the input is three lines. So, in Python, reading three lines via input().\n\nBut in some cases, when the input is read from a file, sometimes there may be leading or trailing whitespaces. But the problem says that the input lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. Therefore, the .strip() is safe. However, perhaps the problem expects that the input is read as is. For example, if a line has leading or trailing spaces (but according to the problem statement, they don't). But since the problem says that all lines consist of uppercase letters only and are not empty, we can safely read each line with input().strip().\n\nWait, but what if the input is given with trailing newlines? For example, the third line may have a newline after. But input().strip() would remove any leading/trailing whitespace, but the problem says that the lines are correct. So, perhaps using input().strip() is safe.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the input is read as-is, but in practice, when you read via input(), it reads the entire line except for the trailing newline. So, for example, if the input is 'ABC\\n', then input().strip() would be 'ABC'.\n\nBut the problem says that the input lines are not empty and contain only uppercase letters. So, the code can safely read each line with input().strip().\n\nTherefore, the code is correct.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written as a Python script that reads from stdin and outputs to stdout.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nimport sys\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\nhost = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\npile = sys.stdin.readline().strip()\n\ncombined = Counter(guest) + Counter(host)\npile_counter = Counter(pile)\n\nprint(\"YES\" if combined == pile_counter else \"NO\")\n\nWait, but sometimes, when reading lines from stdin, there could be issues if there are empty lines. But according to the problem statement, the input consists of three lines, each not empty. So, the code should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, using input() instead of sys.stdin.readline().\n\nBut in some programming contest platforms, using input() may be more straightforward.\n\nSo, the code could be written as:\n\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = Counter(guest) + Counter(host)\npile_counter = Counter(pile)\n\nprint(\"YES\" if combined == pile_counter else \"NO\")\n\nYes.\n\nBut wait, what about the case where the guest and host have letters that are not in the pile? For example, guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\". Then the code returns YES. Which is correct.\n\nAnother example: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AA\". Then combined counts are A:1, B:1. Pile counts are A:2. So the code returns NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, the code should handle all cases.\n\nTherefore, this should be the solution.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine if a pile of letters found at the door can be rearranged to form the combined names of the guest and the host. This involves checking if the frequency of each letter in the pile exactly matches the combined frequency of letters from the guest's and host's names.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Input Reading**: Read three lines from the input, which represent the guest's name, the host's name, and the pile of letters found.\n2. **Character Counting**: Use a counter to count the frequency of each character in the guest's name and the host's name. Combine these counts.\n3. **Comparison**: Compare the combined character count from the guest and host with the character count of the pile. If they match exactly, print \"YES\"; otherwise, print \"NO\".\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\nguest = input().strip()\nhost = input().strip()\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = Counter(guest) + Counter(host)\npile_counter = Counter(pile)\n\nprint(\"YES\" if combined == pile_counter else \"NO\")\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Reading Input**: The input is read line by line using `input().strip()` to ensure any leading or trailing whitespace is removed, although the problem guarantees that the input lines contain only uppercase letters and are non-empty.\n2. **Counting Characters**: Using `collections.Counter`, we count the occurrences of each character in the guest's name and the host's name. These counts are combined into a single counter.\n3. **Comparison**: The combined counter from the guest and host is compared with the counter from the pile. If both counters are identical, it means the pile contains exactly the right number of each letter needed to form the combined names of the guest and host, resulting in \"YES\". Otherwise, the answer is \"NO\".\n\nThis approach efficiently checks for the exact match of character frequencies using Python's `Counter` class, ensuring correctness and simplicity.",
