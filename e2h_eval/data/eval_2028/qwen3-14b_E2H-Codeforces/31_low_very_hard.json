Each card has a single integer. The number on the card can be positive, negative and can even be equal to zero. The only limit is, the number on each card doesn't exceed x in the absolute value.Natasha doesn't like when Vanya spends a long time playing, so she hid all of his cards. Vanya became sad and started looking for the cards but he only found n of them. Vanya loves the balance, so he wants the sum of all numbers on found cards equal to zero. On the other hand, he got very tired of looking for cards. Help the boy and say what is the minimum number of cards does he need to find to make the sum equal to zero?You can assume that initially Vanya had infinitely many cards with each integer number from  - x to x. \n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers: n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of found cards and x (1 ≤ x ≤ 1000) — the maximum absolute value of the number on a card. The second line contains n space-separated integers — the numbers on found cards. It is guaranteed that the numbers do not exceed x in their absolute value.\n\n## Output\nPrint a single number — the answer to the problem.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['3 2\\n-1 1 2', '2 3\\n-2 -2']\n\n### Output\n['1', '2']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample, Vanya needs to find a single card with number -2.In the second sample, Vanya needs to find two cards with number 2. He can't find a single card with the required number as the numbers on the lost cards do not exceed 3 in their absolute value.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards (original plus new ones) equals zero. The existing cards have numbers that don't exceed x in absolute value, and he can use any numbers from -x to x, but each card can be used only once. Wait, no—wait, the problem says that initially he had infinitely many cards with each integer from -x to x. So, he can take as many as he wants of each number, but each card he adds must be one of those numbers. But the question is to find the minimal number of cards to add so that the total sum is zero.\n\nSo first, let's think about the sum of the found cards. Let's call this sum S. We need to add some cards such that the total sum becomes zero. So the sum of the added cards must be -S. Let's denote the required sum as target = -S.\n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of cards (each between -x and x) that sum up to target. But how?\n\nLet me think about the approach. For example, if target is zero, then we don't need to add any cards. But that's only possible if the original sum was already zero. Otherwise, we need to find the minimal number of cards to reach the target.\n\nBut what's the minimal number of cards needed to reach a certain target, given that each card can contribute between -x and x?\n\nLet me think about the maximum possible sum per card. Each card can contribute up to x (if positive) or down to -x. So, for the minimal number of cards, we want to use as large as possible steps towards the target.\n\nLet me think of the target as a positive number. Suppose target is positive. Then, each card can contribute up to +x. So the minimal number of cards would be ceil(target / x). But wait, because if target is divisible by x, then exactly target/x cards. Otherwise, (target//x) + 1.\n\nBut wait, for example, target is 5 and x is 2. Then 5/2 is 2.5, so ceil is 3. Which would be 2+2+1. But since each card can be up to 2. So yes, 3 cards. But what if the target is negative? Well, same logic applies. Because if target is negative, then we can take cards with negative values. So the minimal number of cards is ceil( |target| / x ), but since each card can contribute up to x in absolute value.\n\nWait, but here's the thing: the minimal number of cards is the ceiling of (abs(target)/x). Because each card can contribute at most x towards the target. So, for example, if target is 3 and x is 2, you need two cards: 2 + 1. But wait, 2 + 1 is 3. But each card can be up to 2. So yes, two cards. So 3/2 is 1.5, ceiling is 2. Which works.\n\nBut wait, if target is 4 and x is 2, then 4/2 is 2, which is exactly two cards. So that works.\n\nSo the minimal number of cards needed is ceil( |target| / x ). But wait, what if target is zero? Then zero cards are needed. But that's a special case.\n\nBut wait, let's check the sample input.\n\nFirst sample input: the found cards are -1, 1, 2. Their sum is (-1 +1 +2) = 2. So target is -2. So the absolute value is 2. x is 2. So 2/2 = 1. So minimal number is 1. Which matches the sample output. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input: the found cards are -2, -2. Sum is -4. Target is 4. x is 3. So 4 / 3 is 1.333, ceil is 2. Which matches the sample output. So yes, that seems to work.\n\nBut wait, why can't we have a case where the target is not divisible by x, but we can get it with fewer cards?\n\nWait, suppose target is 5, x is 3. Then 5/3 is 1.666, so ceil is 2. Let's see: 3 + 2 = 5. So two cards. Yes, that's possible. So the formula holds.\n\nAnother example: target is 7, x is 3. 7/3 is 2.333, ceil is 3. Let's see: 3+3+1=7. Three cards. But 3+3+1 is three cards. So yes",
    "response": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of cards Vanya needs to find so that the sum of all found cards equals zero. The solution involves calculating the target sum needed to balance the existing cards and then determining the minimal number of cards required to achieve this target using the given constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Calculate the Current Sum**: First, compute the sum of the numbers on the found cards.\n2. **Determine Target Sum**: The target sum needed to balance the current sum is the negative of the current sum.\n3. **Handle Zero Target**: If the target sum is zero, no additional cards are needed.\n4. **Calculate Minimum Cards**: For a non-zero target sum, calculate the minimum number of cards required using the formula `ceil(abs(target) / x)`, where `x` is the maximum absolute value allowed on a card. This formula ensures that we use the maximum possible value per card to minimize the count.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport math\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input:\n        if not line.strip():\n            continue\n        n, x = map(int, line.split())\n        nums = list(map(int, input[len(input)-1].split()))\n        total = sum(nums)\n        target = -total\n        if target == 0:\n            print(0)\n            continue\n        # Calculate the minimal number of cards\n        min_cards = math.ceil(abs(target) / x)\n        print(min_cards)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The input is read from standard input and split into lines for processing.\n- **Sum Calculation**: The sum of the found cards is computed to determine the target sum needed to balance them.\n- **Target Handling**: If the target sum is zero, it means the current sum is already balanced, so no cards are needed.\n- **Minimum Cards Calculation**: Using the ceiling of the division of the absolute target sum by the maximum allowed value `x` ensures that we use the fewest cards possible, leveraging the maximum contribution each card can provide.\n\nThis approach efficiently computes the required result with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of found cards, ensuring optimal performance even for the upper constraint limits.",
