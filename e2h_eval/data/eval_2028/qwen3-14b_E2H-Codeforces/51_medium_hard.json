Santa Claus and his colleagues can take a rest and have guests at last. When two \"New Year and Christmas Men\" meet, thear assistants cut out of cardboard the letters from the guest's name and the host's name in honor of this event. Then the hung the letters above the main entrance. One night, when everyone went to bed, someone took all the letters of our characters' names. Then he may have shuffled the letters and put them in one pile in front of the door.The next morning it was impossible to find the culprit who had made the disorder. But everybody wondered whether it is possible to restore the names of the host and his guests from the letters lying at the door? That is, we need to verify that there are no extra letters, and that nobody will need to cut more letters.Help the \"New Year and Christmas Men\" and their friends to cope with this problem. You are given both inscriptions that hung over the front door the previous night, and a pile of letters that were found at the front door next morning.\n\n## Input\nThe input file consists of three lines: the first line contains the guest's name, the second line contains the name of the residence host and the third line contains letters in a pile that were found at the door in the morning. All lines are not empty and contain only uppercase Latin letters. The length of each line does not exceed 100.\n\n## Output\nPrint \"YES\" without the quotes, if the letters in the pile could be permuted to make the names of the \"New Year and Christmas Men\". Otherwise, print \"NO\" without the quotes.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\n### Output\n['YES', 'NO', 'NO']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the letters written in the last line can be used to write the names and there won't be any extra letters left.In the second sample letter \"P\" is missing from the pile and there's an extra letter \"L\".In the third sample there's an extra letter \"L\".\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let me read the problem carefully again.\n\nThe problem is about checking if a pile of letters can be exactly formed by combining the letters from two given names. So, the idea is that the combined letters of the guest's name and the host's name should exactly match the letters in the pile. No extra letters, no missing letters.\n\nSo the approach here is to check if the concatenation of the first two strings (guest and host) has exactly the same characters as the third string (the pile), with the same counts for each character.\n\nHow do I do that in Python?\n\nHmm. Well, one way is to take the first two strings, combine them into one, then check if the sorted version of that combined string is equal to the sorted version of the third string.\n\nYes, because when you sort both, if they are the same, then the counts of each character must be the same. That's a common technique for anagram problems.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Read three lines of input.\n2. Concatenate the first two lines into a single string.\n3. Check if the sorted concatenated string equals the sorted third string.\n4. If yes, output \"YES\", else \"NO\".\n\nBut wait, what about cases where the lengths are different? For example, if the combined length of guest and host is not equal to the length of the pile. Then obviously it's impossible. So maybe first check if the lengths are equal. Because if they are not, then we can immediately return \"NO\".\n\nThat's a good optimization. Because if the lengths are different, there's no way they can be permutations of each other. So first check len(guest + host) == len(pile). If not, return NO. Else, proceed to check the sorted strings.\n\nSo the code structure would be:\n\nRead guest, host, pile.\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nThat seems straightforward. Let me test this logic against the examples given.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nGuest: SANTACLAUS\n\nHost: DEDMOROZ\n\nPile: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nCombined is SANTACLAUSDEDMOROZ. Let's see the length.\n\nLet me count:\n\nSANTACLAUS is 10 letters (S A N T A C L A U S) ?\n\nWait, let me count:\n\nS (1), A (2), N (3), T (4), A (5), C (6), L (7), A (8), U (9), S (10). Yes, 10 letters.\n\nDEDMOROZ is D E D M O R O Z. Let's count: D(1), E(2), D(3), M(4), O(5), R(6), O(7), Z(8). So 8 letters. Combined length is 10 + 8 = 18.\n\nPile is SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS. Let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nS A N T A M O R O Z D E D C L A U S. Let me count:\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nSANTAMOROZ is 10 letters (S A N T A M O R O Z?), then DEDCLAUS is D E D C L A U S (8 letters). Total 18. So the lengths match.\n\nThen sorted(combined) should be same as sorted(pile). So the first example returns YES.\n\nSecond example input:\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL\n\nHost: JOULUPUKKI\n\nPile: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI\n\nCombined is PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Let's check length.\n\nPAPAINOEL is 9 letters (P A P A I N O E L). Let me count: P(1), A(2), P(3), A(4), I(5), N(6), O(7), E(8), L(9). Yes.\n\nJOULUPUKKI is J O U L U P U K K I. Let's count: J(1), O(2), U(3), L(4), U(5), P(6), U(7), K(8), K(9), I(10). So 10 letters. Combined length is 9 + 10 = 19.\n\nThe pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the letters. Let me see:\n\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let me count the letters. Let me think, but perhaps the length is 19? Let me count:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I. Let me count each character:\n\nJ (1), O (2), U (3), L (4), N (5), A (6), P (7), A (8), O (9), I (10), L (11), E (12), L (13), U (14), P (15), U (16), K (17), K (18), I (19). Yes, 19 letters. So the lengths match.\n\nBut when sorted, the combined string and the pile may differ. Let's see:\n\nThe combined string is guest + host: PAPAINOELJOULUPUKKI. Let's think about the letters.\n\nThe guest is PAPAINOEL: letters are P, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L.\n\nHost is JOULUPUKKI: J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nCombined letters:\n\nP, A, P, A, I, N, O, E, L, J, O, U, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nNow the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI. Let's think of the letters.\n\nThe pile's letters: J, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nSo when sorted, the combined and pile should be same? But according to the example, the output is NO. Why?\n\nBecause in the problem statement, the second example's output is NO. The note says that there's a missing P and an extra L.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me count the letters in the combined and the pile.\n\nCombined:\n\nLet me count each letter.\n\nGuest: PAPAINOEL → letters:\n\nP: 2, A: 2, I: 1, N: 1, O: 1, E: 1, L: 1.\n\nHost: JOULUPUKKI → J:1, O:1, U:3, L:1, P:1, K:2, I:1.\n\nCombined letters:\n\nP: 2+1=3? Wait guest has 2 P's, host has 1 P. So total P is 3?\n\nA: 2 (from guest) + 0 (host) = 2?\n\nI: 1 (guest) + 1 (host) = 2?\n\nN: 1 (guest) + 0 = 1.\n\nO: 1 (guest) + 1 (host) = 2.\n\nE: 1 (guest) + 0 = 1.\n\nL: 1 (guest) + 1 (host) = 2.\n\nJ: 1 (host).\n\nU: 3 (host).\n\nK: 2 (host).\n\nSo in the combined, letters:\n\nP:3, A:2, I:2, N:1, O:2, E:1, L:2, J:1, U:3, K:2.\n\nNow the pile is JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me count the letters in the pile.\n\nLet me write down the letters:\n\nLetters in pile:\n\nJ, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nBreaking down:\n\nJ:1\n\nO:2 (positions 2 and 9)\n\nU:3 (positions 3, 14, 16?)\n\nWait, let's count each:\n\nLetters:\n\nJ → 1\n\nO → appears in position 2, 9 → 2 times?\n\nYes.\n\nU → positions 3, 14, 16? Let me check the pile string: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI.\n\nLet me split it into individual letters:\n\nJ O U L N A P A O I L E L U P U K K I.\n\nSo letters:\n\nJ, O, U, L, N, A, P, A, O, I, L, E, L, U, P, U, K, K, I.\n\nSo U occurs at positions 3, 14, 16? Let me count:\n\nLooking at the letters:\n\n- J (1)\n- O (2)\n- U (3)\n- L (4)\n- N (5)\n- A (6)\n- P (7)\n- A (8)\n- O (9)\n- I (10)\n- L (11)\n- E (12)\n- L (13)\n- U (14)\n- P (15)\n- U (16)\n- K (17)\n- K (18)\n- I (19)\n\nSo U occurs at 3, 14, 16 → three times. So U:3.\n\nP occurs at 7, 15 → two times? Wait, 7 is P, 15 is P. So P:2?\n\nBut in the combined, P is 3. So the pile has 2 P's. That's a problem. So the combined has 3 P's, but the pile has 2. So the sorted lists would not match. Hence the output is NO.\n\nSo the code would catch that. So the code's logic is correct.\n\nThird example input:\n\nGuest: BABBONATALE\n\nHost: FATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nPile: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER\n\nCombined is BABBONATALEFATHERCHRISTMAS. Let's check the length.\n\nGuest length: BABBONATALE → let's count letters. B A B B O N A T A L E → that's 11 letters?\n\nB (1), A (2), B (3), B (4), O (5), N (6), A (7), T (8), A (9), L (10), E (11). Yes.\n\nHost: FATHERCHRISTMAS → F A T H E R C H R I S T M A S → let's count letters. Let me see:\n\nF (1), A (2), T (3), H (4), E (5), R (6), C (7), H (8), R (9), I (10), S (11), T (12), M (13), A (14), S (15). So 15 letters. Combined length is 11 + 15 = 26.\n\nPile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the letters. Let's see:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R.\n\nBut perhaps the length is longer than 26? Let me check:\n\nThe pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the letters.\n\nBreaking it down:\n\nBABCHRISTMAS → B A B C H R I S T M A S → 12 letters?\n\nThen BONATALLE → B O N A T A L L E → 8 letters?\n\nThen FATHER → F A T H E R → 6 letters. Total 12 + 8 + 6 = 26? Let me check:\n\nWait, the pile is BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER. Let me count the letters:\n\nB A B C H R I S T M A S B O N A T A L L E F A T H E R.\n\nLet me count each character. Let me think:\n\n- B (1)\n- A (2)\n- B (3)\n- C (4)\n- H (5)\n- R (6)\n- I (7)\n- S (8)\n- T (9)\n- M (10)\n- A (11)\n- S (12)\n- B (13)\n- O (14)\n- N (15)\n- A (16)\n- T (17)\n- A (18)\n- L (19)\n- L (20)\n- E (21)\n- F (22)\n- A (23)\n- T (24)\n- H (25)\n- E (26)\n- R (27) ?\n\nWait, that's 27 letters. Oh, so the combined length is 26, and the pile is 27 letters. Therefore, the code would first check the lengths and return NO. Which matches the example's output of NO.\n\nSo the code logic works for these examples.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Python.\n\nBut how to read the input?\n\nThe input is three lines. So in Python, I can read them via input().strip() three times.\n\nBut sometimes, when reading from standard input, there might be trailing newlines or other issues. So perhaps:\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\nThen combine guest and host into combined = guest + host.\n\nCheck if len(combined) != len(pile): print NO.\n\nElse, check sorted(combined) == sorted(pile). If yes, print YES else NO.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nguest = input().strip()\n\nhost = input().strip()\n\npile = input().strip()\n\ncombined = guest + host\n\nif len(combined) != len(pile):\n\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nelse:\n\n    if sorted(combined) == sorted(pile):\n\n        print(\"YES\")\n\n    else:\n\n        print(\"NO\")\n\nThat's simple. Let me test for some edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: All empty? But according to the problem statement, all lines are not empty. So no need to handle that.\n\nEdge case 2: All same letters. Like guest is \"A\", host is \"A\", pile is \"AA\". Then sorted combined is [\"A\", \"A\"], sorted pile is same. Output YES.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"A\", host is \"B\", pile is \"AB\" → YES. If pile is \"BA\" → same. If pile is \"AA\" → NO.\n\nAnother case: guest is \"AB\", host is \"CD\", pile is \"ACBD\" → sorted combined is ABCD, sorted pile is ABCD → YES.\n\nSo the code works.\n\nSo this should handle all cases.\n\nNow, looking back at the sample inputs given in the problem statement. The first sample input is:\n\n['SANTACLAUS\\nDEDMOROZ\\nSANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS', 'PAPAINOEL\\nJOULUPUKKI\\nJOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI', 'BABBONATALE\\nFATHERCHRISTMAS\\nBABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER']\n\nWait, the input is three lines. But in the example, the first input is a list of three elements. Wait, perhaps the example is written as a list of three test cases. So the actual input is three lines per test case. For example, the first test case's input is:\n\nLine 1: SANTACLAUS\n\nLine 2: DEDMOROZ\n\nLine 3: SANTAMOROZDEDCLAUS\n\nWhich would output YES.\n\nThe second test case's input is:\n\nLine 1: PAPAINOEL\n\nLine 2: JOULUPUKKI\n\nLine 3: JOULNAPAOILELUPUKKI → output NO.\n\nThird test case:\n\nLine 1: BABBONATALE\n\nLine 2: FATHERCHRISTMAS\n\nLine 3: BABCHRISTMASBONATALLEFATHER → output NO.\n\nSo the code would process each of these three test cases correctly.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nNow, implement this in Python.\n\nBut the problem says that the input is three lines. So the code reads three lines, processes them, and outputs YES or NO.\n\nSo the code is as written above.\n\nBut in the sample input given, the input is presented as a list of three elements. But that's probably just how the example is presented. The actual input is three lines.\n\nSo the code is correct.\n\nTherefore, the Python code is as follows.\n",
