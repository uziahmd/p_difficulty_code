Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this Crazy Town problem. Let's try to understand the problem first. \n\nSo, the problem is about moving between blocks (regions) divided by infinite roads in a plane. Each road is a line equation. The home and university are in different blocks, and I need to find the minimum number of steps to get from home's block to university's block. Each step allows moving between adjacent blocks that share a common border of non-zero length. \n\nHmm. The key here is to model the blocks as nodes in a graph where edges exist between adjacent blocks. Then, perform BFS to find the shortest path from the home's block to the university's block. But how do I represent the blocks? Since there are potentially an infinite number of blocks, that approach isn't feasible directly. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another way. Because each step involves crossing a road. So, the number of steps required is related to how many roads separate the home and university. Wait, but that's not necessarily true. For example, if two blocks are separated by one road, then it's one step. But if they're separated by multiple roads, perhaps the steps are determined by the number of roads that separate them. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, think about each block being represented by the set of roads that it's on one side of. But since each road divides the plane into two halves, the position of a point relative to each road determines which block it's in. So, for a given point (home or university), we can determine for each road whether it's on the positive or negative side of the line. \n\nBut how does that help? Because two blocks are adjacent if they differ by exactly one road. Because when you cross a road, you move into a neighboring block. Wait, maybe not. Because two roads can intersect, and the regions around them can be adjacent. But perhaps the adjacency between blocks depends on the parity of the number of roads that separate them. \n\nAlternatively, think of each block as being characterized by the signs of the equations of all the roads. But with n roads, there are 2^n possible combinations. However, since each road is a line, the actual number of regions is finite? No, because each new line can divide existing regions into two. But for n lines, the maximum number of regions is O(n²). However, for n=300, that would be 300^2 = 90,000 regions. But that's manageable for BFS if we can model the regions properly. \n\nBut how to represent the regions? Since each region is determined by the sign of each line equation. For example, for each road i, the home point is either on one side or the other. So, the home's region is uniquely determined by the sign of each road's equation evaluated at (x1,y1). Similarly for the university. \n\nNow, the problem reduces to finding the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed to get from the home's sign configuration to the university's sign configuration. Because each step corresponds to crossing a road, which flips the sign for that particular road. But wait, no. Because when you cross a road, you change the sign of exactly one road. But adjacent regions differ by exactly one road's sign. \n\nWait, that's a crucial insight! Suppose two regions are adjacent. Then, their sign configurations differ in exactly one road. Because crossing a road changes the sign of that road's equation. Therefore, the adjacency between regions is equivalent to differing in exactly one road's sign. \n\nSo, the problem becomes: model each region as a node, where each node is represented by the vector of signs (for each road, +1 or -1) of the equations evaluated at that point. Then, two nodes are connected if they differ in exactly one sign. \n\nBut with n up to 300, the number of possible sign configurations is 2^300, which is impossible to handle directly. That's way too big. So, this approach is not feasible. \n\nHmm. So what's another way? \n\nWait, the home and university are two points. We need to find the minimal number of steps (crossing roads) to get from the home's region to the university's region. Let's think of the problem as a graph where each node is a region, but we don't have to generate all regions. Instead, we can model the problem as a BFS where each state is the current set of signs (relative to the roads) and transitions are flipping one sign. However, even this approach is not feasible for n=300, as the state space is 2^300. \n\nBut perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think again. \n\nLet me think about the parity of the number of roads that separate the home and university. For example, suppose that for each road, the home and university are on the same side. Then, the minimal steps is zero. But that's only if they are in the same region. Otherwise, if they are in different regions, then the minimal steps depend on how many roads separate them. \n\nWait, but how can we find the minimal number of roads that need to be crossed? Because each step crosses exactly one road. So, the minimal steps is the minimal number of roads whose sign differs between home and university. But that's not correct. Because if the home and university differ in k roads, then the minimal steps is k. But that's only if there's a way to cross those roads one by one. \n\nWait, for example, imagine that the home and university differ in two roads. Then, can you cross one road, then cross another road? But maybe those two roads are not adjacent. Or perhaps the minimal steps is the number of roads where their signs differ. \n\nBut how can that be? Let me think of an example. Suppose there are two roads. The home is in a region that is on the positive side of both roads. The university is on the negative side of both roads. Then, to get from home to university, you need to cross both roads. But how? Because each step crosses one road. So, you can cross the first road, then cross the second road. So the minimal steps is 2. Which is equal to the number of differing roads. \n\nAnother example: home and university differ in one road. Then, the minimal steps is 1. \n\nAnother example: three roads. Home is on positive side of all. University is on negative side of road 1 and positive of others. Then, the differing roads is 1. So steps is 1. \n\nBut what if the home and university differ in two roads, but those two roads are not adjacent? Like, say, two parallel roads. Then, the home is on one side of both, the university on the other side of both. Then, the minimal steps is 2. \n\nSo, in general, the minimal steps required is equal to the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. Let me think again. Suppose there are two roads that cross each other. Let's say home is in a region that is on the positive side of both roads. The university is on the negative side of both. Then, you can cross one road, then cross the other. So steps is 2. Which is the number of differing roads. \n\nBut what if the home and university differ in two roads, but those roads are not crossed in sequence? Like, suppose you have three roads arranged such that the home and university differ in two roads, but there's a path that requires crossing only one road? No, that's impossible. Because each step flips exactly one road's sign. So, to get from the initial state to the target state, you need to flip exactly the roads that differ. So the minimal steps is the number of roads that differ between the two points. \n\nWait, but that's only if the differing roads can be crossed in any order. But how can that be? Because crossing a road changes your position relative to that road. But the other roads' positions are determined by their equations. \n\nWait, but the problem says that the home and university are not on any road. So for each road, the home and university are on one of the two sides. Let's compute for each road whether the home and university are on the same side or opposite sides. \n\nLet me think of the home and university as two points. For each road, compute the value of a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i. For the home point (x1,y1), let's call this value h_i. For the university (x2,y2), call it u_i. \n\nThe sign of h_i and u_i determines whether the home and university are on the same side of the road. If h_i and u_i have the same sign, then the two points are on the same side of the road. If they have opposite signs, then the road separates them. \n\nSo, the number of roads that separate the two points is the number of roads where h_i * u_i < 0. \n\nNow, the minimal steps needed is equal to the number of such roads. Because each such road must be crossed once. \n\nBut why is this the case? Because each time you cross a road, you can flip the sign of that road. So, if you have k roads separating the two points, you need to cross each of them once. \n\nBut how can you cross them in sequence? For example, suppose there are two roads that cross each other. The home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. Then, you can cross one road, then cross the other. Each step takes you through a different road. \n\nBut how can that be possible? Because after crossing the first road, you are now on the other side of that road. Then, crossing the second road would take you to the other side of that. But the problem is that the two roads cross, so the regions are arranged such that crossing one road and then another would get you to the desired region. \n\nSo, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nWait, but why is that? Let's take the example given in the problem. \n\nFirst example input:\n\nHome is (1,1), university (-1,-1). Roads are 0x +1y +0 = 0 (i.e., y=0) and 1x +0y +0=0 (x=0). \n\nFor the first road (y=0), home is at y=1, which is positive. University is at y=-1, which is negative. So this road separates them. \n\nFor the second road (x=0), home is at x=1 (positive), university at x=-1 (negative). Also separates. So total of 2 roads. Output is 2. Which matches the sample. \n\nSecond example input: home (1,1), university (-1,-1). Three roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. \n\nCheck for each road:\n\nRoad 1: x=0. Home is positive, university negative. Separates. \n\nRoad 2: y=0. Same as above. Separates. \n\nRoad 3: x + y -3 =0. For home (1+1-3) = -1. For university (-1-1-3) = -5. Both are negative. So same sign. Not separating. \n\nSo total roads separating is 2. Output is 2. Which matches the sample. \n\nSo this seems to hold. \n\nSo the answer is simply the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. \n\nWait, but how can this be? How can the minimal steps be exactly that number? Because each step crosses one road. So if there are k roads separating the two points, then you need to cross each of them once. But how can you cross them in sequence? \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the movement is allowed between blocks that share a common border. So, each step you can cross a road. So, for example, if you have two roads that cross each other, you can cross one, then cross the other. \n\nBut how do you know that there's a path that crosses each of the separating roads once? \n\nWell, think of the problem as a graph where each node is a region, and edges connect regions that are adjacent (differ by one road). The minimal steps between home and university is the minimal number of edges to traverse. \n\nBut according to the previous reasoning, the minimal steps is the number of roads separating them. \n\nBut how to prove that? \n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of linear algebra. Each road is a hyperplane. The home and university are points in the plane. The minimal number of hyperplanes that separate them is the number of hyperplanes that they are on opposite sides of. \n\nBut how to reach from home to university by crossing each of these hyperplanes once. \n\nBut since each hyperplane is a line, and the regions are connected, there must be a path that crosses each of the separating lines once. \n\nBut perhaps the answer is indeed the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nIf that's the case, the problem is very easy. For each road, compute the sign of home and university. If their product is negative, increment the count. The answer is that count. \n\nBut why is that correct? Let me think of a scenario where the home and university are separated by two roads, but the minimal steps is 1. \n\nIs that possible? \n\nSuppose two roads are parallel. Let's say home is on one side of both roads, and university is on the other side of both. Then, the number of separating roads is 2. But to get from home to university, you need to cross both roads. So steps is 2. \n\nAnother scenario: suppose there are two roads that cross each other. The home is in a region that is on the positive side of both roads. The university is on the negative side of both. To get there, you need to cross both roads. But how? \n\nImagine the roads as x=0 and y=0. The home is (1,1), university is (-1,-1). The minimal steps is 2. Which is the count. \n\nBut suppose there is a third road that is not separating. Let's say the home and university are separated by two roads. But there's a path that crosses one road twice? No, because crossing a road twice would take you back to the original side. So that's not helpful. \n\nThus, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nSo the solution is to compute for each road whether the home and university are on opposite sides. The count of such roads is the answer. \n\nBut why? How can we be sure that there's no shorter path? \n\nBecause each step can cross exactly one road. So, if there are k roads separating the two points, then you need to cross each of them once. Because each crossing flips the sign of that road. So, the minimal steps is exactly the number of roads that separate them. \n\nThis seems to be the case. \n\nSo the problem reduces to checking, for each road, whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. \n\nSo, the steps to code this would be:\n\n- Read the home and university coordinates.\n\n- Read n roads.\n\n- For each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i).\n\n- If the product of these two values is negative, increment the count.\n\n- Output the count.\n\nWait, but why is that the case? Because if the product is negative, then the two points are on opposite sides of the road. \n\nYes. Because if the value for home is positive and for university is negative, then their product is negative. Same if home is negative and university is positive. \n\nSo, the code can be written as:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor each road:\n\n    a, b, c = coefficients\n\n    val1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nBut wait, the sample input shows that this works. Let's check the first sample:\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nFor the first road (0x +1y +0=0 → y=0):\n\nval1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 = 1 → positive.\n\nval2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 → negative. product is -1 <0 → count increases by 1.\n\nSecond road: 1x +0y +0 → x=0.\n\nval1 is 1*1 +0 +0 =1 → positive.\n\nval2 is 1*(-1) +0 +0 = -1 → negative. product is -1 <0 → count increases by 1. Total count is 2 → output 2. Which matches.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0 → x=0\n\n0 1 0 → y=0\n\n1 1 -3 → x + y -3 = 0.\n\nFirst two roads are same as before, count is 2. Third road:\n\nval1 = 1*1 + 1*1 -3 = 1 +1 -3 = -1.\n\nval2 = 1*(-1) + 1*(-1) -3 = -1-1-3 = -5. Product is (-1)*(-5) = 5>0. So no increment. So total count is 2. Which matches the sample output.\n\nSo this approach works for samples. \n\nBut why is this correct? Because the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nBut why? Let's think of a scenario where the two points are separated by two roads, but there's a way to cross one road and reach the university. But that's impossible. Because if the university is separated by two roads, then you have to cross both roads. \n\nBut how can that be? For example, suppose there are two roads that cross each other, and the home and university are in opposite regions. \n\nBut in that case, the two roads are separating them. So the minimal steps is 2. \n\nBut if you cross one road, you are in a region that is on the other side of that road. But the other road may still separate you from the university. So you have to cross that as well. \n\nSo yes, the minimal steps is the number of roads separating the two points. \n\nThus, the code is straightforward. \n\nBut why is this the case? Because each road that separates the two points must be crossed once. And each crossing takes one step. \n\nTherefore, the code is correct. \n\nBut why didn't the problem mention anything about the parity or other factors? Because the problem's movement allows crossing any road, and the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the two points. \n\nSo the code is simple. \n\nNow, the code needs to read the input, process each road, compute the product of the two values, and count the number of roads where the product is negative. \n\nBut what about the case when the home and university are in the same region? Then the count is zero. \n\nBut how can that be? For example, if all roads are such that the home and university are on the same side. Then the answer is zero steps. \n\nYes. \n\nSo, the code is correct. \n\nTherefore, the Python code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the home coordinates, then the university coordinates, then n, then n lines of a, b, c. \n\nFor each line, compute val1 and val2, check if their product is negative. \n\nCount the number of such roads. \n\nPrint the count. \n\nBut wait, what about if the two points are on the same side of a road? Then, the product is positive. \n\nYes. \n\nSo the code is straightforward. \n\nNow, let's test some edge cases. \n\nEdge case 1: n=0. But according to the input constraints, n is at least 1. Wait, no. The third line says n is given as an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). Wait, no. Looking back:\n\nThe third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300). So n is at least 1. \n\nSo no need to handle n=0. \n\nAnother edge case: when a road is such that val1 is zero. But the problem says that neither home nor university lies on any road. So val1 and val2 can't be zero. \n\nSo the code can proceed safely. \n\nThus, the code is as follows:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n\n        count +=1\n\nprint(count)\n\nThat's the code. \n\nBut let me check the sample inputs again. \n\nFirst sample input:\n\nInput is:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nWhich gives count 2. Correct.\n\nSecond sample input:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nWhich gives count 2. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: home and university are separated by zero roads. For example, home (1,1), university (2,2). Roads are x + y + 1 = 0. Then, val1 = 1+1 +1 = 3, val2 = 2+2 +1 =5. product is positive. So count is zero. So output is zero. \n\nAnother case: home and university are separated by one road. So output is 1. \n\nThus, this code should work. \n\nSo the answer is to write this code. \n\nBut why is this problem considered hard? Because perhaps the initial approach would have been to model the regions as a graph and perform BFS, which is impossible for large n. But the actual solution is a simple observation. \n\nSo the code is straightforward.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads.

If two points (home and university) lie on opposite sides of a road, that road must be crossed to move from one region to another. The minimum number of steps required is equivalent to the number of roads that separate the home and university points.\n\n1. **Input Reading**: Read the coordinates of the home and university points.\n2. **Road Evaluation**: For each road, evaluate the position of both the home and university points relative to the road.\n3. **Separation Check**: Determine if the home and university points are on opposite sides of a road by checking the product of their evaluations. A negative product indicates they are on opposite sides.\n4. **Count Separating Roads**: Count the number of roads that separate the home and university points, which gives the minimum number of steps required.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\n# Read input\nx1, y1 = map(int, input().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, input().split())\nn = int(input())\n\ncount = 0\n\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, input().split())\n    val1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    val2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if val1 * val2 < 0:\n        count += 1\n\nprint(count)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university points are read first, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n- **Evaluating Points Relative to Roads**: For each road, compute the value of the line equation at both the home and university points.
