Each road is defined by the equation aix + biy + ci = 0, where ai and bi are not both equal to the zero. The roads divide the plane into connected regions, possibly of infinite space. Let's call each such region a block. We define an intersection as the point where at least two different roads intersect.Your home is located in one of the blocks. Today you need to get to the University, also located in some block. In one step you can move from one block to another, if the length of their common border is nonzero (in particular, this means that if the blocks are adjacent to one intersection, but have no shared nonzero boundary segment, then it are not allowed to move from one to another one in one step).Determine what is the minimum number of steps you have to perform to get to the block containing the university. It is guaranteed that neither your home nor the university is located on the road.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers x1, y1 ( - 106 ≤ x1, y1 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of your home.The second line contains two integers separated by a space x2, y2 ( - 106 ≤ x2, y2 ≤ 106) — the coordinates of the university you are studying at.The third line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the number of roads in the city. The following n lines contain 3 space-separated integers ( - 106 ≤ ai, bi, ci ≤ 106; |ai| + |bi| > 0) — the coefficients of the line aix + biy + ci = 0, defining the i-th road.

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this problem where I have to find the minimum number of steps to move from a home block to a university block, moving through adjacent blocks. The adjacency here is defined by sharing a common border of non-zero length. So, the problem is essentially about finding the shortest path between two regions divided by lines.\n\nFirst, I need to model the blocks and their adjacencies. But how can I represent each block? Since there are infinite regions, it's impossible to list them all. However, the key insight here is that the movement between blocks depends on crossing roads. Each time you cross a road, you move to a neighboring block. So, perhaps we can model the problem using BFS where each state represents the set of roads that we have crossed an even or odd number of times. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, think about each block as being determined by the position relative to each road. For each road, a point is either on one side or the other. Since the roads are infinite lines, each block can be represented by a sign vector: for each road, whether the point is on the positive or negative side of the line. However, since the roads are not necessarily in general position, two different sign vectors could represent the same block if they are connected through some arrangement. But maybe for the purpose of this problem, we can model each possible sign configuration as a node in a graph. Then, two nodes are connected if they differ by exactly one road's sign (i.e., crossing that road). Because moving from one block to another requires crossing exactly one road (since adjacent blocks share a common border, which is a segment of a road).\n\nBut wait, how do we know if two regions are adjacent? If two regions are separated by exactly one road, then they are adjacent. Because crossing that road would take you from one to the other. However, if two regions are separated by multiple roads, they might not be adjacent. So, the adjacency in the graph would be when two sign vectors differ in exactly one road's sign. Because that would mean that the two regions are separated by that road, hence adjacent.\n\nBut how do I compute the sign vector for the home and university positions? Let me think.\n\nEach road divides the plane into two regions. For a given point (not on the road), the sign of a_i * x + b_i * y + c_i tells us which side of the road the point is on. So for the home point, we can compute for each road whether it's positive or negative. Similarly for the university. Then, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of steps to change the sign vector of the home to that of the university, changing exactly one sign per step. Because each step corresponds to crossing a single road, which flips the sign for that road.\n\nWait, but that's not quite right. Because if you cross a road, you flip the sign for that road. So, the problem becomes similar to a graph where each node is a binary string (for each road, 0 or 1 indicating which side of the road the point is on). Two nodes are connected if they differ in exactly one bit. Then, the problem is to find the minimum number of bit flips needed to go from the home's sign vector to the university's sign vector. However, this seems like the Hamming distance between the two vectors. But that's not correct because each flip can be done in any order, but the minimal steps would be the number of differing bits. Because each differing bit can be fixed by flipping once. But wait, that would imply that the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two vectors. But why is that the case?\n\nLet me think. Suppose the home's sign vector is S and the university's is T. The Hamming distance between S and T is the number of roads where the signs differ. Each step allows you to cross a road, which changes the sign for that road. So, to reach from S to T, you need to flip each differing bit once. However, each flip is a step. Therefore, the minimal steps is the Hamming distance. But that seems too straightforward. What's the catch here?\n\nWait, no. Because when you cross a road, you can flip that bit. However, the problem is that the steps are moving between adjacent regions. Each step corresponds to crossing a road. But each crossing changes exactly one sign. So, the minimal steps required to get from S to T is indeed the Hamming distance between S and T. Because each differing bit can be fixed by crossing that road once. So, for example, if there are two differing bits, you can cross each of those roads once, and that would take two steps. However, is there a scenario where the Hamming distance is k, but you can't reach in k steps? Or maybe there's some dependency between the roads?\n\nWait, no. Because each step allows you to flip any one of the bits. So, regardless of the order, you can flip each differing bit once. Therefore, the minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two vectors.\n\nBut then why does the sample input have output 2? Let's check the first sample input.\n\nSample Input 1:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). n=2 roads: 0x+1y+0=0 (which is y=0) and 1x+0y+0=0 (x=0). \n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nFor first road (y=0): 0*1 + 1*1 +0 = 1>0 → sign is positive. So for this road, the home is on the positive side.\n\nSecond road x=0: 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1>0 → positive.\n\nSo home's sign vector is [1, 1].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nFirst road: 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → sign is -1. So for the first road, it's negative.\n\nSecond road: 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 = -1 <0 → negative. So sign vector is [-1, -1]. But since the sign vectors are stored as 0 or 1, perhaps we need to normalize them. Wait, how are we representing the signs? Let's say for each road, we compute the value of a_i x + b_i y + c_i. Since the point is not on the road, the value is non-zero. So for each road, we can represent the sign as 0 or 1, depending on whether it's positive or negative. But how?\n\nActually, for the purposes of the Hamming distance, the actual value doesn't matter, just whether it's positive or negative. So for each road, we can compute the sign (positive or negative) of the home and the university. Then, for each road, if the home and university have different signs, that contributes 1 to the Hamming distance. The minimal steps is the Hamming distance between the two vectors.\n\nIn the first sample input, the home's signs are [1,1], the university's signs are [-1,-1]. So for each road, the signs are different. Thus, Hamming distance is 2, which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nAnother sample input: the second example input is:\n\nHome (1,1), University (-1,-1). n=3 roads: x=0, y=0, x+y-3=0. Let's compute the signs for home and university.\n\nFor home (1,1):\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → 1*1 + 0*1 +0 =1>0 → positive.\n\nRoad 2: y=0 → 0*1 +1*1 +0=1>0 → positive.\n\nRoad 3: x + y -3 = 1+1-3 = -1 <0 → negative.\n\nSo home's sign vector is [1, 1, -1].\n\nUniversity (-1,-1):\n\nRoad 1: x=0 → -1 → negative.\n\nRoad 2: y=0 → -1 → negative.\n\nRoad 3: (-1) + (-1) -3 = -5 <0 → negative.\n\nSo the university's sign vector is [-1, -1, -1].\n\nComparing the two vectors:\n\nFor road 1: 1 vs -1 → different.\n\nRoad 2: 1 vs -1 → different.\n\nRoad 3: -1 vs -1 → same. So Hamming distance is 2. Which matches the sample output of 2.\n\nSo according to this reasoning, the answer is simply the Hamming distance between the two sign vectors. But why is this the case? Because each differing bit represents a road that needs to be crossed once. So the minimal steps is exactly the number of differing roads.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where you have to cross a road twice? For example, suppose there are two roads that are parallel, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. Then, the Hamming distance is 2. But perhaps you can cross one road, then cross another, which would take two steps. That's exactly the Hamming distance. So that's correct.\n\nBut what if there's a scenario where the Hamming distance is 2, but the two differing roads are not adjacent? Wait, but the roads are not necessarily adjacent. But in the BFS approach, each step is crossing any road. So regardless of which road you cross, you can flip that bit. So the minimal steps is the Hamming distance. So this seems to be the case.\n\nTherefore, the solution is to compute for each road, whether the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. The number of such roads is the answer.\n\nWait, but how can that be? Let me think again.\n\nSuppose there are two roads, and home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. Then, the answer would be 2. But how can you cross both roads? Because each step crosses one road. So you can cross the first road, then cross the second road. So two steps. Which matches the Hamming distance.\n\nBut what if there are three roads, and the home and university are on opposite sides of all three. Then, the answer would be 3 steps. But perhaps there's a way to cross roads in a way that allows you to reach the university in fewer steps? No, because each step can only cross one road. So you have to cross each of the three roads once. Hence, three steps.\n\nSo the answer is indeed the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nSo the problem reduces to, for each road, check if the home and university are on different sides. Count the number of such roads, and that's the answer.\n\nWait, but that's a very simple solution. How come the problem is labeled as hard? Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that you can move from one block to another if the length of their common border is non-zero. So, two blocks are adjacent if they share a common segment of a road. But in terms of sign vectors, two regions that differ in exactly one road's sign are adjacent. Because they are separated by that road. So, moving from one to the other requires crossing that road. Hence, the minimal steps is the Hamming distance.\n\nBut why is that the case? Because the Hamming distance gives the number of roads that need to be crossed. Each step crosses one road. So the minimal steps is the number of differing roads.\n\nBut why can't there be a case where crossing a road more than once is needed? For example, if you have a loop of roads. But the problem states that the home and university are not on any road. So, for example, imagine that the home and university are on the same side of all roads except for two roads. But those two roads are arranged in a way that crossing one road and then another would take you to the university. But that's exactly two steps. Which is the Hamming distance.\n\nSo, the conclusion is that the answer is the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nBut how to compute that?\n\nFor each road, compute the value of (a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i) and (a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i). If their product is negative, then the home and university are on opposite sides of that road. So, count the number of such roads.\n\nYes! That's the approach. So the code can be written as follows:\n\nRead the home coordinates (x1, y1), the university coordinates (x2, y2), then read n roads. For each road, compute f1 = a_i * x1 + b_i * y1 + c_i, f2 = a_i * x2 + b_i * y2 + c_i. If f1 * f2 < 0, then increment the count. Finally, output that count.\n\nWait, but why is that correct?\n\nBecause if f1 and f2 have opposite signs, then the home and university are on opposite sides of the road. Thus, that road is part of the path between the two blocks. Hence, the minimal steps is the number of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because each such road must be crossed once. And since each step allows crossing exactly one road, the minimal steps is the number of such roads.\n\nBut why can't there be overlapping roads that allow for shorter paths?\n\nWait, for example, suppose there are two roads, and the home and university are on opposite sides of both roads. Then, the minimal steps is 2. But if you cross one road, then cross the other, that's two steps. So yes.\n\nBut what if there's a scenario where the home and university are on opposite sides of two roads, but those roads are arranged in such a way that crossing one road takes you to a region that is adjacent to the university? No, because if the university is on the opposite side of both roads, then after crossing one road, you are on the other side of that road. But the university is on the opposite side of the other road. So you need to cross that other road as well. Hence, two steps.\n\nSo the minimal steps is indeed the count of roads that separate the home and university.\n\nBut why is this the case? Because each such road must be crossed once. Because the home and university are in different regions, and the regions are separated by those roads. So, the minimal steps is the number of roads separating them.\n\nThus, the solution is to count the number of roads where the home and university are on opposite sides. So the code is straightforward.\n\nLet me test this against the sample inputs.\n\nSample 1: 2 roads. For each road, check if the product is negative.\n\nFirst road: 0x +1y +0 =0. For home (1,1): 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. For university (-1,-1): 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1. Product is 1 * (-1) = -1 <0. So count +=1.\n\nSecond road: 1x +0y +0=0. Home: 1*1 +0 +0 =1. University: 1*(-1) =-1. Product is -1. So count +=1. Total 2. Output is 2. Correct.\n\nSample 2: 3 roads. Check for each road.\n\nRoad 1: 1x +0y +0=0. For home (1,1): 1*1 +0 +0 =1. University (-1,-1): -1. Product -1. So count +=1.\n\nRoad 2: 0x +1y +0=0. Home: 1. University: -1. Product -1. count +=1.\n\nRoad 3: 1x +1y -3 =0. Home: 1+1-3 =-1. University: -1 + (-1) -3 = -5. Product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0. So no count. Total count is 2. Output 2. Correct.\n\nSo the sample inputs are handled correctly.\n\nAnother test case: suppose home and university are on the same side of all roads. Then the answer is 0. Which makes sense, since they are in the same block.\n\nAnother test case: one road. Suppose home is on one side, university on the other. Answer is 1. Which is correct.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to counting the number of roads where home and university are on opposite sides.\n\nThus, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\nRead x1, y1.\n\nRead x2, y2.\n\nRead n.\n\nRead n lines of a, b, c.\n\nInitialize count to 0.\n\nFor each road:\n\nCompute f1 = a*x1 + b*y1 + c.\n\nCompute f2 = a*x2 + b*y2 + c.\n\nIf f1 * f2 < 0, increment count.\n\nFinally, print count.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the home and university are not located on any road. So f1 and f2 are non-zero. So no division by zero issues.\n\nYes.\n\nThus, this is the solution.\n\nBut why was the problem considered hard? Because perhaps the initial approach would have been to model the regions and perform BFS, which is complicated. But the actual solution is much simpler. So the problem is a trick question, where the answer is the number of roads separating the two points.\n\nTherefore, the code is straightforward.\n\nNow, let's implement this in Python.\n\nRead input:\n\nBut note that the input may be given as multiple lines. For example, the first sample input is given as:\n\n['1 1\\n-1 -1\\n2\\n0 1 0\\n1 0 0', '1 1\\n-1 -1\\n3\\n1 0 0\\n0 1 0\\n1 1 -3']\n\nWait, the input is read from stdin, but the user provided the input as a list of strings. However, in the actual code, the input is read via standard input. So the code should read from stdin.\n\nBut in the problem description, the input is given as:\n\nThe first line contains two integers x1, y1.\n\nThe second line contains two integers x2, y2.\n\nThird line contains n.\n\nThen n lines with a_i, b_i, c_i.\n\nSo the code should read these lines.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead x1, y1 from input.\n\nRead x2, y2 from input.\n\nRead n.\n\nThen read n lines of a, b, c.\n\nThen for each line, compute f1 and f2.\n\nCount the number of roads where f1 * f2 < 0.\n\nOutput that count.\n\nSo, the code in Python would be:\n\nRead the first line as x1, y1.\n\nRead the second line as x2, y2.\n\nRead third line as n.\n\nThen read n lines, each with a, b, c.\n\nThen compute count.\n\nBut how to read input? For example, in Python, the input can be read via input() function, but sometimes when multiple lines are given, it's better to read via sys.stdin.\n\nBut for the code submission, the code needs to read from stdin.\n\nSo the code:\n\nimport sys\n\nx1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nx2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\nn = int(sys.stdin.readline())\ncount = 0\nfor _ in range(n):\n    a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n    f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n    if f1 * f2 < 0:\n        count +=1\nprint(count)\n\nThat's the code. Let's check the sample input.\n\nSample 1:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n2\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 0\n\nProcessing:\n\nFor first road: a=0, b=1, c=0.\n\nf1 = 0*1 +1*1 +0 =1.\n\nf2 = 0*(-1) +1*(-1) +0 =-1.\n\nproduct is -1 <0 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: a=1, b=0, c=0.\n\nf1 = 1*1 +0*1 +0 =1.\n\nf2 = 1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1. product is -1 → count +=1. total 2. Output 2.\n\nSample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n1 1\n\n-1 -1\n\n3\n\n1 0 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 -3\n\nFirst road: a=1, b=0, c=0.\n\nf1 =1*1 +0*1 +0 =1.\n\nf2 =1*(-1) +0*(-1) +0 =-1 → product -1 → count +=1.\n\nSecond road: a=0, b=1, c=0. f1=0*1 +1*1 +0 =1. f2=0*(-1) +1*(-1)+0 =-1. product -1 → count +=1.\n\nThird road: a=1, b=1, c=-3. f1 =1*1 +1*1 -3 = 2-3 =-1. f2 =1*(-1) +1*(-1) -3 = -2-3 =-5. product is (-1)*(-5) =5>0 → no count. total 2. Output 2. Correct.\n\nThus, the code works for samples.\n\nBut why is the problem considered hard? Because perhaps the initial approach would involve complex modeling of regions and BFS, but the actual solution is very simple. So this problem is a good example of how thinking about the problem in terms of the properties of the regions and their separation can lead to an optimal solution.\n\nTherefore, the code is as written above.\n",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of steps required to move from a home block to a university block in a city divided by infinite line roads.

Each road that separates these points contributes to the minimum number of steps required.\n2. **Key Insight**: For each road, if the home and university points lie on opposite sides of the road, the product of their respective evaluations of the road equation will be negative. This indicates that the road separates them.\n3. **Algorithm**: \n   - Read the coordinates of the home and university.\n   - Read the number of roads and their coefficients.\n   - For each road, evaluate the position of the home and university points relative to the road.\n   - Count the number of roads where the points are on opposite sides.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    x1, y1 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    x2, y2 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    count = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        a, b, c = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        f1 = a * x1 + b * y1 + c\n        f2 = a * x2 + b * y2 + c\n        if f1 * f2 < 0:\n            count += 1\n    print(count)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Reading Input**: The coordinates of the home and university are read first, followed by the number of roads and their coefficients.\n- **Evaluating Road Separation**: For each road, the values of the linear equation at the home and university points are computed. If the product of these values is negative, it indicates that the points are on opposite sides of the road, thus contributing to the count of separating roads.\n- **Output**: The count of such separating roads is printed, which directly gives the minimum number of steps required to move from the home block to the university block.\n\nThis approach efficiently determines the solution by leveraging the properties of linear equations and their evaluations at given points, ensuring an optimal and straightforward solution.",
