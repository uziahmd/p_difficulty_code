He is now called Shapur, His majesty King of kings of Iran and Aniran.Recently the Romans declared war on Persia. They dreamed to occupy Armenia. In the recent war, the Romans were badly defeated. Now their senior army general, Philip is captured by Shapur and Shapur is now going to capture Valerian, the Roman emperor.Being defeated, the cowardly Valerian hid in a room at the top of one of his castles. To capture him, Shapur has to open many doors. Fortunately Valerian was too scared to make impenetrable locks for the doors.Each door has 4 parts. The first part is an integer number a. The second part is either an integer number b or some really odd sign which looks like R. The third one is an integer c and the fourth part is empty! As if it was laid for writing something. Being extremely gifted, after opening the first few doors, Shapur found out the secret behind the locks.c is an integer written in base a, to open the door we should write it in base b. The only bad news is that this R is some sort of special numbering system that is used only in Roman empire, so opening the doors is not just a piece of cake!Here's an explanation of this really weird number system that even doesn't have zero:Roman numerals are based on seven symbols: a stroke (identified with the letter I) for a unit, a chevron (identified with the letter V) for a five, a cross-stroke (identified with the letter X) for a ten, a C (identified as an abbreviation of Centum) for a hundred, etc.: I=1 V=5 X=10 L=50 C=100 D=500 M=1000Symbols are iterated to produce multiples of the decimal (1, 10, 100, 1, 000) values, with V, L, D substituted for a multiple of five, and the iteration continuing: I 1, II 2, III 3, V 5, VI 6, VII 7, etc., and the same for other bases: X 10, XX 20, XXX 30, L 50, LXXX 80; CC 200, DCC 700, etc. At the fourth and ninth iteration, a subtractive principle must be employed, with the base placed before the higher base: IV 4, IX 9, XL 40, XC 90, CD 400, CM 900.Also in bases greater than 10 we use A for 10, B for 11, etc.Help Shapur capture Valerian and bring peace back to Persia, especially Armenia.\n\n## Input\nThe first line contains two integers a and b (2 ≤ a, b ≤ 25). Only b may be replaced by an R which indicates Roman numbering system.The next line contains a single non-negative integer c in base a which may contain leading zeros but its length doesn't exceed 103. It is guaranteed that if we have Roman numerals included the number would be less than or equal to 300010 and it won't be 0. In any other case the number won't be greater than 101510.\n\n## Output\nWrite a single line that contains integer c in base b. You must omit leading zeros.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['10 2\\n1', '16 R\\n5', '5 R\\n4', '2 2\\n1111001', '12 13\\nA']\n\n### Output\n['1', 'V', 'IV', '1111001', 'A']\n\n## Note\nYou can find more information about roman numerals here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a hard question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's read the problem carefully.\n\nSo, the problem is about converting a number from base a to base b, where b could be Roman numerals. The input gives me a and b (with b possibly being 'R'), and then a number c in base a. My job is to convert c to base b, handling Roman numerals when needed.\n\nLet me break down the steps:\n\nFirst, I need to parse the input. The first line has a and b. The second line is the number c in base a. But for the case when b is 'R', I have to convert the number to Roman numerals. Otherwise, it's a regular base conversion.\n\nSo the plan is:\n\n1. Convert the input number c (which is in base a) to a decimal integer.\n2. Then, if b is not 'R', convert that decimal integer to base b.\n3. If b is 'R', convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals.\n\nBut wait, how do I handle the conversion from base a to decimal? The input c can be up to 10^3 digits long. For example, if a is 2 and c is 1111001 (as in one of the examples), which is 1*2^6 + ... etc. So I need to process this correctly.\n\nBut for very large numbers, converting directly using int() may not be feasible because Python can handle big integers, but perhaps the input is up to 10^3 digits, which for a base up to 25 would be a very big number. However, since the problem says that when Roman numerals are involved, the number is <= 3000 in decimal. Otherwise, it's up to 1e15. So for cases where the output isn't Roman, the number can be up to 1e15, which is manageable in Python.\n\nSo step 1: Convert c (base a) to decimal.\n\nHow to do that?\n\nFor each digit in the string c, we can compute its value. For example, if the digit is 'A', it represents 10, 'B' 11, etc. So the digits can be letters (uppercase?), but the problem says that in the input, the c may contain letters? Wait, the input says that c is given as a string in base a. So for bases larger than 10, digits beyond 9 are represented as letters. For example, in base 12, the digits are 0-9, A (for 10), B (for 11). So the input c may have letters in it, like 'A' in the example where the input is 12 13 and c is A, which is 10 in base 12, converted to base 13 which is A again.\n\nSo the first step is to process the input string c into a decimal integer. Let's think about how to do that.\n\nFor each character in the string, we need to find its value. For example, '0' is 0, '1' is 1, ..., '9' is 9, 'A' is 10, 'B' 11, etc. So for a given character, we can convert it to its numerical value. So, for example, the function to convert a character to its value is: if it's a digit, then int(c), else ord(c) - ord('A') + 10.\n\nBut the input c may have letters, but the problem says that when the input is for Roman numerals, the number is non-zero and less than or equal to 3000. But in other cases, the number can be up to 1e15. So during the conversion from base a to decimal, we need to process the string correctly.\n\nSo, code-wise, for the first part:\n\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        digit = int(ch) if ch.isdigit() else ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\nWait, but this is assuming that the input string is valid. The problem says that the input is correct, so we don't need to validate it.\n\nBut wait, the input c may have leading zeros. However, the problem says that the input is a valid number in base a, so that's okay. For example, if the input is '001' in base 10, that's 1 in decimal.\n\nSo this function will correctly convert the string to decimal.\n\nOnce I have the decimal value, then I need to convert it to base b, unless b is R, in which case convert to Roman numerals.\n\nSo for the case where b is not R:\n\nConvert the decimal number",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to convert a number from one base to another, with a special case for Roman numerals. The solution involves converting the input number from its given base to a decimal (base 10) integer and then converting this decimal integer to the target base or Roman numerals as required.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Convert Input to Decimal**: The input number is given in base `a`. We first convert this number to a decimal integer. This involves processing each digit of the input string, converting it to its corresponding value in base 10.\n2. **Convert Decimal to Target Base**: If the target base `b` is not 'R', we convert the decimal integer to the target base. This involves repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and collecting the remainders.\n3. **Convert Decimal to Roman Numerals**: If the target base `b` is 'R', we convert the decimal integer to Roman numerals using a mapping of values to their corresponding Roman numeral symbols.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef to_decimal(s, base):\n    value = 0\n    for ch in s:\n        if ch.isdigit():\n            digit = int(ch)\n        else:\n            digit = ord(ch) - ord('A') + 10\n        value = value * base + digit\n    return value\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        rem = n % base\n        if rem < 10:\n            digits.append(str(rem))\n        else:\n            digits.append(chr(ord('A') + rem - 10))\n        n = n // base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef decimal_to_roman(n):\n    val = [\n        (1000, 'M'), (900, 'CM'), (500, 'D'), (400, 'CD'),\n        (100, 'C'), (90, 'XC'), (50, 'L'), (40, 'XL'),\n        (10, 'X'), (9, 'IX'), (5, 'V'), (4, 'IV'),\n        (1, 'I')\n    ]\n    res = ''\n    for (v, symbol) in val:\n        while n >= v:\n            res += symbol\n            n -= v\n    return res\n\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = sys.stdin.read().splitlines()\n    for line in input_lines:\n        parts = line.strip().split()\n        if not parts:\n            continue\n        a_part = parts[0]\n        if len(parts) == 2:\n            c_str = parts[1]\n        else:\n            c_str = ''\n        a_str, b_str = a_part.split() if ' ' in a_part else (a_part, '')\n        a = int(a_str)\n        b = b_str if b_str != 'R' else 'R'\n        # Now process c_str\n        if b == 'R':\n            decimal = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n            roman = decimal_to_roman(decimal)\n            print(roman)\n        else:\n            decimal = to_decimal(c_str, a)\n            converted = decimal_to_base(decimal, int(b))\n            print(converted)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **to_decimal Function**: Converts a string representation of a number in base `a` to its decimal equivalent. Each character in the string is converted to its corresponding integer value, considering both digits and letters for bases greater than 10.\n2. **decimal_to_base Function**: Converts a decimal number to a specified base. The conversion is done by repeatedly dividing the number by the target base and collecting remainders, which are then converted to the appropriate characters for bases greater than 10.\n3. **decimal_to_roman Function**: Converts a decimal number to Roman numerals using a list of value-symbol pairs, iterating through these pairs to construct the Roman numeral string.\n4. **main Function**: Reads input lines, processes each line to determine the input and target bases, converts the input number to decimal, and then either converts it to the target base or Roman numerals as required, ensuring leading zeros are omitted.",
