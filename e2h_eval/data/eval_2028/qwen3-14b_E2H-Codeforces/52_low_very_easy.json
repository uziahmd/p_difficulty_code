Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments.\n\nNote that this is a very easy question."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light his room using candles, considering that he can reuse the burnt-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo the initial number of candles is a. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. The conversion rate is b: every b burnt candles can be made into a new one. And this new candle can be used again, which in turn will burn for an hour and then become another burnt one. So the process continues until he can't make any more new candles.\n\nThe task is to find the total number of hours he can keep the room lit.\n\nLet me think about the example given. For input 4 and 2, the output is 7. Let's break it down:\n\nInitially, he has 4 candles. He uses them all, which gives 4 hours. Then, those 4 burnt candles are converted into 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. He uses those 2, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 burnt ones. Convert them into 1 new candle. Use that, adding 1 hour. Now he has 1 burnt candle, which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Start with 6, so 6 hours. Burnt ones: 6. Convert to 6/3 = 2. Use them, 2 hours. Now 2 burnt. Not enough for 3, so total is 6 + 2 = 8? But wait, the sample output says 8. Yes.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the number of burnt candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new ones, adding to the total hours.\n\nSo here's the plan:\n\n- Initialize total_hours = a (since each initial candle gives one hour)\n- The number of burnt candles is initially a.\n- While the number of burnt candles is >= b:\n   - Convert them into new candles: new_candles = burnt // b\n   - Add new_candles to total_hours\n   - The new burnt candles are the new_candles (since each new candle will burn once)\n   - Also, add the remaining burnt candles (burnt % b) to the new burnt count.\n\nWait, no. Wait, when you convert the burnt candles into new ones, the number of new candles is (burnt // b). Then, after using those new candles, they become burnt again. So the process is:\n\nEach time, you take the current number of burnt candles, convert as many as possible into new ones. Then, the new candles are added to the total hours, and then those new candles become burnt again. But also, the leftover from the conversion (burnt % b) remains as burnt candles.\n\nSo let's model this with variables.\n\nLet me think of variables:\n\ncurrent_burnt = a\n\ntotal_hours = 0\n\nWait, no. Initially, he uses all the candles. So the initial total_hours is a. Then the burnt is a. Then, in each step, we take the current burnt, divide by b to get new_candles. Then, the new_candles are added to the total_hours. Then, the new burnt is (current_burnt % b) + new_candles. Because the new_candles will be burned again, adding to the burnt pile.\n\nWait, but when you make new_candles from the current_burnt, you have to subtract the ones used for making the new ones. So for example, if current_burnt is 4 and b is 2, then 4//2 = 2 new candles. Those 2 new candles are used, which adds 2 hours. Then, the new burnt is 0 (from original 4, 4 - 2*2 = 0) plus the 2 new ones. Wait, no. Wait, the original current_burnt is 4. We take 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. So those 4 are used up in making the 2 new ones. Then, when you use the 2 new ones, they burn and add 2 hours, and then those 2 become burnt. So the next iteration, the current_burnt is 2. Which is then divided by 2 again, giving 1 new candle. Add 1 hour. Then, that 1 becomes burnt. Then, since 1 < 2, we stop. So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\ncurrent_burnt = a\n\nwhile current_burnt >= b:\n\n    new_candles = current_burnt // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    current_b",
