On Lunar New Year's Day, people model a dragon with bamboo strips and clothes, raise them with rods, and hold the rods high and low to resemble a flying dragon.A performer holding the rod low is represented by a 1, while one holding it high is represented by a 2. Thus, the line of performers can be represented by a sequence a1, a2, ..., an.Little Tommy is among them. He would like to choose an interval [l, r] (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n), then reverse al, al + 1, ..., ar so that the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence of the new sequence is maximum.A non-decreasing subsequence is a sequence of indices p1, p2, ..., pk, such that p1 < p2 < ... < pk and ap1 ≤ ap2 ≤ ... ≤ apk.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence after reversing any subarray in the original sequence. The original sequence consists of 1s and 2s. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the optimal reversal would be. Since the elements are only 1 and 2, the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) would be as long as possible. The original sequence might have some 1s followed by 2s, but maybe there's a way to reverse a part of it to get more 1s in order or 2s in order.\n\nWait, but reversing a subarray can help in two ways: maybe merging some 1s and 2s into a longer non-decreasing sequence. For example, if there's a part where 2 comes before 1, reversing that part would make it 1 followed by 2, which is better.\n\nBut how do I find which subarray to reverse to maximize the LNDS?\n\nLet me think about the original approach. The LNDS of the original array can be computed with dynamic programming. But since we can reverse any subarray, perhaps the best option is to find the best possible way to merge the 1s and 2s by reversing a segment that has some 2s followed by 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the optimal solution is to find the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in non-decreasing order by reversing a certain subarray. Let's think about the structure of the original array.\n\nLet me consider the original array. Let's say the original array has some 1s and 2s. The LNDS of the original array is the maximum between the count of 1s and 2s, but that's not necessarily true. Wait, no. Because the sequence could be like 1,2,1,2. Then the LNDS is 2, but the maximum count of 1s is 2, same for 2s. However, if you reverse the middle part, you can get all 1s followed by 2s.\n\nSo the idea is that the maximum possible LNDS after reversing a subarray is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s minus the number of inversions (but that's not exactly accurate). Alternatively, perhaps the best scenario is when all 1s come before 2s. So the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s, which is n. But that's only possible if the array can be made into all 1s followed by 2s. But if the original array is already that way, then reversing nothing gives that. But if not, maybe reversing a certain part can achieve that.\n\nWait, but in the first example, the original array is [1,2,1,2]. The maximum possible is 4, which is achieved by reversing [2,3], making [1,1,2,2]. So the maximum possible is indeed the total number of 1s and 2s (since there are 2 of each, 4 in total). So the optimal is to arrange all 1s first, then 2s.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in non-decreasing order by reversing a subarray. But since the array can be modified by reversing any subarray, perhaps the best possible scenario is to have all 1s followed by all 2s. However, if the original array has some 2s followed by 1s, reversing that part would fix it.\n\nSo the maximum possible LNDS is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s (which is n), but only if the array can be transformed into a non-decreasing sequence. But that's not possible if the original array has 1s and 2s in a way that even after reversing, there's no way to arrange them. Wait, but any array of 1s and 2s can be made into a non-decreasing sequence by reversing a subarray. For example, if the array is [2,1], reversing it gives [1,2]. So in that case, the maximum LNDS is 2. So for any array of 1s and 2s, the maximum possible is n. But why in the first sample input, the output is 4, which is n. But in the second example, the output is 9, which is n-1. Wait, the second input is 10 elements. The output is 9. So that suggests that there's a case where even after reversing, the maximum LNDS is not n. So why?\n\nAh, because the original array may have some 1s and 2s, but after reversing a sub",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the maximum possible length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS) after reversing any subarray in a given sequence of 1s and 2s. The key insight is that the optimal configuration for the LNDS is when all 1s come before all 2s, which can be achieved by reversing an appropriate subarray.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Count the Number of 1s and 2s**: The maximum possible length of the LNDS after any reversal is determined by the number of 1s and 2s in the original sequence. If we can arrange all 1s followed by all 2s, the LNDS will be the total number of elements.\n2. **Identify the Transition Point**: Find the point where the sequence transitions from 1s to 2s. This helps in determining the optimal subarray to reverse if there are any 2s followed by 1s.\n3. **Check for Reversals**: If there are any 2s followed by 1s, reversing that segment can help merge the 1s and 2s into a non-decreasing sequence.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    n = int(input[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    a = list(map(int, input[idx:idx + n]))\n    \n    count_1 = a.count(1)\n    count_2 = n - count_1\n    \n    # The maximum possible is count_1 + count_2 = n\n    # However, if the array is already non-decreasing, then it's n\n    # But if there are some 2s followed by 1s, we can reverse that part\n    # So the answer is always n unless there is no way to make it non-decreasing?\n    # Wait, no. For example, if the array is [1,2,1,2], reversing [2,3] gives [1,1,2,2], which is non-decreasing.\n    # So the maximum possible is always n. But why in the second example the output is 9?\n    # Let me check the second example:\n    # Input is [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]\n    # After reversing [3,7], it becomes [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,1].

Therefore, my previous reasoning was wrong.\n    \n    # So what's the correct approach?\n    # The correct approach is to find the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in a non-decreasing order.\n    # Since the sequence can be modified by reversing a subarray, the optimal way is to find the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s.\n    \n    # Let's compute the maximum number of 1s followed by 2s.\n    # We can iterate through the array and find the maximum number of 1s until a 2 appears, then count the number of 2s from that point.\n    # However, there might be cases where reversing a part allows more 1s to be grouped together.\n    \n    # Another approach is to find the maximum number of 1s before the first 2, and the maximum number of 2s after the last 1.\n    # Then the LNDS would be the sum of those two numbers.\n    # But this might not account for all possibilities.\n    \n    # Alternatively, we can compute the maximum possible by considering all possible positions where a 2 is followed by a 1, and see how reversing that part could help.\n    # But since n is up to 2000, we need an efficient approach.\n    \n    # Let's think of the original array. The LNDS of the original array can be calculated, but we can also consider the best possible scenario.\n    \n    # The maximum possible LNDS is the total number of 1s plus the number of 2s minus the number of inversions that cannot be fixed by reversing a subarray.\n    # But this is unclear.\n    \n    # Let's think differently: the optimal scenario is when all 1s are followed by all 2s. Let's find the maximum number of 1s that can be at the beginning and the maximum number of 2s that can be at the end.\n    \n    # Find the number of 1s from the start until the first occurrence of 2.\n    # Then find the number of 2s from the end until the first occurrence of 1.\n    # The maximum LNDS would be the sum of these two.\n    \n    # But there may be cases where reversing a middle part can allow more 1s and 2s to be grouped.\n    \n    # For example, in the second sample input:\n    # [1,1,2,2,2,1,1,2,2,1]\n    # The number of 1s from the start until first 2 is 2 (the first two 1s).\n    # The number of 2s from the end until first 1 is 1 (the last element is 1, so the number of 2s before that is 2).\n    # Sum is 2+2=4, which is less than the actual maximum of 9.\n    # So this approach is not sufficient.\n    \n    # So perhaps the correct way is to find the maximum number of 1s and 2s that can be arranged in non-decreasing order by considering all possible subarrays.\n    \n    # However, considering all possible subarrays would be O(n^2), which is acceptable for n=2000.\n    \n    # But how to compute the maximum LNDS after reversing any subarray?\n    \n    # Let's think: the LNDS of the new array is the maximum between:\n    # 1.

So the best possible is to have all 1s except one, followed by all 2s.\n    \n    # So the maximum possible is count_1 + count_2 if the array can be made into all 1s followed by all 2s. Otherwise, it's less.\n    \n    # How to determine if it's possible to make the array into all 1s followed by all 2s?\n    # It's always possible by reversing the subarray that contains the transition from 2 to 1.\n    \n    # But in the second example, the array has 6 1s and 4 2s.
