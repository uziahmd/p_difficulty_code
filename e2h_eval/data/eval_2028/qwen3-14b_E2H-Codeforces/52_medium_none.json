Vasily is smart, so he can make b went out candles into a new candle. As a result, this new candle can be used like any other new candle.Now Vasily wonders: for how many hours can his candles light up the room if he acts optimally well? Help him find this number.\n\n## Input\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000; 2 ≤ b ≤ 1000).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the number of hours Vasily can light up the room for.\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\n### Output\n['7', '8']\n\n## Note\nConsider the first sample. For the first four hours Vasily lights up new candles, then he uses four burned out candles to make two new ones and lights them up. When these candles go out (stop burning), Vasily can make another candle. Overall, Vasily can light up the room for 7 hours.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout). Please ensure your solution is efficient and handles all edge cases. Make sure to include any necessary imports and helper functions. Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating how many hours Vasily can light candles, considering that he can reuse the burned-out ones. Hmm.\n\nSo, the initial number of candles is a. Each candle burns for an hour. Then, when they go out, he can collect them and make new ones. For every b burned candles, he can make a new one. And this new one can be used again, which in turn will leave another burned candle. So it's like a process that can loop until he can't make any more new candles.\n\nThe example given is 4 and 2. Let's walk through that. He starts with 4 candles. They burn for 4 hours. Then, he has 4 burned ones. He can make 4 / 2 = 2 new candles. So he lights those, adding 2 hours. Now he has 2 burned ones. Again, he can make 2/2=1 new candle. That adds 1 hour. Now he has 1 burned candle, which isn't enough to make another (since b is 2). So total is 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother example: 6 and 3. Let's see. Initial 6 hours. Then 6 /3 = 2 new. So +2 hours. Now he has 2 burned. Not enough for 3. Wait, but wait. Wait, after burning the 2 new ones, he has 2 more burned. So total burned is 2. But 2 is less than 3. So total is 6 + 2 = 8? But the sample says output is 8. Yes. So that's correct.\n\nSo the approach is to keep track of the number of burned candles, and whenever possible, convert them into new candles. But how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the steps:\n\nInitially, the total hours is a. Because each candle is burned once. Then, the number of burned candles is a. Then, while the number of burned candles is >= b, we can make new candles. Each time, the number of new candles is (burned // b). Then, those new candles are burned, adding to the total hours. And the burned candles are updated as (burned % b) + (number of new candles). Because after making new candles, the remaining burned ones (those that weren't used in the conversion) plus the new ones that are burned after being used.\n\nWait, let's think. Suppose you have 'burned' candles. You take as many as possible to make new ones. For example, if you have 5 burned and b is 2. Then 5//2 = 2 new candles. The remaining burned is 5%2 = 1. Then, when you burn those 2 new candles, you add 2 hours, and then you have 1 + 2 = 3 burned again. So the process continues.\n\nSo the algorithm would be:\n\ntotal_hours = a\n\nburned = a\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned // b\n\n    total_hours += new_candles\n\n    burned = (burned % b) + new_candles\n\nSo this loop continues until burned is less than b.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nLet me test the first example:\n\na=4, b=2.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 4. burned is 4.\n\nLoop:\n\n4 >= 2: yes.\n\nnew_candles = 4//2 = 2. total becomes 4+2=6. burned is 4%2=0 +2= 2.\n\nAgain loop: 2 >=2. new_candles=1. total is 6+1=7. burned is 0 +1=1. Now loop ends.\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nAnother example: a=6, b=3.\n\ntotal_hours starts at 6. burned is 6.\n\nLoop: 6//3=2. total becomes 8. burned is 0 + 2 = 2. Now 2 <3. So done. Total is 8. Which matches the sample.\n\nAnother test case: say a=5, b=5. Then initial hours is 5. burned is 5. 5//5=1. total becomes 6. burned is 0 +1=1. Now loop ends. So total is 6.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2. Let's see:\n\nInitial hours 5. burned=5.\n\nLoop: 5//2=2. total +=2 →7. burned = 5%2=1 +2=3.\n\nAgain loop: 3//2=1. total 8. burned is 1 +1=2.\n\nAgain loop: 2//2=1. total 9. burned is 0+1=1. Now done. So total is 9.\n\nLet me check manually:\n\nStart with 5 candles. Burn them all (5h). Burned=5.\n\nMake 2 new (5//2=2), 5%2=1. So 1 + 2 = 3 burned after burning the new ones. So 2 hours added (total 5+2=7).\n\nThen, 3 burned. Make 1 new (3//2=1), 3%2=1. So 1 +1 = 2 burned. Add 1 hour (total 8).\n\nThen, 2 burned. Make 1 new. 2%2=0 +1=1. Add 1 hour (total 9). Now burned is 1. So done. Correct.\n\nSo the algorithm works.\n\nSo the code needs to read a and b, then compute this.\n\nNow, coding in Python:\n\nRead the input line as two integers. Then process as per the algorithm.\n\nBut wait, the input is given as a list of test cases? Wait, the problem says that the input is a single line with two integers. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe input is given as a single line with two integers a and b. The example shows two inputs, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. Wait, no, looking at the problem statement:\n\nIn the sample input, it's written as ['4 2', '6 3'], but that's probably for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, the original problem's input says:\n\nInput: The single line contains two integers a and b.\n\nSo the code should read a single line, split into two integers. But the sample input shows two lines, but maybe that's for multiple test cases. Wait, the sample input shows for example:\n\nSample Input:\n\n4 2\n\nSample Output:\n\n7\n\nBut in the example given, the input is given as two test cases, but perhaps that's part of the example. Wait, looking back:\n\nIn the problem statement, the sample input is given as:\n\nInput\n\n['4 2', '6 3']\n\nOutput\n\n['7', '8']\n\nBut that's probably because the user provided multiple test cases. However, the actual problem says that the input is a single line. So perhaps the code is supposed to read one line, but in the sample, there are two test cases. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the original problem's sample input is two lines, but the user here has given it as a list. Maybe the actual code is supposed to process multiple test cases, but the problem says that the input is a single line. Wait, the problem says:\n\nInput\n\nThe single line contains two integers, a and b.\n\nSo the code must read one line, split into a and b. So for example, in the first sample input, the line is \"4 2\", and output is 7.\n\nBut in the sample given by the user, the input is given as a list of two inputs, but perhaps that's for multiple test cases. However, the problem says that the code must read from standard input, which for the problem is a single line. Therefore, the code must read a single line, split into a and b.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nRead a and b from input.\n\nThen compute the total hours as per the algorithm.\n\nSo in Python:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nburned = a\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new = burned // b\n\n    total += new\n\n    burned = (burned % b) + new\n\nprint(total)\n\nWait, that's the code.\n\nLet me test with the sample inputs.\n\nFirst sample input: 4 2 → output 7.\n\nYes.\n\nSecond sample input: 6 3 → output 8. Let's see:\n\ntotal starts as 6. burned is 6.\n\nLoop: 6//3=2 → total 8. burned is 0 + 2 = 2. Now 2 <3. Done. So output 8. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: a=5, b=5. Output is 6. Which is correct.\n\nAnother case: a=5, b=2. Output is 9. Which is correct.\n\nWhat about a=1, b=2? Then total is 1. Because after burning the first candle, you have 1 burned. Which is less than 2. So no more.\n\nAnother case: a=3, b=3. Initial total is 3. burned is 3. 3//3=1. total becomes 4. burned is 0 +1=1. Loop ends. So total is 4.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should work.\n\nNow, code:\n\nRead a and b, then process as per the code above.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\nRead the input line, split into a and b.\n\nImplement the loop.\n\nSo the code is:\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\ntotal = a\n\nburned = a\n\nwhile burned >= b:\n\n    new_candles = burned // b\n\n    total += new_candles\n\n    burned = burned % b + new_candles\n\nprint(total)\n\nYes. That's the code.\n\nI think that's all. Let me check edge cases.\n\nEdge case 1: a=1, b=2 → output 1.\n\nEdge case 2: a=1, b=1? Wait, no, the constraints say that b is ≥2. So the input for b is between 2 and 1000.\n\nSo in the code, no problem with division by zero or anything.\n\nAnother edge case: a=1000, b=2. Let's see. The code would process it.\n\nBut for the code, it's handled correctly.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code should handle all cases correctly.\n",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Vasily can illuminate his room using candles, considering that he can reuse burned-out candles to create new ones. The solution involves simulating the process of burning candles and reusing the burned ones optimally.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initial Setup**: Start with the given number of candles, `a`, which will burn for `a` hours initially.\n2. **Track Burned Candles**: After each hour, keep track of the number of burned candles.\n3. **Reuse Burned Candles**: While the number of burned candles is sufficient to make new ones (i.e., at least `b` burned candles), convert them into new candles. Each new candle burns for an additional hour and contributes to the total hours.\n4. **Iterative Process**: Continue the process of converting burned candles into new ones until there are not enough burned candles left to make a new one.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\na, b = map(int, input().split())\ntotal = a\nburned = a\nwhile burned >= b:\n    new_candles = burned // b\n    total += new_candles\n    burned = burned % b + new_candles\nprint(total)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Initial Hours**: The initial number of hours is simply the number of candles `a` since each candle burns for one hour.\n2. **Burned Candles Tracking**: After burning all initial candles, we start tracking the number of burned candles.\n3. **Conversion Loop**: In each iteration, we check if we can convert the burned candles into new ones. If so, we calculate how many new candles can be made and update the total hours accordingly. The remaining burned candles after conversion are updated to include both the leftover burned candles and the newly created ones from the conversion.\n4. **Termination**: The loop terminates when there are not enough burned candles left to make a new one, ensuring we have maximized the use of available candles.\n\nThis approach efficiently simulates the process of reusing burned candles, ensuring optimal use and handling all edge cases within the constraints provided.",
