    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm. The problem statement is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to count the number of ways to assign c_s values (each between 0 and k) for all binary strings s of lengths 1 to n, such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we need to compute this modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, let me understand what a beautiful multiset is. For every binary string s (of any length up to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. And the multiset consists of exactly n-length binary strings. So, the multiset is a collection of n-length binary strings, and for each possible prefix s (of any length up to n), the count of how many strings in the multiset have s as a prefix is <= c_s.\n\nThe maximum possible size of such a multiset is exactly f. Our goal is to find the number of ways to choose the c_s values such that this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this? Let's think about the constraints on the c_s values. For the maximum size of the beautiful multiset to be exactly f, there must be at least one way to have a multiset of size f, and no way to have a larger one. However, since we are choosing the c_s values, the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset depends on the c_s's.\n\nWait, but the problem says that we need to choose the c_s's such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. So, for these chosen c_s's, the maximum possible size is f. That is, there exists a multiset of size f that is beautiful, and any larger multiset would violate the constraints.\n\nBut how do we compute this for all possible c_s assignments?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is determined by some constraints on the c_s's. Let me think: the maximum possible size is the minimum over all possible constraints that would limit the number of strings in the multiset.\n\nFor example, each string in the multiset contributes to multiple prefixes. For instance, if a string is '01', then it contributes to the prefixes '0', '01'. So, the counts for all prefixes of the string must not exceed their respective c_s values.\n\nTo maximize the size of the multiset, we need to select as many strings as possible without violating any of the constraints. But the maximum possible size would be determined by the minimal \"capacity\" along the paths of the trie of all binary strings.\n\nThis seems similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of nodes in a trie with certain constraints on the number of children. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum size is the sum over all possible strings of the minimum constraints along their paths. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAnother approach: think of the problem as a trie where each node represents a binary string. Each node has a capacity c_s. The maximum number of strings in the multiset is the maximum number of leaves (n-length strings) such that for each node in the trie, the number of leaves passing through it does not exceed c_s.\n\nWait, but each string in the multiset is of length n. So, for each such string, all of its prefixes (from length 1 to n) contribute to the counts. Therefore, the problem is equivalent to selecting a set of n-length strings such that for every node (prefix) in the trie, the number of selected strings that pass through that node is ≤ c_s.\n\nThe maximum possible size of such a set is the maximum number of strings that can be selected under these constraints. The question is, given the c_s's, what is this maximum size?\n\nNow, the problem requires that the maximum possible size is exactly f. So, for the given c_s's, the maximum size is f. How can we model this?\n\nThis feels like a problem that can be modeled using dynamic programming on the trie structure. Let me think recursively. For each node (binary string), the maximum number of strings that can be added under its subtree is constrained by c_s and the capacities of its children.\n\nWait, here's an idea: the maximum number of strings in the multiset is determined by the minimum of the capacities along the paths. But how?\n\nAlternatively, considering that each string in the multiset contributes exactly 1 to the count of all its prefixes. So, for each node (prefix), the total number of strings in the multiset that have this prefix is equal to the number of strings in the multiset that are in the subtree rooted at this node. Therefore, the constraint is that for each node, the number of strings in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut since the strings are of length exactly n, the leaves of the trie (depth n) are the actual strings in the multiset. So, for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is the number of strings in the multiset that have this node's string as a prefix.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be placed in the trie such that for every node, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nThe maximum number of such leaves is determined by the constraints on the nodes. How can we compute this maximum?\n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be solved with a greedy approach. For example, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the minimum of the capacities along the paths from the root to the leaves. Wait, but that's not quite right. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider the trie structure. Each node has two children (for 0 and 1). The capacity of a node is c_s. The number of leaves in the subtree of a node can't exceed c_s. But the children's capacities also impose constraints. For example, if a node has capacity c, then the sum of the leaves in its left and right subtrees can't exceed c. But each of those subtrees must also satisfy their own constraints.\n\nSo, for a node, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves from its children. But since each child can contribute up to their own maximum, which depends on their own capacities and their children's capacities, etc.\n\nWait, this seems like a standard problem. The maximum number of leaves in the trie is determined by a bottom-up approach. For each node, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves of its children. But since the children are nodes of depth d+1, and the leaves are at depth n.\n\nWait, for example, consider the root node. Its maximum number of leaves is the minimum of c_root and (left_child_max + right_child_max). But for the leaves (nodes at depth n), their maximum is min(c_leaf, 1), but since they can't have children (as they are leaves in the trie of length n), their maximum is just 1 (since adding a leaf here would contribute 1 to the count of the node). But wait, the leaves in the trie (the actual strings in the multiset) are of length n. So, for a node at depth d < n, its maximum number of leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, left_child_max + right_child_max). For a node at depth n, its maximum is min(c_s, 1) (since it can contribute at most 1 leaf, itself).\n\nBut how does this work? Let's take an example. Suppose n=2. For a node at depth 1 (say '0'), its children are '00' and '01'. The maximum number of leaves in the subtree of '0' is min(c_0, max_leaves('00') + max_leaves('01')). And for '00' (depth 2), which is a leaf node, its max is min(c_00, 1).\n\nSo, this seems like a dynamic programming approach where for each node, we compute the maximum number of leaves that can be placed in its subtree, given the constraints of the capacities.\n\nBut in our problem, we need to choose the capacities c_s for all nodes (binary strings of length 1 to n), and then ensure that the maximum number of leaves (i.e., the value computed for the root node) is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we model this for all possible c_s choices?\n\nThe problem requires that the maximum possible size (the root's DP value) is exactly f. However, since the c_s's can be chosen in various ways, we need to count all possible assignments of c_s's (each between 0 and k) such that when you compute the DP as described, the result is exactly f.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nGiven that n is up to 15, the total number of nodes (binary strings of lengths 1 to n) is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^(n+1) - 2. For n=15, this is 2^16-2=65534, which is manageable for some DP approaches, but perhaps not for all possibilities.\n\nBut considering that for each node, the choice of c_s affects the DP computation. However, the problem requires us to count the number of c_s assignments such that the DP for the root is exactly f.\n\nBut how can we model this? Let's think recursively.\n\nLet me think of the trie as a tree where each node has two children (except for leaves at depth n). For each node, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is determined by the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maxima of its children.\n\nSo, for each node, the value of the maximum leaves in its subtree depends on the c_s of that node and the maximum leaves of its children.\n\nBut since the children are processed first, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, where for each node, we track the possible values of the maximum leaves in its subtree, given the possible choices of c_s for that node and the constraints from the children.\n\nBut since the nodes are structured in a hierarchy (parents before children?), perhaps we can process them in a bottom-up manner.\n\nHowever, the problem is that the c_s's are variables that we can choose for each node. So, for each node, the choice of c_s can be between 0 and k, and for each such choice, the maximum leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, left_child_max + right_child_max).\n\nBut how can we model the number of ways to choose the c_s's such that the root's max is exactly f?\n\nThis seems like a problem that can be approached with memoization and dynamic programming. Let me think recursively.\n\nLet's denote that for a node, given the possible maximum number of leaves that its children can contribute (say, L and R for left and right children), the number of ways to choose c_s for this node such that the maximum for this node is m, where m is min(c_s, L + R). But since the node's maximum is determined by its c_s and the sum of the children's maxima.\n\nBut for a node, once the children's maxima are fixed, the choice of c_s for this node can influence the maximum for this node. Let's formalize this.\n\nSuppose a node has two children. Let's say the maximum leaves in the left child's subtree is l, and in the right child's subtree is r. Then, the sum of these is l + r. The maximum leaves for this node is min(c, l + r), where c is the chosen value of c_s for this node.\n\nBut for the node's maximum to be some value m, we have that m = min(c, l + r). Therefore, for each possible choice of c, we can determine what m would be.\n\nBut since we are trying to count the number of ways to choose c's for all nodes, perhaps we can model for each node and for each possible value of the maximum leaves that can be achieved in its subtree, the number of ways to choose c_s for that node and its descendants such that the maximum is that value.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about the base case. For a leaf node (depth n), the maximum leaves in its subtree is min(c_s, 1). Because the node itself is a leaf of the trie (a string of length n). So, for this node, the maximum is either 0 (if c_s is 0) or 1 (if c_s ≥ 1). Therefore, for a leaf node, the number of ways to choose c_s such that the maximum is m (which can be 0 or 1) is:\n\n- If m is 0: c_s must be 0. So there's 1 way (c_s = 0).\n- If m is 1: c_s can be any value from 1 to k. So there are k ways.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that c_s can be chosen from 0 to k. So for the leaf node, the maximum is min(c_s, 1). So for the maximum to be 0, c_s must be 0. For the maximum to be 1, c_s must be ≥1. So the number of choices is:\n\nways = (if m == 0: 1; else if m == 1: (k) if k ≥1 else 0).\n\nBut since k is given as ≥1 in the input (the constraints say 1 ≤ k, f ≤ 2e5), but wait, the input allows k to be 1 or more. So for the leaf node, the number of ways to get m is:\n\nif m is 0 → 1 (only c=0)\nif m is 1 → k (c can be 1..k)\nelse → 0.\n\nBut for non-leaf nodes, the situation is more complex. Let's take a node at depth d < n. It has two children. Let's suppose that for each child, we have computed the possible number of ways that the child can contribute to a certain maximum value. Then, for the current node, we need to combine these possibilities.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose that for the left child, the possible maximum is l (could be any value up to some limit), and for the right child, the possible maximum is r. Then, the sum l + r is the maximum possible leaves that could be contributed by the children. However, the current node's c_s can be chosen between 0 and k, and the maximum for this node is min(c_s, l + r). So, the possible maximum for this node depends on both the sum l + r and the choice of c_s.\n\nBut how do we model this? For each node, we need to know the possible values of the maximum leaves in its subtree, and for each possible value, the number of ways to choose c_s and the children's configurations to achieve that.\n\nThis seems like a dynamic programming problem where for each node, we compute a function dp[node][m] = number of ways to assign c_s for this node and its subtree such that the maximum leaves in its subtree is exactly m.\n\nBut how do we compute this for each node?\n\nLet me think about the recurrence. For a non-leaf node (depth < n), it has two children. Let's denote the left child's DP as left_dp and the right child's DP as right_dp. For each possible value of l (maximum for left) and r (maximum for right), we can compute the sum l + r. Then, for the current node, the maximum is min(c, l + r), where c is the chosen c_s for this node. But since c can be any value between 0 and k, we need to count all possibilities where min(c, l + r) equals some target m.\n\nBut how do we aggregate this over all possible l and r?\n\nThe approach would be:\n\nFor each node, we compute the possible values of m (the maximum leaves in its subtree) and the number of ways to achieve that m, based on the children's possibilities.\n\nLet me formalize this. For a non-leaf node, the DP is computed as follows:\n\nWe need to consider all possible pairs (l, r), where l is the maximum leaves for the left child, and r is the maximum leaves for the right child. For each such pair, the sum s = l + r. Then, the current node's maximum can be any value m such that m = min(c, s), where c is between 0 and k.\n\nBut how do we combine this with the number of ways for the left and right children?\n\nLet me think. For each possible l and r, the number of ways for the left and right children is left_ways[l] * right_ways[r]. Then, for each such combination, the current node's possible m depends on the choice of c_s.\n\nSo, for each possible s = l + r, the current node's maximum is m = min(c, s). For each possible m, we need to count how many choices of c_s (between 0 and k) would result in m.\n\nBut for a given s, the possible m values are:\n\nIf c_s is chosen such that c_s >= s, then m = s.\n\nIf c_s is chosen such that c_s < s, then m = c_s.\n\nSo, for the current node, the number of ways to choose c_s for this node, given that the sum s is fixed, is:\n\nFor each possible target m, the number of c's that satisfy min(c, s) = m.\n\nWhich can be broken down into:\n\n- If m < s: then c must be exactly m. So there is 1 choice (c = m) if m is between 0 and k.\n- If m = s: then c can be any value between s and k. So there are (k - s + 1) choices, provided that s ≤ k.\n\nSo, for a given s, the contribution to the current node's DP for m is:\n\nsum over all (left_ways[l] * right_ways[r]) multiplied by the number of ways to choose c_s to get m from s.\n\nTherefore, for each node, the DP can be computed by combining the DPs of the children, considering all possible pairs of their maximums, computing s = l + r, and then for each possible m, accumulating the contributions based on the possible choices of c_s.\n\nBut how do we compute this efficiently?\n\nThe key steps are:\n\n1. Process the nodes in a bottom-up manner, starting from the leaves (depth n) and moving up to the root (depth 1).\n\n2. For each node, compute a frequency array (or dictionary) of possible m values and their counts.\n\n3. For non-leaf nodes, combine the children's frequency arrays to compute the possible m values for the current node.\n\nBut given that n is up to 15, the maximum possible m for a node at depth d is 2^{n - d} (since each level doubles the possibilities). For example, the root node (depth 1) can have m up to 2^{n-1} (since there are 2^{n} leaves in the trie, but constrained by the capacities). However, since k can be up to 2e5, and f can be up to 2e5, perhaps the m values can be up to min(2^n, k). However, for n=15, 2^15 is 32768, which is manageable.\n\nWait, but for a node at depth d, the maximum possible m is the number of leaves in its subtree. Since the subtree includes all strings of length n that start with the node's string. The number of such strings is 2^{n - d}. So, for example, the root node has 2^{n} leaves in its subtree. However, due to the constraints of the capacities, the actual maximum m for the node is min(c_s, ...), which depends on the capacities. But in the worst case (if all capacities are large enough), the maximum possible m for the root is 2^n. However, given that k can be up to 2e5, and n is 15, 2^15 is 32768, which is less than 2e5 when n is 15 (since 2^15 is 32768, which is less than 2e5 for n=15). Wait, 2^15 is 32768, which is less than 200,000. So for n=15, the maximum possible m for the root is 32768. However, if k is larger than that, then the maximum possible m for the root is 32768, but if k is smaller, then it's limited by k.\n\nBut since the problem requires that the maximum is exactly f, we need to handle cases where f could be larger than the maximum possible m. In such cases, the answer is zero. For example, if n=2 and f=5, but the maximum possible is 4 (since 2^2=4), then there are zero ways.\n\nSo, for the DP, the possible m values for each node can be up to min(2^{n - depth}, k), but since the depth varies, perhaps we can precompute for each node the maximum possible m.\n\nBut regardless, for each node, during the DP computation, we need to track possible m values up to some maximum, which for n=15 is manageable.\n\nNow, the problem is how to compute this DP efficiently. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, we need to generate all the nodes in the trie. Each node is a binary string of length between 1 and n. However, for the purposes of processing, perhaps we can represent the nodes in terms of their depth and their position in the trie. Alternatively, since the trie is a full binary tree (each node has two children except leaves), we can process the nodes in order of increasing depth, starting from the leaves (depth n) and moving up to depth 1.\n\nFor each node, we can represent it by its depth and a binary identifier. However, for the purpose of processing, perhaps we can model the nodes as a tree structure, where each node has a left and right child, and we process them in post-order traversal (children first, then parent).\n\nBut for code implementation, perhaps we can model the nodes as a list, and for each node, track its depth and whether it's a leaf (depth ==n).\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\n- Generate all nodes in the trie, ordered by depth from n down to 1.\n\n- For each node, compute its DP table, which is a dictionary (or array) where dp[m] is the number of ways to assign c_s for this node and its subtree such that the maximum number of leaves is m.\n\n- For a leaf node (depth ==n), the DP is as discussed earlier: for m=0, 1 way; for m=1, k ways.\n\n- For non-leaf nodes, we compute the DP by combining the DPs of the left and right children.\n\nOnce the root's DP is computed, the answer is the number of ways where the root's DP value is exactly f. But we need to ensure that the maximum is exactly f, not less than or equal to f. However, the problem requires that the maximum possible size is exactly f. So, how do we ensure that?\n\nAh, here's a crucial point. The DP for the root gives the maximum possible size of the beautiful multiset. However, the problem requires that this maximum is exactly f. Therefore, the answer is the number of c_s assignments where the root's DP value is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute that?\n\nYes. So, once we compute the root's DP, the value dp_root[f] is the number of c_s assignments that result in the maximum size being exactly f. However, this is only true if the DP is designed to count exactly that.\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. The DP for a node is the number of ways to assign c_s values for that node and its subtree such that the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is exactly m. But how?\n\nActually, the DP for a node is the number of ways to assign c_s values such that the maximum number of leaves in the subtree is exactly m. Because when you choose the c_s for the node, you are ensuring that the maximum is exactly m. For example, in the leaf node case, the maximum is either 0 or 1, and the DP counts the ways for each.\n\nSo, the final answer is the value of dp_root[f], where dp_root is the DP of the root node.\n\nBut wait, what if the maximum possible size is less than f? For example, if the root's DP for m=f is zero, then there are no ways. However, the problem requires that the maximum is exactly f. So, the answer is the number of assignments where the maximum is exactly f.\n\nThus, the approach is correct.\n\nNow, the challenge is to implement this DP efficiently.\n\nBut for n=15, the number of nodes is 2^1 + ... + 2^15 = 2^16 - 2 = 65534. For each node, the DP table can have up to some maximum m. Let's think about the possible maximum m for each node. For a node at depth d, the maximum possible m is 2^{n -d} (the number of leaves in its subtree). For example, for the root (d=1), it's 2^{n-1}.\n\nBut for n=15, 2^{n-1} is 32768. So, for each node, the DP table can be represented as an array of size up to 32768, but for deeper nodes, the maximum m is smaller.\n\nBut even with that, for 65534 nodes, each with a DP array of up to 32768 entries, the total memory required would be O(65534 * 32768) which is around 2e9, which is way too big. That's impossible.\n\nSo, this approach is not feasible for n=15. Therefore, we need a smarter way.\n\nAlternative idea: notice that for each node, the maximum possible m is the sum of the maximum m of its children. However, since the children's m can be up to their own maximums, which is 2^{n - depth - 1} for each child (assuming depth is d, children are at d+1). So for a node at depth d, the maximum possible sum of children's m is 2*2^{n -d -1} = 2^{n -d} which is the same as the maximum possible m for the node.\n\nBut again, for n=15, this leads to a lot of possibilities.\n\nAlternative approach: for each node, the possible m values for the DP are up to the maximum possible value for that node. However, when combining two children's DP tables, the sum of their m's can be up to 2^{n -d} for the node at depth d. However, for the DP computation, perhaps we can use convolution-like techniques, but I'm not sure.\n\nBut considering that n is small (up to 15), and for each node, the maximum m is 2^{n - depth}, which for depth d ranges from 1 to n. For example, for depth d =n, the maximum m is 1. For depth d =n-1, the maximum is 2, etc. So, for each node, the maximum m is 2^{n -d}.\n\nBut for n=15, the maximum possible m for the root is 2^14 = 16384. Which is manageable. Because 16384 is manageable for convolution-like operations.\n\nWait, but for each node, the possible m is up to 2^{n -d}. For example, for the root node (d=1), it's 2^{n-1} = 32768 for n=15. So, for each node, the DP is an array of size up to 32768, but for deeper nodes, the size is smaller.\n\nBut even with that, the total number of operations would be O(number of nodes * (max m per node)^2). For example, for the root node, combining two children's DP tables (each of size up to 2^{n-2} = 16384) would take O( (16384)^2 ) operations. For n=15, this is about 2.7e8 operations for the root node alone. Multiply by the number of nodes, which is 65534, and this becomes impossible.\n\nTherefore, this approach is not feasible for n=15. Need to find another way.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the problem differently. The maximum size of the beautiful multiset is determined by the constraints on the capacities. This maximum is the minimal value of the capacities along all paths from the root to the leaves, but adjusted for the sum of capacities of the children. Wait, no. Earlier analysis suggested that the maximum is determined by the DP approach. However, perhaps there's a way to model this with the inclusion of constraints on the capacities.\n\nAnother observation: For the maximum size of the beautiful multiset to be exactly f, the following must hold:\n\nThe maximum possible is f, which implies that there exists at least one way to select f strings without exceeding any c_s, and that no way to select more than f strings exists.\n\nBut how can we model this in terms of the capacities?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of strings in the multiset is the minimum over all nodes of (c_s multiplied by some factor?), but I don't see it.\n\nAnother thought: For the maximum size of the multiset, it's the same as the minimum over all nodes of the sum of capacities along the path? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as a flow network. Each node has a capacity c_s. The number of leaves in the subtree of a node cannot exceed c_s. So, the problem is similar to a flow where each node can have at most c_s leaves in its subtree. The maximum number of leaves is determined by the capacities of the nodes.\n\nBut this is similar to the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves that can be selected under these constraints. This is equivalent to the problem of finding the maximum number of leaves such that for every node, the number of leaves in its subtree is <= c_s.\n\nThis problem is known in combinatorics and can be solved with the DP approach discussed earlier. However, given the constraints on n, perhaps there's a way to find the number of c_s assignments that make this DP value exactly f.\n\nBut again, for n=15, the DP approach is computationally expensive.\n\nAlternative Idea: Let's think about the DP for the root node. The value of the root's DP is the minimum between c_root and the sum of the left and right children's DP values. However, the children's DP values are themselves determined by their own c_s and their children's DP values.\n\nBut perhaps we can model this recursively, and for each node, track the possible ways to have a certain value of m, considering the constraints on c_s.\n\nBut how can we optimize this?\n\nLet me think about the possible values for each node. For a node at depth d, the maximum possible m is 2^{n-d} as discussed. For example, for a node at depth d, the number of leaves in its subtree is 2^{n-d}.\n\nSo, for the DP of a node, the m can be up to this value.\n\nBut for the DP of the node, the value of m is determined by the choice of c_s and the sum of the children's m's.\n\nLet me consider that for a node, the sum of the children's m's is S. Then, the maximum m for the node is min(c_s, S). So, for the node, the number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, S) = m is:\n\nIf m < S: then c_s must be exactly m. So, if m is between 0 and k, there's 1 way. Else, 0.\n\nIf m = S: then c_s must be >= S. The number of ways is max(0, k - S + 1).\n\nBut this is only for a particular S. However, the sum S is not fixed, but depends on the children's DP values.\n\nBut for each node, the DP is computed as follows:\n\nFor all possible combinations of left_m and right_m, compute S = left_m + right_m. Then, for this S, compute the number of ways to choose c_s for the node to get a certain m.\n\nBut how do we aggregate this across all possible left_m and right_m?\n\nLet me think of it as follows: for a node, the DP is the convolution of the left and right children's DPs, multiplied by the possible ways to choose c_s based on the sum.\n\nBut convolution here would mean combining all possible pairs of left and right m values, and for each sum S, compute the contribution to the current node's DP.\n\nBut even this seems computationally heavy for n=15.\n\nBut perhaps we can find that for each node, the DP can be represented as a generating function, and then combining the children's generating functions with the c_s choices.\n\nLet me think about generating functions. For a node, the generating function G(x) is the sum over m of (number of ways to get m) * x^m.\n\nFor a leaf node, the generating function is:\n\nG_leaf(x) = 1 * x^0 + k * x^1.\n\nFor a non-leaf node, the generating function is computed by taking the generating functions of the left and right children, convolving them to get the possible sums S, then for each S, multiply by the generating function of the possible ways to choose c_s for this node to get a certain m from S.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think. Let's say the left child's generating function is L(x) and the right child's is R(x). Their convolution would be C(x) = L(x) * R(x), which represents the sum over all possible pairs (l, r) of (ways_l * ways_r) * x^{l + r}.\n\nThen, for each term x^S in C(x), we need to compute the contribution to the current node's generating function.\n\nFor each S, the contribution to the current node's generating function is:\n\nIf we choose c_s such that min(c_s, S) = m, then the number of ways is as discussed earlier.\n\nSo, for each S, the contribution to the current node's generating function is:\n\nsum_{m} [ways_to_choose_c_s_for_this_S_and_m] * x^m.\n\nWhich for each S is:\n\nif m < S: 1 way (c_s = m) if m is between 0 and k.\n\nplus if m == S: (k - S + 1) ways if S <=k.\n\nSo, for a given S, the contribution to the current node's generating function is:\n\nsum_{m=0}^{min(S-1, k)} x^m + (if S <=k then (k - S + 1) * x^S else 0).\n\nBut this sum is equal to:\n\nsum_{m=0}^{min(S, k)} x^m - x^S * (if S >k then 0 else 1).\n\nWait, the sum from m=0 to m = min(S-1, k) is the same as the sum from m=0 to min(S, k) minus x^{min(S, k)} if min(S, k) >= S. But this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the sum is:\n\nif S >k:\n\nthen for m < S, but m can be up to k. So the sum is sum_{m=0}^k x^m.\n\nAdditionally, if S <=k, then the sum is sum_{m=0}^{S-1} x^m + (k - S + 1) x^S.\n\nBut this seems complicated. However, note that the sum from m=0 to m = min(S, k) of x^m is (x^{min(S, k)+1} - 1)/(x-1), but I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nBut for the purpose of generating functions, perhaps we can precompute for each possible S the contribution.\n\nBut how can we compute this efficiently?\n\nLet me think. For a given S, the contribution to the current node's generating function is:\n\nterm = 0\n\nif S <=k:\n\n   term = (sum_{m=0}^{S-1} x^m) + (k - S + 1) * x^S \n\nelse:\n\n   term = (sum_{m=0}^k x^m)\n\nBut sum_{m=0}^t x^m is (x^{t+1} - 1)/(x - 1), assuming x != 1.\n\nBut in our case, we're dealing with generating functions, and perhaps we can represent this as polynomials.\n\nHowever, given that we're working with exponents up to 2^15, which is manageable for small n, perhaps we can compute this for each S.\n\nBut this seems computationally intensive. However, considering that for each node, the possible S is up to 2^{n -d}, and for n=15, this is manageable.\n\nBut even so, for each node, combining the children's generating functions and then processing each term of the convolution may be feasible.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me outline the steps again with this new idea:\n\nFor each node:\n\n- If it is a leaf, its generating function is as discussed.\n\n- Else, compute the convolution of the left and right children's generating functions. This gives for each possible S (sum of left and right m's) the number of ways to achieve that sum.\n\n- For each S in this convolution, compute the contribution to the current node's generating function as described above.\n\n- Sum all these contributions to get the current node's generating function.\n\nOnce we reach the root, the coefficient of x^f in the root's generating function is the",
    "response": "\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose values for each binary string's capacity such that the maximum size of a beautiful multiset is exactly `f`. This involves dynamic programming (DP) on a trie structure and careful handling of constraints.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Trie Structure**: Represent all binary strings of lengths from 1 to `n` as nodes in a trie. Each node corresponds to a binary string and has two children (0 and 1).\n2. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a bottom-up approach to compute the number of ways to assign capacities such that the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is exactly `f`.\n3. **Generating Functions**: For each node, maintain a generating function that tracks the number of ways to achieve different sizes of the multiset. This helps in efficiently combining results from child nodes.\n4. **Combining Results**: For non-leaf nodes, combine the generating functions of their children using convolution and adjust based on the chosen capacities.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport sys\nimport math\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        k = int(input[idx+1])\n        f = int(input[idx+2])\n        idx += 3\n        \n        max_m = 1 << (n -

Each node's generating function is computed based on its children's generating functions, adjusted by the constraints on capacities. The approach involves recursively processing nodes from the leaves up to the root, combining results using convolution and adjusting for capacity constraints.
