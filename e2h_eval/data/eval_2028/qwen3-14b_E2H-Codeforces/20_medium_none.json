For every such string $$$s$$$, you need to choose an integer $$$c_s$$$ from $$$0$$$ to $$$k$$$.A multiset of binary strings of length exactly $$$n$$$ is considered beautiful if for every binary string $$$s$$$ with length from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, the number of strings in the multiset such that $$$s$$$ is their prefix is not exceeding $$$c_s$$$.For example, let $$$n = 2$$$, $$$c_{0} = 3$$$, $$$c_{00} = 1$$$, $$$c_{01} = 2$$$, $$$c_{1} = 1$$$, $$$c_{10} = 2$$$, and $$$c_{11} = 3$$$.

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, the problem is a bit complex, but I'll break it down step by step.\n\nSo, the task is to find the number of ways to assign c_s values for all binary strings s of lengths 1 to n such that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly f. And we have to compute this count modulo 998244353.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a beautiful multiset is. From the description, for every binary string s (of length from 1 to n), the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must not exceed c_s. The maximum size of such a multiset is exactly f, and we need to count the number of c_s assignments that make this possible.\n\nLet me think about how to model this. For each possible assignment of c_s values, we need to determine what the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is. Then, we want the count of assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute that maximum? Well, the maximum size of a beautiful multiset would be determined by some constraints based on the c_s values. Let's think about the constraints for the multiset.\n\nEach string in the multiset contributes to the count of prefixes. For example, if a string of length n is in the multiset, then all its prefixes (of lengths 1 to n) are counted. So, for the multiset to be beautiful, for every prefix s of any string in the multiset, the count of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix must be ≤ c_s.\n\nThe maximum size of such a multiset would be determined by the constraints imposed by the c_s values. How can we model this?\n\nThis feels similar to a problem where you have to find the maximum number of elements you can select under certain constraints. Maybe this can be modeled as a flow problem or using some kind of tree structure with constraints.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each string of length n contributes to all its prefixes. So, for each node (binary string), the number of times it's used as a prefix depends on the number of longer strings that have it as a prefix.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem can be viewed as a tree. Each binary string is a node in a trie. The root is the empty string, and each node has two children (0 and 1). But since we're dealing with strings of length up to n, the trie would have levels from 1 to n.\n\nFor each node (string s), the maximum number of times it can be a prefix is c_s. However, the number of times s can be a prefix is limited by the sum of the counts of its children. Because each string that starts with s (i.e., is a child or descendant of s) contributes to the count of s being a prefix.\n\nWait, here's an idea: For the maximum size of the multiset, we need to choose how many times each string is included in the multiset, such that for each node s, the sum of counts of all strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s. But since each string in the multiset contributes to all its prefixes, the problem becomes similar to a constraint that for each node s, the number of strings in the multiset that have s as a prefix is at most c_s. \n\nBut how to model the maximum possible size of the multiset given the c_s values?\n\nThis seems like a problem where we can model the constraints as a hierarchy. For example, the count for a node s can't exceed the minimum between c_s and the sum of counts of its children plus one (if we include s itself). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider the multiset as consisting of some number of strings of length n. Each such string contributes to the count of all its prefixes. For example, if a string is \"01\", then it contributes to the count of \"0\", \"01\", and also to the count of the empty string (but the problem says s has length from 1 to n, so maybe the empty string isn't considered here).\n\nWait, the problem says that for every binary string s of length from 1 to n. So the empty string isn't considered here. So for each string in the multiset (which is of length exactly n), all its prefixes of length 1 to n are considered. \n\nSo, for a node s (a binary string of length l, 1 ≤ l ≤ n), the number of times it is a prefix in the multiset is equal to the number of strings in the multiset that start with s. For example, if s is a prefix of t, then t contributes to the count of s.\n\nSo, the maximum possible size of the multiset is the maximum number of strings of length n that can be selected such that for every s (prefix of length l), the number of selected strings that have s as a prefix is ≤ c_s.\n\nBut how to model this maximum? It seems like this is equivalent to finding the maximum number of strings that can be placed in the multiset under the constraints that for each node s, the number of strings that pass through s (i.e., have s as a prefix) is ≤ c_s. \n\nThis sounds like a problem that can be modeled using the concept of a trie with constraints. For each node, the number of strings that pass through it can't exceed c_s. However, since each string contributes to all its prefixes, the constraints are hierarchical. \n\nLet me think of this as a flow problem. For each node, the capacity is c_s. The maximum number of strings that can be selected is the sum over all leaves (strings of length n) of the number of times they are selected. But how to model this?\n\nAlternatively, the maximum number of strings that can be selected is determined by the minimal capacities along the paths. For example, for a string to be selected, all its prefixes must have their capacities sufficient to allow this. So, perhaps the maximum number of strings is determined by the sum of the minimum capacities along the paths. Wait, not sure.\n\nAnother approach is to model this as a tree where each node has a capacity c_s, and the problem is to select as many leaves (strings of length n) as possible such that for each node, the number of leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s. Wait, that makes sense. Because each leaf in the subtree of s contributes to the count of s's capacity. So, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected is the maximum number of leaves such that for each node s, the number of selected leaves in the subtree rooted at s is ≤ c_s.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to: given a trie (each node represents a binary string, with children being the extensions by 0 and 1), and capacities c_s for each node, compute the maximum number of leaves (strings of length n) that can be selected such that for each node s, the number of selected leaves in its subtree is ≤ c_s.\n\nIf that's the case, then the maximum number of leaves (the maximum size of a beautiful multiset) is the same as the maximum number of leaves that can be selected under these constraints.\n\nNow, the question is, given the capacities c_s, how to compute this maximum. Then, we need to count the number of assignments of c_s (each c_s is between 0 and k, inclusive) such that this maximum equals exactly f.\n\nBut how to compute that maximum for a given set of c_s? Let's think recursively. For each node, the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in its subtree is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves that can be selected in each of its children's subtrees. Wait, that might be the case.\n\nLet me think. Suppose I have a node s of length l. Its children are s0 and s1 (strings of length l+1). The maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is limited by c_s. Also, the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is the sum of the leaves from the left and right subtrees. But this sum can't exceed c_s. However, the leaves in the left and right subtrees can be chosen up to their own capacities. So, the maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is min(c_s, left_max + right_max).\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each leaf in the left subtree of s contributes to the count of s's capacity. Similarly for the right. So, the total number of leaves in the subtree of s can't exceed c_s. Therefore, for each node, the maximum number of leaves is the minimum between c_s and the sum of the maximum leaves from its children.\n\nBut for leaves (nodes of length n), they have no children. So, their maximum is 1 if allowed by their capacity (c_s), but since they have no children, the sum is zero. So for a leaf node, the maximum is min(c_s, 0 + 0) = min(c_s, 0) = 0? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, for a node s of length l < n, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is the sum of the maxima of its children. But for a node s of length n (a leaf in the trie), the subtree is just itself. So, the maximum number of leaves in the subtree is 1 (if allowed by c_s). Wait, but how?\n\nLet me rephrase. The maximum number of leaves in the subtree of s is the number of leaves that can be selected in that subtree. For a node s of length l < n, the maximum is the sum of the maxima of its children, but constrained by c_s. For example, suppose s has two children, left and right. Each can contribute some leaves. The sum of their contributions is the maximum number of leaves that can be selected under s's capacity. But the sum can't exceed c_s. So, the maximum for s is min( c_s, left_max + right_max ). \n\nFor a node s of length n (a leaf in the trie), the subtree is only itself. So, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1, but this can't exceed c_s. So the maximum is min( c_s, 1 ). \n\nAh! That makes sense. So, the way to compute the maximum is recursively:\n\ndef max_leaves(s):\n    if s is a leaf (length == n):\n        return min(c_s, 1)\n    else:\n        left = max_leaves(s0)\n        right = max_leaves(s1)\n        return min( c_s, left + right )\n\nSo, the maximum size of the beautiful multiset is the value of max_leaves(root), where the root is the empty string? No, wait. The root here would be the empty string, but the problem says that the strings in the multiset are of length exactly n. So perhaps the root is not considered. Wait, the root (empty string) is not part of the problem's constraints. The constraints are for s of length 1 to n.\n\nBut the trie structure includes all prefixes. So for example, the root is the empty string, but the problem's constraints start from length 1. So, the maximum number of leaves is computed by starting from the root's children (the strings of length 1). But perhaps the initial approach is correct.\n\nWait, but the root's children are the strings of length 1. The maximum number of leaves in the entire trie (the root's subtree) is min(c_root, ... ), but the problem doesn't have a c_root. Because the problem says that the constraints are for s of length 1 to n. So the root (empty string) isn't considered. Therefore, the root isn't part of the constraints. So, the maximum number of leaves would be computed for the root's children (strings of length 1) and their capacities. But how?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The maximum number of leaves is determined by the constraints for all prefixes. For example, each leaf (string of length n) contributes to all its prefixes. So, the constraints for each prefix must be satisfied. \n\nBut according to the previous logic, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the recursive function that starts at the root (empty string) and computes min(c_root, ...), but since there's no c_root, perhaps that's not the case. So maybe the root is not part of the constraints, and the actual computation starts from the nodes of length 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the root isn't part of the problem's constraints. So the problem's constraints are for all prefixes of length 1 to n. Therefore, the root's children (strings of length 1) are the first level. So, the maximum number of leaves is computed as follows:\n\nFor the root's children (strings of length 1), each can have their own subtree. For each of these, the maximum number of leaves in their subtree is min(c_s, ... ), and the total maximum is the sum of those for the root's children, but since the root isn't part of the constraints, there's no upper limit. Wait, but the root's children (strings of length 1) can have their own constraints. But the root isn't part of the problem's constraints. So, perhaps the maximum number of leaves is the sum of the max_leaves for each of the root's children. However, since the root isn't part of the constraints, there's no cap on the sum. \n\nWait, but that can't be. Because each leaf contributes to the count of all its prefixes. For example, a string of length n contributes to all its prefixes of length 1 to n. The constraints for each of these prefixes must be satisfied. Therefore, the maximum number of leaves is determined by the constraints of all prefixes. \n\nSo, the initial approach of computing for each node s (with length l from 1 to n) the maximum number of leaves in its subtree (i.e., the number of leaves that have s as a prefix) is min(c_s, sum of children's max_leaves). \n\nThen, the maximum number of leaves is the sum of the max_leaves of the root's children (strings of length 1), since there's no constraint on the root. \n\nBut the root's children are the strings of length 1, which have their own constraints. So, the maximum number of leaves is the sum of the max_leaves of the root's children. However, since the root's children are not constrained by any parent (except the root, which isn't part of the constraints), their max_leaves can be as per their own constraints. \n\nSo, the overall maximum is the sum of the max_leaves of the two root children (since the root has two children: '0' and '1'). \n\nWait, but the root's children are the strings of length 1. So, the maximum number of leaves is the sum of the max_leaves for each of these. But how does this fit into the earlier recursive formula?\n\nLet me think of the root's children as nodes of length 1. Each of these nodes has their own max_leaves computed as min(c_s, sum of their children's max_leaves). And the overall maximum is the sum of the max_leaves of the root's children. \n\nYes, that makes sense. Because each string in the multiset is a leaf (length n), and each such string contributes to the count of its prefixes. So, the total number of leaves is the sum of the max_leaves for each of the root's children. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to: for a given set of c_s values, compute the maximum number of leaves (the sum of the max_leaves of the root's children) as described. And we need to count the number of c_s assignments where this maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut how do we compute this for all possible c_s assignments? Since n can be up to 15, the number of nodes (binary strings of length 1 to n) is 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^n = 2^(n+1) - 2. For n=15, that's 2^16-2 = 65534 nodes. Which is manageable for dynamic programming approaches, but the problem requires considering all possible c_s values (each from 0 to k) and counting those where the maximum is exactly f.\n\nBut directly iterating over all possible c_s assignments is impossible since the number is (k+1)^(number of nodes) which is way too big.\n\nThus, we need a smarter approach. Let's think of the problem in terms of dynamic programming on the trie structure.\n\nThe key insight is that the maximum number of leaves depends on the c_s values in a way that can be represented as a tree DP. For each node, the value of max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, sum of children's max_leaves). \n\nBut since the nodes are structured as a binary tree (each node has two children), we can process them in a bottom-up manner. Starting from the leaves (nodes of length n) and moving up to the root.\n\nFor each node, the value of max_leaves(s) is determined by the c_s and the values of its children. However, since the c_s can vary, we need to find for each node the possible values of max_leaves(s) given the possible choices of c_s and the possible values of its children.\n\nBut how can we model this? For each node, the value of max_leaves(s) depends on the choice of c_s and the sum of the children's max_leaves. Let's denote for a node s, the sum of the children's max_leaves as S. Then, the value for s is min(c_s, S). \n\nBut since c_s can be chosen between 0 and k, for a given S, the value of min(c_s, S) can be anything from 0 to min(S, k). However, the choice of c_s affects the value. For example, if S is fixed, then choosing c_s >= S will result in min(c_s, S) = S, while choosing c_s < S will give min(c_s, S) = c_s.\n\nBut since the max_leaves(s) is determined by this, and the problem requires that the total maximum (sum of root's children's max_leaves) is exactly f, perhaps we can model this with dynamic programming, considering for each node the possible ways to choose c_s and the resulting value of max_leaves(s), and track the number of ways to reach a certain total.\n\nBut given that n is up to 15, and for each node, the number of possible values for max_leaves(s) could be up to something like k (since for a node with children sum S, the max_leaves is min(c_s, S)), which for S up to f (assuming f is up to 2e5) could be manageable with memoization.\n\nHowever, even for n=15, the number of nodes is 65534, and for each node, the DP state would track the possible values of max_leaves(s). This seems computationally intensive, but perhaps manageable with some optimizations.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of generating functions. For each node, we can compute the number of ways to choose c_s such that, given the possible values of the children, the max_leaves(s) is a certain value.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think recursively. For a node s, suppose we have already computed for each of its children (s0 and s1) the possible values of their max_leaves, and for each possible value, the number of ways to achieve it. Then, for node s, the sum of the children's max_leaves is S = a + b, where a is the value from s0 and b from s1. Then, for node s, the max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, S). The choice of c_s can be anything between 0 and k. However, the choice of c_s affects the value of min(c_s, S). For each possible value x that min(c_s, S) can take, we can calculate how many ways there are to choose c_s such that min(c_s, S) = x.\n\nFor example, if S is fixed, then for node s, the possible x values are between 0 and min(S, k). For each x, the number of c_s that result in x is:\n\n- If x < S: then c_s must be exactly x. So 1 way (if x <=k).\n- If x = S: then c_s can be any value >= S and <=k. So (k - S + 1) ways, provided S <=k. Otherwise, if S >k, then no way (since x can't be more than k).\n\nWait, no. For example, if S is fixed, then min(c_s, S) = x. So:\n\n- If x < S: then c_s must be exactly x. Because if c_s is larger than x but less than S, then min(c_s, S) would be c_s, which is larger than x. So, only when c_s =x, then min(c_s, S) is x. So for x < S, the number of ways is 1 if x ≤k, else 0.\n- If x = S: then c_s can be any value ≥ S and ≤k. So the number of ways is max(0, k - S + 1) if S ≤k, else 0.\n\nBut for a node s, the value of S is the sum of the children's max_leaves. So, for each possible pair of values (a, b) from the children, S = a + b. Then, for node s, the possible x is min(c_s, a + b). \n\nBut how to aggregate this across all possibilities?\n\nThe approach would be for each node, to compute a DP table that maps the possible value of max_leaves(s) (call it x) to the number of ways to choose c_s and the children's configurations to achieve that x.\n\nLet me formalize this. For each node, we can represent the possible ways as a dictionary (or array) dp[s][x] = number of ways to assign c_s and the children's configurations such that the max_leaves(s) is x.\n\nFor the base case, when the node is a leaf (length n), its children are none. So, for a leaf node s, the sum of the children's max_leaves is 0. Then, the max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, 0 + 0) = min(c_s, 0) = 0. Wait, but earlier analysis said that for a leaf node, the max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, 1). What's wrong here?\n\nAh! Here's the mistake. Earlier, I thought that for a node of length n (a leaf in the trie), the max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, 1). But according to the recursive formula, it's min(c_s, sum of children's max_leaves). However, for a leaf node (length n), it has no children. So the sum of children's max_leaves is zero. Hence, the formula gives min(c_s, 0). But that can't be correct. Because for a leaf node, the subtree consists of itself. So the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1, provided that c_s allows it. \n\nWait, this suggests that my earlier reasoning was incorrect. Let me re-examine the logic.\n\nThe function max_leaves(s) is supposed to represent the maximum number of leaves that can be selected in the subtree rooted at s. For a leaf node (length n), the subtree consists of only the node itself. So, the maximum number of leaves in its subtree is 1 if c_s ≥ 1, otherwise 0. Because the node itself can be selected once (as a leaf) only if its capacity allows. \n\nSo, for a node s of length l = n, the max_leaves(s) is min(c_s, 1). \n\nBut according to the previous formula, it would be min(c_s, sum of children's max_leaves). But for a leaf node, there are no children. So, the sum is zero, and min(c_s, 0) would be zero. Which contradicts the correct value. \n\nAh, I see the error. The previous formula was wrong. Let me correct it. \n\nThe correct formula for the max_leaves(s) is:\n\nIf s is a leaf (length n):\n\nmax_leaves(s) = min(c_s, 1)\n\nElse:\n\nmax_leaves(s) = min( c_s, left_max + right_max )\n\nBecause, for non-leaf nodes, the maximum number of leaves in their subtree is the sum of the maximum leaves from their children, but cannot exceed their capacity. For a leaf node, the maximum is 1 (the node itself) if allowed by c_s.\n\nSo, the previous reasoning was missing this base case. So, the recursive formula is:\n\ndef compute_max(s):\n    if s is a leaf:\n        return min(c_s, 1)\n    else:\n        left = compute_max(s0)\n        right = compute_max(s1)\n        return min(c_s, left + right)\n\nThis makes more sense.\n\nNow, for the root's children (nodes of length 1), their compute_max is min(c_s, left + right), where left and right are the compute_max of their children (nodes of length 2). And so on.\n\nSo, the problem is to compute for all possible c_s assignments, the value of compute_max applied to the root's children (summing them), and count how many assignments have this sum equal to exactly f.\n\nNow, the challenge is to model this with dynamic programming, considering all possible nodes and their possible values.\n\nLet's think of the nodes in levels, from level 1 (length 1) up to level n (length n). For each node, we can compute the number of ways to assign c_s such that, given the possible values of the children, the compute_max for this node is x.\n\nFor example, for a node of level n (leaf), the compute_max is min(c_s, 1). So, for this node, the possible values of x are 0 or 1. The number of ways to choose c_s such that x is achieved is:\n\n- For x=0: c_s can be 0. So 1 way (if k >=0, which it always is).\n- For x=1: c_s can be 1, 2, ..., k. So (k - 1 + 1) = k ways, if k >=1. Else 0.\n\nWait, but the c_s can be from 0 to k. So for x=1, min(c_s, 1) =1 implies c_s ≥1. So the number of ways is (k - 1 + 1) if k ≥1, else 0. So yes, k ways if k ≥1, else 0.\n\nBut for a leaf node, the compute_max is x, and the number of ways to choose c_s for this node given x is:\n\nways_leaf(x) = \n   if x == 0: 1 (c_s must be 0)\n   elif x == 1: (k - 1 + 1) = k (if k >=1)\n   else: 0\n\nBut for the leaf node, x can be 0 or 1.\n\nNow, for a non-leaf node (level l < n), compute_max is min(c_s, left + right), where left and right are the compute_max of the children. \n\nSo, for such a node, given that the children have certain possible values, we can compute the sum of their compute_max (S = left + right), and then the compute_max for the current node is min(c_s, S).\n\nSo, for this node, the number of ways to choose c_s and the children's configurations such that the compute_max is x is:\n\nFor each possible combination of left and right values (a and b) leading to S = a + b, and for each possible x, the number of ways is the product of the ways for left and right multiplied by the number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, S) = x.\n\nBut how to aggregate this across all possible a and b?\n\nLet me think. For a non-leaf node, the children are s0 and s1. Let's assume that for each child, we have a DP table that maps possible values to the number of ways. For example, for s0, we have dp0[x] = number of ways to assign c_s for s0's subtree such that compute_max(s0) is x. Similarly for s1.\n\nThen, for the current node, we can combine these two DPs. For each possible a (value from s0) and b (value from s1), we can compute S = a + b. Then, for this S, the current node's compute_max is min(c_s, S). For each possible x, the number of ways to choose c_s and the children's configurations leading to x is the sum over all a and b where S = a + b of (dp0[a] * dp1[b]) * ways_to_choose_c_s_for_this_S_and_x.\n\nSo, the DP for the current node is built by combining the DPs of its children.\n\nThis seems feasible. Now, the problem is to compute for each node, the DP table of possible x values and their counts.\n\nBut for n up to 15, the maximum depth is 15, and for each node, the number of possible x values could be up to the sum of the children's x values, which for the root's children could be up to f (since the problem requires the total to be f). However, since f can be up to 2e5, and for each node, the DP tables could be up to O(f) in size, this may be manageable.\n\nBut considering that for each node, the DP tables can be merged from the children, and for each node, the number of possible x values depends on the possible sums of the children's x values, we need to find an efficient way to compute this.\n\nMoreover, since the nodes are processed in a bottom-up manner (starting from the leaves), we can build the DP tables for each node based on their children.\n\nLet's outline the steps:\n\n1. Generate all nodes in the trie, organized by their depth (length). For each node, we need to know its children (if any).\n\nBut since the nodes are binary strings, perhaps we can represent them as tuples of bits, or just track their depth and position. However, for n up to 15, the total number of nodes is manageable.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to generate the nodes in a hierarchical way, processing them level by level, starting from depth n (the leaves) and going up to depth 1.\n\nFor example, for depth l (from n down to 1):\n\n- For each node at depth l, if l == n, then it's a leaf. Compute its DP table.\n- Else, for each node, compute its DP table based on the DPs of its children (which are at depth l+1).\n\nOnce we have the DP tables for the root's children (depth 1), the total maximum is the sum of their compute_max values. But wait, no. The root's children are the nodes of depth 1. The compute_max for each of them is the maximum number of leaves in their subtree. The total maximum number of leaves is the sum of the compute_max of the root's children.\n\nWait, no. The root's children are the nodes of depth 1. Each of their compute_max is the maximum number of leaves in their subtree. Since the entire trie is rooted at the empty string, and the root's children are the two nodes of depth 1, the total number of leaves in the entire trie is the sum of the compute_max of the root's children.\n\nSo, for the entire problem, the value we are interested in is the sum of the compute_max of the root's two children (the nodes of depth 1). Thus, our final answer is the number of ways to assign c_s values such that this sum is exactly f.\n\nTherefore, the plan is:\n\n- For each node, compute its DP table (possible x values and counts).\n- For the root's children (depth 1 nodes), compute their DP tables, then combine them to get the sum of their x values and count the number of ways where this sum is f.\n\nBut how to combine the DPs of the two root children. Let's say for each root child (left and right), we have their DP tables, which are dp_left[x] and dp_right[y]. The total sum is x + y. We need to count the number of pairs (x, y) such that x + y = f, multiplied by dp_left[x] * dp_right[y].\n\nSo, the problem reduces to, after building the DPs for the two root children, perform a convolution-like operation to find the count of (x, y) pairs where x + y = f.\n\nNow, the key is to compute for each node, the DP table. Let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, for the leaves (depth n), their DP tables are as follows:\n\nFor a leaf node, the possible x is 0 or 1.\n\nways for x=0: 1 (c_s must be 0)\nways for x=1: k (if k ≥1, else 0)\n\nSo, for each leaf node, the DP is {0: 1, 1: k} if k ≥1, else {0:1}.\n\nBut since the problem allows k to be up to 2e5, and for each leaf node, this is manageable.\n\nNext, for a non-leaf node (depth l < n). Let's say it has two children, left and right. For each child, we have their DP tables. For the current node, we need to compute the possible x values based on the sum of the children's x values (S = a + b) and the choice of c_s for this node.\n\nFor each possible a and b (values from left and right DPs), compute S = a + b. Then, for the current node, the possible x is min(c_s, S). The number of ways for this x is the product of the ways for a and b multiplied by the number of ways to choose c_s for this node to get x from S.\n\nSo, for each possible S, we can precompute how many ways there are to choose c_s for this node to get a particular x.\n\nLet me think of this as follows. For a given S, the number of ways to choose c_s such that min(c_s, S) = x is:\n\nif x == 0: only if c_s is 0. So 1 way if 0 ≤k. Which is always true.\n\nif x == 1: c_s must be 1, but only if S ≥1. Because if S is 0, then min(c_s, 0) is 0, which can't be 1. So for x to be 1, S must be ≥1 and c_s must be 1. So the number of ways is 1 if S ≥1 and 1 ≤k, else 0.\n\nWait, no. For a given S, the possible x can be any value between 0 and min(S, k). \n\nWait, for a given S, the min(c_s, S) can be any x such that x ≤ min(S, k). \n\nFor example, if S is 5 and k is 3, then min(c_s, 5) can be 0, 1, 2, 3.\n\nSo, for each x in 0..min(S, k), the number of ways to choose c_s is:\n\nif x < S: 1 way (c_s =x)\nif x == S: (k - S + 1) ways (if S ≤k) else 0.\n\nBut if x > S, it's impossible.\n\nSo, for a given S, the number of ways to get x is:\n\nif x > min(S, k): 0\n\nelse:\n\nif x < S: 1\n\nif x == S: max(0, k - S + 1)\n\nSo, for each S, and for each possible x, we can compute this count.\n\nBut how do we incorporate this into the DP for the current node?\n\nThe approach is as follows:\n\nFor the current node, we need to consider all possible combinations of a and b (from left and right children's DPs), compute S = a + b, and then for each possible x, accumulate the count of ways for this x by multiplying the number of ways for a and b by the number of ways to choose c_s for this S and x.\n\nSo, for the current node, the DP table is initialized as empty. Then, for each a in left_dp, and b in right_dp:\n\n   S = a + b\n\n   for each possible x that can be obtained from S:\n\n       ways = left_dp[a] * right_dp[b] * ways_for_c_s(S, x)\n\n       add this to current_dp[x]\n\nBut how to efficiently compute this for all possible a and b?\n\nThis seems computationally intensive, but for small n (up to 15), and considering that the maximum possible x for each node's DP is up to the sum of the children's maximum x, which for the root's children could be up to f (which is up to 2e5), it's manageable with some optimizations.\n\nBut for n=15, the number of nodes is 2^1 + ... + 2^15 = 2^16 - 2 = 65534. For each node, the DP tables could be up to size O(f). However, for each node, the maximum possible x is the sum of the children's maximum x. For example, for the root's children (depth 1), their maximum x could be up to 2 * (some value). But for the worst case, it's possible that the sum could be up to f, which is 2e5. \n\nBut even with that, for each node, the DP tables could be up to O(f) in size. For 65534 nodes, that's O(65534 * f) operations",
