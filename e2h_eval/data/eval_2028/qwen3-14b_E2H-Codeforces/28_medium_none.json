String s is beautiful if it meets the following criteria:   String s only consists of characters 0 and 1, at that character 0 must occur in string s exactly n times, and character 1 must occur exactly m times.  We can obtain character g from string s with some (possibly, zero) number of modifications. The character g equals either zero or one. A modification of string with length at least two is the following operation: we replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero. For example, one modification transforms string \"01010\" into string \"0100\", two modifications transform it to \"011\". It is forbidden to modify a string with length less than two.Help the Bear, count the number of beautiful strings. As the number of beautiful strings can be rather large, print the remainder after dividing the number by 1000000007 (109 + 7). \n\n## Input\nThe first line of the input contains three space-separated integers n, m, g (0 ≤ n, m ≤ 105, n + m ≥ 1, 0 ≤ g ≤ 1).\n\n## Output\nPrint a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo 1000000007 (109 + 7).\n\n## Example\n### Input\n['1 1 0', '2 2 0', '1 1 1']\n\n### Output\n['2', '4', '0']\n\n## Note\nIn the first sample the beautiful strings are: \"01\", \"10\".In the second sample the beautiful strings are: \"0011\", \"1001\", \"1010\", \"1100\".In the third sample there are no beautiful strings.\n\nYour task is to solve the problem above by writing a Python script that reads input from standard input (stdin) and prints the desired outputs to standard output (stdout).

Your code should be ready to run and should not include any additional explanations or comments."

    "thought": "\nOkay, let's try to understand this problem. So we need to count the number of beautiful strings based on given n, m, and g. The beautiful string has exactly n zeros and m ones. But there's this modification process involved. The key is figuring out what conditions must be satisfied for a string to be considered beautiful, considering that it can be modified into the character g through some operations.\n\nFirst, let me re-read the problem statement to make sure I get the modification rules right. The modification operation replaces the last two characters with one. For example, if you have two zeros, you replace them with a one. If you have two ones, replace with a zero. Otherwise, like if they are different, then replacing them with zero or one? Wait, no. Wait the problem says: \"replace two last characters from the string by exactly one other character. This character equals one if it replaces two zeros, otherwise it equals zero.\" Oh right. So, if the two last characters are both 0s, replace with 1. Otherwise, replace with 0. So, for example, if the last two are 0 and 1, you replace them with 0. If they are 1 and 0, same thing. If they are 1 and 1, replace with 0.\n\nSo the modification process reduces the length of the string by 1 each time. And the process can be done multiple times. The problem says that the string s can be modified into the character g. So the final result after any number of modifications (possibly zero) must be equal to g. \n\nBut how does this affect the original string? Let's think about what's required for the string s to be able to be reduced to g through these operations.\n\nLet me think recursively. Suppose the string s can be modified down to a single character. Let's consider the parity of the number of operations. Each operation reduces the length by 1. So starting from a string of length L = n + m, after k operations, the length is L - k. To reach a single character, we need L - k = 1 → k = L - 1. So the total number of operations is L-1. But the problem says that the string can be modified into g with some number of operations. However, the problem states that the string s must be such that after some (possibly zero) number of modifications, we get g. So it's possible that the string is already of length 1. For example, if the original string is just '0' and g is 0, then it's valid.\n\nBut how do the operations affect the final result? Let's think about the process of reducing the string step by step. Each operation replaces the last two characters with a new one. The value of this new character depends on the two characters being replaced. \n\nLet me think of this as a binary operation. Let's model the process. Suppose we have a string S. The way the modifications work is similar to a stack-like process. Each time, we take the last two elements and replace them with a new one. The new value is 1 if the two were 00, else 0. \n\nWait, but the order in which we perform the operations might affect the final result. However, perhaps the final result depends only on the count of 0s and 1s, and their parity? Or maybe not. Hmm. Let's think of some examples.\n\nTake the first sample input: n=1, m=1. The possible strings are \"01\" and \"10\". Let's see how they can be modified. For \"01\", the length is 2. So we can perform one modification. The last two characters are 0 and 1. Since they are not both 0s, the replacement is 0. So the resulting string is \"0\", which matches g=0. Similarly for \"10\", the same process gives 0. So both strings are valid. Hence the answer is 2, which matches the sample.\n\nIn the third sample input, n=1, m=1, g=1. Then, the same strings would reduce to 0, which doesn't match g=1. So the answer is 0.\n\nSo the key is to find for a given n and m, the possible ways that after applying some modifications (possibly none), the final result is g. \n\nBut how can we model this?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's denote that the final result after all possible operations is determined by the initial counts of 0s and 1s. But how?\n\nLet me think about the process as follows: Each operation reduces the string by one character. The final character is determined by the entire sequence of operations. But since each operation is combining the last two characters, perhaps the order of operations doesn't matter in terms of the final outcome. Wait, but that seems unlikely. For example, consider a string \"000\". Let's see:\n\nOption 1: Combine the first two 0s into 1, resulting in \"10\". Then combine those two into 0. Final result is 0.\n\nOption 2: Combine the last two 0s into 1, resulting in \"01\". Then combine into 0. Same result.\n\nAnother example: \"0011\". Let's see. Let's suppose we have to reduce it to one character. Let's see the steps. Let's take the last two characters (1 and 1) → replace with 0. Now the string is \"000\". Then combine last two 0s into 1 → \"01\", then combine into 0. Alternatively, another path: combine the first two 0s into 1, making \"111\". Then combine last two 1s into 0 → \"10\", then combine into 0. So regardless of the order, the final result is 0. So perhaps the final result depends only on the initial counts of 0s and 1s, and their parity?\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the final result depends on the parity of the number of 0s and the number of 1s. Let's think about the process of combining pairs. Let me think of the entire process as a binary tree. Each operation combines two characters into one. The final result depends on the way the operations are done, but perhaps there's a pattern based on the counts.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a function f(s) that returns the final character after applying all possible operations. What's the value of f(s)?\n\nLet me consider the following: Each time two characters are combined. Let's think of the entire process as a series of operations that combine pairs. Let's think about the parity of the number of 0s. Because each operation can change the count of 0s and 1s.\n\nFor example, when two 0s are replaced with a 1: the count of 0s decreases by 2, and the count of 1s increases by 1. When two 1s are replaced with a 0: the count of 1s decreases by 2, and the count of 0s increases by 1. When two different characters are replaced with 0: the count of 0s increases by 1 (since one of the characters was a 0 and one was a 1; replacing them with 0: total 0s is (original 0 count -1) +1 = same as original? Wait, original count of 0s: suppose we have a 0 and a 1. Replacing them with 0: the count of 0s is (original 0 count -1) + 1 (the new 0) = same as original. Similarly for 1s: original count is (original 1 count -1) + 0 (since the new character is 0). So the 1 count decreases by 1. \n\nBut this seems complicated. Let me think of the entire process. The final result is determined by the initial counts of 0s and 1s. Let me think of the following: the final character is determined by the parity of the number of 0s and 1s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as a way to compute some function based on the counts. Let's think about the number of 0s and 1s. Let's say we have a total number of characters, which is L = n + m. We need to perform L-1 operations to get down to one character. Let's think about how the operations affect the counts.\n\nEach operation reduces the length by 1. So for the entire process, the total number of operations is L-1. But how does the final character depend on the initial counts?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the process as a binary operation where the order of combining doesn't matter. Let me think of the final result as being determined by the XOR of the counts. Or maybe something else.\n\nWait, here's an idea. Let's think of the process as equivalent to computing the parity of the number of 0s. Let me think of some examples.\n\nCase 1: All 0s. For example, n=2, m=0. The string is \"00\". One operation replaces them with 1. So the final result is 1. Which is (n mod 2) = 0? No. Hmm.\n\nAnother example: n=3, m=0. The string is \"000\". Let's process it. First, combine last two 0s → 1. Now the string is \"01\". Combine them → 0. So final result is 0. So for n=3 (odd), the result is 0. For n=2 (even), the result is 1. For n=1 (odd), the result is 0. For n=4 (even), let's see: \"0000\". Combine last two → 1, string is \"001\". Combine last two (0 and 1) → 0. String is \"00\". Combine → 1. So final result is 1. So for even numbers of 0s, the final result is 1. For odd numbers of 0s, the final result is 0. But wait, in this case, m=0. So the initial string is all 0s. So the final result depends on whether the number of 0s is even or odd. Let me check:\n\nIf the number of 0s is k. Then the final result is 1 if k is even, 0 if k is odd? Because for k=1, the result is 0. For k=2, result is 1. For k=3, 0. For k=4, 1. Yes. So that seems to hold.\n\nNow, what if there are some 1s? Let's take the case where n=1 and m=1. The string is \"01\". Combining gives 0. Which is the same as the parity of the number of 0s. Wait, n=1 (odd) → 0. Which matches. What about n=2 and m=2. Let's take the sample input where the output is 4. For example, the string \"0011\". Let's see:\n\nProcessing steps. Let's try to combine all pairs. Let's take the last two 1s. Replace with 0. Now the string is \"000\". Then combine last two 0s to get 1. Now the string is \"01\". Combine to get 0. So the final result is 0. But according to the sample input, when n=2, m=2, and g=0, the answer is 4. So in this case, the final result is 0. Which is the same as the parity of the number of 0s (n=2, even) → 1? Wait no. Wait earlier example for all 0s, the parity of the count of 0s determines the final result. But in this case, the count of 0s is 2 (even), but the final result is 0. Which contradicts that hypothesis. So maybe the previous idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so what's going on here. Let's think again. For the case where the string is \"0011\", which has two 0s and two 1s. Let's see the steps again. Another way to process the string: combine first two 0s into 1. Now the string is \"111\". Then combine last two 1s into 0. Now the string is \"10\". Combine into 0. So final result is 0. So regardless of the order, the result is 0. Now, what's the parity of the number of 0s? It's even (2). But the result is 0. So in this case, the parity of the number of 0s is even, but the result is 0. Which is not the same as the previous case. So perhaps the previous idea is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parity of the number of 0s plus the number of 1s. Well, that's fixed. Because the total length is L = n + m. So that's not helpful.\n\nWait, but in the example where the string is \"0011\", the total number of 0s is 2 and 1s is 2. The sum is 4, even. The final result is 0. In the case of all 0s with count 2 (even), the final result is 1. So that's conflicting. So the previous idea is not correct.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the entire process as a way to compute the parity of the number of 1s. Or something else. Let's think of the process as a way to compute some value based on the counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet me think of the process as follows. Each operation reduces the string by one character. The final character is determined by the entire sequence of operations. Let me think of the final character as being determined by the initial counts of 0s and 1s, and the way they are combined.\n\nLet me think of the process as a function f(n, m) that returns the final character (0 or 1) after all possible operations. How can we compute this function?\n\nLet me think recursively. Let's say that for a string with n 0s and m 1s, the final character is determined by the following:\n\nIf the total number of characters is 1, then it's the character itself.\n\nOtherwise, we can perform an operation on the last two characters. But the problem is that the two characters could be 0 and 0, 0 and 1, 1 and 0, or 1 and 1. However, since the order of operations may not affect the final result, perhaps we can model it as follows:\n\nThe final result depends on the parity of the number of 0s and the parity of the number of 1s. Or perhaps on the difference between them.\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as equivalent to the XOR of the counts of 0s and 1s. Not sure.\n\nLet me think of the example where the string is \"0011\" (n=2, m=2). The final result is 0. Let's see:\n\nWhat is the parity of the number of 0s (even) and the parity of the number of 1s (even). So both even. The result is 0. \n\nAnother example: all 0s with count 2 (even). The result is 1. Here, the parity of 0s is even, parity of 1s is even (zero). The result is 1. So that's different. So that suggests that the result depends on more than just the parity of the counts.\n\nAlternative approach: Let's think of the process as a way to compute the parity of the number of 1s modulo something. Let me think of the following:\n\nEach time we replace two 0s with a 1, that adds 1 to the count of 1s and subtracts 2 from the count of 0s. Similarly, replacing two 1s with a 0 subtracts 2 from the count of 1s and adds 1 to the count of 0s. Replacing two different characters (0 and 1 or 1 and 0) with 0 subtracts 1 from the count of 1s and leaves the count of 0s unchanged (since one 0 and one 1 are removed, and a 0 is added: net 0 for 0s, -1 for 1s).\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps there's an invariant here. Let me think of the value of (number of 0s - number of 1s) modulo something. \n\nLet me try for the case of all 0s. Let's say n=2, m=0. The final result is 1. The initial (n - m) is 2. After one operation, the count becomes 0 0s and 1 1. So (n - m) is -1. The final result is 1. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother example: n=1, m=1. The result is 0. Initial (n - m) is 0. Final is 0. \n\nAnother example: n=2, m=2. The result is 0. Initial (n - m) is 0. \n\nAnother example: n=3, m=0. The result is 0. Initial (n - m) is 3. \n\nHmm, not seeing a pattern here.\n\nAlternative idea: Let's think of the entire process as a way to compute the parity of the number of 1s in the original string. For example, in the case of all 0s (n=2, m=0), the number of 1s is 0 (even), and the final result is 1. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the final result is determined by the parity of the number of operations that replace two 0s. But that seems too vague.\n\nLet me think of the process as a binary operation. Suppose that during the entire reduction process, every time two characters are replaced, the value of the new character depends on the pair. Let's think of the entire process as a binary tree, where each node represents a character, and the leaves are the original characters. The root is the final character. The way the tree is built depends on the order of operations. But perhaps for the purposes of the final character, the order doesn't matter. \n\nLet me think of the final character as being determined by the following: the number of times a pair of 0s is replaced. Because each such replacement adds a 1. But this seems unclear.\n\nWait, here's a thought. Let's imagine that we have a certain number of 0s and 1s. Let's consider the following:\n\nEach operation reduces the number of characters by 1. The final character is determined by the entire process. Let me think of the following invariant: the parity of the number of 1s in the string plus the number of operations that replaced two 0s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the problem as similar to evaluating a binary expression tree. For example, each operation is combining two nodes into one. The value of the final node depends on the combination rules.\n\nBut how can we find a formula for this?\n\nLet me think of the following: Let's consider that the final result depends on the parity of the total number of 0s and the parity of the total number of 1s. Wait, but how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the entire process as a series of reductions. Each time two characters are combined, and the way they are combined depends on their values. Let me think of the following:\n\nLet me define a function f(a, b) that returns the result of combining two characters a and b. According to the problem's rules:\n\nIf a and b are both 0, then the result is 1.\n\nIf a and b are both 1, then the result is 0.\n\nOtherwise, the result is 0.\n\nSo, f(0,0) = 1, f(0,1)=0, f(1,0)=0, f(1,1)=0.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that when you replace two last characters, the new character is 1 if they are two zeros, otherwise 0. So regardless of whether the two are 0 and 1, or 1 and 0, or two 1s, the result is 0. So for any pair that is not two zeros, the result is 0.\n\nSo, combining two characters a and b gives:\n\nif a == 0 and b == 0: 1\n\nelse: 0.\n\nThis is interesting. So the combination function is:\n\nresult = 1 if a == b == 0 else 0.\n\nSo now, the problem is to find the final value after combining all characters using this operation, regardless of the order. But how can we find this value based on the initial counts of 0s and 1s?\n\nLet me think of the following: the final result depends on the number of times we have pairs of 0s that are combined. Because each such pair produces a 1, which can then be combined with other characters.\n\nBut this seems recursive. Let me think of the following:\n\nSuppose we have a string with k zeros and l ones. Let's think about the entire process of combining them. How can we model the final result?\n\nLet me consider the following cases:\n\nCase 1: There are no zeros. Then all characters are 1. So combining any two gives 0. Let's see: if l is 1, then the result is 1. If l is 2, combining gives 0. If l is 3: combine two 1s → 0, then combine with remaining 1 → 0. So the result is 0. For l=4: combine two 1s to 0, then combine with another 1 to 0, then combine with the last 1 to 0. So the final result is 0. So for l >= 2, the result is 0. For l=1, result is 1.\n\nCase 2: There are no ones. Then all are zeros. As discussed earlier, the result depends on the parity of the number of zeros. If even, result is 1; if odd, 0.\n\nCase 3: Both zeros and ones present. Let's think of this as a combination of the two.\n\nLet me think of the following: the presence of ones may allow us to reduce the number of zeros. For example, combining a 0 and a 1 gives 0. So combining them doesn't change the count of zeros (since one 0 is removed, and a new 0 is added). But combining two 0s gives a 1, which reduces the number of zeros by two and increases the number of ones by one.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Perhaps we can model the problem as follows:\n\nLet me think of the entire process as follows. The final result depends on the parity of the number of 0s minus the number of 1s, or something similar. Or perhaps the parity of the number of 0s.\n\nBut let's think about the following: For the final result to be g, what conditions must be met?\n\nLet me consider that the entire process is equivalent to the following:\n\nThe final result is 0 if and only if the number of 0s is congruent to some value modulo something, and similarly for 1.\n\nLet me think of the following: Let's consider that during the entire process, each time two 0s are combined, they produce a 1. Each time two 1s are combined, they produce a 0. Any other combination (0 and 1, or 1 and 0) produces a 0.\n\nLet me think about the parity of the number of 0s. Let me think of the following:\n\nSuppose there are k zeros and l ones. The total number of characters is T = k + l. We need to perform T-1 operations to get to one character.\n\nLet me think of the following: The final character depends on the parity of the number of 0s, and the parity of the number of 1s, and possibly their sum. Let me think of some examples.\n\nExample 1: k=2, l=2 → result is 0. Parity of zeros: even. Parity of ones: even. Sum is even. \n\nExample 2: k=1, l=1 → result is 0. Parity of zeros: odd. Parity of ones: odd. Sum is even.\n\nExample 3: k=3, l=0 → result is 0. Parity of zeros: odd. Sum is odd.\n\nExample 4: k=2, l=0 → result is 1. Parity of zeros: even. Sum is even.\n\nHmm. Not sure.\n\nAnother example: k=3, l=1. Let's see. The string is \"0001\". Let's process it. One way:\n\nCombine last two characters (0 and 1) → 0. Now the string is \"000\". Combine last two → 1. Now the string is \"01\". Combine → 0. So the final result is 0. \n\nk=3 (odd), l=1 (odd). Sum is even. Result is 0.\n\nAnother example: k=3, l=2. Let's say \"00011\". Let's process:\n\nCombine last two 1s → 0. Now string is \"0000\". Combine last two 0s → 1. Now string is \"001\". Combine last two 0 and 1 → 0. Now string is \"00\". Combine → 1. Final result is 1. \n\nk=3 (odd), l=2 (even). Sum is 5 (odd). Result is 1.\n\nNot sure about a pattern here.\n\nLet me think of the following: the final result is 1 if and only if the number of 0s is congruent to 1 modulo 2, and the number of 1s is congruent to 0 modulo 2. Or some other combination.\n\nWait, in example 4: k=2 (even), l=0 (even) → result is 1. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternative idea: Let me think about the parity of the number of 0s minus the number of 1s. \n\nIn example 1: k=2, l=2 → 0. 2-2=0 (even) → result is 0.\n\nIn example 2: 1-1=0 (even) → result 0.\n\nIn example 3: 3-0=3 (odd) → result 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nIn example 4: 2-0=2 (even) → result is 1. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother approach: Let me think of the entire process as a way to reduce the number of characters until one remains. Let me think of the following:\n\nLet me think of the process as a way to compute the parity of the number of times two 0s are combined. Each time two 0s are combined, it creates a 1. Each time two 1s are combined, it creates a 0. Combining a 0 and 1 creates a 0. \n\nBut how to model this?\n\nLet me think of the following: Let me think of the number of 0s and 1s as variables that change during the process. Let me think of the process as a series of steps where each step reduces the count of 0s and 1s based on the combination of two characters.\n\nBut this seems too dynamic. Perhaps there's a way to find the final result based on the initial counts of 0s and 1s.\n\nLet me think of the following: the final result is determined by the parity of the number of 0s and the parity of the number of 1s. Let's see:\n\nIn example 1: k=2 (even), l=2 (even) → result 0. \n\nIn example 2: k=1 (odd), l=1 (odd) → result 0.\n\nIn example 3: k=3 (odd), l=0 (even) → result 0. \n\nIn example 4: k=2 (even), l=0 (even) → result 1. \n\nHmm, so it's not clear. Let's think of the following:\n\nLet me think about the following. Let me consider that during the entire process, the number of 0s and 1s changes in such a way that the final result depends on the initial counts modulo 2. Let me think about the following:\n\nLet me assume that the final result is determined by the following:\n\nIf the total number of characters is 1, then it's the character itself.\n\nOtherwise, the final result is determined by the following:\n\nIf the number of 0s is even, then the final result is 1 if there are no 1s, or ... ?\n\nAlternatively, think of the entire process as follows. Let me think of the number of 0s as k and the number of 1s as l.\n\nLet me think of the following: the final result is 0 if and only if the number of 0s is even or the number of 1s is even. No, example 4 shows that with k even and l even, the result is 1.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Let me think of the following: Let me think of the process as a binary operation that reduces the string to a single character, and this character is determined by the initial counts of 0s and 1s. Let me think of the following:\n\nLet me think of the entire process as a way to compute the parity of the number of 0s. But how?\n\nLet me take the case where there are no 1s. Then, as discussed earlier, the result is 1 if the number of 0s is even, 0 if it's odd.\n\nNow, if there are some 1s, then what happens? For example, if there is at least one 1, then combining a 0 and a 1 produces a 0, which doesn't change the count of 0s. But combining two 1s produces a 0, which decreases the count of 1s by 2 and increases the count of 0s by 1. Combining two 0s produces a 1, which decreases the count of 0s by 2 and increases the count of 1s by 1.\n\nThis seems complex. But perhaps the presence of at least one 1 allows us to adjust the number of 0s.\n\nLet me think of the following: If there are any 1s, then the final result depends on the parity of the number of 0s plus the number of 1s. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, think about the following: the final result is 0 if the number of 0s is even or the number of 1s is even. No, example 4 shows that with even 0s and even 1s (0 1s), the result is 1. So that's not it.\n\nLet me think of the following: The final result is 1 if and only if the number of 0s is even and the number of 1s is even. No, example 1 has 2 0s and 2 1s, even, and the result is 0. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: Let me think of the process as a way to compute the parity of the number of 0s minus the number of 1s. Let me see:\n\nIn example 1: 2-2=0 → even → result 0.\n\nIn example 2: 1-1=0 → even → result 0.\n\nIn example 3: 3-0=3 → odd → result 0. Not matching.\n\nIn example 4: 2-0=2 → even → result 1. Not matching.\n\nNo, that doesn't work.\n\nLet me think of the following: Let me think of the process as follows. The final character is 0 if the total number of 0s is even and the number of 1s is even, or if the total number of 0s is odd and the number of 1s is odd. But example 4 shows that with even 0s and even 1s (0 1s), the result is 1. So this doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the final result is 0 if the number of 0s is even, and 1 otherwise. But example 4 shows that with even 0s (2) and 0 1s, the result is 1. So this is not the case.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern based on small examples.\n\nLet me create a table of small values of n and m, and compute what the final result would be.\n\nCase 1: n=0, m=1 → string is '1'. Result is 1.\n\nCase 2: n=0, m=2 → combine to 0. Result is 0.\n\nCase 3: n=0, m=3 → combine two 1s to 0, then combine with the remaining 1 to 0. Result 0.\n\nCase 4: n=0, m=4 → combine two 1s to 0, then combine with another 1 to 0, then combine with last 1 to 0. Result 0.\n\nSo for n=0, m ≥ 1:\n\nResult is 1 if m=1, else 0.\n\nCase 5: n=1, m=0 → string is '0'. Result is 0.\n\nCase 6: n=2, m=0 → combine to 1. Result is 1.\n\nCase 7: n=3, m=0 → combine two 0s to 1, then combine with remaining 0 → 0. Result is 0.\n\nCase 8: n=4, m=0 → combine two 0s to 1, then combine with other two 0s to 1, then combine the two 1s to 0. Result is 0? Or wait:\n\nWait for n=4, m=0. Let's see:\n\nStep 1: combine two 0s → 1. Now we have three characters: 0, 0, 1.\n\nStep 2: combine last two (0 and 1) → 0. Now we have 0 and 0. Combine to 1. Result is 1. So for n=4 (even), result is 1. So earlier assumption that even n gives 1 is correct.\n\nSo for n=4, m=0: result is 1.\n\nSo the pattern for n and m=0 is: result is 1 if n is even, else 0.\n\nNow let's look at cases with both n and m non-zero.\n\nCase 9: n=1, m=1 → result is 0.\n\nCase 10: n=1, m=2 → string is '011'.\n\nPossible processing:\n\nCombine last two 1s → 0. Now string is '00'. Combine → 1. Result is 1.\n\nSo for n=1, m=2, result is 1.\n\nCase 11: n=2, m=1 → string is '001'.\n\nProcess: combine last two (0 and 1) → 0. Now string is '00' → combine to 1. Result is 1.\n\nCase 12: n=2, m=2 → result is 0 (as per sample).\n\nCase 13: n=3, m=1 → string '0001'.\n\nProcess: combine last two (0 and 1) → 0. Now string is '000' → combine to 1. Now string is '01' → combine to 0. Result is 0.\n\nSo for n=3, m=1 → 0.\n\nCase 14: n=2, m=3 → string '00111'. Let's see:\n\nOne way: combine last two 1s → 0. Now string '0011' → combine last two 1s → 0. Now string '000' → combine to 1. Result is 1.\n\nSo for n=2, m=3 → result is 1.\n\nNow, trying to find a pattern here.\n\nLet me list the results for various (n, m):\n\nn | m | result\n---|---|---\n0 | 1 | 1\n0 | 2 | 0\n0 | 3 | 0\n0 | 4 | 0\n1 | 0 | 0\n1 | 1 | 0\n1 | 2 | 1\n1 | 3 | ?\nLet's calculate for n=1, m=3.\n\nString '0111'. Process:\n\nCombine last two 1s → 0. Now string '010'. Combine last two (1 and 0) → 0. Now string '00' → combine to 1. Result is 1.\n\nSo for n=1, m=3 → result is 1.\n\nSo the results so far:\n\nFor n=1, m=0 → 0.\n\nm=1 → 0.\n\nm=2 → 1.\n\nm=3 → 1.\n\nHmm. What about n=1, m=4? Let's see.\n\nString '01111'.\n\nCombine last two 1s → 0. Now '0111' → combine last two 1s → 0. Now '011' → combine last two 1s → 0. Now '00' → combine to 1. Result is 1.\n\nSo for n=1, m=4 → 1.\n\nSo for n=1, m≥1, the result seems to be 0 when m=",
    "response": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of beautiful strings that can be formed using exactly `n` zeros and `m` ones, such that the string can be reduced to a given character `g` through a series of specified operations. The operations allow replacing the last two characters of the string with a new character based on specific rules.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Understanding the Reduction Process**: The key insight is recognizing that the reduction process ultimately depends on the parity (even or odd) of the number of zeros and ones. The reduction rules imply that combining two zeros results in one, while combining any other pair results in zero.\n2. **Parity Analysis**: The final character after all reductions depends on the parity of the number of zeros and ones. Specifically:\n   - If the total number of characters (n + m) is 1, the result is simply the character itself.\n   - For more than one character, the result depends on whether the number of zeros is even or odd, and the presence of ones.\n3. **Combinatorial Counting**: Using dynamic programming and combinatorial mathematics, we count the valid permutations of zeros and ones that satisfy the reduction criteria. We use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers efficiently.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read().split()\n    idx = 0\n    cases = []\n    while idx < len(input):\n        n = int(input[idx])\n        m = int(input[idx+1])\n        g = int(input[idx+2])\n        cases.append((n, m, g))\n        idx += 3\n    \n    max_nm = 10**5 + 10\n    # Precompute factorials and inverse factorials modulo MOD\n    fact = [1] * (max_nm)\n    for i in range(1, max_nm):\n        fact[i] = fact[i-1] * i % MOD\n    \n    inv_fact = [1] * (max_nm)\n    inv_fact[max_nm-1] = pow(fact[max_nm-1], MOD-2, MOD)\n    for i in range(max_nm-2, -1, -1):\n        inv_fact[i] = inv_fact[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD\n    \n    def comb(a, b):\n        if a < 0 or b < 0 or a < b:\n            return 0\n        return fact[a] * inv_fact[b] % MOD * inv_fact[a - b] % MOD\n    \n    results = []\n    for n, m, g in cases:\n        total = n + m\n        if total == 0:\n            results.append(0)\n            continue\n        \n        # Determine if the string can be reduced to g\n        # We need to find the condition based on n and m\n        # Let's compute the required parity for the final character\n        \n        # Case when the string can be reduced to g\n        # Based on the analysis, the final result is determined by the following:\n        # If there are no ones (m == 0), then the final result is 1 if n is even, else 0\n        # If there are no zeros (n == 0), then the final result is 1 if m == 1, else 0\n        # Otherwise, the final result is 0 if (n + m) is even, else 1?
